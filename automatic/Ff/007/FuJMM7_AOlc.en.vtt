interesting set going on and it's
basically<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.300> guys<00:01:56.600> are<00:01:57.190> forged<00:01:58.190> from<00:01:58.340> steel

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
basically the guys are forged from steel

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.400 
basically the guys are forged from steel
so<00:01:58.940> we've<00:01:59.060> created<00:01:59.330> this<00:01:59.660> environment<00:01:59.840> which

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
so we've created this environment which

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.050 
so we've created this environment which
looks<00:02:00.680> like<00:02:00.740> a<00:02:00.830> foundry<00:02:01.280> well<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.790> guys<00:02:01.910> are

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
looks like a foundry well the guys are

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.180 
looks like a foundry well the guys are
doing<00:02:02.300> they're<00:02:02.450> just<00:02:02.600> doing<00:02:02.950> some<00:02:03.950> sort<00:02:04.160> of

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
steel shot which I don't really

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.169 
steel shot which I don't really
understand<00:02:06.860> but<00:02:07.070> it<00:02:07.190> looks<00:02:07.370> really<00:02:07.520> good<00:02:07.700> it's

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179

the<00:02:26.370> steel<00:02:26.640> mill<00:02:26.850> I<00:02:27.120> think<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.690> effects<00:02:28.020> look

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
the steel mill I think the effects look

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.810 
the steel mill I think the effects look
great<00:02:28.410> but<00:02:28.710> they'll<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.950> pyrotechnics<00:02:29.610> going

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
great but they'll the pyrotechnics going

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.780 
great but they'll the pyrotechnics going
up<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:31.320> grinder<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:31.980> things<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.460> vishal

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
up and the grinder and things and vishal

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.270 
up and the grinder and things and vishal
added<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.330> hope<00:02:33.930> pollution<00:02:34.710> of<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:34.950> steel

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
added to hope pollution of the steel

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.520 
added to hope pollution of the steel
mill<00:02:35.490> environment<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:36.260> to<00:02:37.260> come<00:02:37.410> together

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
hours I thought I'd be about half an

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.990 
hours I thought I'd be about half an
hour<00:03:28.739> verse<00:03:28.950> two<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.310> half<00:03:29.430> hours<00:03:29.670> we're

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
hour verse two and a half hours we're

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.490 
hour verse two and a half hours we're
just<00:03:30.269> about<00:03:30.390> done<00:03:30.510> we<00:03:30.750> go<00:03:30.840> one<00:03:30.989> more<00:03:31.110> shots<00:03:31.380> you

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
just about done we go one more shots you

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.340 
just about done we go one more shots you
go<00:03:32.430> wait<00:03:32.580> for<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.820> rain<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:33.000> go<00:03:33.269> off<00:03:33.330> so<00:03:33.690> almost

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
go wait for the rain to go off so almost

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.930 
go wait for the rain to go off so almost
the<00:03:34.500> outcome<00:03:34.769> actually<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.280> doing<00:03:35.580> it<00:03:35.700> after

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
for the players I would think because

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.470 
for the players I would think because
