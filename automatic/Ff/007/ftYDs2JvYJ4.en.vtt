00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
seven hours in the maps so far and i

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.230 
seven hours in the maps so far and i
think<00:01:25.950> that's<00:01:26.220> enough<00:01:26.580> time<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.060> write

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240

think that's enough time to write
overview<00:01:27.659> if<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.869> think<00:01:28.080> about<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.290> that's<00:01:28.500> an

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
overview if you think about it that's an

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.429 
overview if you think about it that's an
hour<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> half<00:01:29.790> plan<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:30.299> each<00:01:30.509> map<00:01:30.840> i<00:01:31.049> think

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
hour and a half plan on each map i think

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.160 
hour and a half plan on each map i think
that<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:32.240> what<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.780> comes<00:01:34.020> out

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
that that is what is that that comes out

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.679

in-your-face kind of map you actually
have<00:03:15.550> to<00:03:15.640> think<00:03:15.850> about<00:03:15.940> what<00:03:16.210> are<00:03:16.240> you<00:03:16.330> gonna

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
have to think about what are you gonna

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.270 
have to think about what are you gonna
do<00:03:16.660> because<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:17.170> will<00:03:17.380> be<00:03:17.530> left<00:03:17.740> in<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.010> open

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
do because you will be left in the open

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.820 
do because you will be left in the open
a<00:03:18.400> lot<00:03:18.640> on<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.910> map<00:03:19.090> but<00:03:19.780> you<00:03:20.350> do<00:03:20.500> get<00:03:20.650> the

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
a lot on the map but you do get the

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.190 
a lot on the map but you do get the
benefit<00:03:21.280> of<00:03:21.310> having<00:03:21.520> those<00:03:21.880> uh<00:03:21.940> clown<00:03:22.840> bombs

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
benefit of having those uh clown bombs

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.900 
benefit of having those uh clown bombs
that<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:23.560> can<00:03:23.709> throw<00:03:23.890> those<00:03:24.370> things<00:03:24.430> are

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
that you can throw those things are

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.000 
that you can throw those things are
explosive<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.660> so<00:03:26.110> overall<00:03:26.530> I'm<00:03:26.709> gonna<00:03:26.830> say

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
explosive and so overall I'm gonna say

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.630 
explosive and so overall I'm gonna say
that<00:03:27.160> that<00:03:27.310> is<00:03:27.340> also<00:03:27.760> a<00:03:28.240> good<00:03:28.930> map<00:03:29.140> okay<00:03:30.040> better

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
that that is also a good map okay better

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.430 
that that is also a good map okay better
than<00:03:30.880> urban<00:03:31.120> I<00:03:31.390> think<00:03:31.660> I<00:03:31.870> think<00:03:32.170> it's<00:03:32.290> better

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
than urban I think I think it's better

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.470 
than urban I think I think it's better
than<00:03:32.560> urban<00:03:32.770> next<00:03:33.640> map<00:03:33.790> that<00:03:33.970> we're<00:03:34.120> gonna<00:03:34.240> go

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
than urban next map that we're gonna go

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.449 
than urban next map that we're gonna go
over<00:03:34.510> is<00:03:34.840> gonna<00:03:35.140> be<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.590> core<00:03:35.920> map<00:03:36.100> now<00:03:36.280> that

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
over is gonna be the core map now that

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.280 
over is gonna be the core map now that
is<00:03:36.580> one<00:03:36.790> of<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:36.910> biggest<00:03:37.209> maps<00:03:37.570> if<00:03:37.780> not<00:03:38.050> the

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
is one of the biggest maps if not the

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.500 
is one of the biggest maps if not the
biggest<00:03:38.470> in<00:03:38.830> advanced<00:03:39.220> warfare<00:03:39.640> it's<00:03:39.880> kind<00:03:40.360> of

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
biggest in advanced warfare it's kind of

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.770 
biggest in advanced warfare it's kind of
bland<00:03:40.780> a<00:03:41.080> little<00:03:41.380> bit<00:03:41.500> dull<00:03:41.740> um<00:03:42.010> it<00:03:42.580> can<00:03:42.910> get<00:03:43.540> a

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
bland a little bit dull um it can get a

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.420 
bland a little bit dull um it can get a
little<00:03:44.140> bit<00:03:44.380> boring<00:03:44.740> if<00:03:44.890> you<00:03:44.950> don't<00:03:45.160> find<00:03:45.340> the

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
little bit boring if you don't find the

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.580 
little bit boring if you don't find the
enemy<00:03:45.610> because<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.750> map<00:03:46.930> is<00:03:47.110> so<00:03:47.350> big<00:03:47.560> and

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
enemy because the map is so big and

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.530 
enemy because the map is so big and
inside<00:03:48.040> in<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.250> fact<00:03:48.430> that<00:03:48.490> it's<00:03:48.730> big<00:03:49.090> it's

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
inside in the fact that it's big it's

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.690 
inside in the fact that it's big it's
the<00:03:49.720> fact<00:03:49.930> that<00:03:50.050> it's<00:03:50.290> very<00:03:50.620> split<00:03:51.280> up<00:03:51.459> and

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
the fact that it's very split up and

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.760 
the fact that it's very split up and
because<00:03:52.540> it's<00:03:52.690> so<00:03:52.870> split<00:03:53.140> up<00:03:53.290> sometimes<00:03:53.620> you

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
because it's so split up sometimes you

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.350 
because it's so split up sometimes you
will<00:03:53.950> have<00:03:54.100> trouble<00:03:54.459> finding<00:03:54.820> your<00:03:55.060> enemies

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
will have trouble finding your enemies

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.300 
will have trouble finding your enemies
and<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.990> matches<00:03:56.350> will<00:03:56.530> last<00:03:56.800> quite<00:03:57.130> a<00:03:57.190> while

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
and the matches will last quite a while

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.870 
and the matches will last quite a while
um<00:03:58.320> probably<00:03:59.320> that's<00:04:00.070> probably<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.700> worst

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
um probably that's probably the worst

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.350 
um probably that's probably the worst
map<00:04:01.090> in<00:04:01.300> the<00:04:01.510> map<00:04:02.050> pack<00:04:02.350> and<00:04:02.850> it<00:04:03.850> seems<00:04:04.150> to<00:04:04.270> be

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
map in the map pack and it seems to be

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.790 
map in the map pack and it seems to be
the<00:04:04.450> one<00:04:04.600> that<00:04:04.630> people<00:04:04.840> vote<00:04:05.110> for<00:04:05.140> the<00:04:05.560> least

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
the one that people vote for the least

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.580 
the one that people vote for the least
as<00:04:06.040> far<00:04:06.490> as<00:04:06.640> drift<00:04:07.030> is<00:04:07.180> concerned<00:04:07.600> drift<00:04:08.320> is<00:04:08.440> my

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
as far as drift is concerned drift is my

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.290 
as far as drift is concerned drift is my
favorite<00:04:08.980> map<00:04:09.130> it<00:04:09.310> looks<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.670> best<00:04:09.850> it<00:04:10.060> plays

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
favorite map it looks the best it plays

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.449 
favorite map it looks the best it plays
the<00:04:10.510> best<00:04:10.660> in<00:04:10.900> my<00:04:11.020> opinion<00:04:11.050> it's<00:04:11.650> big<00:04:12.190> but<00:04:12.340> it

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
the best in my opinion it's big but it

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.580 
the best in my opinion it's big but it
plays<00:04:12.700> fast<00:04:13.000> paced<00:04:13.300> and<00:04:13.540> that's<00:04:14.080> the<00:04:14.230> best<00:04:14.440> way

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
plays fast paced and that's the best way

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.050 
plays fast paced and that's the best way
to<00:04:14.650> do<00:04:14.830> it<00:04:14.950> so<00:04:15.100> if<00:04:15.190> I<00:04:15.310> had<00:04:15.430> to<00:04:15.520> rate<00:04:15.730> the<00:04:15.880> maps

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
to do it so if I had to rate the maps

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.560 
to do it so if I had to rate the maps
I'd<00:04:16.299> say<00:04:16.450> it<00:04:16.570> goes<00:04:17.700> as<00:04:18.700> far<00:04:18.940> as<00:04:19.030> fun<00:04:19.209> factor<00:04:19.510> is

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
I'd say it goes as far as fun factor is

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.740 
I'd say it goes as far as fun factor is
concerned<00:04:19.930> drift<00:04:20.380> urban<00:04:21.130> sideshow<00:04:21.970> then<00:04:22.330> core

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
concerned drift urban sideshow then core

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.200 
concerned drift urban sideshow then core
and<00:04:22.990> that's<00:04:23.800> my<00:04:23.979> opinion<00:04:24.250> on<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:24.760> maps<00:04:25.030> I

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
and that's my opinion on the maps I

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.470 
and that's my opinion on the maps I
would

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
would

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.580 
would
definitely<00:04:25.750> get<00:04:25.840> them<00:04:25.990> if<00:04:26.140> you're<00:04:26.290> a<00:04:26.320> fan<00:04:26.560> of

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
definitely get them if you're a fan of

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.350 
definitely get them if you're a fan of
advanced<00:04:26.980> warfare<00:04:27.400> and<00:04:27.610> as<00:04:28.000> far<00:04:28.150> as<00:04:28.270> the

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
advanced warfare and as far as the

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.870 
advanced warfare and as far as the
zombies<00:04:28.810> is<00:04:28.960> concerned<00:04:29.350> it<00:04:29.650> it<00:04:30.160> has<00:04:30.430> a<00:04:30.460> it
