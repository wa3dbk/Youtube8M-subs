00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello to all so today we get 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.359
 found for my face care routine from 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.770
 moment, so you have to know before any 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.139
 thing that I present the products etc 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.870
 be aware that I have mixed skin 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.400
 dehydrated tendency and which tends to 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.830
 to make buttons quite easily 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.210
 so that's what it says for all 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.670
 people who have a too dry or or 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.430
 other this is this routine risk of not 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.730
 not really fit you this is it 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.070
 said so I start him with the morning 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.929
 so in the morning I use it is the foam 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.070
 unctuous cleanser at nivea 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.520
 you see that I have them almost 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.050
 finished so that's a care routine 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.280
 face I use since a good little 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.350
 moment that all products I you 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.820
 actually showed they're pretty much at the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.450
 end so I become the time to them 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.300
 use 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.280
 so the foam leveled that is frankly 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.440
 not bad at first I had a little trouble 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.989
 to use it because I found that 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.250
 it did not clean deep enough and 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.140
 ultimately over uses 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.079
 well here I found that my skin was 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.730
 still pretty much clean in the end 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.730
 without being caps is so not so 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.480
 the foam is a foam it's not 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.729
 like a shaving foam 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.740
 it's not at all as compact as 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.790
 shaving foam its very very foams 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.920
 aerial so that's pretty fast on the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.090
 face it's not very long but 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.770
 it cleans what is needed so I have 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.869
 that for combination to oily skin 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.850
 that's it not non normal to mixed here 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.259
 and I find it really not bad at all 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.880
 so I clean my face with that the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.189
 morning once I cleaned up my 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.229
 face I'm not going to dry it with a 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.240
 towel I leave Sunnis like that and 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.250
 I'm not directly malo so 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.299
 I take the ribs have sealed cotton 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.850
 I've changed now I'm taking 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.700
 big guys like that so that's 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.409
 those at carrefour duos and maxi 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.549
 and I think it's really better 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.799
 for the face 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.570
 finally I prefer at this moment and so I 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.080
 pass directly my lotion still on 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.880
 wet face and that's it I 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.030
 I pass my motion where I took this one 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.590
 is listening to your kind of ba 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.390
 yannick noah is what does that I do not 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.220
 know shorter is a water of care 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.830
 toning by fresh and invigorating complexion 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.530
 immediate hydration with floral 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.390
 organic peppermint peeling so 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.850
 I found that at stokomani I know 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.500
 not everything he says I do not know it's beautiful 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.420
 the face for the body I do not know of 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.500
 everything - suicide for the veiled face that 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.000
 I still finished well for 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.010
 a notion here go very cool not 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.710
 all sensations of sticky pantyhose 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.360
 on the skin it smells good 33 1 100 super 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.160
 I like them very much this 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.020
 lotion I arrive on the end and what 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.850
 I really appreciate a lot on this 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.470
 lotion is the fact that huawei a spray 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.900
 so I put directly on mont cotton 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.430
 you do not waste product you put 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.890
 the exact dose me I know that the c4 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.740
 pressure and it's not over anymore by 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.240
 month is good it's moisturizing I do not know 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.070
 not but in any case for me she is 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.170
 really good so I recommend it to you 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.940
 if you find it it's frankly in 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.190
 plus his 1,300 activists but for a 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.560
 moment and she's fine so I spend my 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.030
 lotions and then the same I do not wait 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.489
 not that my skin is dry 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.870
 here they are drying fast do not wait 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.750
 not too dry dock until squeeze the 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.489
 skin in celebration is going on how does the other 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.459
 your skin will evaporate it's the body 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.170
 hydrates so it's still quick 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.550
 and then I spend the morning 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.590
 now I changed before using 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.870
 the effaclar duo more but I find 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.280
 that she comes quickly to the end so 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.420
 I do not use any more than the evening I 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.820
 showed in the morning I use mat eraslar 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.890
 So here it is to moisturize 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.130
 and at the same time that an action is to 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.590
 regulators a cvo regulatory action 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.410
 rather it would be better anti brilliance 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.570
 handisport dilate so honestly I 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.450
 not seen a big difference did two 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.250
 weeks this if I use about two 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.070
 weeks I have not seen a big big 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.799
 difference on the fact that here is there 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.480
 had a lower gloss 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.130
 it's the edges dilate I have not seen but 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.380
 next to that it's a good base of 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.390
 makeup she does not make a button 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.680
 it's super important I prefer 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.530
 skin that shines but no pimples 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.760
 and for dilated pores so 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.380
 I did not see a big difference by 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.780
 against the only difference I find that 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.180
 it's a bit the same texture as the 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.459
 epate their duo more but the only 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.750
 difference I find these picotte channels 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.400
 the fake when I apply them in the morning 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.560
 so I do not know it's an action a 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.260
 domestic product which it is 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.609
 I do not know at all but that's it for 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.410
 me it suits me rather well to 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.080
 predict for the hot weather what 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.669
 it will give if it is not too much if 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.710
 it's not too thick but for the 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.700
 moment is ok 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.020
 so that's what I know and then 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.000
 judged lic skirt 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.380
 I apply my eye contour so 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.370
 it's always the same 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.510
 it's the jan urria that I love 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.330
 always and sailboats that starts to 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.340
 So thin I like this around 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.740
 really moisturizing eyes there is the 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.480
 base of urea and hyaluronic acid this 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.390
 which makes it really hyper 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.490
 moisturizer and I do not judge under 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.020
 makeup also a hyper point 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:59.750
 important and gold there I find very well 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.790
 then we go low in the evening 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:06.050
 So at night I have my makeup is 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:07.490
 had seen him eat so I saw a 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.990
 video of Helen it is this morning 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.400
 that they said they had trouble in 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.990
 finish this product there and me yet 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.280
 I love them this flagship product said 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.590
 that he was good but that there 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.560
 laces this is the dr mo detox creams 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.890
 foams at diadermine so this is a 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.600
 cleansing foam here I learned 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.890
 that on the wet face I do 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.780
 like an oil makes it a bit like a 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.419
 principle of an oil you said that 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.680
 my oil l'oreal I thought she 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.870
 pose and buttons so I'm not 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.210
 sure for the moment I would use the street 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.310
 we'll tell you but now I've been 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.250
 blow to something of -8 2 so a 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.150
 cream and that I think it's great 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.650
 samus not because they say that this 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.919
 creams foam I think it 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.470
 foam 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:48.020
 here you do you do trades well 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:51.770
 like an oil and then you go 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.850
 pass water put water and you 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.229
 will rub a little bit more 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.750
 emulsify a little more water 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:59.090
 on the other hand that maquis all but by 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.160
 against the rendering me I can not have that 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.419
 I cleanse your skin afterwards with a 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.190
 cleanser because I can not I have 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:05.270
 the impression of having you know them 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.360
 made soap of Marseille 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.400
 it's pretty stripping the skin when you 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.900
 pass it slips finer I do not like 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.280
 all the feeling that it makes messadi 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.590
 maquis very well but after two ways 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.190
 I spend a cleanser so it puts me 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.270
 no problem 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:21.229
 we see there for that then I go back to 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.210
 the same routine 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:29.300
 that's just when this amount nivea 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:31.130
 malo sion that's fine and life 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.800
 akelarre duo more on the other hand because 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.900
 there I treat rather so they say that 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.789
 it is an anti imperfections care 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:40.460
 correcting anti- markers anti mark and 

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:42.470
 should allow the night since the 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.840
 side matt I do not really need it 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.010
 evening and I love these two creams 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.330
 frankly the road 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.700
 the rock posay really save my skin 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.080
 in regard to buttons that me 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.030
 really a lot a lot helped and so 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.470
 in me it is a mark towards which I 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.849
 will i think i will continue with 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.599
 this brand because I like a lot 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:01.280
 so with hard art more fac and my 

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:03.830
 eye contour as usual 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.590
 that's it and that's all I do after 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.960
 concerning scrubs and masks 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.340
 I finally have a scrub 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.200
 introduce yourself it's the sweet clean in 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.180
 exfoliating express with orange head all 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.860
 Skin type from Clarins 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.659
 so that's something I've had since 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.430
 a good little moment now since 

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:21.890
 a scrub you make me I do 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.729
 once twice as big maximum in the 

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.340
 week no more 

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:26.220
 and here I am really very well 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.450
 scrub 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.980
 I know there are people who use 

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.690
 as a cleaner I know too much 

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.760
 too aggressive in cleaning there are 

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:34.350
 grains anyway it's degrading that 

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.150
 be gentle enough for a scrub but 

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.980
 for a cleaner that's too much I find 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.540
 that it's too much and frankly it's 

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:42.720
 very pleasant leaves a very soft skin 

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:45.230
 very clear and after I spend masks 

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.850
 anyway here I have not one 

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:50.760
 special to introduce yourself so that's for 

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:54.180
 my faceless routine for skins 

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.590
 Mixed to fat dehydrated tendency he 

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.910
 important part of missing your skin even 

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.470
 if you have skin crash I think 

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.310
 I'll talk about it in a video but 

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.590
 it's very important 

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:03.570
 and that's all I had to say about 

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.310
 my face care routine 

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:09.060
 I do you kisses do not hesitate to 

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:10.650
 tell me your favorite products for my 

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.390
 skin type or favorite products 

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.160
 also for other types of skin 

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.490
 so I do kisses and I say to very 

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.000
