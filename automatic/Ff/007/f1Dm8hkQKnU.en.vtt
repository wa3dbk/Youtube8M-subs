00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.580
 how about god of jaime now we are 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.590
 from chicago the mccormick place the day 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.790
 1 from chicago auto south and we have a 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.390
 toyota let's see what is going to 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.309
 present 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.980
 toyota has just presented to the tundra 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.790
 2014 completely redesigned we see the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.010
 front as they have changed 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.960
 completely a front have gone up a 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.600
 little and the design is completely more 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.129
 aggressive 5 versions of this grill 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.750
 can differentiate us from all 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.030
 versions of the tomb from the back have been 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.500
 done an extraordinary job the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.860
 Subsequent bumpers have divided it into 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.410
 three parts 1 2 and 3 the reason for that is 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.270
 that knows economy for the owner 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.350
 When you have an accident, you do not have 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.390
 to replace all the pieces 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.369
 simply one for the other of the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.869
 major changes in what this has changed 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.670
 this is the connector to perform the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.410
 driver instead of putting it down as 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.240
 it was before where it turned around made a 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.490
 achieved what they have moved here to 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.410
 avoid accidents and to make it more 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.240
 easy to operate have added for this 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.759
 year the rear view camera for all your 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.320
 versions we also find this a 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.479
 spoiler integrated to the floodgate 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.479
 back for better aerodynamics of the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.280
 vehicle this is the thousand 794 decision 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.030
 this ranchera edition are trying 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.799
 to give 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.510
 a more American personality is 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.130
 trying to conquer the heart of the 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.590
 Americans but now let's see the 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.659
 common version is in model b 8 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.280
 we see again a different grill 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.020
 which we had seen before we see 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.580
 they have also included a lot of chrome are 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.770
 trying to get more attention by 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.200
 outside we also see that the headlights 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.820
 strikers have been better elaborated a 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.860
 little more complex also giving it a 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.600
 more muscular environment the interior 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.009
 it was also completely redesigned and 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.170
 the funny thing is that the engineer that 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.180
 participated in this is a rancher 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.890
 then the personality of the adjustment that 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.259
 they have done is to make a car more 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.149
 functional a work vehicle how 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.190
 it has to be a pickup and one of the 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.380
 major changes is that they moved almost 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.239
 three inches the center console more 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.160
 close to the pilot to give him a 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.590
 much more practical functionality for the 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.019
 pilot for the tunda 2014 has kept 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.019
 the same engines the 5.7 engine follows 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.300
 being the most powerful and can load 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.519
 up to 2000 pounds here in the camera and 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.250
 can drag up to 10,000 pounds with 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.830
 this engine also found a package 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.660
 of the 4x4 tr other to improve for 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.060
 maximize your ability off the route 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.250
 already had the tundra of 2014 we have 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.930
 seen that it has improved a lot in this 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.700
 segment that is super competitive rne 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.680
 had got the title of the 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.260
 truck of the year last year now 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.130
 this one has many possibilities to be able 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.130
 take that title
