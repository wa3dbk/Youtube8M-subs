time all of the testers had disappeared

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.700 
time all of the testers had disappeared
so<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.939> didn't<00:00:21.210> know<00:00:21.300> which<00:00:21.480> one<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.810> try<00:00:22.080> but<00:00:22.680> I

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710

can<00:01:30.240> see<00:01:30.299> it's<00:01:30.570> not<00:01:30.720> running<00:01:31.020> at<00:01:31.409> all

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.520 

so<00:01:35.340> I've<00:01:35.700> used<00:01:35.880> about<00:01:36.030> just<00:01:36.689> under<00:01:36.899> two<00:01:37.079> pumps

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
so I've used about just under two pumps

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.440 
so I've used about just under two pumps
on<00:01:37.710> my<00:01:38.250> entire<00:01:38.549> face<00:01:38.909> just<00:01:39.179> to<00:01:39.270> cover

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
on my entire face just to cover

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.359 
on my entire face just to cover
everything<00:01:39.719> and<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.619> first<00:01:40.859> side<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.100> my<00:01:41.219> face

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
everything and the first side of my face

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.160 
everything and the first side of my face
I'm<00:01:41.609> going<00:01:41.789> to<00:01:41.880> be<00:01:42.000> doing<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.600> with<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.020> brush

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
I'm going to be doing is with the brush

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.029 
I'm going to be doing is with the brush
which<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.799> side<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.069> my<00:01:44.159> face

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.130 

so<00:01:50.039> this<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.610> first<00:01:50.909> half<00:01:51.299> blending<00:01:51.810> with

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
so this the first half blending with

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.889 
so this the first half blending with
this<00:01:52.439> brush<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.429> looking<00:01:54.329> close<00:01:54.539> up<00:01:54.719> in<00:01:54.840> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
this brush and looking close up in the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.569 
this brush and looking close up in the
mirror<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.229> don't<00:01:55.439> say<00:01:55.679> it<00:01:55.829> does<00:01:56.039> look<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.549> bit

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
mirror I don't say it does look a bit

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.029 
mirror I don't say it does look a bit
better<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:57.359> as<00:01:57.509> obviously<00:01:57.959> I<00:01:58.049> have<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.649> huge

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
better but as obviously I have a huge

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.130 
better but as obviously I have a huge
spot<00:01:59.520> here<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.880> it's<00:02:00.000> not<00:02:00.179> covered<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.630> as

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
spot here and it's not covered it as

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.849 
spot here and it's not covered it as
well<00:02:01.469> why<00:02:02.039> a<00:02:02.630> light<00:02:03.630> coverage<00:02:04.319> but<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.590> mean<00:02:04.770> it

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:04.859 
well why a light coverage but I mean it

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:07.370 
well why a light coverage but I mean it
does<00:02:05.009> seem<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.489> actually<00:02:05.939> make<00:02:06.149> my<00:02:06.390> skin<00:02:06.659> look

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
does seem to actually make my skin look

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.350 
does seem to actually make my skin look
better<00:02:08.130> but<00:02:08.579> it<00:02:08.789> makes<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.209> look<00:02:09.329> really

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
better but it makes you look really

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.449 
better but it makes you look really
natural<00:02:09.720> if<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.110> makes<00:02:10.289> sense<00:02:13.099> but<00:02:14.099> this<00:02:14.250> is

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
natural if that makes sense but this is

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.000 
natural if that makes sense but this is
both<00:02:14.819> parts<00:02:15.569> of<00:02:15.750> my<00:02:15.959> face<00:02:16.410> with<00:02:16.799> the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
both parts of my face with the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.410 
both parts of my face with the
foundation<00:02:17.579> arts<00:02:17.760> as<00:02:17.879> you<00:02:17.940> can<00:02:18.090> see<00:02:18.239> that's

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
foundation arts as you can see that's

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.839 
foundation arts as you can see that's
clearly<00:02:18.870> not<00:02:18.959> covered<00:02:19.349> but<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:19.980> stopped<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.670> say

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
clearly not covered but I stopped to say

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.569 
clearly not covered but I stopped to say
it<00:02:21.150> does<00:02:21.329> look<00:02:21.510> quite<00:02:21.690> similar<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.590> me<00:02:22.709> on<00:02:23.010> both

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
it does look quite similar to me on both

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.509 
it does look quite similar to me on both
halves<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.360> my<00:02:24.420> face<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.530> my<00:02:25.860> skin<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.370> does

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
halves of my face and my skin that does

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.160 
halves of my face and my skin that does
actually<00:02:26.670> look<00:02:26.879> a<00:02:27.150> lot<00:02:27.360> better<00:02:27.569> at<00:02:27.840> if<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.019> can

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
actually look a lot better at if you can

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.970 
actually look a lot better at if you can
tell<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:29.430> looks<00:02:29.730> really<00:02:30.120> natural<00:02:30.840> like<00:02:31.530> it

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
tell but it looks really natural like it

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.020 
tell but it looks really natural like it
doesn't<00:02:32.250> really<00:02:32.370> look<00:02:32.579> like<00:02:32.640> I've<00:02:32.849> got<00:02:32.879> a

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
doesn't really look like I've got a

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.460 
doesn't really look like I've got a
foundation<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:33.720> wish<00:02:33.870> my<00:02:34.049> skin<00:02:34.110> actually

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.370 

this<00:02:46.520> is<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.700> foundation<00:02:47.270> with<00:02:47.450> two<00:02:47.900> layers

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
the lighting has definitely changed as

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.270 
the lighting has definitely changed as
well<00:03:20.330> because<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:21.320> Sun<00:03:21.560> has<00:03:21.680> decided<00:03:21.950> to<00:03:22.130> come

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.170 
off my nose well my review for this
foundation<00:05:50.560> I'm<00:05:51.340> not<00:05:51.460> sure<00:05:51.639> why<00:05:51.760> I<00:05:51.790> give<00:05:52.060> it

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
foundation I'm not sure why I give it

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.470 
foundation I'm not sure why I give it
out<00:05:52.300> of<00:05:52.330> 10<00:05:52.450> I'd<00:05:52.960> probably<00:05:53.200> say<00:05:53.590> maybe<00:05:54.250> a<00:05:54.700> six

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
out of 10 I'd probably say maybe a six

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.570 
out of 10 I'd probably say maybe a six
or<00:05:55.660> a<00:05:55.750> seven<00:05:55.780> out<00:05:56.320> of<00:05:56.350> ten<00:05:56.470> I<00:05:56.860> don't<00:05:57.160> think<00:05:57.430> it's

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
or a seven out of ten I don't think it's

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.190 
or a seven out of ten I don't think it's
good<00:05:57.760> for<00:05:57.790> oily<00:05:58.150> skin<00:05:58.180> unless<00:05:58.540> you<00:05:58.690> do<00:05:58.930> want<00:05:59.169> to

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
good for oily skin unless you do want to

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.800 
good for oily skin unless you do want to
top<00:05:59.440> up<00:05:59.650> a<00:05:59.830> lot<00:06:00.310> on<00:06:00.490> top<00:06:00.760> of<00:06:00.910> your<00:06:01.060> powder<00:06:01.300> but

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
top up a lot on top of your powder but

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.260 
top up a lot on top of your powder but
mostly<00:06:02.710> it<00:06:02.980> has<00:06:03.190> stayed<00:06:03.520> and<00:06:03.790> the<00:06:03.880> bits<00:06:04.060> that

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
mostly it has stayed and the bits that

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.030 
mostly it has stayed and the bits that
do<00:06:04.419> stay<00:06:04.690> and<00:06:04.840> don't<00:06:05.020> get<00:06:05.169> very<00:06:05.440> oily<00:06:05.620> on<00:06:05.890> my

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
do stay and don't get very oily on my

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.190 
do stay and don't get very oily on my
skin<00:06:06.370> like<00:06:06.550> my<00:06:06.850> cheeks<00:06:07.120> for<00:06:07.330> example<00:06:07.720> they<00:06:08.140> do

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
skin like my cheeks for example they do

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.110 
skin like my cheeks for example they do
still<00:06:08.680> feel<00:06:08.860> very<00:06:08.890> powdery<00:06:09.400> so<00:06:09.760> that's<00:06:09.940> why<00:06:10.060> I

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
still feel very powdery so that's why I

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.030 
still feel very powdery so that's why I
think<00:06:10.240> it<00:06:10.480> will<00:06:10.570> work<00:06:10.720> really<00:06:10.750> well<00:06:11.200> on<00:06:11.470> normal

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.040 
think it will work really well on normal

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.950 
think it will work really well on normal
skin<00:06:12.250> after<00:06:12.700> the<00:06:12.760> foundation<00:06:13.450> is<00:06:13.600> actually

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
skin after the foundation is actually

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.840 
skin after the foundation is actually
pretty<00:06:14.200> good<00:06:14.470> and<00:06:14.710> for<00:06:14.860> the<00:06:14.950> price<00:06:15.250> as<00:06:15.550> well<00:06:15.790> I

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850 
pretty good and for the price as well I

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.270 
pretty good and for the price as well I
think<00:06:16.240> it<00:06:16.419> was<00:06:16.540> about<00:06:16.780> nine<00:06:17.410> pounds<00:06:17.950> which<00:06:18.100> in

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
think it was about nine pounds which in

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.550 
think it was about nine pounds which in
my<00:06:18.430> opinion<00:06:18.550> is<00:06:19.030> not<00:06:19.330> that<00:06:19.480> expensive<00:06:19.720> for<00:06:20.320> a

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
my opinion is not that expensive for a

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.130 
my opinion is not that expensive for a
kind<00:06:21.220> of<00:06:21.310> drugstore<00:06:21.820> foundation<00:06:22.600> obviously

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:23.140

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
got the SPF the application is really

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.540 
got the SPF the application is really

opinions change at all it just in my

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.840 
opinions change at all it just in my
opinion<00:06:40.000> I<00:06:40.440> probably<00:06:41.440> wouldn't<00:06:41.979> wear<00:06:42.220> this<00:06:42.430> on

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:42.850 
opinion I probably wouldn't wear this on

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.570 
opinion I probably wouldn't wear this on
a<00:06:42.910> day-to-day<00:06:43.450> basis<00:06:44.200> because<00:06:44.430> sometimes<00:06:45.430> I

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
a day-to-day basis because sometimes I

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.890 
a day-to-day basis because sometimes I
don't<00:06:45.640> want<00:06:45.910> to<00:06:46.030> like<00:06:46.180> to<00:06:46.390> think<00:06:46.630> about

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:46.900 
don't want to like to think about

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.810 
don't want to like to think about
topping<00:06:47.320> up<00:06:47.470> my<00:06:47.620> powder<00:06:47.950> as<00:06:48.190> much<00:06:48.430> and<00:06:48.640> this

you<00:06:49.030> will<00:06:49.150> have<00:06:49.270> to<00:06:49.390> think<00:06:49.570> about<00:06:49.690> topping<00:06:50.140> up

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:50.350 
you will have to think about topping up

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.890
