00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.719
 look carefully guys all beaver 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.400
 dear friends with you windows and today we 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.500
 let 's talk about one very interesting thing 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.869
 which was seen in fnaf 3 i think 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.210
 many of you remember such animatronics 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.599
 like Sparky much for Lena's noise and video on 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.349
 where you can see the fitcha 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.630
 animatronic sparks 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.279
 he was so called he is a dog 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.770
 who just stands near the door 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.260
 opens it and straining in through 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.329
 the camera is looking straight into the soul 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.460
 however, almost immediately it was announced that 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.020
 This animatronic nothing more than a joke 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.210
 there is not really in the first and in 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.520
 the second part of it was not visible scott 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.450
 I liked this idea so much 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.430
 decided to add 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.800
 and mobs on of 3 and now I'll tell you 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.079
 why I think so of course write your 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.620
 comments and what do you think about this 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.449
 theories 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.190
 Here is the same picture from the poster 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.739
 however slightly processed which 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.629
 removed the prospect of course I understand that 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.670
 the quality is poor but it is 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.740
 so far the most we can achieve 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.900
 let's immediately talk about what is clearly 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.729
 it can be seen in his first ears that 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.049
 look great like a bath 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.000
 but unlike slaughter they 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.920
 arranged in different directions also 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.229
 clearly visible oblong maw on 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.090
 the end of which is located black nose i would 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.799
 happy you its volume well I tried 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.180
 do this photoshop I got out 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.860
 some kind of incomprehensible blot 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.140
 Well, at least here you can see that she seems to be 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.790
 somewhere running and her than it seems and 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.200
 there are people but let's better give it back 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.119
 it was now when we once again 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.460
 were convinced that I would kill the draftsman I 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.710
 I hope that you can understand what I mean 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.409
 I say to anyone who comes again 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.020
 Here I am right brought on the fact that I think the mouth 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.939
 here they are better than this incomprehensible hat 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.100
 and on the left is visible on I hope after that 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.450
 you see the picture as well as I am different 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.970
 the version of the picture that was proposed 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.340
 one of youtube here these guys could 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.470
 circle it draw something like 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.270
 I think there will be no dog here 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.250
 argue that this is a dog by the way he has 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.530
 nostrils which there is none for no 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.149
 motronic of which is interesting and I would say 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.080
 This is the thing to the right of 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.370
 him this 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.110
 if you maybe he is sad about 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.210
 lost tail because it looks like 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.460
 sad actually possible this and not 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.960
 real animatronic which will be in 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.910
 the game may have decided to leave 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.400
 just a little easter because 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.440
 about it its time said a lot 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.540
 people and even many still argue 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.500
 as I video in my comments so 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.940
 that scott looked at all this i will leave 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.460
 paskhalochku these guys let yourself another 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.520
 argue a little about whether there is a dog 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.260
 in the game or idiot nonsense and it wasn't well 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.820
 that's probably all for today dear 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.850
 friends I hope you liked to write 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.660
 comments what you think about it and 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.660
 good luck to all
