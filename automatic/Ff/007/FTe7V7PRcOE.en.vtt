Magnussen is car carrier mode um pretty
cool<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.570> think<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.800> mean<00:00:29.789> it's<00:00:29.970> kind<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.240> just

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
cool I think I mean it's kind of just

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.380 
cool I think I mean it's kind of just
the<00:00:30.689> right<00:00:31.650> there<00:00:31.890> but<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.489> still<00:00:32.910> kind<00:00:33.270> of

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
the right there but it still kind of

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.060 
the right there but it still kind of
looks<00:00:33.620> reminiscent<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.770> his<00:00:35.070> original

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
looks reminiscent of his original

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.900 
looks reminiscent of his original
counterpart<00:00:38.070> it's<00:00:38.250> got<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.520> two<00:00:38.670> little

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
counterpart it's got the two little

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.459 
counterpart it's got the two little
cannons<00:00:39.390> here<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.960> for<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.710> boxy<00:00:41.610> shape<00:00:42.469> and

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
cannons here and for that boxy shape and

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.029 
cannons here and for that boxy shape and
if<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.520> bring<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:45.030> ludicrous<00:00:45.930> improvised<00:00:46.469> Lego

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
if you bring a ludicrous improvised Lego

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.860 
if you bring a ludicrous improvised Lego
color<00:00:47.370> into<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> picture<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:49.910> mean<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.719> can

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
color into the picture I mean you can

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.939 
color into the picture I mean you can
move<00:00:52.020> one<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.500> top<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.960> one<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:56.000> bottom<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.949> it

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
move one on top and one on bottom so it

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.210 
move one on top and one on bottom so it
doesn't<00:00:59.640> look<00:00:59.850> too<00:01:01.969> incredible<00:01:03.739> now<00:01:04.739> you'll

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
doesn't look too incredible now you'll

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.560 
doesn't look too incredible now you'll
notice<00:01:05.460> here's<00:01:05.970> different<00:01:06.210> wheels<00:01:07.159> than

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
notice here's different wheels than

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.649 
notice here's different wheels than
bumblebee<00:01:09.570> or<00:01:09.600> Optimus<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:11.360> that's<00:01:12.360> because

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
bumblebee or Optimus and that's because

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.580 
bumblebee or Optimus and that's because
I<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.049> ran<00:01:13.350> out<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.680> those<00:01:13.979> pieces<00:01:15.350> so<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.409> use

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
I just ran out of those pieces so I use

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.670 
I just ran out of those pieces so I use
these<00:01:17.900> also<00:01:18.979> he<00:01:19.979> annoyed<00:01:20.340> me<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.119> front

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
these also he annoyed me that the front

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.429 
these also he annoyed me that the front
ones<00:01:22.680> on<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.070> cab<00:01:23.310> rolled<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.990> ones<00:01:25.229> on

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
ones on the cab rolled and the ones on

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.039 
ones on the cab rolled and the ones on
the<00:01:25.560> trailer<00:01:25.979> didn't<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.850> kind<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.479> glued

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
the trailer didn't so kind of just glued

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.219 
the trailer didn't so kind of just glued
these<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.369> pegs<00:01:29.640> they<00:01:29.820> went<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.390> so

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
these to the pegs they went on to so

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.760 
these to the pegs they went on to so
that<00:01:31.409> these<00:01:31.920> don't<00:01:32.130> roll<00:01:32.900> yeah<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.140> kind<00:01:34.710> of

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
that these don't roll yeah that kind of

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.730 
that these don't roll yeah that kind of
is<00:01:35.990> crazy<00:01:37.009> but<00:01:38.479> whatever<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.720> just<00:01:40.439> didn't<00:01:40.680> like

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
is crazy but whatever I just didn't like

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.319 
is crazy but whatever I just didn't like
the<00:01:40.799> fact<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.280> these<00:01:41.520> didn't<00:01:41.850> roll<00:01:42.030> and

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
the fact that these didn't roll and

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.590 
the fact that these didn't roll and
these<00:01:42.600> did<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.350> glued<00:01:43.710> these<00:01:43.920> ones<00:01:44.220> on<00:01:44.600> here

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
these did so I glued these ones on here

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.230 
these did so I glued these ones on here
you<00:01:45.810> mix<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.290> optimus<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.790> can<00:01:47.939> see<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
you mix to optimus and you can see the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.020 
you mix to optimus and you can see the
cabs<00:01:48.509> are<00:01:49.200> pretty<00:01:50.159> much<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.369> same<00:01:50.399> this<00:01:50.790> one

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
cabs are pretty much the same this one

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.550 
cabs are pretty much the same this one
does<00:01:51.210> not<00:01:51.740> transform<00:01:52.740> into<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.220> robot<00:01:53.899> this<00:01:54.899> cab

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
does not transform into a robot this cab

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.219 
does not transform into a robot this cab
part<00:01:55.979> does<00:01:56.219> not<00:01:56.250> transform<00:01:57.030> into<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.750> Magnus

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
part does not transform into the Magnus

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.760 
part does not transform into the Magnus
he'd<00:01:59.009> never<00:01:59.570> had<00:02:00.570> turned<00:02:00.869> into<00:02:01.020> Magnus<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:01.680> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
he'd never had turned into Magnus in the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.700 
he'd never had turned into Magnus in the
show<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.460> didn't<00:02:02.969> think<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.990> was<00:02:04.110> necessary

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
show so I didn't think it was necessary

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.640 
show so I didn't think it was necessary
but<00:02:05.490> as<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.820> can<00:02:05.939> see<00:02:06.000> here

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.610 

Optimus<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:11.680> quite<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.250> bit<00:02:12.370> longer<00:02:12.580> but<00:02:13.620> quite

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
Optimus is quite a bit longer but quite

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.400 
Optimus is quite a bit longer but quite
a<00:02:14.920> bit<00:02:15.520> shorter<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:19.240> front<00:02:19.510> of<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.630> cabs<00:02:19.870> look

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
a bit shorter the front of the cabs look

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.290 
a bit shorter the front of the cabs look
almost<00:02:20.950> exactly<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.610> same<00:02:21.790> except<00:02:22.120> he<00:02:22.209> has

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
almost exactly the same except he has

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.730 
almost exactly the same except he has
headlights<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:22.990> four<00:02:23.200> different<00:02:23.440> colors

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
headlights and four different colors

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.090 
headlights and four different colors
overall<00:02:24.550> they<00:02:25.240> look<00:02:25.450> pretty<00:02:25.660> cool<00:02:25.840> together

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.949 

comparing<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.280> cabs<00:02:30.640> together<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:31.510> can<00:02:31.690> see

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
comparing the cabs together you can see

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.720 
comparing the cabs together you can see
that<00:02:31.990> Optimus<00:02:32.980> Prime<00:02:33.160> is<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.340> lot<00:02:33.550> longer

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
that Optimus Prime is a lot longer

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.229 
that Optimus Prime is a lot longer
because<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.330> seat<00:02:34.860> but<00:02:35.860> he<00:02:35.890> also<00:02:36.070> is<00:02:36.520> a<00:02:36.820> lot

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
because of the seat but he also is a lot

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.970 
because of the seat but he also is a lot
wider<00:02:39.540> height<00:02:40.540> they're<00:02:41.290> about<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.709> same

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
wider height they're about the same

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.670 
wider height they're about the same
though<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.920> I<00:02:45.310> suppose<00:02:46.180> these<00:02:47.110> would<00:02:47.500> be<00:02:47.650> the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
though so I suppose these would be the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.310 
though so I suppose these would be the
same<00:02:48.160> truck<00:02:48.550> made<00:02:49.090> by<00:02:49.269> different<00:02:49.600> companies

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.470 

to<00:02:53.320> transform<00:02:54.070> Ultra<00:02:54.340> Magnus<00:02:54.519> what<00:02:55.239> you're

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
to transform Ultra Magnus what you're

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.870 
to transform Ultra Magnus what you're
going<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:55.690> do<00:02:56.220> is<00:02:57.989> I<00:02:59.400> fold<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:00.640> up<00:03:01.150> like<00:03:01.630> that

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
going to do is I fold this up like that

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.020 
going to do is I fold this up like that
now<00:03:03.880> this<00:03:04.060> transforms<00:03:05.100> entirely<00:03:06.100> different

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
now this transforms entirely different

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.250 
now this transforms entirely different
than<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:07.810> originals<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.440> want<00:03:09.750> down<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.959> just

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
than the originals you want down to just

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.220 
than the originals you want down to just
about<00:03:11.410> everything<00:03:11.739> so<00:03:12.540> do<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:13.750> this<00:03:13.989> will

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
about everything so do that this will

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.979 
about everything so do that this will
attach<00:03:14.530> onto<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.160> back<00:03:15.400> like<00:03:15.940> that<00:03:18.600> now<00:03:19.600> what

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
attach onto the back like that now what

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
these parts down these will become the

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:45.050 
these parts down these will become the
legs<00:03:40.620> like<00:03:41.620> that

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:55.990 

then<00:03:46.640> just<00:03:47.640> for<00:03:47.969> now<00:03:48.739> split<00:03:50.359> the<00:03:51.359> top<00:03:51.569> part

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.530 

rotate<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.569> waist<00:03:57.810> around<00:03:58.140> like<00:03:59.040> this<00:04:02.540> and

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
bring the head up all the stuff to do is

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:21.020 
bring the head up all the stuff to do is
straighten<00:04:10.379> out<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:11.340> arms<00:04:16.579> and<00:04:18.440> attach<00:04:20.030> the

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
guns here to make his little shoulder

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.310 
guns here to make his little shoulder
spires<00:04:23.699> now<00:04:24.660> this<00:04:24.840> is<00:04:25.130> not<00:04:26.130> how<00:04:26.400> it<00:04:26.520> works<00:04:26.849> on

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
spires now this is not how it works on

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.920 
spires now this is not how it works on
the<00:04:28.320> original<00:04:28.710> toy<00:04:28.940> guns<00:04:29.940> would<00:04:30.270> peg<00:04:30.630> on<00:04:30.780> to

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
the original toy guns would peg on to

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.230 
the original toy guns would peg on to
the<00:04:31.020> side<00:04:31.289> of<00:04:31.440> his<00:04:31.530> shoulders<00:04:31.949> and<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.340> little

the side of his shoulders and the little
shoulder<00:04:33.630> spires<00:04:33.900> would<00:04:35.090> where<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.449> results

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
shoulder spires would where the results

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.490 
shoulder spires would where the results
of<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.139> transformation<00:04:37.830> actually<00:04:38.310> but<00:04:39.500> just

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
of the transformation actually but just

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.270 
of the transformation actually but just
to<00:04:40.590> be<00:04:40.770> sort<00:04:41.400> of<00:04:41.430> accurate<00:04:41.940> to<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.660> show<00:04:43.289> I<00:04:43.710> did

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
to be sort of accurate to the show I did

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.820 
to be sort of accurate to the show I did
that<00:04:44.460> he<00:04:44.729> had<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.150> guns<00:04:45.360> in<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:45.660> show<00:04:45.979> but<00:04:46.979> I

that he had the guns in the show but I

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.520 
that he had the guns in the show but I
did<00:04:49.830> what<00:04:50.010> I<00:04:50.039> could<00:04:50.370> with<00:04:50.810> the<00:04:51.810> technology<00:04:52.500> I

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
did what I could with the technology I

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.580 
did what I could with the technology I
have<00:04:53.630> now<00:04:54.630> you<00:04:54.690> don't<00:04:54.930> close<00:04:55.139> this<00:04:55.320> all<00:04:55.500> the
