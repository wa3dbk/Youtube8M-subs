in all the report is important and I

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.450 
in all the report is important and I
think<00:01:26.280> frankly<00:01:26.670> surprising<00:01:27.360> because<00:01:28.460> it's

system and their needs that we showed
are<00:01:37.290> frankly<00:01:37.979> startling<00:01:38.520> it's<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.600> cost<00:01:39.840> which

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
are frankly startling it's a cost which

are frankly startling it's a cost which
to<00:01:40.560> some<00:01:40.740> extent<00:01:40.799> will<00:01:41.579> be<00:01:41.700> borne<00:01:42.000> by
