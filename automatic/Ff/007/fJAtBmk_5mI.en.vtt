00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
get involved you know so it could be

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.600 
get involved you know so it could be
that<00:02:10.410> those<00:02:10.500> are<00:02:10.679> some<00:02:10.770> dissenters<00:02:11.250> as<00:02:11.400> well

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
that those are some dissenters as well

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.520 
that those are some dissenters as well
but<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.569> does<00:02:12.720> bring<00:02:12.900> up<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.170> great

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
but it does bring up a great

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.710 
but it does bring up a great
about<00:02:13.800> poaching<00:02:14.040> versus<00:02:14.850> legal<00:02:15.180> hunting<00:02:15.360> so

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
about poaching versus legal hunting so

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.510 
about poaching versus legal hunting so
everything<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.230> she's<00:02:16.560> done<00:02:16.830> she<00:02:17.070> claims<00:02:17.340> is

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
everything that she's done she claims is

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.090 
everything that she's done she claims is
legal<00:02:17.910> hunting<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.570> is<00:02:19.110> hunting<00:02:19.740> part<00:02:19.980> of

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
legal hunting and is hunting part of

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.280 
legal hunting and is hunting part of
conservation<00:02:20.730> efforts<00:02:21.120> yes<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:22.110> know<00:02:22.200> you

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
conservation efforts yes you know you

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.380 
conservation efforts yes you know you
may<00:02:22.440> agree<00:02:22.650> with<00:02:22.740> it<00:02:22.980> or<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.190> may<00:02:23.430> not<00:02:23.460> but<00:02:24.150> the

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
may agree with it or you may not but the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.390 
may agree with it or you may not but the
truth<00:02:24.600> is<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.810> lot<00:02:24.990> of<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> lot<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:25.920> places<00:02:26.280> that

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
truth is a lot of a lot of places that

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.750 
truth is a lot of a lot of places that
have<00:02:27.050> areas<00:02:28.050> for<00:02:28.230> conservation<00:02:28.520> will<00:02:29.520> auction

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
have areas for conservation will auction

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.300 
have areas for conservation will auction
off<00:02:30.209> licenses<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.110> kill<00:02:31.320> a<00:02:31.350> rhino<00:02:31.590> so<00:02:31.920> there<00:02:32.040> or

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
off licenses to kill a rhino so there or

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.460 
off licenses to kill a rhino so there or
an<00:02:32.700> elephant<00:02:33.090> or<00:02:33.420> line<00:02:33.720> whatever<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.290> might<00:02:34.410> be

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
an elephant or line whatever it might be

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.380 
an elephant or line whatever it might be
so<00:02:34.590> they'll<00:02:34.950> sell<00:02:35.190> off<00:02:35.370> these<00:02:35.550> licenses<00:02:36.150> and

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
so they'll sell off these licenses and

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.410 
so they'll sell off these licenses and
purportedly<00:02:37.320> use<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:37.860> revenue<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.670> help

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
purportedly use that revenue to help

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.120 
purportedly use that revenue to help
keep<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.840> other<00:02:40.020> animals<00:02:40.500> safe<00:02:40.740> and<00:02:40.920> alive

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
keep the other animals safe and alive

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.890 
keep the other animals safe and alive
and<00:02:41.280> conserve<00:02:41.640> them<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:41.880> it's<00:02:42.000> it's<00:02:42.300> very<00:02:42.390> odd

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
and conserve them so it's it's very odd

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.390 
and conserve them so it's it's very odd
it's<00:02:43.170> almost<00:02:43.380> saying<00:02:43.590> like<00:02:43.709> will<00:02:43.890> kill<00:02:44.130> one<00:02:44.340> to

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
it's almost saying like will kill one to

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.699 
it's almost saying like will kill one to
save<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:45.300> other<00:02:45.450> hunter<00:02:45.750> but<00:02:46.170> what<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:46.560> the

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
save the other hunter but what it is the

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.890 
save the other hunter but what it is the
said<00:02:46.860> is<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.070> it's<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.489> false<00:02:47.880> economy<00:02:48.420> that

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
said is is it's a false economy that

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.090 
said is is it's a false economy that
they've<00:02:49.020> created<00:02:49.200> they've<00:02:49.620> created<00:02:49.860> a

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
they've created they've created a

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.460 
they've created they've created a
built-in<00:02:50.640> mechanism<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:51.390> justify<00:02:51.900> hunting<00:02:52.290> by

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
built-in mechanism to justify hunting by

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.930 
built-in mechanism to justify hunting by
taking<00:02:52.800> part<00:02:53.070> of<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.340> revenue<00:02:53.670> from<00:02:53.790> the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
taking part of the revenue from the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.630 
taking part of the revenue from the
licenses<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:55.050> conserve<00:02:55.470> animals<00:02:55.950> at<00:02:56.100> large<00:02:56.310> so

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
licenses to conserve animals at large so

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.550 
licenses to conserve animals at large so
by<00:02:56.820> hunting<00:02:57.270> you're<00:02:57.570> helping<00:02:57.959> animals<00:02:58.140> but

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
by hunting you're helping animals but

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.440 
by hunting you're helping animals but
clearly<00:02:59.160> that's<00:02:59.340> not<00:02:59.430> the<00:03:00.120> way<00:03:00.270> it<00:03:00.420> really

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
clearly that's not the way it really

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.020 
clearly that's not the way it really
works<00:03:01.170> it's<00:03:01.500> just<00:03:01.590> helping<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.280> animal

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
works it's just helping that animal

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.390 
works it's just helping that animal
