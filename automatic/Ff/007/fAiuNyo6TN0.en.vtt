00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
also it can be quite hard depending on

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.170 
also it can be quite hard depending on
what<00:00:54.500> weapon<00:00:54.800> set<00:00:55.040> you're<00:00:55.190> doing<00:00:55.460> for<00:00:55.910> example

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
what weapon set you're doing for example

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.430 
what weapon set you're doing for example
if<00:00:56.239> you're<00:00:56.329> doing<00:00:56.540> the<00:00:56.629> assault<00:00:56.989> rifles<00:00:57.320> it

can be a little bit harder to get those

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.939 
can be a little bit harder to get those
point-blank<00:00:59.180> kills<00:00:59.540> but<00:01:00.170> also<00:01:00.379> because<00:01:00.830> you

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
point-blank kills but also because you

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.250 
point-blank kills but also because you
don't<00:01:01.160> need<00:01:01.400> to<00:01:01.580> get<00:01:01.760> a<00:01:01.910> lot<00:01:02.300> then<00:01:02.930> you'll<00:01:03.110> be<00:01:03.230> a

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260

don't need to get a lot then you'll be a
lot<00:01:03.440> easy<00:01:03.620> to<00:01:03.860> do<00:01:04.009> then<00:01:04.250> if<00:01:04.369> you're<00:01:04.489> trying<00:01:04.670> to

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
lot easy to do then if you're trying to

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.210 
lot easy to do then if you're trying to
get<00:01:04.910> the<00:01:05.059> SMGs<00:01:05.630> which<00:01:06.140> actually<00:01:06.590> require<00:01:06.740> a

hundred<00:01:07.610> point-blank<00:01:07.910> kills<00:01:08.330> and<00:01:08.600> therefore

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
hundred point-blank kills and therefore

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.080 
hundred point-blank kills and therefore

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.820 
even though it's easy to get it you'll
notice<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:11.660> difference<00:01:11.930> in<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.440> fact<00:01:12.770> that

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830
