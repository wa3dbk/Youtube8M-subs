00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hi, how are you? What are you talking about? 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.299
 leave it for later 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.620
 good people in various situations in my 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:14.429
 life I have stayed at this situation not 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.490
 It's not cool that it's only late 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.789
 block exists and you always 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.800
 an internal excuse not to do this 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.580
 kind of thing you know because he's in the background 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.670
 Is there any fear or fear? 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.550
 some is a form of defense that you 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.500
 creates not to do is or to 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.840
 something at that time when 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.210
 I started to record the Indians here on the channel 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.410
 I spent a year meanwhile the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.290
 first video I spent a year 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.480
 watching a lot of people there is an event for 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.489
 the contents and I know what to 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.280
 then it is always the devil spoke in the morning 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.160
 the player coming the next day not to 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.590
 cool one day, you're cool, you announced 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.260
 who will travel tomorrow to appear a 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.260
 commitment or else it will cycle through 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.140
 that vicious and people do not realize just 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.299
 when you spend a lot of time and 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.930
 courses you speak today and I started 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.820
 There you are not dedicating yourself to 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.369
 something that you consider important in 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.009
 your life why not do it now if you 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.500
 has the possibility if you have the 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.509
 ability to do only 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.159
 study a little bit about what you 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.110
 You want to talk a lot about what you 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.159
 Do you want to study what job you 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.770
 would you like 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.700
 so there are several things we can do 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.890
 do and do not leave for tomorrow they do 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.840
 The whole difference in people's lives seems 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.659
 a subject that smells like me talking like that 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.729
 It seems something that is so silly, right? 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.070
 It is part of the daily life of many people I 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.740
 I'm sure it has thousands of 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.350
 people 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.890
 what do you think what sometimes happens 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.909
 How do I go about this ayman business? 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:58.360
 the diet trade people diet diet thing 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.670
 but I think it happens in the world of 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.830
 Everyone leaves for tomorrow because 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.210
 this problem, for example, does not 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.970
 I want today because today I'm in the mood 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.349
 eating a pizza is good if you want 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:14.830
 start unification lethality is x and y 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:18.190
 soon you there eat six pieces of 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.350
 pizza like 3 you did not leave tomorrow you 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.500
 did not stop eating your pizza and you already 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.830
 began to decrease its diet 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.230
 Saturday to eat less calories then 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.140
 always has a shape only we always 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.880
 have to think about giving to do so if the 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.489
 people have the willpower of people 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.739
 have a focus that we want to change if we 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.350
 Do you want to achieve your colors? 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.730
 There has to be shape you have to have a lot 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.549
 will power 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.599
 but you will always leave 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.549
 after 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.280
 without leaving for tomorrow being that 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.660
 You could have done it now in this 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.180
 moment to rise 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.850
 Look I'm tired but I do not know what I 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.070
 so I want to do such a thing I can say 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.200
 but I work all day I do not have 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.600
 time to breathe right I 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.989
 I understand, I swear I have time to 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.120
 Sometimes we do not even have time. 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.519
 but does not have a day you can 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.720
 take well to devote to that 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:19.299
 dream knows that on that day you will 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.750
 waking up is going to do that 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.700
 sleep that goal and not wake up from that 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.980
 day and said I'll do it tomorrow 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.139
 plundered again is a circle 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.750
 vicious people leave for tomorrow 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.720
 My god is the terrible vicious circle. 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.340
 what I do in my life 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.930
 daily I try to change only once in a 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.769
 When and look I'm going through the 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.109
 living room 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.490
 I talk very much alone a lot 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:46.980
 just there talking to me 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.080
 and talk to mali then I'll move on to 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.940
 front of the mirror spoke pope you 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.970

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.610

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.340
 For but of cerium have to think this 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.470
 There is that phrase, you have to love the 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.800
 people like there is no tomorrow with 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.540
 security, but people are very 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.430
 You liked this video I 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.340

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.260
 way I knew how to breathe because what I 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.020
 I'm doing here and venting with 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.420
 the camera and talk about a subject that I 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.090
 I have to force myself to always do 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.670
 not to leave for tomorrow, never have to 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.190
 to do now is no different from the heat and 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:38.060
 the cold of america and the scorching sun 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.830
 have dirty clean house 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.390

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.070
 Do you want to do something? 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.610

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:50.070

 Okay, so let's do is if this fact 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.520

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.470
 something tomorrow says no I am 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.270
