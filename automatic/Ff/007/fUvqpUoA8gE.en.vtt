00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.520
 started at thq and before the house 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.750
 do not put the key under the door and go 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.730
 the torch at ubisoft 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.440
 the development of south park the stick 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.190
 of truth enters his last 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.200
 straight line 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.179
 an incredibly faithful role- playing game 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.160
 the animated series developed by the studio 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.680
 obsidian which one must in particular 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.869
 fallout new vegas and neverwinter nights 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.210
 2 it was imagined by the creators of 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.519
 south park themselves trey parker and matt 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.840
 stone so two players having grown up 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.609
 between a keyboard and a mouse 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.349
 decided not to let their 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.239
 derived babies in the hands of studio 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.489
 not very careful the pitiful 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.059
 adaptation of the 90s 2000 will be 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.059
 soon forgotten 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.519
 had absolutely no desire to 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.019
 start a new park sauce game in 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.269
 letting someone else realize it at 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:49.839
 our place leaves to make a game there 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:51.610
 had to be like the series 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:53.649
 deprives in the same way that one is as much 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.120
 involved and got into trouble 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.879
 because we did not imagine it 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.190
 would be so hard without us it would be 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.989
 already finished we should not have had 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.640
 to get involved basically we are the ones who 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.699
 let's put things down 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.699
 complicated 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.090
 more seriously the stick of truth 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.680
 benefited from the expertise of the duo in 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.270
 integrated indicator from its beginnings in the 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.110
 well- run production line of the 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.790
 TV series we do the game as we do 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.500
 the series spends a lot of time in the 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.450
 newsroom to ask what 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.450
 will be the key moments and then 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.680
 how related to each other that 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.330
 rolls alone for the services to 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.490
 parks we pass very easily from the 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.869
 writing to the creation of images but 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.430
 for the game add a step with 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.909
 the programmers who come back then 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.440
 to us for your opinion for 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.030
 magnify the classic base of the game of 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.500
 role with turn-based fights 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.200
 we will find the original voices 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.090
 of the series his iconic visual style and 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.429
 of course the corrosive humor of 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.459
 parker and stone as well say that with a 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:58.780
 such bail not the right to error 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:58.780
 seriously guys will have to insure
