windows-based environment we actually

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.529

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
we look at a med vWorkspace what we'll

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.069 
we look at a med vWorkspace what we'll
notice<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.090> there's<00:00:54.329> nothing<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.899> user

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
notice is there's nothing that the user

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.200 
notice is there's nothing that the user
is<00:00:55.289> going<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.559> see<00:00:55.949> by<00:00:56.129> default<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.820> tells

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
is going to see by default that tells

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.670 
is going to see by default that tells
them<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.480> there<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.870> workspace<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.350> is

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
them that there is a workspace that is

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.830 
them that there is a workspace that is
running<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.129> reason<00:01:00.090> behind<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.539> that

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
running the reason behind that is that

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.479 
running the reason behind that is that
Med<00:01:01.020> V<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.379> actually<00:01:01.739> make<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.100> environment

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
Med V can actually make the environment

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.280 
Med V can actually make the environment
seamless<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> user<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.960> that's<00:01:04.080> called

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
seamless to the user and that's called

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.039 
seamless to the user and that's called
seamless<00:01:04.710> integration<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.700> UI<00:01:05.930> what<00:01:06.930> we

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
seamless integration of the UI what we

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.539 
seamless integration of the UI what we
will<00:01:07.170> see<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.500> through<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.070> policies

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
will see is that through the policies

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.240 
will see is that through the policies

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
lose functionality like alt tab so alt

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.690

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
the image which is going to encrypt and

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.540 
the image which is going to encrypt and
also<00:03:47.690> compress<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.320> image<00:03:48.650> to<00:03:49.280> make<00:03:49.310> it

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
also compress the image to make it

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.460 
also compress the image to make it
smaller<00:03:49.790> on<00:03:49.880> the<00:03:50.000> network<00:03:50.390> and<00:03:50.600> finally<00:03:51.320> we'll

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
smaller on the network and finally we'll

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.740 
smaller on the network and finally we'll
upload<00:03:51.740> it<00:03:51.980> to<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.400> distribution<00:03:52.760> server<00:03:53.390> and

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
upload it to the distribution server and

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.090 
upload it to the distribution server and
this<00:03:54.320> will<00:03:54.440> make<00:03:54.500> it<00:03:54.560> available<00:03:54.740> to<00:03:55.330> users

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
this will make it available to users

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.360 
this will make it available to users
after<00:03:59.080> creating<00:04:00.080> the<00:04:00.290> image<00:04:00.800> we're<00:04:01.190> going<00:04:01.220> to

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
after creating the image we're going to

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.490 
after creating the image we're going to
go<00:04:01.460> ahead<00:04:01.580> and<00:04:01.970> look<00:04:02.090> at<00:04:02.270> the<00:04:02.510> policies<00:04:03.050> and
