00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 hi friends 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:10.100
 I almost look like that picture that appears with 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:14.600
 a scythe this is not a scythe s 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:17.180
 an extendable and fixed pruning shears 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.320
 it can be extended many more than we 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.710
 He is saying because that is sensitive and 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.710
 to prune 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.430
 this plum tree that you see that I have here in 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.509
 a farm are active companies 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.509
 that still has some 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.160
 it is almost at the end of the harvest of 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.020
 plums this has yellow claudius that 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.390
 now for san juan 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.230
 when we are in the carmen we are 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.880
 July 16 day of the card congratulations 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.040
 delayed because only when you see 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.310
 the video has already passed the day to all 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.740
 cÃ¡rmenes on this day of carmen 2014 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.770
 July broadcast 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.340
 and let's go to the crux of the matter I'm going to 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.340
 support here 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:07.910
 here I have another manual and here I have another 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.800
 which is also extensible but of the 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.990
 arms 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:17.120
 these are from the leader the greens are 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.130
 quite competitive price-quality and 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.530
 They usually put them two or three times a year 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.290
 there by spring in summer it will be the 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.480
 Promotion of the pruning shears 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.900
 expressions and these are typical of 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.840
 ironmongery that I advise them of iron 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.430
 that are oxidized sometimes we have them 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.500
 to clean and assign tougher people 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.230
 I recommend it so much the streets were 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.760
 of aluminum and carbon and such because it 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:45.320
 tend to see are very fixed and good and what 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.880
 I'm going to do with this plum tree 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.880
 see what size 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.660
 He has reached the TV and you have to prune 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.360
 all branches must be pruned 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.060
 green you already have video of other years 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.610
 you have seen the green pruning 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.470
 to do them in all the fruit trees and 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.600
 when they are made then at the end of July 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.760
 mid July to mid 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.530
 August we can see it 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.200
 with leaf and all poblanos and how it 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.900
 will perform for having given giving almost 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.710
 all the branches or takes looted very 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.080
 long leaving a quarter or half of 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.480
 the branch of the extension of the branch is 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.580
 unites as we want to leave the structure of 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.610
 long and here I'm going to start pruning 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:34.320
 the hand scissors and 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.320
 you lower things and all 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.090
 Monaco back 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.620
 when you see this video in the previous 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.490
 said that visits have gone down 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.860
 quite 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.860
 but it is already recovered 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.840
 it's summer and surely it would be 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.400
 enjoying the beach 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.400
 the holidays you have 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.180
 of the beaches 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.390
 and giving here already 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.850
 will know more 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.690
 low see you with the before 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.690
 the manual 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.930
 Besides that 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.710
 in the line of weapons we will see more 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.790
 time in the next winter guinea pig 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.790
 has much less wood 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.250
 let's save these little maid and the 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.600
 long production will be better 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.790
 as you see 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.540
 fast coffee are practical 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.540
 when you read 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.970
 and apart we leave the light at the door 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:00.230
 because there are days and so forth 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.230
 not much light coming in 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:08.790
 we must take advantage of the land for all 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:12.370
 How to dance down with manual scissors 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.850
 we have the intermediate flames and 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.850
 we use 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.790
 more there are no clear 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:26.050
 if you do not have arms , nothing happens 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.050
 we take some stairs 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.730
 a staircase we climbed with care and 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.730
 we are playing 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.830
 to see the example the sensitive 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:48.330
 extendable we can extend it in several 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.870
 stretches 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:56.169
 in a sky we imagine left and beige 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.849
 and we get to the much much higher 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:02.229
 to see if we enter you have to enter 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:05.830
 inside the branches and once 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:10.810
 we introduce the scissors we have this 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:12.810
 rope and little more goddess than us 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.740
 what 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.740
 cambric 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:26.630
 you have to remove the trees from the 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:29.270
 the good land and up to here this video 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:33.230
 I already say you will have seen other pruning 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:35.180
 other years is the 2014 pruning in 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.160
 fruit trees the pruning that is called 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.800
 green summer pruning that is very 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.810
 important and you have to do it you know that 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.360
 when you have fruit trees they give a lot of work 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.970
 but we also have the satisfaction of 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.800
 eat fruit that if we give treatments 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.600
 ecological is much healthier than this 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.289
 source has bought that many times we 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:57.169
 they come from other continents of hours 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:58.819
 of days or months that come from other 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:01.490
 parts of the world fruit that has been caught 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:03.499
 green chemical treatments for 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.300
 keep it and that is not as healthy as 

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:07.879
 fruit that we can have in our 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.499
 Orchards is finally good until soon 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:12.080

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:14.990
 vacations those who work in the 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.119
 soap operas so keep enjoying the 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.139
 life until soon friends I will continue
