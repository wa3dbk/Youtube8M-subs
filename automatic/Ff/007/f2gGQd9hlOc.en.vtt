your<00:02:29.540> first<00:02:29.900> gun<00:02:30.200> that<00:02:30.410> you're<00:02:30.560> going<00:02:30.710> to<00:02:30.770> be

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
your first gun that you're going to be

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.130 
your first gun that you're going to be
shooting<00:02:31.070> lots<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.760> you<00:02:32.510> know<00:02:32.570> getting<00:02:33.050> that

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
shooting lots and you know getting that

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.960 
shooting lots and you know getting that
trigger<00:02:33.440> time<00:02:33.680> down<00:02:33.950> with<00:02:34.190> I<00:02:34.400> would<00:02:34.700> probably

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
trigger time down with I would probably

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.590 
trigger time down with I would probably
go<00:02:35.090> for<00:02:35.120> at<00:02:35.330> 22<00:02:37.810> volts<00:02:38.810> cycles<00:02:40.480> very<00:02:41.480> easily

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
go for at 22 volts cycles very easily

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.500 
go for at 22 volts cycles very easily
it's<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:42.490> cheaper<00:02:43.490> construction<00:02:44.150> I<00:02:44.240> mean<00:02:44.390> it's

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
it's a cheaper construction I mean it's

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.430 
it's a cheaper construction I mean it's
a<00:02:44.540> cert<00:02:44.780> $300<00:02:45.470> gun<00:02:46.480> but<00:02:47.480> overall<00:02:48.170> I've<00:02:48.260> been

very happy with it

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.760 
very happy with it
it's<00:02:49.790> been<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.390> great<00:02:50.900> gun<00:02:51.170> it's<00:02:51.380> been<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.560> lot<00:02:51.740> of

I recommend the gun if you want a sub
$300<00:04:52.560> HMR<00:04:53.460> with<00:04:54.270> a<00:04:54.300> heavy<00:04:54.510> barrel<00:04:54.950> and<00:04:55.950> I<00:04:56.040> would

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
$300 HMR with a heavy barrel and I would

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.040 
$300 HMR with a heavy barrel and I would
go<00:04:56.400> for<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:56.670> heavy<00:04:56.790> barrel<00:04:57.950> definitely<00:05:00.050> it's

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
go for the heavy barrel definitely it's

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.020 
go for the heavy barrel definitely it's
a<00:05:01.170> little<00:05:01.380> bit<00:05:01.470> heavier<00:05:01.710> but<00:05:01.920> such<00:05:02.220> II<00:05:02.250> the

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
a little bit heavier but such II the

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.600 
a little bit heavier but such II the
accuracy<00:05:03.570> I<00:05:03.750> find<00:05:04.230> anyways<00:05:04.620> is<00:05:04.950> extremely

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
accuracy I find anyways is extremely

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.820 
accuracy I find anyways is extremely
good<00:05:07.850> but<00:05:08.850> the<00:05:09.180> HMO<00:05:09.570> around<00:05:09.870> I'm<00:05:10.140> probably<00:05:10.590> not

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
good but the HMO around I'm probably not

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.100 
good but the HMO around I'm probably not
going<00:05:10.980> to<00:05:11.070> continue<00:05:11.340> with<00:05:11.690> I'll<00:05:12.690> be<00:05:12.750> selling

going to continue with I'll be selling
this<00:05:13.230> gun<00:05:13.410> shortly<00:05:13.890> I'll<00:05:14.670> make<00:05:14.850> probably<00:05:15.210> a

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
this gun shortly I'll make probably a

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.140 
this gun shortly I'll make probably a
small<00:05:15.540> loss<00:05:15.750> of<00:05:15.960> it<00:05:16.310> but<00:05:17.310> you<00:05:17.610> know<00:05:17.730> what<00:05:17.880> you

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
small loss of it but you know what you

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.240 
small loss of it but you know what you
got<00:05:18.300> to<00:05:18.390> invest<00:05:18.900> your<00:05:19.110> to<00:05:19.200> try<00:05:19.470> these<00:05:19.530> things<00:05:19.710> I

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
got to invest your to try these things I

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.700 
got to invest your to try these things I
guess<00:05:20.850> I<00:05:21.000> I've<00:05:21.810> owned<00:05:22.050> this<00:05:22.170> gun<00:05:22.410> for<00:05:22.500> about

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
guess I I've owned this gun for about

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.890 
guess I I've owned this gun for about
two<00:05:22.980> years<00:05:23.010> I<00:05:23.520> don't<00:05:24.150> like<00:05:24.270> to<00:05:24.420> review<00:05:24.690> things

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
two years I don't like to review things

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.440 
two years I don't like to review things
unless<00:05:25.230> I<00:05:25.410> actually<00:05:25.620> use<00:05:26.040> them<00:05:26.310> for<00:05:26.730> an<00:05:27.210> amount

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
unless I actually use them for an amount

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.190 
unless I actually use them for an amount
of<00:05:27.570> time<00:05:27.630> I'm<00:05:27.990> not<00:05:28.020> guys<00:05:28.740> gonna<00:05:29.100> buy<00:05:29.370> again<00:05:30.200> not

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
overall the the gun is competent gun

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.520 
overall the the gun is competent gun
heavy<00:05:41.850> barrel<00:05:42.180> love<00:05:42.450> the<00:05:42.780> Accu<00:05:43.140> trigger

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
heavy barrel love the Accu trigger

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.950 
heavy barrel love the Accu trigger
really<00:05:44.010> makes<00:05:44.220> this<00:05:44.370> again<00:05:44.610> as<00:05:44.820> the<00:05:45.660> reason<00:05:45.900> I

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
really makes this again as the reason I

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.220 
really makes this again as the reason I
bought<00:05:46.200> the<00:05:46.500> axis<00:05:47.340> mark<00:05:47.610> 2<00:05:47.910> is<00:05:48.330> because<00:05:49.110> they

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
bought the axis mark 2 is because they

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.410 
bought the axis mark 2 is because they
upgraded<00:05:49.590> from<00:05:50.010> the<00:05:50.190> exes<00:05:50.460> Mach<00:05:50.670> 1<00:05:50.940> and<00:05:51.210> the

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
upgraded from the exes Mach 1 and the

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.530 
upgraded from the exes Mach 1 and the
big<00:05:51.600> upgrade<00:05:51.960> was<00:05:52.230> the<00:05:52.380> Accu<00:05:52.620> trigger<00:05:53.450> if<00:05:54.450> you

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
big upgrade was the Accu trigger if you

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.940 
big upgrade was the Accu trigger if you
don't<00:05:54.780> know<00:05:54.930> about<00:05:55.050> the<00:05:55.290> Anki<00:05:55.530> trigger<00:05:55.830> that

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
don't know about the Anki trigger that

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.770 
don't know about the Anki trigger that
it's<00:05:56.130> worth<00:05:56.370> investing<00:05:57.270> the<00:05:57.360> time<00:05:57.390> and

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
it's worth investing the time and

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.140 
it's worth investing the time and
learned<00:05:57.960> about<00:05:58.280> basically<00:05:59.280> it<00:05:59.580> allows<00:05:59.640> the

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
learned about basically it allows the

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.380 
learned about basically it allows the
trigger<00:06:00.750> to<00:06:00.930> be<00:06:01.610> loaded<00:06:02.610> a<00:06:02.730> lot<00:06:02.970> lighter<00:06:03.210> than

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
trigger to be loaded a lot lighter than

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.930 
trigger to be loaded a lot lighter than
normal<00:06:03.690> but<00:06:04.380> have<00:06:04.620> a<00:06:04.650> yeah<00:06:04.980> effectively<00:06:05.910> a

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
normal but have a yeah effectively a

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.540 
normal but have a yeah effectively a
safety<00:06:06.450> sear<00:06:06.890> so<00:06:07.890> the<00:06:08.010> a<00:06:08.040> key<00:06:08.130> trigger<00:06:08.460> is

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
safety sear so the a key trigger is

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.570 
safety sear so the a key trigger is
probably<00:06:08.940> one<00:06:09.390> of<00:06:09.420> the<00:06:09.830> the<00:06:10.830> biggest<00:06:11.040> changes

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
probably one of the the biggest changes

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.180 
probably one of the the biggest changes
in<00:06:11.880> in<00:06:12.300> triggered<00:06:12.930> technology<00:06:13.560> in<00:06:13.920> recent

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
in in triggered technology in recent

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.700 
in in triggered technology in recent
years<00:06:14.730> and<00:06:15.360> it's<00:06:15.630> been<00:06:15.750> copied<00:06:15.990> by<00:06:16.140> a<00:06:16.530> lot<00:06:16.680> of

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
years and it's been copied by a lot of

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.020 
years and it's been copied by a lot of
other<00:06:16.920> companies<00:06:17.690> including<00:06:18.800> Ruger<00:06:20.030> they

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
other companies including Ruger they

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.540 
other companies including Ruger they
have<00:06:21.420> their<00:06:21.540> own<00:06:21.570> version<00:06:21.990> of<00:06:22.080> that<00:06:22.550> but

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
have their own version of that but

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.630 
have their own version of that but
effectively<00:06:24.090> it's<00:06:24.330> kind<00:06:24.600> of<00:06:24.660> the<00:06:24.750> same<00:06:25.640> so

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.640 
effectively it's kind of the same so

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.550 
effectively it's kind of the same so
this<00:06:27.030> is<00:06:27.210> great<00:06:27.420> if<00:06:28.020> you're<00:06:28.200> wondering<00:06:28.500> about
