00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.350 
thing is I wanted to have meaning and so
I<00:00:14.340> was<00:00:14.490> looking<00:00:14.700> at<00:00:14.820> various<00:00:15.150> graduate

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
I was looking at various graduate

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.840 
I was looking at various graduate
schemes<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.109> jobs<00:00:16.379> however<00:00:16.859> something<00:00:17.699> was

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
schemes and jobs however something was

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.040 
schemes and jobs however something was
in<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.000> back<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.210> my<00:00:18.270> mind<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.660> wanted<00:00:18.990> to

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
in the back of my mind that I wanted to

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.240 
in the back of my mind that I wanted to
have<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.199> look<00:00:19.289> at<00:00:19.439> teaching<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.859> see<00:00:20.070> what<00:00:20.220> I

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
have a look at teaching and see what I

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.750 
have a look at teaching and see what I
could<00:00:20.400> offer<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:21.949> immediately<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.310> realized

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
could offer and immediately I realized

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.689 
could offer and immediately I realized
that<00:00:24.590> with<00:00:25.590> teaching<00:00:26.039> there's<00:00:26.220> not<00:00:26.340> one<00:00:26.519> day

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
that with teaching there's not one day

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.560 
that with teaching there's not one day
the<00:00:26.820> same<00:00:31.640> well<00:00:32.640> obviously<00:00:32.759> when<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.149> came<00:00:33.329> to

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
the same well obviously when I came to

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.209 
the same well obviously when I came to
apply<00:00:33.899> for<00:00:34.079> teach<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.710> saw<00:00:35.010> there<00:00:35.160> were

two<00:00:35.370> avenues<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.270> could<00:00:36.630> go<00:00:36.840> down<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.290> PGCE

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739

route into University which I applied

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.200 
route into University which I applied
for<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.770> was<00:00:40.860> lucky<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.190> obtain<00:00:42.180> a

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.359 
live and to be able to afford to be a
teacher<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.439> think<00:01:07.680> when<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.830> weighed<00:01:08.070> up<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
teacher so I think when I weighed up the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.010 
teacher so I think when I weighed up the
advantages<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:08.970> disadvantages<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.540> both<00:01:09.840> the

advantages and disadvantages of both the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.600 
advantages and disadvantages of both the
courses<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.439> realized<00:01:11.010> obviously<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.310> salary

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
courses I realized obviously the salary

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.850 
courses I realized obviously the salary
boot<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.030> me<00:01:12.210> was<00:01:12.810> more<00:01:12.930> beneficial<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.740> I

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
boot to me was more beneficial and I

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.560 
boot to me was more beneficial and I
feel<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.460> that's<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.880> right<00:01:15.060> choice<00:01:15.119> now

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
feel like that's the right choice now

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.260 
feel like that's the right choice now
because<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.020> feel<00:01:16.320> but<00:01:17.040> I'm<00:01:17.159> not<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.520> trainee<00:01:18.060> at
