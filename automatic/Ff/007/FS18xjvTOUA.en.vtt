straw you'll want to watch it because of

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.569 
straw you'll want to watch it because of
the<00:02:48.910> 3d<00:02:49.150> so<00:02:49.720> I<00:02:49.989> give<00:02:50.620> this<00:02:50.739> one<00:02:50.799> a<00:02:50.980> 5<00:02:51.310> out<00:02:51.459> of<00:02:51.519> 5

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
the 3d so I give this one a 5 out of 5

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.559 
the 3d so I give this one a 5 out of 5
for<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.180> 3d<00:02:53.549> it's<00:02:54.549> hard<00:02:54.849> to<00:02:55.060> rate<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.360> film

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
for the 3d it's hard to rate the film

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:56.910 
for the 3d it's hard to rate the film
because<00:02:55.870> I<00:02:55.959> was<00:02:56.049> enjoying<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:56.440> so<00:02:56.680> much

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
because I was enjoying it so much

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.520 
because I was enjoying it so much
because<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.430> 3d<00:02:57.730> if<00:02:58.660> I<00:02:58.780> watched<00:02:58.989> in<00:02:59.200> 2d<00:02:59.500> I

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
because the 3d if I watched in 2d I

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.050 
because the 3d if I watched in 2d I
don't<00:02:59.739> think<00:02:59.920> I<00:03:00.040> would<00:03:00.160> have<00:03:00.250> thought<00:03:00.400> as<00:03:00.670> much

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
don't think I would have thought as much

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.509 
don't think I would have thought as much
as<00:03:01.299> the<00:03:01.420> film<00:03:01.660> so<00:03:02.079> I<00:03:02.319> can't<00:03:03.069> really<00:03:03.160> rate<00:03:03.400> the

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
as the film so I can't really rate the

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.059 
as the film so I can't really rate the
film<00:03:03.730> but<00:03:04.000> as<00:03:04.239> for<00:03:04.540> 3d<00:03:04.810> goes<00:03:05.079> 5<00:03:05.590> out<00:03:05.769> of<00:03:05.799> 5

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
film but as for 3d goes 5 out of 5
