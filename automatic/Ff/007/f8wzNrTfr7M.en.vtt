00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
higher and there are power-ups which

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.970 
higher and there are power-ups which
gives<00:00:22.949> an<00:00:23.130> extra<00:00:23.519> gram<00:00:24.350> unlimited<00:00:25.350> jumps<00:00:25.740> and

gives an extra gram unlimited jumps and

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.060 
gives an extra gram unlimited jumps and
this<00:00:26.279> powerup<00:00:26.970> disables<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.990> four<00:00:28.260> speed<00:00:28.619> and

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
this powerup disables the four speed and

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
and have longer to jump higher and I got

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.520 
and have longer to jump higher and I got
it<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:10.140> tap<00:01:10.740> steps<00:01:11.340> cab<00:01:12.409> and<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.119> this

graphics<00:01:27.420> are<00:01:27.600> very<00:01:27.630> simple<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.880> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
graphics are very simple and the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.170 
graphics are very simple and the
character<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.420> running<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.259> its<00:01:31.470> own<00:01:31.710> and

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
character is running on its own and

therefore the only thing you do is do

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.399 
therefore the only thing you do is do
the<00:01:36.240> jumping<00:01:36.720> part<00:01:36.960> power<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.610> died<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:42.409> for

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
the jumping part power and I died so for

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.460 
the jumping part power and I died so for
one<00:01:43.619> more<00:01:43.740> time<00:01:43.979> now<00:01:44.790> we'll<00:01:44.970> play<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:46.140> very

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
levels so you get an impression of this

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.889 
levels so you get an impression of this
game<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:54.259> hope<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.590> will<00:01:55.799> be<00:01:55.829> able<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.460> clear<00:01:56.899> some

game I hope I will be able to clear some
of<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.259> levels

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
of the levels

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:14.140 
of the levels
let's<00:02:00.110> see<00:02:11.710> okay<00:02:12.710> and<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.220> have<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.520> focus<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:14.120> I

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
let's see okay and I have to focus so I

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.120 
let's see okay and I have to focus so I
can't<00:02:14.540> talk<00:02:14.780> too<00:02:14.990> much<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:17.620> this<00:02:18.620> was<00:02:18.920> the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
can't talk too much and this was the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.780 
can't talk too much and this was the
first<00:02:20.140> level<00:02:21.430> so<00:02:22.430> attempt<00:02:22.940> three<00:02:23.209> is<00:02:23.560> 34<00:02:24.790> jumps

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
first level so attempt three is 34 jumps

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.150 
first level so attempt three is 34 jumps
and<00:02:26.030> now<00:02:26.630> a<00:02:26.660> new<00:02:27.050> powerup<00:02:27.500> is<00:02:27.709> introduced

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
and now a new powerup is introduced

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.610 
and now a new powerup is introduced
Gibson<00:02:28.610> extra<00:02:29.090> grams<00:02:29.330> so<00:02:30.230> if<00:02:30.500> he<00:02:31.180> hit<00:02:32.180> this<00:02:33.050> you

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
Gibson extra grams so if he hit this you

unlimited jumps so now I can jump all

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.090 
unlimited jumps so now I can jump all
the<00:03:34.130> time<00:03:34.400> but<00:03:35.030> if<00:03:35.209> I<00:03:35.360> hit<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:36.440> bottom<00:03:36.829> here

the power Bob will be gone and we see

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.330 
the power Bob will be gone and we see
that<00:03:43.700> this<00:03:44.239> part<00:03:45.049> is<00:03:45.230> very<00:03:45.500> similar<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:48.160> a<00:03:49.160> game

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
that this part is very similar to a game

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.449 
that this part is very similar to a game
you<00:03:49.519> all<00:03:49.670> know<00:03:49.880> very<00:03:49.959> flappy<00:03:50.959> bird<00:03:51.170> here<00:03:51.650> with

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
you all know very flappy bird here with

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.130 
you all know very flappy bird here with
the<00:03:52.549> unlimited<00:03:52.850> jump<00:03:55.180> which<00:03:56.180> makes<00:03:56.570> the<00:03:56.900> game

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
the unlimited jump which makes the game

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.410 
the unlimited jump which makes the game
really<00:03:58.780> difficult<00:03:59.780> here

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
really difficult here

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.790 
really difficult here
I<00:04:03.120> had<00:04:04.120> to<00:04:04.240> make<00:04:04.390> a<00:04:04.420> cut<00:04:04.720> here<00:04:04.990> because<00:04:05.410> I<00:04:05.650> was

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
I had to make a cut here because I was

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.370 
I had to make a cut here because I was
dying<00:04:06.100> so<00:04:06.240> often<00:04:07.240> and<00:04:07.450> it's<00:04:07.600> really<00:04:07.840> hard<00:04:08.110> to

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
dying so often and it's really hard to

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.350 
dying so often and it's really hard to
talk<00:04:08.950> and<00:04:09.010> play<00:04:09.340> at<00:04:09.700> the<00:04:10.330> very<00:04:10.600> same<00:04:10.959> time<00:04:11.020> and

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
talk and play at the very same time and

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.380 
talk and play at the very same time and
I<00:04:13.360> really<00:04:14.200> like<00:04:14.380> this<00:04:14.590> game<00:04:14.800> because<00:04:15.250> it's

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
I really like this game because it's

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.229 
I really like this game because it's
simple<00:04:16.390> but<00:04:16.570> devilishly<00:04:17.200> hard<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.940> if<00:04:19.120> you're

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
simple but devilishly hard and if you're

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.750 
simple but devilishly hard and if you're
playing<00:04:19.419> this<00:04:19.570> game<00:04:19.780> maybe<00:04:20.019> you<00:04:20.169> can<00:04:20.320> tell<00:04:20.500> me

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
playing this game maybe you can tell me

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.100 
playing this game maybe you can tell me

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
where you are struggling to win and

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.140 
where you are struggling to win and

especially here in level number three in
this<00:04:28.300> part<00:04:28.600> where<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:28.930> spikes<00:04:29.230> are<00:04:29.500> up<00:04:29.710> and
