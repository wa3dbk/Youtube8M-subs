a<00:03:07.360> little<00:03:07.480> bit<00:03:07.810> fake<00:03:08.140> does<00:03:08.769> not<00:03:08.920> make<00:03:09.100> it<00:03:09.250> look

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
a little bit fake does not make it look

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.350 
a little bit fake does not make it look
or<00:03:10.000> feel<00:03:10.209> natural<00:03:10.810> so<00:03:11.530> medium<00:03:11.980> even<00:03:12.940> coverage

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360

on your face that has SPF the
ingredients<00:03:42.579> that<00:03:42.670> I<00:03:42.730> used<00:03:42.820> in<00:03:43.269> the<00:03:43.390> SPF<00:03:44.220> cause

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
ingredients that I used in the SPF cause

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.210 
ingredients that I used in the SPF cause
the<00:03:46.120> light<00:03:46.329> to<00:03:46.780> reflect<00:03:46.959> so<00:03:47.440> when<00:03:47.590> a<00:03:47.620> photo<00:03:47.920> or

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
the light to reflect so when a photo or

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.330 
the light to reflect so when a photo or

any thing is taken the light gets

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.550 
any thing is taken the light gets
deflected<00:03:51.640> hence<00:03:52.209> your<00:03:52.540> face<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.989> look<00:03:53.200> kind

appearance<00:03:56.220> people<00:03:57.220> always<00:03:57.579> presume<00:03:57.940> it's

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
appearance people always presume it's

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.860 
appearance people always presume it's
the<00:03:58.299> lighting

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
the lighting

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.280 
the lighting
but<00:03:59.489> the<00:04:00.489> SPF<00:04:01.000> is<00:04:01.329> one<00:04:01.690> of<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:01.840> main<00:04:01.989> causes

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
but the SPF is one of the main causes

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.720 
but the SPF is one of the main causes
for<00:04:02.470> your<00:04:02.980> face<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.220> look<00:04:03.400> like<00:04:03.549> that

actually use this so as you can see I

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.050 
actually use this so as you can see I
mix<00:05:30.020> it<00:05:30.200> along<00:05:30.530> with<00:05:30.740> this<00:05:30.919> motion<00:05:31.580> that<00:05:31.820> is
