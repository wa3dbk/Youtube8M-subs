hi last time we were dealing with self
pinholes<00:00:09.490> and<00:00:09.850> fitting<00:00:10.750> it<00:00:10.840> back<00:00:10.870> today<00:00:11.620> we're

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.070 
pinholes and fitting it back today we're

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.049 
pinholes and fitting it back today we're
tuning<00:00:12.309> up<00:00:12.460> some<00:00:12.670> brass<00:00:12.910> hinges<00:00:14.639> high<00:00:15.639> quality

tuning up some brass hinges high quality
hinges<00:00:16.660> are<00:00:17.110> great<00:00:17.619> but<00:00:17.950> they're<00:00:18.070> also

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
hinges are great but they're also

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.670 
hinges are great but they're also
expensive<00:00:18.760> if<00:00:19.600> your<00:00:19.750> budget<00:00:20.080> doesn't<00:00:20.260> stretch

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
expensive if your budget doesn't stretch

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.560 
expensive if your budget doesn't stretch
to<00:00:20.920> that<00:00:21.100> here's<00:00:21.760> an<00:00:21.940> idea

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
to that here's an idea

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.530 
to that here's an idea
that<00:00:22.960> will<00:00:23.080> give<00:00:23.260> you<00:00:23.380> just<00:00:23.650> as<00:00:23.770> good<00:00:23.920> a<00:00:23.980> finish

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540 
that will give you just as good a finish

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.080 
that will give you just as good a finish
these<00:00:25.540> mid-range<00:00:26.260> brass<00:00:26.920> knife<00:00:27.370> hinges<00:00:27.640> are

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
these mid-range brass knife hinges are

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.660 
these mid-range brass knife hinges are
one<00:00:28.750> fifth<00:00:29.170> the<00:00:29.290> price<00:00:29.620> of<00:00:29.890> the<00:00:30.100> Brousseau

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
one fifth the price of the Brousseau

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.500 
one fifth the price of the Brousseau
equivalents

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.180 

the<00:00:34.510> main<00:00:34.660> problem<00:00:35.080> with<00:00:35.260> this<00:00:35.380> set<00:00:35.650> of<00:00:35.800> hinges

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
the main problem with this set of hinges

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.880 
the main problem with this set of hinges
is<00:00:36.970> that<00:00:37.420> the<00:00:37.660> pivot<00:00:38.140> is<00:00:38.440> a<00:00:38.500> bit<00:00:38.740> loose<00:00:38.950> so<00:00:40.890> I

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
is that the pivot is a bit loose so I

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.540 
is that the pivot is a bit loose so I
tackle<00:00:42.430> that<00:00:42.630> by<00:00:43.950> adding<00:00:44.950> some<00:00:45.100> filler

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
tackle that by adding some filler

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.310 
tackle that by adding some filler
material

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.260 

first<00:00:48.980> we<00:00:49.160> clean<00:00:49.370> out<00:00:49.579> the<00:00:49.670> pivot<00:00:49.970> hole<00:00:50.120> with

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
first we clean out the pivot hole with

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:59.569 
first we clean out the pivot hole with
some<00:00:50.390> fine<00:00:50.660> sandpaper<00:00:54.130> then<00:00:55.130> we<00:00:55.280> heat<00:00:55.460> it<00:00:55.489> up

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.889 

and<00:01:00.030> then<00:01:00.210> lay<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.690> some<00:01:00.989> cold<00:01:01.320> solder<00:01:02.690> on<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
and then lay in some cold solder on the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:11.200 
and then lay in some cold solder on the
inside<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.500> pivot<00:01:04.800> hole

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.740 

once<00:01:12.210> that's<00:01:12.420> cooled<00:01:12.780> down<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.259> can<00:01:14.509> read<00:01:15.509> rill

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
once that's cooled down we can read rill

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.490 
once that's cooled down we can read rill
the<00:01:15.929> hole<00:01:16.520> with<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:18.179> correct<00:01:18.509> size<00:01:19.130> bit<00:01:21.500> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
the hole with the correct size bit the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.600 
the hole with the correct size bit the
pivot<00:01:22.829> pin<00:01:23.009> measures<00:01:23.969> six<00:01:24.420> point<00:01:24.719> three<00:01:24.899> three

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
pivot pin measures six point three three

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.800 
pivot pin measures six point three three
millimeters<00:01:26.869> so<00:01:27.869> if<00:01:28.649> I<00:01:28.950> drill<00:01:29.219> out<00:01:29.399> a<00:01:29.810> hole

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
millimeters so if I drill out a hole

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.649 
millimeters so if I drill out a hole
that<00:01:31.289> is<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.469> quarter<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:31.979> an<00:01:32.039> inch<00:01:32.359> six<00:01:33.359> point

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
that is a quarter of an inch six point

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.139 
that is a quarter of an inch six point
three<00:01:33.929> five<00:01:34.170> millimeters<00:01:34.859> we<00:01:35.759> should<00:01:35.969> have<00:01:36.119> a

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
three five millimeters we should have a

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:54.789 
three five millimeters we should have a
a<00:01:36.420> nice<00:01:36.899> snug<00:01:37.380> fit

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.630 

once<00:01:55.799> you've<00:01:56.009> achieved<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.579> nice<00:01:56.759> snug<00:01:57.659> fit

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
once you've achieved a nice snug fit

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:06.289 
once you've achieved a nice snug fit
remove<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.880> spacer<00:02:01.520> like<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:04.789> then<00:02:05.789> lock<00:02:06.060> it

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
remove the spacer like so then lock it

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.009 
remove the spacer like so then lock it
with<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.720> small<00:02:06.810> nut<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.439> bolt<00:02:08.420> and<00:02:09.420> then<00:02:09.840> what

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
with a small nut and bolt and then what

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.960 
with a small nut and bolt and then what
we<00:02:10.110> do<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.319> flush<00:02:10.830> these<00:02:11.130> edges<00:02:12.000> up<00:02:13.550> on<00:02:14.550> some

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
we do is flush these edges up on some

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.259 
we do is flush these edges up on some
sandpaper<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:16.069> some<00:02:17.069> wet<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.430> dry<00:02:17.610> paper<00:02:18.120> to

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
sandpaper and some wet and dry paper to

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.350 
sandpaper and some wet and dry paper to
polish<00:02:18.599> them<00:02:19.580> making<00:02:20.580> sure<00:02:20.760> we<00:02:21.000> keep<00:02:21.209> them

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
polish them making sure we keep them

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.339 
polish them making sure we keep them
parallel<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:23.700> once<00:02:23.910> that's<00:02:24.120> done<00:02:24.319> we<00:02:25.319> can

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
parallel and once that's done we can

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.580 
parallel and once that's done we can
create<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.040> nice<00:02:26.280> round<00:02:27.180> over<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.690> end<00:02:27.840> and

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
create a nice round over the end and

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.900 
create a nice round over the end and
polish<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:32.160> we<00:02:32.280> can<00:02:32.400> take<00:02:32.549> them<00:02:32.700> apart

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
polish that and we can take them apart

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:40.070 
polish that and we can take them apart
and<00:02:33.239> put<00:02:33.630> in<00:02:33.989> a<00:02:34.140> thinner<00:02:34.500> spacer<00:02:38.810> that's<00:02:39.810> one

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
and put in a thinner spacer that's one

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.220 
and put in a thinner spacer that's one
side<00:02:42.019> nice<00:02:43.019> and<00:02:43.260> flat<00:02:43.519> flush<00:02:44.519> surfaces<00:02:45.230> and

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
side nice and flat flush surfaces and

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.720 
side nice and flat flush surfaces and
now<00:02:46.319> we<00:02:46.380> can<00:02:46.560> turn<00:02:46.920> our<00:02:47.099> attention<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.640> the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
now we can turn our attention to the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.680 
now we can turn our attention to the
opposite<00:02:48.120> side<00:02:48.329> and<00:02:50.060> keeping<00:02:51.060> even<00:02:51.390> pressure

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
opposite side and keeping even pressure

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.630 
opposite side and keeping even pressure
along<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.170> length<00:02:52.349> we<00:02:53.160> should<00:02:53.370> be<00:02:53.459> able<00:02:53.519> to

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
along the length we should be able to

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.970 
along the length we should be able to
maintain<00:02:53.790> parallel<00:02:54.660> with<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:55.349> first<00:02:55.680> side

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.520 

we'll<00:03:01.980> just<00:03:02.190> bring<00:03:02.430> this<00:03:03.049> curve<00:03:04.049> at<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.380> end

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
we'll just bring this curve at the end

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.000 
we'll just bring this curve at the end
into<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.310> nice<00:03:05.549> smooth<00:03:06.420> curve<00:03:06.750> flowing<00:03:07.709> nicely

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
into a nice smooth curve flowing nicely

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:20.120 
into a nice smooth curve flowing nicely
into<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:08.700> straight<00:03:09.600> sections<00:03:10.170> just<00:03:18.829> how<00:03:19.829> long

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
into the straight sections just how long

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.949 
into the straight sections just how long
and<00:03:20.459> how<00:03:20.700> much<00:03:20.910> effort<00:03:21.299> you<00:03:21.329> have<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:21.569> put<00:03:21.690> in

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
and how much effort you have to put in

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.080 
and how much effort you have to put in
here<00:03:22.200> will<00:03:22.380> depend<00:03:22.980> on<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.489> quality<00:03:23.730> of<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
here will depend on the quality of the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.420 
here will depend on the quality of the
hinges<00:03:24.450> that<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.660> have<00:03:24.810> in<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.049> first<00:03:25.200> place

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.400 

once<00:03:29.430> we've<00:03:29.700> finished<00:03:30.299> polishing<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.200> main

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
once we've finished polishing the main

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
now I can now set about fitting them to

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.070 
now I can now set about fitting them to
the<00:04:04.850> cabinet<00:04:06.610> it's<00:04:07.610> worth<00:04:07.880> taking<00:04:08.690> a<00:04:08.900> little

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
the cabinet it's worth taking a little

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.020 
the cabinet it's worth taking a little
extra<00:04:09.350> effort<00:04:09.920> just<00:04:10.460> to<00:04:10.610> mark<00:04:12.760> on<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:13.880> back

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
extra effort just to mark on the back

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.970 
extra effort just to mark on the back
faces<00:04:14.660> of<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:14.900> hinges<00:04:15.320> a<00:04:16.120> number<00:04:17.120> or<00:04:17.360> a<00:04:17.390> letter

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
faces of the hinges a number or a letter

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.460 
faces of the hinges a number or a letter
so<00:04:18.980> we<00:04:19.100> can<00:04:19.250> identify<00:04:19.720> each<00:04:20.720> half<00:04:21.170> of<00:04:21.380> the

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
so we can identify each half of the

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.140 
so we can identify each half of the
hinge<00:04:23.770> because<00:04:24.770> although<00:04:24.920> there<00:04:25.430> probably

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
hinge because although there probably

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.930 
hinge because although there probably
interchangeable<00:04:27.110> they<00:04:27.290> won't<00:04:27.980> be<00:04:28.190> as<00:04:28.370> flush

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
interchangeable they won't be as flush

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.810 
interchangeable they won't be as flush
if<00:04:29.540> they<00:04:29.780> don't<00:04:29.960> get<00:04:30.110> put<00:04:30.320> together<00:04:30.520> in<00:04:31.520> the

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
if they don't get put together in the

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.020 
if they don't get put together in the
way<00:04:31.970> in<00:04:32.120> which<00:04:32.240> they<00:04:32.450> were<00:04:32.510> created<00:04:33.880> so<00:04:34.880> I've

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
way in which they were created so I've

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.610 
way in which they were created so I've
just<00:04:35.060> got<00:04:35.390> my<00:04:35.420> scribe<00:04:35.990> and<00:04:36.320> I'm<00:04:36.410> just

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
just got my scribe and I'm just

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:48.370 
just got my scribe and I'm just
numbering<00:04:38.290> each<00:04:39.290> side<00:04:46.840> join<00:04:47.840> me<00:04:47.990> next<00:04:48.170> time

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
numbering each side join me next time

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:58.930 
numbering each side join me next time
when<00:04:49.190> we<00:04:49.310> fit<00:04:49.490> them<00:04:49.640> to<00:04:49.730> the<00:04:49.850> cabinet
