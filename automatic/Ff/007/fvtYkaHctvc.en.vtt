00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
it's a lot of fun and I think when kids

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.389 
it's a lot of fun and I think when kids
come<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.600> see<00:00:54.809> artwork<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.890> sculpture<00:00:56.280> and

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
come and see artwork and sculpture and

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.410 
come and see artwork and sculpture and
models<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.820> things<00:00:56.910> like<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.360> are

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
models and things like that that are

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.549 
models and things like that that are
made<00:00:57.600> with<00:00:57.780> these<00:00:57.899> things<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.199> they<00:00:58.320> have<00:00:58.440> at

and I think that really makes me feel
good<00:01:16.650> about<00:01:16.770> what<00:01:16.890> I'm<00:01:17.070> doing<00:01:17.100> yeah<00:01:18.060> that's
