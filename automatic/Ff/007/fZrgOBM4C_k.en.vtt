it's a Russian company but it has the
same<00:04:07.549> rotating<00:04:08.549> fan<00:04:08.880> blades<00:04:09.470> so<00:04:11.510> this<00:04:12.510> is<00:04:12.780> a

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
same rotating fan blades so this is a

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.610 
same rotating fan blades so this is a
first<00:04:14.010> I<00:04:14.639> was<00:04:15.359> waiting<00:04:15.720> for<00:04:15.750> this<00:04:16.079> for<00:04:16.349> quite<00:04:16.590> a

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
first I was waiting for this for quite a

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.430 
first I was waiting for this for quite a
long<00:04:16.799> time<00:04:16.859> that<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.900> actual<00:04:21.109> fan<00:04:22.109> blades

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
long time that the actual fan blades

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.190 
long time that the actual fan blades
would<00:04:22.800> be<00:04:22.830> turning<00:04:23.510> it's<00:04:24.510> almost<00:04:24.750> impossible

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
would be turning it's almost impossible

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.700 
would be turning it's almost impossible
to<00:04:25.650> see<00:04:26.160> when<00:04:27.090> they're<00:04:27.270> inside<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:28.139> it's<00:04:28.470> hard

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
to see when they're inside and it's hard

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.939 
to see when they're inside and it's hard
to<00:04:28.889> appreciate<00:04:29.370> but<00:04:30.330> knowledge<00:04:31.139> of<00:04:31.410> the<00:04:31.560> fact

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
to appreciate but knowledge of the fact

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:37.850 
to appreciate but knowledge of the fact
that<00:04:32.820> they<00:04:33.060> are<00:04:33.710> gives<00:04:34.710> me<00:04:34.949> enough<00:04:36.830> there<00:04:37.830> are
