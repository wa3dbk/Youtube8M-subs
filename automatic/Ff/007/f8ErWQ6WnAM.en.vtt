then<00:00:07.010> having<00:00:07.220> some<00:00:07.370> funny<00:00:07.880> jittering<00:00:08.599> in<00:00:08.809> my

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
then having some funny jittering in my

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.879 
then having some funny jittering in my
tail<00:00:09.639> on<00:00:10.639> my<00:00:10.730> 130<00:00:11.150> X<00:00:11.389> I'm<00:00:12.379> just<00:00:12.440> trying<00:00:12.830> to

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889 
tail on my 130 X I'm just trying to

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.789 
tail on my 130 X I'm just trying to
determine<00:00:13.690> whether<00:00:14.690> maybe<00:00:15.019> my<00:00:15.230> board<00:00:15.589> is

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:15.799 
determine whether maybe my board is

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.540 
determine whether maybe my board is
sharp<00:00:16.430> or<00:00:16.840> if<00:00:17.840> it's<00:00:18.020> the<00:00:18.170> servo<00:00:18.650> so<00:00:19.100> I'm<00:00:19.250> going

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
sharp or if it's the servo so I'm going

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.260 
sharp or if it's the servo so I'm going
to<00:00:23.950> I'm<00:00:24.950> going<00:00:25.010> to<00:00:25.160> plug<00:00:25.700> it<00:00:25.820> in<00:00:25.880> a<00:00:26.000> couple

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
to I'm going to plug it in a couple

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:34.500 
to I'm going to plug it in a couple
times<00:00:29.140> this<00:00:30.140> with<00:00:30.350> the<00:00:31.989> the<00:00:32.989> d<00:00:33.140> s<00:00:33.260> 35<00:00:33.710> serve<00:00:33.950> all

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
times this with the the d s 35 serve all

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.729 
times this with the the d s 35 serve all
that<00:00:35.510> I<00:00:35.570> thought<00:00:35.749> was<00:00:35.899> maybe<00:00:36.410> something<00:00:36.620> on

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
that I thought was maybe something on

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.290 
that I thought was maybe something on
with<00:00:36.920> this<00:00:37.010> serve<00:00:37.370> all<00:00:38.140> okay<00:00:39.140> it's<00:00:39.260> plugged<00:00:39.499> in

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
with this serve all okay it's plugged in

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.989 
with this serve all okay it's plugged in
and<00:00:41.469> no<00:00:42.469> matter<00:00:42.499> how<00:00:42.800> I<00:00:42.829> sub<00:00:43.190> trim<00:00:43.429> it<00:00:43.579> it's<00:00:43.789> not

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:43.999 
and no matter how I sub trim it it's not

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:47.529 
and no matter how I sub trim it it's not
even<00:00:44.239> connected<00:00:44.420> to<00:00:44.899> the<00:00:46.030> anything<00:00:47.030> in<00:00:47.359> the

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
even connected to the anything in the

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:48.040 
even connected to the anything in the
back

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
back

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.819 
back
I<00:00:49.510> can<00:00:50.510> sub<00:00:50.749> trim<00:00:51.019> and<00:00:51.319> once<00:00:51.440> in<00:00:51.530> a<00:00:51.559> while<00:00:51.649> it'll

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
I can sub trim and once in a while it'll

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.189 
I can sub trim and once in a while it'll
stop<00:00:52.129> and<00:00:52.309> if<00:00:52.399> I<00:00:52.519> even<00:00:52.789> touch<00:00:53.659> that<00:00:53.690> little<00:00:54.050> rod

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
stop and if I even touch that little rod

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.099 
stop and if I even touch that little rod
it<00:00:54.379> just<00:00:54.530> goes<00:00:54.800> again

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109 
it just goes again

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:00.369 
it just goes again
so<00:00:58.120> typically<00:00:59.120> honored<00:00:59.390> I<00:00:59.690> would<00:01:00.079> think<00:01:00.199> maybe

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
so typically honored I would think maybe

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.560 
so typically honored I would think maybe
the<00:01:00.620> potentiometer<00:01:01.339> is<00:01:02.300> messed<00:01:02.629> up<00:01:03.850> so<00:01:04.850> I'm

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
the potentiometer is messed up so I'm

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.780 
the potentiometer is messed up so I'm
going<00:01:05.990> to<00:01:06.939> unplug<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.210> plug<00:01:08.270> back<00:01:08.420> in<00:01:09.790> there's

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
going to unplug and plug back in there's

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:19.230 
going to unplug and plug back in there's
a<00:01:10.880> stock<00:01:11.299> serve<00:01:11.659> off<00:01:14.320> okay<00:01:16.450> here<00:01:17.450> I<00:01:17.479> have<00:01:17.659> a

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
a stock serve off okay here I have a

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:38.050 
a stock serve off okay here I have a
stock<00:01:20.240> servo

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.090 

okay<00:01:39.060> well<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.140> can't<00:01:40.350> see<00:01:40.560> right<00:01:40.590> now<00:01:40.920> it's

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
okay well you can't see right now it's

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.460 
okay well you can't see right now it's
just<00:01:41.130> I'm<00:01:41.400> going<00:01:41.730> to<00:01:41.820> set<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> camera

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
just I'm going to set the camera

00:01:42.470 --> 00:02:11.350 
just I'm going to set the camera
plugging<00:01:43.470> back<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.860> with<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.190> stock<00:01:44.490> servo

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.640 

and<00:02:12.360> if<00:02:12.540> I'd<00:02:12.690> even<00:02:12.870> just<00:02:13.110> touch<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.440> rudder<00:02:13.590> a

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
and if I'd even just touch the rudder a

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.680 
and if I'd even just touch the rudder a
little<00:02:13.860> bit<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:15.000> doing<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.450> same<00:02:15.480> thing

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
little bit this is doing the same thing

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.380 
little bit this is doing the same thing
although<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:17.190> travel<00:02:17.610> isn't<00:02:17.790> seem<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.240> be<00:02:18.360> a

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
although the travel isn't seem to be a

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.350 
although the travel isn't seem to be a
small<00:02:18.660> spot<00:02:19.610> it's<00:02:20.610> really<00:02:20.910> doing<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.180> same

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
small spot it's really doing the same

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:32.120 
small spot it's really doing the same
thing<00:02:30.470> I'm<00:02:31.470> not<00:02:31.560> quite<00:02:31.860> sure

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
thing I'm not quite sure

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.910 
thing I'm not quite sure
right<00:02:32.660> of<00:02:33.660> course<00:02:33.930> now<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.170> I'm<00:02:34.380> doing<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.800> in

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
right of course now that I'm doing it in

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.340 
right of course now that I'm doing it in
on<00:02:35.310> video<00:02:35.700> it's<00:02:36.000> not<00:02:36.240> showing<00:02:36.690> up<00:02:36.870> this<00:02:39.350> time

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
on video it's not showing up this time

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:54.110 
on video it's not showing up this time
as<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.800> was<00:02:40.920> earlier<00:02:41.540> we're<00:02:42.540> gonna<00:02:42.660> go<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:53.120> just

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
as it was earlier we're gonna go I just

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.840 
as it was earlier we're gonna go I just
don't<00:02:54.750> know<00:02:54.930> if<00:02:54.960> it's<00:02:55.200> work<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:58.460> can<00:02:59.460> see<00:02:59.700> the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
don't know if it's work you can see the

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.670 
don't know if it's work you can see the
little<00:03:00.030> how<00:03:00.720> much<00:03:00.900> it's<00:03:01.080> actually<00:03:01.140> moving

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
little how much it's actually moving

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.860 
little how much it's actually moving
back<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.370> forth<00:03:02.580> by<00:03:02.820> that<00:03:04.040> it<00:03:05.040> just<00:03:05.220> will<00:03:05.400> not

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
back and forth by that it just will not

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.260 
back and forth by that it just will not
stop<00:03:06.870> Oh
