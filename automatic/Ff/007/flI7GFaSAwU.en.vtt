00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.150
 video 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.850
 Good people, we're going to need a 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.689
 white sheet pencil or pencil sharpener 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.619
 black red corrective pen one 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.860
 ruler a scissors glue and paper card 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.770
 yellow or cardboard keep running there 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.860
 on the blog to start reaching to catch 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.040
 our white sheet and our pencil 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.140
 let's measure five centimeters 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.409
 We are going to make a little square in the field. 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.250
 of the leaf it will be five centimeters 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.250
 on each side 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:08.500
 and it is good doing leaf singing because 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:11.720
 already helps us to make another square 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.060
 in doing another square leave now the 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.620
 side of it also containing five 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:22.120
 centimeters and now a square on top 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:26.120
 of the first square with the same size 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.150
 in a way it should look like this 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.250
 will divide in the middle of the two squares 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.569
 what did we do last? 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:41.680
 this way this part crossed out people 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.680
 will not use and now just cut 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.800
 This mount can do several 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:58.260
 different the way you like it 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.760
 more this to the mold 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.970
 Let's get the card stock or the 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.980
 cardboard and draw our mold is good 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.860
 always use the corner of the leaf because 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:20.310
 It makes it easier and become more cute 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:20.310
 so we'll cut too 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:30.510
 and it's this way we're going to double 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:36.000
 Our little ears in our paper 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:43.830
 into that shape so that it stays 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:47.940
 the space he and we are going to paste is to join 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:50.130
 the two two chickens is important not 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.860
 collar inside have to leave 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.280
 this empty space that we will 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:04:00.540
 I fit the book but I must do both 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:05.690
 pikachu's ears and also the lightning bolt 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.690
 What's his tail? 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:20.239
 there and let's remember are still there 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:24.200
 all trimmed and we'll put it in the 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:31.280
 our little bookmark reject cute little 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:33.610
 the way we want it to stay and it's 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.130
 just stick it the way you like it 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.990
 that already everything, this one that gave 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.030
 The way it goes though, we'll go 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.450
 to draw 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.750
 Let's make the details of pikachu as 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:51.940
 black ears 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.940
 we will use permanent marker 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.729
 so let's paint from black at the tip 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:03.729
 from abin 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:16.629
 that way we will not make the line 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.629
 little and the little mouth 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.300
 With the red pen, we'll do it. 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.430
 his red little pets 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.920
 and to finish we'll get the 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.610
 no matter what the white and 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:46.020
 will make the ball of the bus became a 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.020
 super cute detail 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:59.970
 and this is the result I hope you 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:03.660
 have liked guys and so put 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:06.000

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.210
 take a leaf to the leaf that people 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.090

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.350
