00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
know even though biological VAR I

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.260 
know even though biological VAR I
computer<00:02:39.410> via<00:02:39.620> are<00:02:39.980> not<00:02:40.160> exactly<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.970> same

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
computer via are not exactly the same

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.650 
computer via are not exactly the same
thing<00:02:41.600> even<00:02:42.020> though<00:02:42.230> it<00:02:42.440> was<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:43.190> know<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.820> myth

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
thing even though it was you know a myth

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.920 
thing even though it was you know a myth
spread<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.500> lot<00:02:45.680> by<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.220> children<00:02:46.930> television

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
spread a lot by the children television

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.380 
spread a lot by the children television
show<00:02:48.170> reboot<00:02:48.709> which<00:02:48.980> I<00:02:49.340> watched<00:02:50.000> quite

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
show reboot which I watched quite

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.500 
show reboot which I watched quite
religiously<00:02:51.170> as<00:02:51.350> a<00:02:51.380> child<00:02:51.709> I<00:02:51.980> must<00:02:52.220> say<00:02:52.510> okay

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
religiously as a child I must say okay

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.210 
religiously as a child I must say okay
so<00:02:53.570> I<00:02:53.780> guess<00:02:53.900> now<00:02:54.200> its<00:02:54.380> phase<00:02:54.709> two<00:02:55.040> of<00:02:55.070> the

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
so I guess now its phase two of the

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.690 
so I guess now its phase two of the
viral<00:02:55.790> infection<00:02:57.100> when<00:02:58.100> it<00:02:58.190> will<00:02:58.310> get<00:02:58.459> some

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
viral infection when it will get some

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.990 
viral infection when it will get some
swap<00:02:59.030> files<00:02:59.560> okay<00:03:00.560> that's<00:03:00.800> bouncing<00:03:01.459> petrol

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
swap files okay that's bouncing petrol

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.720 
swap files okay that's bouncing petrol
the<00:03:02.600> most<00:03:02.840> dangerous<00:03:03.350> of<00:03:03.620> all<00:03:03.769> viruses<00:03:04.130> so

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
the most dangerous of all viruses so

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.240 
the most dangerous of all viruses so
dangerous<00:03:05.330> basically<00:03:05.989> destroys<00:03:06.380> himself<00:03:06.620> but

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
dangerous basically destroys himself but

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.790 
dangerous basically destroys himself but
gotta<00:03:07.940> watch<00:03:08.150> out<00:03:08.390> for<00:03:08.420> petrol<00:03:08.959> so<00:03:09.470> now<00:03:09.590> we're

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
gotta watch out for petrol so now we're

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.860 
gotta watch out for petrol so now we're
gonna<00:03:09.920> go<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.310> get<00:03:10.430> Rodriguez<00:03:10.970> I<00:03:11.180> guess<00:03:11.360> wat

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
gonna go and get Rodriguez I guess wat

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.720 
gonna go and get Rodriguez I guess wat
is<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.260> fastest<00:03:12.860> of<00:03:13.070> the<00:03:13.100> bunch<00:03:13.459> you<00:03:13.700> know

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
is the fastest of the bunch you know

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.120 
is the fastest of the bunch you know
when<00:03:14.060> well<00:03:14.300> he's<00:03:14.630> finally<00:03:15.290> back<00:03:15.530> to<00:03:15.739> kick<00:03:15.920> some

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
when well he's finally back to kick some

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.090 
when well he's finally back to kick some
shell<00:03:16.160> so<00:03:16.700> watch<00:03:16.880> out<00:03:17.090> just<00:03:17.840> knows<00:03:18.380> a<00:03:18.410> lot<00:03:18.680> fast

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
shell so watch out just knows a lot fast

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.220 
shell so watch out just knows a lot fast
and<00:03:19.489> he<00:03:19.670> dies<00:03:19.910> basically<00:03:20.660> that's<00:03:20.870> that's<00:03:21.110> his

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
and he dies basically that's that's his

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.620 
and he dies basically that's that's his
power<00:03:21.440> his<00:03:22.040> power<00:03:22.370> is<00:03:22.549> quite<00:03:22.970> fatal<00:03:23.239> to

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
power his power is quite fatal to

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.870 
power his power is quite fatal to
himself<00:03:24.049> and<00:03:24.260> all<00:03:24.350> his<00:03:24.470> loved<00:03:24.739> ones<00:03:24.980> which<00:03:25.670> why

was emanated by the sensible processing
unit<00:03:29.510> I<00:03:29.750> guess<00:03:30.230> this<00:03:30.950> is<00:03:31.130> an<00:03:31.280> odd<00:03:31.700> it's<00:03:32.390> the

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
unit I guess this is an odd it's the

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.750
