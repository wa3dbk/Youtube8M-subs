00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:18.980
 We will explain how to set up a camper rector tarp 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.970
 Please check the parts first 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.480
 Main pole 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.900
 Side pole 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.710
 rope 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.710
 And pegs 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:39.770
 The pole is assembled at the height you want to use at this point 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.770
 Move the stopper of the rope a little 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:50.890
 Then it takes to install Lecta Carp 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:56.579
 First expand the tarp body to the place where it will be installed in half 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.579
 Position the main pole of Japan at the center position of the tarp 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.219
 Peg down the quote peg to a 45 degree open position 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.440
 The other side will peg down as well 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:20.550
 The pole in the center of the main rope is temporarily hooked on the pole 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:27.030
 Multiply both ends to just typed's peg 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:31.010
 Remove the rope from the pole once and insert the triangle ring of the lecta tarp into the ball 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:37.540
 I 'll put the rope on it again 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:43.960
 Two people start pole slowly at the same time while confirming safety 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:47.710
 Please let independence to adjust the pension with a stopper Once you get up 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:51.340
 Next, I will set up the side pole of the four corners 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:56.300
 The tip of the side pole is at the corner of the tarp 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:59.990
 Insert into the eyelet and hang the rope from above 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:08.140
 Eg down while pulling on the rope 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:08.140
 The peg down position is between 45 and 90 degrees to the center line of the tarp 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.450
 Peg down the remaining corners as well 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:22.440
 One of the bifurcated ropes is the main peg 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:26.550
 Or put on either side peg 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:33.240
 Align all the balls vertically 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:35.600
 You can put the tarp beautifully by adjusting the knot of the rope while watching the whole at the end 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.600
 I can do it 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.409
 You can change the height by changing the main pole combination 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.530
 An optional pole can be added to the central part 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.079
