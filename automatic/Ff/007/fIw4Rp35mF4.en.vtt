00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.720 
so I had a lovely daughter Eagles cotton
I<00:00:43.469> think<00:00:43.739> those<00:00:43.859> two<00:00:43.890> thousand<00:00:44.280> eight<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.519> but

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
I think those two thousand eight to but

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.189 
I think those two thousand eight to but
he<00:00:44.789> didn't<00:00:45.059> really<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.629> end<00:00:45.690> get<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.019> do

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
he didn't really in the end get to do

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.380 
he didn't really in the end get to do
the<00:00:46.350> dressage<00:00:46.710> he<00:00:47.249> was<00:00:47.370> injured<00:00:47.699> before<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
the dressage he was injured before the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.970 
the dressage he was injured before the
dressage<00:00:48.690> hacking<00:00:49.140> up<00:00:49.319> to<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.649> dressage

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980
