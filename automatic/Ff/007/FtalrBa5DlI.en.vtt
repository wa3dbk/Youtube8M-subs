00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
we'd have really good defensive but I

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.679

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
Madrid for that season which for me

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.550 
Madrid for that season which for me
seems<00:02:59.000> quite<00:02:59.240> odd<00:02:59.420> but<00:02:59.990> obviously<00:03:00.260> he<00:03:00.350> moved

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
seems quite odd but obviously he moved

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.810 
seems quite odd but obviously he moved
back<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:00.920> left<00:03:01.130> wing<00:03:01.310> back<00:03:01.520> which<00:03:01.700> was

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
back to the left wing back which was

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.970 
back to the left wing back which was
quite<00:03:02.030> a<00:03:02.350> traditional<00:03:03.350> Brazilian<00:03:03.500> role

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
quite a traditional Brazilian role

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.790 
quite a traditional Brazilian role
really<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:04.460> then<00:03:05.020> he's<00:03:06.020> kind<00:03:06.260> of<00:03:06.350> established

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
really and then he's kind of established

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.920 
really and then he's kind of established
himself<00:03:06.980> as<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.340> left<00:03:07.610> back<00:03:07.790> at<00:03:08.030> Real<00:03:08.630> Madrid

at all now and if Marcel has been really
consistent<00:03:12.800> I'm<00:03:13.130> really<00:03:13.340> solid<00:03:13.670> this<00:03:13.760> year<00:03:14.000> I

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
consistent I'm really solid this year I

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.850 
consistent I'm really solid this year I
figured<00:03:14.750> 'super<00:03:14.870> season<00:03:15.200> call<00:03:15.350> to<00:03:15.440> be<00:03:15.530> really

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
figured 'super season call to be really

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.110 
figured 'super season call to be really
good<00:03:15.890> it'll<00:03:16.340> be<00:03:16.430> one<00:03:16.580> of<00:03:16.640> those<00:03:16.730> good<00:03:16.910> players

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
good it'll be one of those good players

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.310 
good it'll be one of those good players
that<00:03:17.330> if<00:03:17.420> you're<00:03:17.540> actually<00:03:17.630> used<00:03:18.050> it<00:03:18.170> like<00:03:18.260> a

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
that if you're actually used it like a

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.840 
that if you're actually used it like a
five<00:03:18.560> of<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.740> back<00:03:18.860> would<00:03:19.190> be<00:03:19.220> genuinely

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
five of the back would be genuinely

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.090 
five of the back would be genuinely
solid<00:03:20.209> next<00:03:21.080> up<00:03:21.200> we<00:03:21.290> have<00:03:21.320> like<00:03:21.530> four<00:03:21.800> players

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
solid next up we have like four players

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.830 
solid next up we have like four players
that<00:03:22.430> I<00:03:22.459> think<00:03:22.820> they<00:03:22.910> were<00:03:23.000> all<00:03:23.180> new<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.690> this

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
that I think they were all new to this

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.170 
that I think they were all new to this
FIFA<00:03:24.290> so<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:25.280> just<00:03:25.490> put<00:03:25.550> them<00:03:25.790> in<00:03:25.880> there<00:03:26.030> one<00:03:26.150> on

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
FIFA so I just put them in there one on

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.310 
FIFA so I just put them in there one on
their<00:03:26.420> own<00:03:26.510> I<00:03:26.660> just<00:03:27.020> thought<00:03:27.110> I'd<00:03:27.230> be

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
their own I just thought I'd be

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.630 
their own I just thought I'd be
interesting<00:03:27.770> stuff<00:03:27.950> for<00:03:28.070> these<00:03:28.220> guys<00:03:28.370> all

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
interesting stuff for these guys all

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.250 
interesting stuff for these guys all
look<00:03:28.730> really<00:03:28.940> solid<00:03:29.330> and<00:03:29.690> I<00:03:29.720> just<00:03:29.930> kind<00:03:30.170> of

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
look really solid and I just kind of

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.900 
look really solid and I just kind of
wanted<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.680> just<00:03:31.040> to<00:03:31.190> talk<00:03:31.370> about<00:03:31.520> their<00:03:31.760> team

wanted to just to talk about their team
of<00:03:32.030> seasoned<00:03:32.240> cards<00:03:32.510> i<00:03:32.570> think<00:03:32.750> that<00:03:32.870> enter<00:03:33.200> is

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
of seasoned cards i think that enter is

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.080 
of seasoned cards i think that enter is
going<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:33.620> be<00:03:33.709> incredible<00:03:34.010> without<00:03:34.700> pace<00:03:34.910> in

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
going to be incredible without pace in

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.610 
going to be incredible without pace in
the<00:03:35.120> dribbling<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.840> list<00:03:36.020> so<00:03:36.170> it's<00:03:36.350> just<00:03:36.470> a

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
the dribbling to list so it's just a

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.110 
the dribbling to list so it's just a
kind<00:03:36.770> of<00:03:36.920> unique<00:03:37.190> one<00:03:37.400> I<00:03:37.430> think<00:03:37.670> again<00:03:38.000> it'll

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
kind of unique one I think again it'll

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.880 
kind of unique one I think again it'll
be<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:38.270> really<00:03:38.540> solid<00:03:38.750> bronze<00:03:39.080> enough<00:03:39.650> solid

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
be a really solid bronze enough solid

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.650 
be a really solid bronze enough solid
pace<00:03:40.220> his<00:03:40.459> physical<00:03:40.910> will<00:03:41.000> be<00:03:41.090> good<00:03:41.270> and<00:03:41.600> I

pace his physical will be good and I

well-rounded<00:03:43.340> card<00:03:43.850> denio<00:03:44.420> it<00:03:44.600> looks

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
well-rounded card denio it looks

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.630 
well-rounded card denio it looks
ridiculous<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:45.380> same<00:03:45.560> with<00:03:45.709> Gaia<00:03:45.890> I<00:03:46.160> think<00:03:46.550> if

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
ridiculous the same with Gaia I think if

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.280 
ridiculous the same with Gaia I think if
you<00:03:46.760> put<00:03:46.940> space<00:03:47.270> above<00:03:47.480> 85<00:03:47.750> who<00:03:48.050> will<00:03:48.170> be

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
you put space above 85 who will be

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.620 
you put space above 85 who will be
absolutely<00:03:49.040> outstanding<00:03:49.330> next<00:03:50.330> up<00:03:50.480> we<00:03:50.600> have

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
absolutely outstanding next up we have

submits<00:03:51.230> another<00:03:51.739> one<00:03:51.890> I<00:03:51.920> kind<00:03:52.520> of<00:03:52.610> like<00:03:52.790> when

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
submits another one I kind of like when

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.850 
submits another one I kind of like when
they<00:03:53.120> change<00:03:53.450> positions<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.050> stuff<00:03:54.140> I<00:03:54.440> think

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
they change positions and stuff I think

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.710 
they change positions and stuff I think
this<00:03:54.920> guy<00:03:55.130> is<00:03:55.160> going<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.489> be<00:03:55.610> a<00:03:55.640> right<00:03:56.090> winger

this guy is going to be a right winger

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.360
