00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
wash away so I figured I'd give it a

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.830 
wash away so I figured I'd give it a
shot<00:00:10.260> just<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.759> warn<00:00:12.030> you<00:00:12.179> now<00:00:12.330> I'm<00:00:12.630> not<00:00:12.660> a

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
shot just to warn you now I'm not a

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.620 
shot just to warn you now I'm not a
great<00:00:13.200> teacher<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:14.150> we'll<00:00:15.150> see<00:00:15.330> how<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.480> goes

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
great teacher so we'll see how it goes

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.029 
great teacher so we'll see how it goes
but<00:00:16.640> give<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.760> try<00:00:17.970> anyway<00:00:18.650> so<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> chords

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
but give it a try anyway so the chords

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.920 
but give it a try anyway so the chords
for<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.220> main<00:00:20.609> part<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.029> song<00:00:21.210> are

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
for the main part of the song are

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.189 
for the main part of the song are
basically<00:00:22.410> C<00:00:23.359> and<00:00:24.470> G<00:00:25.470> F<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.910> then<00:00:27.630> back<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.019> C

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
basically C and G F and then back to C

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.589 
basically C and G F and then back to C
again<00:00:28.730> as<00:00:29.730> far<00:00:29.939> as<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.150> strumming<00:00:30.570> pattern

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
again as far as the strumming pattern

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.780 
again as far as the strumming pattern
goes<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.500> basically<00:00:31.710> just<00:00:32.040> hit<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> root

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
goes so you basically just hit the root

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.760 
goes so you basically just hit the root
notes<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.300> then<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.930> quick<00:00:34.170> down<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.500> up

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
notes and then it's a quick down and up

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.700 
notes and then it's a quick down and up
a<00:00:35.040> little<00:00:35.700> pause<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.300> then<00:00:36.510> down<00:00:36.690> again<00:00:36.840> so

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
a little pause and then down again so

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:52.580 
a little pause and then down again so
something<00:00:38.010> like<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:50.449> basically<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:52.289> then

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
something like this basically and then

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:00.529 
something like this basically and then
with<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.890> lyrics<00:00:53.219> should<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:59.359> they're<00:01:00.359> gonna

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
with the lyrics should be they're gonna

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:08.750 
with the lyrics should be they're gonna
wash<00:01:01.050> away<00:01:05.270> something<00:01:06.270> like<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:07.890> then

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
wash away something like that and then

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.910 
wash away something like that and then
when<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:08.939> get<00:01:09.090> into<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.360> bridge<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.650> course

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
when you get into the bridge the course

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.440 
when you get into the bridge the course
changed<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.880> D<00:01:12.180> minor<00:01:12.450> C<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.619> G<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:15.240> with<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
changed to D minor C and G but with the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:29.440 
changed to D minor C and G but with the
same<00:01:15.689> strumming<00:01:16.110> pattern<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:17.159> it'd<00:01:17.280> be

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.120 

something<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.170> then<00:01:31.470> when<00:01:32.009> you

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
something like that and then when you

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.429 
something like that and then when you
get<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.000> end<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> bridge<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:34.020> throw

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
get to the end of the bridge you throw

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:47.270 
get to the end of the bridge you throw
an<00:01:34.530> F<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.920> there<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:44.340> live<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> G<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:47.100> then

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
an F in there and live to a G and then

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.289 
an F in there and live to a G and then
just<00:01:47.460> start<00:01:47.700> over

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.330 

or<00:01:51.299> whatever<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.500> words<00:01:52.710> are<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.950> don't<00:01:53.070> really

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
or whatever the words are I don't really

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.469 
or whatever the words are I don't really
remember<00:01:53.670> anymore

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
remember anymore

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.350 
remember anymore
um<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.649> that's<00:01:56.399> basically<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:57.060> it's<00:01:57.240> nothing

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
um so that's basically it it's nothing

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.270 
um so that's basically it it's nothing
complicated<00:01:59.149> hopefully<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.329> helps<00:02:00.950> if<00:02:01.950> it

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
complicated hopefully that helps if it

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.969 
complicated hopefully that helps if it
