00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
many applications but you can you can

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.770 
many applications but you can you can
choose<00:00:40.500> what<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.649> want<00:00:41.329> so<00:00:42.329> for<00:00:42.510> me<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.719> was

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
double speed and after she surfaces and

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.619 
double speed and after she surfaces and
you<00:00:46.829> passed<00:00:47.070> around<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:48.090> can<00:00:48.239> move<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.480> with

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
you passed around you can move in with

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.610 
you passed around you can move in with
alpha<00:00:48.930> strike<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.910> just<00:00:50.910> continue<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.620> alpha

strike once marlies down she's going to

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.610 
strike once marlies down she's going to
flip<00:00:56.670> into<00:00:57.620> tiptoe<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.059> your<00:01:00.320> strike<00:01:01.320> should

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
flip into tiptoe and your strike should

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.529 
flip into tiptoe and your strike should
be<00:01:01.739> back<00:01:01.920> up<00:01:01.949> with<00:01:02.579> another<00:01:02.820> natural<00:01:03.090> strike

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539

the high teens if not into the 20s
darkness<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.409> going<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.710> affect<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.100> little<00:02:02.369> bit

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
darkness is going to affect a little bit

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.440 
darkness is going to affect a little bit
of<00:02:02.610> our<00:02:03.590> damage<00:02:04.590> until<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.640> wears<00:02:05.850> off<00:02:06.090> like<00:02:06.329> it

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
of our damage until it wears off like it

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.900 
of our damage until it wears off like it
just<00:02:06.659> did<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.110> we<00:02:07.740> hear<00:02:08.099> what<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.520> want<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.759> do

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
just did so we hear what you want to do

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.589 
just did so we hear what you want to do
is<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.300> want<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.509> time<00:02:09.810> your<00:02:10.319> deflection<00:02:10.920> uh

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
is you want to time your deflection uh

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.350 
is you want to time your deflection uh
once<00:02:12.599> there<00:02:12.930> is

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
once there is

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.270 
once there is
one<00:02:13.570> round<00:02:13.840> left<00:02:14.050> on<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:14.620> whirlpool<00:02:14.920> in<00:02:15.190> that

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
one round left on that whirlpool in that

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.590 
one round left on that whirlpool in that
geyser<00:02:15.490> you<00:02:15.730> want<00:02:15.880> to<00:02:15.940> pop<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.240> flexion

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
geyser you want to pop the flexion

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.290 
geyser you want to pop the flexion
that's<00:02:17.230> going<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.770> not<00:02:17.980> only<00:02:18.190> negate<00:02:18.700> all<00:02:18.970> the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
that's going to not only negate all the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.600 
that's going to not only negate all the
damage<00:02:19.630> and<00:02:19.750> be<00:02:19.870> coming<00:02:20.170> in<00:02:20.320> from<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.280> tidal

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
damage and be coming in from the tidal

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.250 
damage and be coming in from the tidal
wave<00:02:21.760> but<00:02:22.120> it's<00:02:22.240> also<00:02:22.420> going<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.780> completely

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
wave but it's also going to completely

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.900 
wave but it's also going to completely
negate<00:02:23.680> any<00:02:23.860> damage<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.370> would<00:02:24.490> have<00:02:24.580> happened

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
negate any damage it would have happened

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.200 
negate any damage it would have happened
from<00:02:25.060> either<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.660> geyser<00:02:26.230> or<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.730> whirlpool

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
from either the geyser or the whirlpool

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.480 
from either the geyser or the whirlpool
so<00:02:28.420> just<00:02:28.600> completely<00:02:29.110> sidestep<00:02:29.920> it<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:32.490> from

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
so just completely sidestep it and from

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.520 
so just completely sidestep it and from
here<00:02:33.760> there's<00:02:34.000> not<00:02:34.210> really<00:02:34.480> much<00:02:34.810> left<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.290> do

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
here there's not really much left to do

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.640 
here there's not really much left to do
other<00:02:36.220> than<00:02:36.490> continuing<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.300> cycle<00:02:37.570> so<00:02:38.080> just

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
other than continuing the cycle so just

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.620 
other than continuing the cycle so just
continue<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.580> spam<00:02:39.850> crush<00:02:40.150> again<00:02:40.450> a<00:02:40.480> little

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
continue to spam crush again a little

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.540 
continue to spam crush again a little
bit<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:40.870> life<00:02:41.020> with<00:02:41.320> that<00:02:41.530> humanoid<00:02:41.950> ability

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
bit of life with that humanoid ability

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.940 
bit of life with that humanoid ability
and<00:02:42.730> if<00:02:43.600> you<00:02:43.780> have<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.350> there's<00:02:44.740> going<00:02:44.800> to<00:02:44.920> come

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
and if you have to there's going to come

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.410 
and if you have to there's going to come
a<00:02:45.100> time<00:02:45.250> where<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.520> timers<00:02:45.850> don't<00:02:46.180> line<00:02:46.390> up

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
a time where the timers don't line up

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.070 
a time where the timers don't line up
where<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:48.790> whirlpools<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:49.540> go<00:02:49.660> off<00:02:49.780> first

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
where the whirlpools and I go off first

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.680 
where the whirlpools and I go off first
before<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.620> geyser<00:02:50.800> so<00:02:51.790> if<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.090> have<00:02:52.300> to<00:02:52.540> if

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
before the geyser so if you have to if

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.630 
before the geyser so if you have to if
it<00:02:52.780> just<00:02:52.959> runs<00:02:53.170> all<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.410> way<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.830> end<00:02:53.980> make

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
it just runs all the way to the end make

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.490 
it just runs all the way to the end make
sure<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:54.910> you<00:02:54.970> keep<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.300> deflection<00:02:55.870> for

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
sure that you keep the deflection for

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.800 
sure that you keep the deflection for
the<00:02:56.620> geysers<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.190> guys<00:02:57.340> are<00:02:57.520> stuns<00:02:57.850> whereas

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
the geysers the guys are stuns whereas

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.390 
the geysers the guys are stuns whereas
the<00:02:58.959> whirlpool<00:02:59.380> just<00:02:59.680> locks<00:02:59.860> you<00:03:00.010> in<00:03:00.160> place
