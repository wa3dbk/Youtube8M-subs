00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.170
 good kids very good everyone here 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.769
 we are with the third and the last 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:11.259
 gameplay of battlefield 4 that I recorded in 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.179
 the e3 the truth that as you know many 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.280
 of you then better by twitter or what 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.680
 I commented on some video I had thought 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.210
 do a mini assembly with the example that 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.000
 I got out of there when we were half an hour 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.010
 and well I do not know how I had some 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.080
 pretty cool shots some plays 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.530
 pretty cool and because all two 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.530
 top 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.570
 It's not a big deal, but you know that 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.640
 besides playing me I started and 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.860
 here I am not a great pc player 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.570
 Well, I had not played, we were never there 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.450
 playing standing 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.710
 It will be an authentic madness and often 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.720
 mind that many books also 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.350
 recorded so I've decided then to 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.809
 end do not do anything either had great 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.000
 thing to record but still I think 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.020
 that my mola me well enough salt 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.970
 first I kill you I know that they are 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.769
 firing down from behind I turned around 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.019
 in half turn I see that it comes to me and 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.570
 I pay attention, it's going slow 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.729
 nothing happens now we continue and blow the 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.950
 tank that was firing me before 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.630
 so I do not know to me what we see when 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.550
 it's over there you motivate yourself just because 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.130
 besides you are playing we are playing 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.590
 then everyone in computers 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.840
 one next to the other land style and the 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.649
 truth that enough is judged 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.970
 as much as what you are going to see right now 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.160
 the play you are going to see now I 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.539
 I was in the elevator with willy it will not be 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.899
 a willy and alexis made a mistake and 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.280
 we were in this building only 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.740
 have a rise here you see they were 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.450
 waiting for everyone to leave here 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.970
 inside I say we hope you do not leave 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.679
 I'm going to throw c4, so a lot and 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.020
 I do not know how many I loaded but let's go I know 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.880
 that cleaned all the way I killed 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.310
 one with the gun and then we 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.869
 they killed me but this map is 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.570
 quite curious since in addition to that 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.700
 you can see how you interact here with 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.100
 the map very much he was that has 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.439
 to climb the elevators you can go down 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.179
 and uploading barriers within the map is not 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.030
 what the cool and the game and you 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:06.340
 interact with what you can do then 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.190
 of several possibilities this has 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.019
 taught simply so you can see that 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.420
 where I give the button in order to other 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.099
 not authentic for triple case 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.099
 I try to get with the shotgun 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.870
 rambo but failure of the attempt of the 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.790
 resoundingly and the position is 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.410
 saying then just the next 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.760
 death that caught on it and with technicians it 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.830
 they are going to shit all these who are here 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.150
 I'm going to inflate them with bullets and that's what 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.959
 what I tried to do not until I saw 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.220
 I was obviously blown up by helicopter 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.019
 simply because more than one started to 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.160
 shoot a little more here that I was 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.650
 going crazy I was hitting on 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.510
 everyone and they killed me I do not know how not but 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.549
 good kids what I said wanted to bring you 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.410
 this last complete of battlefield 4 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.579
 this Friday today they gave and accounts in 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.840
 Blood was shooting at my 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.630
 team and I like to shoot like a 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.670
 crazy 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.700
 one last the graphics are not noticed 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.090
 as much as the previous battle row 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.470
 3 but it had a lot mola 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.420
 been finishing a game less than 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.460
 15 minutes and diego I'm going to throw myself to see 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.930
 if fall building but did not fall the only thing 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.550
 that gave time is to fall and that 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.720
 they will kill me did not give time to anything else 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.770
 so city ​​to kids just 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.750
 tell you what you will have in the description 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.060
 the two other examples that I raised from the 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.330
 34 I hope that I have dwelled just like you 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.040
 it has improved me I hope that the 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.030
 game and be able to upload the gameplays that 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.440
 We have uploaded some few debates 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.270
