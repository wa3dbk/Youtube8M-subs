long time so I got the shade 218 rose

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:02.300 
long time so I got the shade 218 rose
elixir<00:04:00.659> I<00:04:00.930> might<00:04:01.650> be<00:04:01.739> butchering<00:04:02.129> that<00:04:02.190> name

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
elixir I might be butchering that name

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.699 
elixir I might be butchering that name
but<00:04:02.730> that's<00:04:03.180> how<00:04:03.540> I<00:04:03.569> think<00:04:03.780> it<00:04:04.169> is<00:04:04.349> pronounced

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709

packaging on this and there wasn't a

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.020 
packaging on this and there wasn't a
good<00:04:10.680> color<00:04:11.040> range<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.370> choose<00:04:11.579> from<00:04:11.819> because

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
good color range to choose from because

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.610

the<00:04:36.639> m.i.c<00:04:37.090> one<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:37.449> this<00:04:37.570> is<00:04:37.840> in<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.080> shade

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
the m.i.c one and this is in the shade

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.950 
the m.i.c one and this is in the shade
golden<00:04:38.650> tan<00:04:39.100> and<00:04:39.790> this<00:04:40.330> was<00:04:40.540> only<00:04:40.690> three

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960
