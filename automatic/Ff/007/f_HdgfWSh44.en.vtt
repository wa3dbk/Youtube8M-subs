00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
will have to tap on the apply button and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.930 
will have to tap on the apply button and
respring<00:00:55.140> your<00:00:55.800> device<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.370> order<00:00:56.670> for<00:00:56.879> that

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
respring your device in order for that

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.090 
respring your device in order for that
to<00:00:57.000> take<00:00:57.120> effect<00:00:57.570> now<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.020> position<00:00:58.320> right

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
to take effect now the position right

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.920 
to take effect now the position right
here<00:00:59.309> takes<00:00:59.550> effect<00:00:59.879> immediately<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.840> you

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
here takes effect immediately so you

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.270 
here takes effect immediately so you
won't<00:01:01.140> have<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.289> respring<00:01:01.710> for<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.070> so

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
won't have to respring for that so

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.219 
won't have to respring for that so
that's<00:01:02.370> pretty<00:01:02.609> nice<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.809> kind<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
that's pretty nice but this is kind of a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.810 
that's pretty nice but this is kind of a
tweak<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.710> stays<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.129> your<00:01:05.250> lock<00:01:05.400> screen<00:01:05.430> you
