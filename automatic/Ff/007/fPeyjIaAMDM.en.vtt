okay so here's an actual pace a down
here<00:01:42.409> I'll<00:01:43.409> quickly<00:01:43.619> go<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.189> specs<00:01:44.579> but<00:01:44.790> I'll

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
here I'll quickly go the specs but I'll

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.660 
here I'll quickly go the specs but I'll
leave<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.210> full<00:01:45.420> list<00:01:45.689> in<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.140> description

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
so I've got a and FX 8120 the a core

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.810 
so I've got a and FX 8120 the a core
overclocked<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.420> 4.0<00:01:52.280> will<00:01:53.280> be<00:01:53.399> going<00:01:53.610> further
