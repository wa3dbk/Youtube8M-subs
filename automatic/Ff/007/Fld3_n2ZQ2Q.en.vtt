00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.250
 for www base colombia point with we are 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.689
 here between the match between the team 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.520
 north and the continual brand team 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.890
 these are the two teams that will be 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.460
 representing their respective 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.310
 departments in national games 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.860
 they really are teams that until the 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.750
 At the moment they are very weak with respect to 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.750
 the others think what 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.850
 the antioquia teams to exhaust the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.399
 valley team are a little more 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.530
 competitive they have a little more detail 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.140
 these teams really see each other for 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:54.019
 national games such as within the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.019
 average where they could not be 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:01.489
 participating to get medals 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:05.090
 of gold and matter of missing atoms 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.660
 still some months for what 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.660
 keep preparing 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.670
 north that especially will be the 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.220
 host there in the city ​​of cúcuta in 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.440
 the month of November of national games 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.680
 the number 14 a player of the most 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.440
 expected from north the number 10 also 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.100
 was the field pitcher but in that 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.100
 moment fails 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.590
 first encourages us to 2,600 on the level 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.840
 of the sea removing knowledge 50 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.730
 sea ​​level we arrived said the first 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.400
 party let's contrast now when the 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.020
 physical remains we did but in 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.210
 the height and the same cold that there is in 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.220
 this collision undermines the physical capacity 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.520
 are not athletes the other is that the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.900
 players who did not change 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.180
 would have a function to study very 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.660
 fearful there is some respect for 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:04.170
 antioquia that we have tried to overcome 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:07.560
 but happy we have done all the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.230
 first times two first times and 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.500
 good half against cundinamarca two and 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.450
 three and a quarter with work we go in 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.640
 rise if that just looked at it and 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.650
 that we give with the critics of the 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.150
 basketball that you target a team that 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.530
 she has very good players she plays very 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.870
 well the brand plays very well at 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.400
 perimeter has triple players but 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.380
 sometimes I do not know sometimes like that one 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.580
 puzzled with some of some 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.200
 moments according to the times of the 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.239
 table matches 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.580
 in the lack of concentration and in mother 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.760
 the majority of players that we have had 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.760
 tournaments 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.470
 let's talk about psychological capacity very 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.549
 low emotionality this we have to 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.549
 work in the volitional part 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.750
 we are here in the match between little 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.190
 for national back team against 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.150
 goal governing team in this 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.280
 moment is gaining goal 27 23 pause 1 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.000
 minute 7 carlos to finish the 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.000
 second quarter 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.810
 this one has suddenly sung badly yesterday 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.180
 went to a match 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.610
 in our time against the selected 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.130
 from cundinamarca see today we see it a little 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.360
 and did not physically see qualities of the goal 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.200
 they are winning the game at this moment 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.150
 27 23 missing one minute 38 seconds 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.670
 so that the game that is being 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.239
 developing within the framework of the championship 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.370
 national 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.810
 interligas sub-20 female that is being 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.730
 developing here in the coliseum the 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.090
 nitrate make the launch of the girl 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.090
 of the goal 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.490
 very important that I do it very well 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.490
 convert 28 23 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.190
 second release 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.670
 it does not make it look 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:06.049
 we always emphasize here the 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.049
 Player number 4 of Bogota 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.930
 is the launch of triples fails 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:19.430
 nor what to do a pressure 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.790
 completely converts 28 25 in this 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.790
 moment 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.360
 for triple as Colombia pointed 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.400
 with we are with several gutierre birds 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.669
 player outstanding today in the match 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.870
 between bogotá and the valley team 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.610
 definitely there are games that 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.840
 games that played valley and that 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.000
 missing also that is the group of 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.970
 Bogota a team match really very 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.740
 defensive do us the favor do us a 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.569
 summary of what really happened in that 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.879
 good match this game was something very 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:50.680
 even where everything and then we have a good 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:52.720
 level I think about that party what is 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.099
 he highlighted was the defense both teams 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.139
 the defense of karate get ahead and 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:59.409
 fight thanks to god write down the 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.180
 things at the end then with the weeds of 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:03.810
 all of our female cousins ​​in the 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.810
 specialties
