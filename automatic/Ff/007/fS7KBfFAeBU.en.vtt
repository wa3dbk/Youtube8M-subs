00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
of days also continues and then it will

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.929 
of days also continues and then it will
probably<00:01:03.960> take<00:01:04.110> around<00:01:04.470> 16<00:01:05.100> days<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.549> upgrades

considering<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.380> their<00:01:55.740> parting<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.790> that

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
considering that their parting is that

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.990 
considering that their parting is that
much<00:01:57.570> more<00:01:58.290> improved<00:01:58.799> there<00:01:59.340> wasn't<00:01:59.759> really<00:01:59.850> a

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
much more improved there wasn't really a

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.149 
much more improved there wasn't really a
proper<00:02:00.540> specialty<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.259> unit<00:02:01.530> apart<00:02:01.920> from

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
proper specialty to the unit apart from

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.039 
proper specialty to the unit apart from
just<00:02:02.790> their<00:02:02.939> splash<00:02:03.240> damage<00:02:03.450> which<00:02:03.840> was

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
just their splash damage which was

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.600 
just their splash damage which was
pretty<00:02:04.320> pointless<00:02:04.740> if<00:02:04.950> we<00:02:05.040> could<00:02:05.189> only<00:02:05.250> attack

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
pretty pointless if we could only attack

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.119 
pretty pointless if we could only attack
one<00:02:05.820> building<00:02:06.149> at<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> time<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:06.780> now<00:02:07.259> I'd<00:02:08.009> be

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
one building at a time so now I'd be

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.740

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
going to be quite a little while though

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.760

you once you final most units in they'll
be<00:02:31.800> pretty<00:02:32.340> much<00:02:32.550> gone<00:02:32.730> within<00:02:32.940> those<00:02:33.180> first

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
be pretty much gone within those first

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.350 
be pretty much gone within those first
30<00:02:33.960> so<00:02:34.230> seconds<00:02:34.710> but<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.370> massive<00:02:35.790> change<00:02:36.060> is

changes attack strategy especially with

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.240 
changes attack strategy especially with
things<00:06:58.210> like<00:06:58.380> watching<00:06:59.380> so<00:06:59.710> now<00:06:59.860> all<00:06:59.890> your

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 
troops will go ahead and target one wall

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.960 
troops will go ahead and target one wall
instead<00:07:02.830> of<00:07:02.980> just<00:07:03.190> your<00:07:03.340> arches<00:07:03.670> just

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
instead of just your arches just

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.060 
instead of just your arches just
shooting<00:07:04.270> randomly<00:07:04.630> at<00:07:04.900> one<00:07:05.350> will<00:07:05.560> each<00:07:05.800> which

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.070 
shooting randomly at one will each which

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.500 
shooting randomly at one will each which
is<00:07:06.220> kind<00:07:06.460> of<00:07:06.550> annoying<00:07:06.730> especially<00:07:07.150> when

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:07.510 
is kind of annoying especially when

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.330 
is kind of annoying especially when
you're<00:07:07.630> watching<00:07:07.780> but<00:07:08.200> every<00:07:08.830> interesting<00:07:09.250> to

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.340 
you're watching but every interesting to

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.950 
you're watching but every interesting to
see<00:07:09.460> how<00:07:09.580> that<00:07:09.790> will<00:07:09.910> change<00:07:10.180> and<00:07:10.450> now<00:07:10.660> hog

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 
see how that will change and now hog

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.680 
see how that will change and now hog
riders<00:07:11.320> take<00:07:11.830> increased<00:07:12.370> damage<00:07:12.640> from<00:07:13.120> giant

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:13.690 
riders take increased damage from giant

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.290 
riders take increased damage from giant
bombs<00:07:13.930> so<00:07:14.260> the<00:07:14.650> hog<00:07:14.800> riders<00:07:15.220> definitely<00:07:16.030> might

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:16.300 
bombs so the hog riders definitely might

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.450 
bombs so the hog riders definitely might
not<00:07:16.480> be<00:07:16.600> as<00:07:16.720> available<00:07:17.140> as<00:07:17.170> they<00:07:18.040> used<00:07:18.310> to<00:07:18.400> be

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:18.460 
not be as available as they used to be

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.000 
not be as available as they used to be
anymore<00:07:19.020> so<00:07:20.020> the<00:07:20.110> clan<00:07:20.290> wars<00:07:20.470> have<00:07:20.590> also<00:07:20.830> had<00:07:20.950> a

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.010 
anymore so the clan wars have also had a

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.290 
anymore so the clan wars have also had a
bit<00:07:21.190> of<00:07:21.220> an<00:07:21.370> upgrade<00:07:21.550> where<00:07:21.940> we<00:07:22.000> can<00:07:22.120> watch

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:22.300
