 explain with your words good the 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:43.629
 graphic novel for me because it has 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:47.199
 many definitions is a comic book let's say 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:49.390
 in that way but extensive and with a 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.010
 better finished the best technique a 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.640
 story a little more developed than 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.649
 entertaining and good this is the first 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.839

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.700

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.950

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.680
 world and she has an obsession with other 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.280
 creature that is the successor of his kingdom 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.530
 then they have a problem and between 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.090
 them and the whole story is about how 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.670
 it's like a cat and mouse game 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.790
 they start as a chase between 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.440
 them through different parts of the 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.200
 history of eras of history since 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.810
 1800 until 2014 and my beginning and end 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.880
 or see us in a part as this book is 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.670
 autoconclusivo consists of eight chapters 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.190
 and here begins here ends is the only 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.110
 I'm going to leave the mobile and then 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.110

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:54.190

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.140
 claudia made between my friend and I 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.770
 nap life 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.790
 is that you do not greet me and the army 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:07.140

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.140
 rayista not with the letters 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.170
 among them I wrote the story the 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.320
 first part is drawn by me the 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.480
 second part by claudia but it's the 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.209
 same is the mind the book so that what 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.830
 can you see that we are here if I like it 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.709
 your art is sometimes half bizarre but 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.480
 I liked if in fact it is technical 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.370
 is a little more worked we last 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.170

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.390
 comic deadline with which we have to 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.820
 take it out immediately but it's going to 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.000
 like it a lot because it has the space 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.540
 it has double pages the chapters 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.220
 they have pretty typography and we have the 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.200
 characters that come out in each chapter 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.150
 they really are interesting the mab and it's 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.020
 pretty scary it becomes a 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.180
