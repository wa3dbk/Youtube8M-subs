00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
this from from the a-50 unboxing from

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.120 
this from from the a-50 unboxing from
like<00:04:05.510> last<00:04:05.840> year<00:04:06.260> or<00:04:06.380> even<00:04:06.500> two<00:04:06.650> years<00:04:06.980> before

that but basically if I can figure out
how<00:04:09.590> this<00:04:09.739> thing<00:04:09.799> goes<00:04:10.750> that<00:04:11.750> goes<00:04:12.140> in<00:04:12.320> like

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
how this thing goes that goes in like

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.229 
how this thing goes that goes in like
that<00:04:12.500> I<00:04:13.010> didn't<00:04:13.549> quite<00:04:13.670> snap<00:04:14.000> it<00:04:14.120> in<00:04:14.209> place

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
that I didn't quite snap it in place

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.360 
that I didn't quite snap it in place
these<00:04:15.170> things<00:04:15.410> are<00:04:15.530> built<00:04:15.739> really<00:04:15.950> well<00:04:16.070> so

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
these things are built really well so

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.039 
these things are built really well so
you<00:04:16.459> really<00:04:16.700> have<00:04:16.789> to<00:04:16.850> snap<00:04:17.120> it<00:04:17.269> in<00:04:17.390> and<00:04:17.539> then

the eight fifties they come with a
built-in<00:04:38.279> stand<00:04:38.580> so<00:04:39.120> this<00:04:39.270> is<00:04:39.360> just<00:04:39.419> going<00:04:39.599> to

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:39.659 
built-in stand so this is just going to

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:41.510 
built-in stand so this is just going to
be<00:04:39.749> sitting<00:04:40.050> here<00:04:40.289> and<00:04:40.469> then<00:04:41.189> like<00:04:41.340> I<00:04:41.490> said

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
be sitting here and then like I said

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.790 
be sitting here and then like I said
we'll<00:04:42.060> take<00:04:42.449> the<00:04:42.509> the<00:04:42.990> little<00:04:43.199> headset<00:04:43.560> thing

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
we'll take the the little headset thing

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.159 
we'll take the the little headset thing
this<00:04:44.039> is<00:04:44.279> for<00:04:44.639> your<00:04:45.240> controller<00:04:45.779> that<00:04:45.960> plugs

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
this is for your controller that plugs

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:46.999 
this is for your controller that plugs
in<00:04:46.289> your<00:04:46.409> controller

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
in your controller

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:48.739 
in your controller
so<00:04:47.370> basically<00:04:47.729> when<00:04:47.999> you're<00:04:48.120> wanting<00:04:48.389> to<00:04:48.509> play

00:04:48.739 --> 00:04:48.749 
so basically when you're wanting to play

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:51.409 
so basically when you're wanting to play
you<00:04:49.439> plug<00:04:49.710> this<00:04:50.009> into<00:04:50.310> the<00:04:50.639> headset<00:04:51.060> right

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
you plug this into the headset right

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:52.790 
you plug this into the headset right
there<00:04:51.599> so<00:04:51.719> it<00:04:51.779> could<00:04:51.840> be<00:04:51.900> one<00:04:52.259> cord<00:04:52.560> coming

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
there so it could be one cord coming

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.489 
there so it could be one cord coming
down<00:04:53.069> that<00:04:53.699> goes<00:04:53.909> to<00:04:54.150> your<00:04:54.240> controller<00:04:54.810> which

00:04:55.489 --> 00:04:55.499 
down that goes to your controller which

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:57.920 
down that goes to your controller which
is<00:04:55.620> over<00:04:55.860> here<00:04:56.000> it<00:04:57.000> plugs<00:04:57.300> in<00:04:57.449> your<00:04:57.479> controller

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
is over here it plugs in your controller

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.189 
is over here it plugs in your controller
just<00:04:58.319> like<00:04:58.620> that<00:04:59.550> and<00:05:00.000> boom<00:05:00.810> you're<00:05:01.020> good<00:05:01.139> to

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
just like that and boom you're good to

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.629 
just like that and boom you're good to
go<00:05:01.259> so<00:05:01.560> basically<00:05:01.680> these<00:05:02.129> are<00:05:02.310> connected

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
go so basically these are connected

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.189 
go so basically these are connected
together<00:05:02.729> but<00:05:03.090> that's<00:05:03.240> the<00:05:03.479> only<00:05:03.750> wire<00:05:03.960> like

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
together but that's the only wire like

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.749 
together but that's the only wire like
you<00:05:04.319> can<00:05:04.469> get<00:05:04.620> up<00:05:04.740> and<00:05:04.860> go<00:05:05.009> walk<00:05:05.219> around<00:05:05.250> and<00:05:05.699> go

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 
you can get up and go walk around and go

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.399 
you can get up and go walk around and go
to<00:05:05.819> the<00:05:05.909> bathroom<00:05:06.270> and<00:05:06.360> stuff<00:05:06.539> you<00:05:06.750> don't<00:05:06.990> have

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:07.409

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:08.779 
to the bathroom and stuff you don't have
to<00:05:07.560> completely<00:05:07.889> unhook<00:05:08.189> yourself<00:05:08.279> which<00:05:08.699> is

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
to completely unhook yourself which is

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:10.580 
to completely unhook yourself which is
kind<00:05:08.969> of<00:05:09.000> nice<00:05:09.120> so<00:05:09.389> oh<00:05:09.659> yeah<00:05:09.960> that's<00:05:10.319> the<00:05:10.560> other

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
kind of nice so oh yeah that's the other

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.339 
kind of nice so oh yeah that's the other

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
basic gist of the Astro 850 s you know

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:15.320 
basic gist of the Astro 850 s you know
that<00:05:13.500> they<00:05:13.620> are<00:05:13.740> 100%<00:05:14.340> Wireless<00:05:15.089> like<00:05:15.240> I

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
that they are 100% Wireless like I

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.640 
that they are 100% Wireless like I
always<00:05:15.629> get<00:05:15.870> that<00:05:15.990> question<00:05:16.050> they're<00:05:16.469> not

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
always get that question they're not

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.499 
always get that question they're not
100%<00:05:17.009> Wireless<00:05:17.490> there<00:05:17.639> is<00:05:17.789> this<00:05:17.969> one<00:05:18.210> cord

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
100% Wireless there is this one cord

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:20.540 
100% Wireless there is this one cord
that<00:05:18.960> goes<00:05:19.139> from<00:05:19.379> your<00:05:19.529> headset<00:05:19.949> to<00:05:20.430> the

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
that goes from your headset to the

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.079 
that goes from your headset to the
controller

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:21.089 
controller

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:23.929 
controller
but<00:05:21.689> that's<00:05:22.199> better<00:05:22.560> than<00:05:22.919> might<00:05:23.099> be<00:05:23.129> the<00:05:23.520> 840

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:23.939 
but that's better than might be the 840

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:26.360 
but that's better than might be the 840
pro<00:05:24.089> Z<00:05:24.330> you<00:05:24.389> guys<00:05:24.509> saw<00:05:24.719> in<00:05:24.810> the<00:05:24.900> other<00:05:24.990> video<00:05:25.370> do

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
you have a cord going from your headset

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.329 
you have a cord going from your headset
to<00:05:28.020> the<00:05:28.110> mix<00:05:28.349> amp<00:05:28.589> which<00:05:28.770> is<00:05:28.889> on<00:05:28.979> your<00:05:29.099> desk

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:29.339 
to the mix amp which is on your desk

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:31.040 
to the mix amp which is on your desk
which<00:05:29.520> has<00:05:29.639> a<00:05:29.669> cord<00:05:30.240> going<00:05:30.419> from<00:05:30.659> it<00:05:30.810> to<00:05:30.960> your

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
which has a cord going from it to your

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.929 
which has a cord going from it to your
console<00:05:31.500> and<00:05:31.710> then<00:05:32.039> another<00:05:32.250> cord<00:05:32.580> going<00:05:32.759> from

00:05:32.929 --> 00:05:32.939 
console and then another cord going from

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:34.519 
console and then another cord going from
it<00:05:33.060> to<00:05:33.150> your<00:05:33.240> console<00:05:33.599> and<00:05:33.839> the<00:05:34.139> cord<00:05:34.379> going

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:35.969 
from it to your controller so that's

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:38.869 
from it to your controller so that's
