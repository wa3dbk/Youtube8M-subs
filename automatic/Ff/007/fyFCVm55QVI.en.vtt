00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.880 
slow rate of fire for an assault rifle
but<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.390> really<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> fantastic<00:00:49.079> long-range

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
but it really is a fantastic long-range

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.369 
but it really is a fantastic long-range
weapon<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:51.149> has<00:00:51.270> an<00:00:51.420> extremely<00:00:51.750> manageable

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
weapon it has an extremely manageable

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.380

recoil<00:00:52.800> even<00:00:53.250> with<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> heavy<00:00:53.699> barrel<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.180> and

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
recoil even with the heavy barrel on and

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.540 
recoil even with the heavy barrel on and
spread<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.780> also<00:00:55.110> very<00:00:55.260> contained<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:56.280> fact

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
spread is also very contained in fact

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.400

after<00:00:56.850> using<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.360> gun<00:00:57.539> for<00:00:57.750> an<00:00:57.840> hour<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.199> it

after using this gun for an hour to it
is<00:00:58.500> one<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.649> my<00:00:58.800> most<00:00:58.920> accurate<00:00:59.399> weapons<00:01:00.109> using

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
is one of my most accurate weapons using

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.540 
is one of my most accurate weapons using
all<00:01:01.230> these<00:01:01.379> strengths<00:01:01.770> your<00:01:01.920> advantage<00:01:02.340> will

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
all these strengths your advantage will

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.979 
all these strengths your advantage will
allow<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.910> line<00:01:03.180> your<00:01:03.359> shots<00:01:03.629> up<00:01:03.809> quickly

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
allow you to line your shots up quickly

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.660 
allow you to line your shots up quickly
and<00:01:04.140> take<00:01:04.439> out<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.619> target<00:01:05.040> within<00:01:05.220> just<00:01:05.519> a

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
and take out the target within just a

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.719 
and take out the target within just a
few<00:01:05.700> shots<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:07.590> reload<00:01:07.920> time<00:01:07.950> also<00:01:08.369> feels

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
few shots the reload time also feels

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.359 
few shots the reload time also feels
very<00:01:09.060> short<00:01:09.360> even<00:01:09.689> with<00:01:09.810> an<00:01:09.930> empty<00:01:10.110> clip

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
very short even with an empty clip

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.980 
very short even with an empty clip
obviously<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> reload<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.939> no<00:01:12.090> m16<00:01:12.689> but<00:01:12.930> you

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
obviously the reload is no m16 but you

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.090 
obviously the reload is no m16 but you
won't<00:01:13.110> catch<00:01:13.290> yourself<00:01:13.470> spending<00:01:13.860> eight

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
won't catch yourself spending eight

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.859 
won't catch yourself spending eight
minutes<00:01:14.400> reload<00:01:14.760> like<00:01:15.000> with<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.210> AK<00:01:15.360> or<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
minutes reload like with the AK or the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.410 
minutes reload like with the AK or the
famas<00:01:16.250> for<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.340> majority<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.850> my<00:01:18.000> playtime

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
famas for the majority of my playtime

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.030 
famas for the majority of my playtime

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
with it I ran heavy barrel and red dot

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.830 
with it I ran heavy barrel and red dot
sight<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.759> really<00:01:20.970> didn't<00:01:21.270> need<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.450> for<00:01:21.630> grip

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
sight it really didn't need to for grip

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.990 
sight it really didn't need to for grip
his<00:01:22.290> weapon<00:01:22.650> also<00:01:22.950> did<00:01:23.130> surprisingly<00:01:23.460> well<00:01:23.670> in

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
his weapon also did surprisingly well in

his weapon also did surprisingly well in
close<00:01:24.150> quarters<00:01:24.600> as<00:01:24.780> long<00:01:25.290> as<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.500> check<00:01:25.680> my

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
close quarters as long as I check my

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.230 
close quarters as long as I check my
corners<00:01:26.159> i<00:01:26.280> could<00:01:26.430> easily<00:01:26.580> hit<00:01:26.850> fire<00:01:27.060> from

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
corners i could easily hit fire from

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.020 
corners i could easily hit fire from
even<00:01:27.630> if<00:01:27.720> i<00:01:27.780> didn't<00:01:28.020> get<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.229> first<00:01:28.409> shot<00:01:28.700> so<00:01:29.700> i

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
even if i didn't get the first shot so i

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.690 
even if i didn't get the first shot so i
did<00:01:30.479> lose<00:01:30.689> out<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> lot<00:01:31.290> high<00:01:31.740> RPM<00:01:32.159> weapons<00:01:32.520> and

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
did lose out a lot high RPM weapons and

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.310 
did lose out a lot high RPM weapons and
i<00:01:32.759> wouldn't<00:01:32.970> particularly<00:01:33.360> recommend<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.170> for

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
i wouldn't particularly recommend it for

i wouldn't particularly recommend it for
game<00:01:34.530> modes<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:34.920> Team<00:01:35.430> Deathmatch<00:01:35.610> and

game modes like Team Deathmatch and

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.280 
game modes like Team Deathmatch and
possibly<00:01:36.329> not<00:01:36.540> even<00:01:36.570> for<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.900> close<00:01:37.049> quarters

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
weapon from being a free shot kill and

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.309 
weapon from being a free shot kill and
we<00:02:38.940> give<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.209> a<00:02:39.299> greater<00:02:39.540> purpose<00:02:39.810> over<00:02:40.200> the

we give it a greater purpose over the

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.350 
we give it a greater purpose over the
other<00:02:40.470> guys<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:40.950> just<00:02:41.610> isn't<00:02:41.790> accurate<00:02:42.060> to

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
other guys that just isn't accurate to

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.819 
other guys that just isn't accurate to
the<00:02:42.390> actual<00:02:42.750> gun<00:02:43.019> though<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.470> I'm<00:02:43.530> sure<00:02:43.709> if

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
the actual gun though and I'm sure if

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.289 
the actual gun though and I'm sure if
dice<00:02:44.040> did<00:02:44.340> do<00:02:44.519> that<00:02:44.549> it<00:02:44.910> would<00:02:45.000> unbalance

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
dice did do that it would unbalance

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.590 
dice did do that it would unbalance
again<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:47.340> in<00:02:47.519> conclusion<00:02:47.549> i<00:02:48.239> give<00:02:48.480> this

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
again so in conclusion i give this

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.830 
again so in conclusion i give this
weapon<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:49.049> 4.5<00:02:50.010> out<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.489> 5<00:02:50.790> with<00:02:51.600> a<00:02:51.630> high

accuracy<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.620> low<00:02:52.829> spread<00:02:53.190> it's<00:02:53.459> incredibly

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
accuracy and low spread it's incredibly

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.629 
accuracy and low spread it's incredibly
easy<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.480> take<00:02:54.660> out<00:02:54.810> different<00:02:55.200> targets<00:02:55.639> it

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
easy to take out different targets it

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.610 
easy to take out different targets it
