with another tutorial and today we're
gonna<00:00:05.850> be<00:00:05.970> doing<00:00:06.120> part<00:00:06.330> three<00:00:06.810> of<00:00:06.839> our<00:00:07.080> game

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
gonna be doing part three of our game

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.440 
gonna be doing part three of our game
development<00:00:07.649> tutorials<00:00:07.790> so<00:00:08.790> what<00:00:09.360> we're

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
development tutorials so what we're

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.089 
development tutorials so what we're
going<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.599> be<00:00:09.690> doing<00:00:09.840> this<00:00:09.929> time<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.410> creating

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
going to be doing this time is creating

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.039 
going to be doing this time is creating
cast<00:00:11.639> spawn<00:00:12.059> objects<00:00:12.599> so<00:00:12.690> it's<00:00:12.809> going<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:12.960> be

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
cast spawn objects so it's going to be

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.950 
cast spawn objects so it's going to be
creating<00:00:13.500> cars<00:00:13.950> on<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.820> entrances<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.480> the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
creating cars on the entrances to the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.170 
creating cars on the entrances to the
scene<00:00:16.199> all<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:17.010> these<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.670> first<00:00:17.940> thing<00:00:18.029> we're

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
scene all of these so first thing we're

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.240 
scene all of these so first thing we're
going<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.359> do<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.660> create<00:00:18.930> an<00:00:19.260> empty<00:00:19.740> objects

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
going to do is create an empty objects

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.560 
going to do is create an empty objects
which<00:00:20.400> would<00:00:20.490> be<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.699> one<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.210> if<00:00:21.420> we

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
which would be this one so if we

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.120 
which would be this one so if we
double-click<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:22.080> our<00:00:22.199> floor<00:00:22.529> just<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:22.980> get

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
double-click on our floor just so we get

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.560 
double-click on our floor just so we get
to<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.310> center<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.850> scene<00:00:24.060> again<00:00:24.210> like<00:00:24.480> we

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
to the center of the scene again like we

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.800 
to the center of the scene again like we
did<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:24.930> part<00:00:24.990> 1<00:00:25.800> we<00:00:26.039> can<00:00:26.699> then<00:00:26.939> create<00:00:27.570> an

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
did in part 1 we can then create an

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.359 
did in part 1 we can then create an
empty<00:00:28.080> objects<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.740> we've<00:00:28.830> got<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.130> there

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
empty objects and we've got that there

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.220 
empty objects and we've got that there
then<00:00:29.820> what<00:00:29.970> I've<00:00:30.029> done<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.330> create<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> created

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
then what I've done is create a created

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.410 
then what I've done is create a created
a<00:00:31.320> cube<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.859> then<00:00:32.130> add<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.700> added<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.239> as<00:00:33.390> a

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
a cube and then add it to added it as a

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.260 
a cube and then add it to added it as a
child<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.559> car<00:00:35.040> spawns<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.880> created

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
child to the car spawns that I created

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.389 
child to the car spawns that I created
just<00:00:36.390> now<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.899> then<00:00:37.290> I've<00:00:37.410> also<00:00:37.500> called<00:00:38.280> this

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
just now and then I've also called this

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.340 
just now and then I've also called this
one<00:00:38.579> cast<00:00:38.910> spawn<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.629> one's<00:00:39.809> spawning

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
one cast spawn so this one's spawning

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.040 
one cast spawn so this one's spawning
the<00:00:40.530> cars<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.040> then<00:00:41.550> I've<00:00:41.670> set<00:00:41.879> its<00:00:42.059> scale<00:00:42.420> to

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
the cars and then I've set its scale to

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.330 
the cars and then I've set its scale to
not<00:00:43.410> point<00:00:43.620> 8<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:44.250> not<00:00:44.850> 0.5<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.840> 1.5<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.739> those

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
not point 8 it not 0.5 and 1.5 and those

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.190 
not point 8 it not 0.5 and 1.5 and those
are<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.910> gets<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.600> kind<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.930> size

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
are just so it gets to this kind of size

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.600 
are just so it gets to this kind of size
because<00:00:49.590> what<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:49.800> need<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.039> do<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.250> not<00:00:50.460> be

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
because what we need to do is not be

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.610 
because what we need to do is not be
spawning<00:00:50.850> cars<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.420> top<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.780> other<00:00:51.930> cars<00:00:52.260> if

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
spawning cars on top of other cars if

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.410 
spawning cars on top of other cars if
there's<00:00:52.800> one<00:00:52.980> in<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.250> kind<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.579> area<00:00:53.820> I've

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
there's one in this kind of area I've

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.760 
there's one in this kind of area I've
also<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:54.899> turned<00:00:55.350> off<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.559> mesh<00:00:55.739> renderer

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
also just turned off the mesh renderer

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.830 
also just turned off the mesh renderer
but<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.760> we<00:00:57.149> can't<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> mesh

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
but we have we can't just have a mesh

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.599 
but we have we can't just have a mesh
renderer<00:00:58.170> there<00:00:58.379> as<00:00:58.469> well<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.800> then<00:00:59.370> both<00:00:59.579> of

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
renderer there as well and then both of

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.670 
renderer there as well and then both of
these<00:00:59.940> even<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.539> car<00:01:00.750> spawns<00:01:01.079> here<00:01:01.440> has<00:01:01.530> got

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
these even the car spawns here has got

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.609 
these even the car spawns here has got
scripts<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:03.180> one<00:01:03.390> I've<00:01:03.899> then<00:01:04.110> duplicated

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
scripts so this one I've then duplicated

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.530 
scripts so this one I've then duplicated
and<00:01:04.949> moved<00:01:05.189> all<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.549> way<00:01:05.580> around<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.000> scene

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
and moved all the way around the scene

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.390 
and moved all the way around the scene
so<00:01:07.080> if<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.500> select<00:01:07.770> them<00:01:07.860> all<00:01:07.979> you've<00:01:08.250> got

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
so if I just select them all you've got

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.640 
so if I just select them all you've got
every<00:01:09.060> single<00:01:09.210> entrance<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.990> would<00:01:10.140> be<00:01:10.350> in

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
every single entrance that would be in

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.649 
every single entrance that would be in
on<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.979> road<00:01:11.400> where<00:01:11.729> people<00:01:12.060> could<00:01:12.210> come<00:01:12.240> from

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
on a road where people could come from

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.140 
on a road where people could come from
and<00:01:13.049> all<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.470> those<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:14.310> all<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.700> scripts<00:01:15.030> on

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
and all of those have all the scripts on

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.030 
and all of those have all the scripts on
them<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.540> if<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.200> I've<00:01:16.290> created<00:01:16.590> them<00:01:16.799> as

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
them so if I and I've created them as

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.700 
them so if I and I've created them as
prefabs<00:01:17.580> as<00:01:17.759> well<00:01:17.970> for<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.590> objects<00:01:19.590> are

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
prefabs as well for the objects are

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.740 
prefabs as well for the objects are
going<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.920> be<00:01:19.979> creating<00:01:20.369> from<00:01:20.670> these<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.270> I've

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
going to be creating from these so I've

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.200 
going to be creating from these so I've
got<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.259> prefab<00:01:22.799> directory<00:01:23.640> which<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:23.909> then

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
got a prefab directory which is then

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.730 
got a prefab directory which is then
also<00:01:24.420> got<00:01:24.689> cars<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.170> say<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.530> because<00:01:25.619> I'm

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
also got cars and say that because I'm

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.920 
also got cars and say that because I'm
gonna<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.759> all<00:01:26.850> kinds<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.600> things<00:01:27.659> in

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
gonna have and all kinds of things in

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.249 
gonna have and all kinds of things in
there<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.770> we've<00:01:29.520> created<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.020> cars

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
there so we've created and just the cars

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.590 
there so we've created and just the cars
thing<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.040> I've<00:01:32.250> also<00:01:32.490> just<00:01:32.790> created<00:01:33.240> for<00:01:33.420> now

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
thing and I've also just created for now

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.039 
thing and I've also just created for now
car<00:01:34.320> target<00:01:34.950> which<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.520> just<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.909> box<00:01:36.210> if<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.600> move

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
car target which is just a box if I move

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.780 
car target which is just a box if I move
towards<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.530> it's<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.159> literally<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.549> box

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
towards it it's just literally a box

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.730 
towards it it's just literally a box
that's<00:01:39.119> going<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.390> be<00:01:39.540> what<00:01:40.140> our<00:01:40.290> cars<00:01:40.619> are

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
that's going to be what our cars are

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.200 
that's going to be what our cars are
going<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.920> follow<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.490> they<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.759> smoother

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
going to follow so they have smoother

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.420 
going to follow so they have smoother
corners<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.799> they're<00:01:43.799> not<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> thing<00:01:44.250> that's

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
corners and they're not the thing that's

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.219 
corners and they're not the thing that's
being<00:01:44.610> affected<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.780> an<00:01:45.990> invisible

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
being affected it's is an invisible

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.440 
being affected it's is an invisible
object<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.829> front<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.159> them<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.700> our<00:01:48.000> script

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
object in front of them so our script

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.050 
object in front of them so our script
we've<00:01:48.780> got<00:01:49.159> we've<00:01:50.159> added<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.490> new<00:01:50.640> directory

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
we've got we've added a new directory

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.880 
we've got we've added a new directory
called<00:01:51.180> cars<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.840> we've<00:01:51.930> got<00:01:52.079> card<00:01:52.350> data<00:01:52.649> and

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
called cars and we've got card data and

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.300 
called cars and we've got card data and
casts<00:01:53.700> own<00:01:54.030> spawn<00:01:54.390> cars<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.380> car<00:01:55.680> data<00:01:55.950> is

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
casts own spawn cars so car data is

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.149 
casts own spawn cars so car data is
going<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.090> go<00:01:57.180> onto<00:01:57.329> our<00:01:57.479> hair<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.530> object<00:01:58.920> and

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
going to go onto our hair and object and

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.399 
going to go onto our hair and object and
what<00:01:59.850> that's<00:02:00.030> going<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.299> do<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.659> store<00:02:00.960> every

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
what that's going to do is store every

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.810 
what that's going to do is store every
single<00:02:01.439> car<00:02:01.890> that's<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.340> scene<00:02:02.549> at<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
single car that's in the scene at the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.030 
single car that's in the scene at the
time<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.570> if<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:04.049> open<00:02:04.409> that<00:02:04.649> up

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
time so if I open that up

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.700 
time so if I open that up
we've<00:02:05.460> got<00:02:05.780> import<00:02:06.780> systems<00:02:07.110> collection<00:02:07.619> is

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
we've got import systems collection is

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.949 
we've got import systems collection is
generic<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.360> because<00:02:09.720> we're<00:02:09.869> going

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
generic and that is because we're going

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.470 
generic and that is because we're going
to<00:02:10.020> be<00:02:10.110> using<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.590> generic<00:02:11.009> list<00:02:11.340> from<00:02:11.879> unity

script<00:02:13.680> list<00:02:13.860> all<00:02:14.580> we<00:02:14.880> got<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.330> variable<00:02:15.990> of

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
script list all we got is a variable of

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.100 
script list all we got is a variable of
cars<00:02:16.380> which<00:02:16.740> is<00:02:16.920> equal<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.460> a<00:02:17.700> list<00:02:18.180> dot<00:02:18.660> and

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
cars which is equal to a list dot and

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.920 
cars which is equal to a list dot and
then<00:02:19.440> open<00:02:19.950> arrow<00:02:20.340> angled<00:02:21.120> brackets<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.780> then

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
then open arrow angled brackets and then

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.560 
then open arrow angled brackets and then
game<00:02:22.170> object<00:02:22.590> capital<00:02:23.010> G<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.550> then<00:02:24.240> close

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
game object capital G and then close

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.090 
game object capital G and then close
that<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.960> then<00:02:25.230> close<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.650> off<00:02:25.740> as<00:02:25.920> well<00:02:26.040> so

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
that and then close it off as well so

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.710 
that and then close it off as well so
that's<00:02:26.280> just<00:02:26.520> going<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.700> create<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.060> list<00:02:27.300> every

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
that's just going to create a list every

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.930 
that's just going to create a list every
time<00:02:27.960> if<00:02:28.410> we<00:02:28.620> want<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:28.830> add<00:02:29.010> stuff<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.700> and

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
time if we want to add stuff to it and

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.850 
time if we want to add stuff to it and
then<00:02:30.300> we've<00:02:30.420> got<00:02:30.510> our<00:02:30.570> spawn<00:02:30.990> cars<00:02:31.410> script

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
then we've got our spawn cars script

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.260 
then we've got our spawn cars script
which<00:02:32.310> we're<00:02:32.610> gonna<00:02:32.670> be<00:02:32.850> starting<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.180> get

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
which we're gonna be starting to get

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.880 
which we're gonna be starting to get

adding<00:02:37.350> AI<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.830> things<00:02:38.070> so<00:02:39.000> we've<00:02:39.630> got<00:02:39.930> our

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
adding AI and things so we've got our

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.620 
adding AI and things so we've got our
car<00:02:40.800> target<00:02:41.340> which<00:02:41.490> is<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.880> empty<00:02:42.540> object

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
car target which is the empty object

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.000 
car target which is the empty object
which<00:02:42.990> our<00:02:43.140> car<00:02:43.350> is<00:02:43.410> going<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.590> be<00:02:43.680> following

which our car is going to be following

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.580 
which our car is going to be following
and<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.310> this<00:02:45.150> one<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.540> just<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:46.110> prefab

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
and that this one is just the prefab

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.260 
and that this one is just the prefab
that<00:02:46.620> we're<00:02:46.890> going<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.070> be<00:02:47.130> using<00:02:47.490> and<00:02:47.820> then

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
that we're going to be using and then

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.300 
that we're going to be using and then
we've<00:02:48.390> got<00:02:48.540> can<00:02:48.870> spawn<00:02:49.230> is<00:02:49.410> equal<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.800> true<00:02:50.130> to

we've got can spawn is equal to true to

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.010 
we've got can spawn is equal to true to
start<00:02:50.580> with<00:02:50.730> because<00:02:51.090> it's<00:02:51.660> not<00:02:51.840> going<00:02:51.960> to

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
can spawn so can spawn is true then it

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.470 
can spawn so can spawn is true then it

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
will create a variable of this car which

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.840 
will create a variable of this car which
will<00:03:21.570> be<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.870> our<00:03:22.110> car<00:03:22.580> target<00:03:23.580> which<00:03:23.670> we've

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
will be the our car target which we've

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.580 
will be the our car target which we've
spawned<00:03:24.060> at<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.720> position<00:03:25.050> that<00:03:25.170> we<00:03:25.260> are<00:03:25.290> and

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
spawned at the position that we are and

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.170 
spawned at the position that we are and
our<00:03:25.800> rotation<00:03:26.310> that's<00:03:26.520> going<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.730> create<00:03:26.940> as<00:03:27.060> a

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
our rotation that's going to create as a

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.790 
our rotation that's going to create as a
game<00:03:27.330> object<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:27.810> we<00:03:27.900> can<00:03:28.020> access<00:03:28.140> it<00:03:28.320> easier

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
game object so we can access it easier

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.820 
game object so we can access it easier
here<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.340> then<00:03:30.330> we're<00:03:31.230> going<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.410> tell<00:03:31.620> our

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
here and then we're going to tell our

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.890 
here and then we're going to tell our
parent<00:03:32.340> because<00:03:32.790> these<00:03:33.000> are<00:03:33.240> added<00:03:33.690> as

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
parent because these are added as

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.810 
parent because these are added as
children<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:34.920> car<00:03:35.130> spawns<00:03:35.459> we're<00:03:35.700> going

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
children to the car spawns we're going

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.150 
children to the car spawns we're going
to<00:03:35.880> tell<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.209> parent<00:03:36.660> which<00:03:37.380> will<00:03:37.650> have<00:03:37.890> to<00:03:38.010> be

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
to tell the parent which will have to be

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.430 
to tell the parent which will have to be
the<00:03:38.700> one<00:03:38.880> that's<00:03:38.970> got<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.209> car<00:03:39.480> data<00:03:39.720> script

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
the one that's got the car data script

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.400 
the one that's got the car data script
on<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.709> and<00:03:41.040> then<00:03:41.790> that<00:03:42.000> one's<00:03:42.209> cars<00:03:42.570> it<00:03:42.900> will

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
on it and then that one's cars it will

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.560 
on it and then that one's cars it will
add<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.830> car<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:44.220> we've<00:03:44.340> just<00:03:44.459> created<00:03:44.730> so

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
add the car that we've just created so

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.750 
add the car that we've just created so
it's<00:03:45.780> added<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.350> list<00:03:46.470> of<00:03:46.950> cars<00:03:47.340> that's<00:03:47.640> in

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
it's added to the list of cars that's in

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.490 
it's added to the list of cars that's in
the<00:03:47.880> scene<00:03:48.090> so<00:03:48.330> basically<00:03:48.570> we<00:03:48.690> make<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:49.110> and<00:03:49.290> we

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
the scene so basically we make it and we

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.440 
the scene so basically we make it and we
tell<00:03:49.800> our<00:03:49.950> parent<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.550> we<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:51.180> there<00:03:51.300> is

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
tell our parent that we that there is

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.720 
tell our parent that we that there is
one<00:03:51.660> now<00:03:51.840> in<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.080> scene<00:03:52.290> so<00:03:52.980> keep<00:03:53.310> a<00:03:53.400> track<00:03:53.550> of

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
one now in the scene so keep a track of

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.479 
one now in the scene so keep a track of
that<00:03:53.820> kind<00:03:54.060> of<00:03:54.090> thing<00:03:54.300> and<00:03:54.540> then<00:03:55.200> just<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:56.280> make

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
that kind of thing and then just to make

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.670 
that kind of thing and then just to make
you<00:03:56.760> so<00:03:56.880> we<00:03:57.000> can<00:03:57.180> choose<00:03:57.390> whether<00:03:57.570> we<00:03:57.680> can

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
you so we can choose whether we can

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.770 
you so we can choose whether we can
spawn<00:03:58.920> or<00:03:59.070> not<00:03:59.340> we've<00:03:59.820> got<00:03:59.880> on<00:04:00.180> trigger<00:04:00.420> stay

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
spawn or not we've got on trigger stay

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.380 
spawn or not we've got on trigger stay
so<00:04:00.840> anytime<00:04:01.380> that<00:04:01.590> anything<00:04:02.310> is<00:04:02.520> inside<00:04:03.060> our

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
so anytime that anything is inside our

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.260 
so anytime that anything is inside our
our<00:04:04.230> area<00:04:04.680> we<00:04:05.010> can't<00:04:05.220> spawn<00:04:05.489> a<00:04:05.550> car<00:04:05.880> so<00:04:06.150> we

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
our area we can't spawn a car so we

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.699 
our area we can't spawn a car so we
won't<00:04:06.420> just<00:04:06.570> spawn<00:04:06.780> it<00:04:06.870> on<00:04:06.959> top<00:04:07.110> of<00:04:07.200> a<00:04:07.320> person

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
won't just spawn it on top of a person

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.590 
won't just spawn it on top of a person
that's<00:04:07.890> walking<00:04:07.980> over<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.430> road<00:04:08.610> then<00:04:09.060> we

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
that's walking over to the road then we

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.960 
that's walking over to the road then we
set<00:04:09.840> our<00:04:09.959> can<00:04:10.140> spawn<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.530> false<00:04:10.800> and<00:04:11.520> you'll<00:04:11.640> be

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
set our can spawn to false and you'll be

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.580 
set our can spawn to false and you'll be
doing<00:04:12.209> on<00:04:12.360> trigger<00:04:12.660> stay<00:04:12.959> with<00:04:13.200> capital

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
doing on trigger stay with capital

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.930 
doing on trigger stay with capital
letters<00:04:13.620> at<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:13.980> start<00:04:14.280> of<00:04:14.370> each<00:04:14.430> word<00:04:14.670> and

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
letters at the start of each word and

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.820 
letters at the start of each word and
then<00:04:15.450> I've<00:04:15.570> set<00:04:15.810> it<00:04:15.840> to<00:04:15.959> other<00:04:16.169> you<00:04:16.500> can<00:04:16.650> call

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
then I've set it to other you can call

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.110 
then I've set it to other you can call
that<00:04:16.980> wherever<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.280> want<00:04:17.489> I<00:04:17.580> prefer<00:04:17.910> to<00:04:17.970> call

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
that wherever you want I prefer to call

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.520 
that wherever you want I prefer to call
it<00:04:18.180> other<00:04:18.390> so<00:04:18.660> you<00:04:18.720> know<00:04:18.840> it's<00:04:19.020> the<00:04:19.140> other<00:04:19.290> one

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
it other so you know it's the other one

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.440 
it other so you know it's the other one
that<00:04:19.560> we<00:04:19.830> hit<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:20.310> then<00:04:20.880> that<00:04:21.120> one's<00:04:21.299> the

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
that we hit and then that one's the

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.880 
that we hit and then that one's the
collider<00:04:21.780> when<00:04:22.080> you're<00:04:22.200> using<00:04:22.350> triggers

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
collider when you're using triggers

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.920 
collider when you're using triggers
we've<00:04:23.280> also<00:04:23.550> got<00:04:23.789> ontriggerexit<00:04:24.390> so<00:04:24.750> whenever

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
we've also got ontriggerexit so whenever

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.980 
we've also got ontriggerexit so whenever
we<00:04:25.140> leave<00:04:25.410> to<00:04:25.710> trigger<00:04:25.950> with<00:04:26.190> that<00:04:26.400> with<00:04:26.760> an

we leave to trigger with that with an

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.469 
we leave to trigger with that with an
object<00:04:27.259> we<00:04:27.949> then<00:04:28.130> set<00:04:28.520> our<00:04:28.759> can<00:04:29.030> sworn<00:04:29.300> to

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
object we then set our can sworn to

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.860 
object we then set our can sworn to
false<00:04:29.870> to<00:04:30.139> true<00:04:30.590> so<00:04:31.310> you<00:04:32.300> don't<00:04:32.479> always<00:04:32.630> need

constantly as opposed to being run only

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.189 
constantly as opposed to being run only
when<00:04:37.610> you<00:04:37.699> actually<00:04:37.880> enter<00:04:38.360> a<00:04:38.780> trigger<00:04:39.080> or

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
when you actually enter a trigger or

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.050 
when you actually enter a trigger or
exit<00:04:39.650> trigger<00:04:39.919> because<00:04:40.430> we're<00:04:40.699> setting<00:04:41.000> this

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
exit trigger because we're setting this

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.370 
exit trigger because we're setting this
every<00:04:41.270> time<00:04:41.449> we<00:04:41.569> leave<00:04:41.750> trigger<00:04:42.169> with

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
every time we leave trigger with

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.930 
every time we leave trigger with
something<00:04:42.710> if<00:04:42.889> there's<00:04:43.250> two<00:04:43.430> things<00:04:43.639> and

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
something if there's two things and

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.210 
something if there's two things and
that's<00:04:44.360> triggering<00:04:44.900> with<00:04:45.050> us<00:04:45.229> and<00:04:45.620> one<00:04:46.099> of

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
that's triggering with us and one of

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.309 
that's triggering with us and one of
them<00:04:46.310> leaves<00:04:46.520> then<00:04:46.940> we<00:04:47.330> still<00:04:47.660> have<00:04:47.900> it<00:04:48.020> set<00:04:48.199> to

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:48.319 
them leaves then we still have it set to

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:49.839 
them leaves then we still have it set to
false<00:04:48.530> so<00:04:48.800> we<00:04:48.889> still<00:04:49.099> can't<00:04:49.310> spawn<00:04:49.550> on<00:04:49.729> the

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:49.849 
false so we still can't spawn on the

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:51.960 
false so we still can't spawn on the
other<00:04:50.000> one<00:04:50.180> so<00:04:50.840> back<00:04:51.080> into<00:04:51.259> the<00:04:51.349> scene

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
other one so back into the scene

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.100 
other one so back into the scene
basically<00:04:52.970> what<00:04:53.330> it's<00:04:53.419> going<00:04:53.449> to<00:04:53.599> be<00:04:53.660> doing<00:04:53.840> if

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
basically what it's going to be doing if

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.020 
basically what it's going to be doing if
I<00:04:54.229> hit<00:04:54.380> play<00:04:54.410> it<00:04:55.160> randomly<00:04:55.759> is<00:04:55.819> going<00:04:55.970> to

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
I hit play it randomly is going to

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.600 
I hit play it randomly is going to
create<00:04:56.270> each<00:04:56.720> of<00:04:56.750> these<00:04:57.370> objects<00:04:58.370> don't

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
create each of these objects don't

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.120 
create each of these objects don't
forget<00:04:58.910> actually<00:04:59.300> to<00:04:59.479> set<00:04:59.750> these<00:05:00.050> onto<00:05:01.039> the

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
forget actually to set these onto the

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.240 
forget actually to set these onto the
prefab<00:05:01.550> so<00:05:01.909> onto<00:05:02.419> our<00:05:02.780> car<00:05:03.440> spawns<00:05:03.770> I've<00:05:03.979> set

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
prefab so onto our car spawns I've set

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.610 
prefab so onto our car spawns I've set
car<00:05:04.849> target<00:05:05.330> which<00:05:05.509> is<00:05:05.659> the<00:05:05.870> object<00:05:06.409> to<00:05:06.500> the

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
car target which is the object to the

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.680 
car target which is the object to the
prefab<00:05:06.979> that<00:05:07.009> I<00:05:07.130> created<00:05:07.460> just<00:05:07.550> just<00:05:08.300> before

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
prefab that I created just just before

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.870 
prefab that I created just just before
all<00:05:09.500> I've<00:05:09.650> done<00:05:09.830> with<00:05:10.009> that<00:05:10.099> is<00:05:10.310> just<00:05:10.639> giving

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
all I've done with that is just giving

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.270 
all I've done with that is just giving
it<00:05:11.000> its<00:05:11.210> made<00:05:11.389> at<00:05:11.509> kinam<00:05:11.780> kinematic<00:05:12.440> rigidbody

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
it its made at kinam kinematic rigidbody

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.730 
it its made at kinam kinematic rigidbody
so<00:05:13.669> it<00:05:13.819> will<00:05:13.909> trigger<00:05:14.180> with<00:05:14.449> things<00:05:14.690> and<00:05:14.960> then

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
so it will trigger with things and then

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.100 
so it will trigger with things and then
made<00:05:16.190> it<00:05:16.220> into<00:05:16.520> a<00:05:16.580> trigger<00:05:16.940> as<00:05:17.120> well<00:05:17.330> and<00:05:17.539> you

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
made it into a trigger as well and you

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.629 
made it into a trigger as well and you
don't<00:05:18.259> really<00:05:18.530> need<00:05:18.740> the<00:05:18.889> meta<00:05:19.069> renderer<00:05:19.370> but

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
don't really need the meta renderer but

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.399 
don't really need the meta renderer but
just<00:05:19.819> for<00:05:20.090> testing<00:05:20.389> purposes<00:05:20.840> is<00:05:21.050> nice<00:05:21.259> to

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:21.409 
just for testing purposes is nice to

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:23.469 
just for testing purposes is nice to
have<00:05:21.530> it<00:05:21.680> there<00:05:21.710> so<00:05:22.280> you<00:05:22.370> can<00:05:22.610> just<00:05:22.639> see<00:05:22.940> it<00:05:23.090> so

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
have it there so you can just see it so

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:24.790 
have it there so you can just see it so
if<00:05:23.569> I<00:05:23.659> play<00:05:23.960> you're<00:05:24.199> going<00:05:24.319> to<00:05:24.440> see<00:05:24.530> that<00:05:24.680> we're

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
if I play you're going to see that we're

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.830 
if I play you're going to see that we're
going<00:05:24.860> to<00:05:24.979> randomly<00:05:25.340> creating<00:05:26.000> them<00:05:26.150> and<00:05:26.360> over

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
going to randomly creating them and over

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.510 
going to randomly creating them and over
a<00:05:26.900> bit<00:05:27.080> of<00:05:27.110> time<00:05:27.440> we're<00:05:28.099> going<00:05:28.190> to<00:05:28.250> end<00:05:28.400> up

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
a bit of time we're going to end up

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.980 
a bit of time we're going to end up
having<00:05:28.699> them<00:05:28.940> on<00:05:29.060> every<00:05:29.300> single<00:05:29.479> entrance

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
having them on every single entrance

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.560 
having them on every single entrance
because<00:05:30.500> that<00:05:30.800> has<00:05:30.889> a<00:05:30.919> chance<00:05:31.250> every<00:05:31.849> five<00:05:32.419> to

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
because that has a chance every five to

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.719 
because that has a chance every five to
ten<00:05:32.719> seconds<00:05:33.169> to<00:05:33.259> create<00:05:33.469> one<00:05:33.710> so<00:05:34.159> that's

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
ten seconds to create one so that's

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:36.100 
ten seconds to create one so that's
going<00:05:34.880> to<00:05:34.940> effectively<00:05:35.389> be<00:05:35.539> creating<00:05:35.870> cars

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
going to effectively be creating cars

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.920 
going to effectively be creating cars
into<00:05:36.380> in<00:05:36.620> the<00:05:36.710> next<00:05:36.880> tutorial<00:05:37.880> so<00:05:38.300> stick

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
into in the next tutorial so stick

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.600 
into in the next tutorial so stick
around<00:05:38.960> for<00:05:39.320> that<00:05:39.349> one<00:05:39.469> and<00:05:39.830> they<00:05:40.130> will<00:05:40.280> see

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
around for that one and they will see

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.789 
around for that one and they will see
you
