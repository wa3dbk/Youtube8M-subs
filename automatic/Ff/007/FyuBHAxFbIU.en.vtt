00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.410
 good that we bring today portland look there 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.119
 we're going to talk about a whole 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.219
 little but this seems if we start as 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.840
 it's Friday talking about something a little 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.880
 light although those lovers of 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.360
 animals are going to be looking at the 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.730
 theme but I know what are you already know 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.170
 what good are we going if we have some of 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.660
 the images we are telling you a little 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.090
 what happened to this woman that already 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.859
 they called the accumulator to was found to 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.510
 a woman that they had maybe she had in 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:40.579
 your house 100 dogs and 20 cats good not 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.979
 they are few this morning was not personal 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.139
 of the police that in coordination with the 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:47.149
 good animal brigade performed this 

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:48.949
 operative in the closed street of chocó 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.409
 in santamaría de la ribera where they were 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.949
 they were found I was already saying 100 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:57.229
 dogs and 20 cats today extras 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.749
 funny I imagine that the lady you 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.489
 I want to think that not because I saw one 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:03.859
 and then he saw two and then he saw three in the 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.170
 street began to have them in his house and what 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.820
 well, suddenly, they were feeling 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.659
 yes but here what we have also the 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.740
 information is that these animals 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.530
 They were well fed 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.950
 if they were in good condition 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.770
 the lady on her own what she was doing was 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.080
 take care of them why this happens because the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.479
 neighbors begin to complain 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.070
 obviously surely because of the noise and 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.450
 all this situation and societies 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.770
 animal protectors are very 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.780
 worried because they were taken to 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.950
 anti-rabies that is not going to be 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.869
 they take away the lady for 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.670
 sacrifice that's what they asked for 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.899
 example a lot of people complained about the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.670
 said the neighbors were the ones 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.520
 they called and they said hear this there is already a 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.740
 100 lady dogs and enough is 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.330
 they carry them but what they do not want many 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.190
 of these people is that then the 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.590
 sacrifice, kill them are 100 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.380
 animals where you accommodate 100 dogs and 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.759
 20 I fall I think that if we give it good 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.619
 rope with social networks 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.100
 quickly these little animals are going to have 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.229
 many adoption options I do not know if you 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.090
 you knew a case that there was in Mexico in 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.069
 Somewhere they were saying that dogs 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.439
 they were attacking people and they were 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:09.479
 to take and suddenly there are a lot of 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.250
 requests via twitter via facebook 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.410
 they wanted to adopt the animals 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.610
 we just should not see each other and this one 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.620
 it could also be one of the options 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.400
 for all these animals if not 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.769
 They will be able to 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.659
 The lady will not be able to have 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.510
 none of these dogs or cats already in 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:27.269
 your house see if maybe it's via facebook 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.829
 or maybe via twitter you can have 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.989
 some option so that they can 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.849
 adopt because there are several 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.650
 there are some hostels and there are some 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.409
 organizations that just work 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.269
 with the animals for example by 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:42.299
 gattuso that is one of them that also 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.180
 they were asking not to kill the 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.099
 animals if just when they are at 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.109
 anti-rabies many times what they do not 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.780
 they are given a deadline to have them there 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:53.670
 after that term expires they begin 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.049
 to eliminate the animals I think 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.870
 would have to see if this woman can be 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.519
 stop because with what basis are they 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.129
 removing the animals and I have 100 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.870
 animals in my house I can feed them 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.340
 animals are in good condition 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.530
 it seems that they did not have symptoms of 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.599
 abuse they were well fed 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.700
 we are seeing ourselves in the images like this 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.379
 like they have little puppies and 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.870
 of puppies that are happy do not know 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:19.230
 they saw aggressive animals maybe only 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.549
 respond to the final complaint I tell you 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.169
 I can imagine it must also be 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.610
 very annoying what you have your house in the 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.670
 house next door 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.890
 dogs and the noise the barks the 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.690
 smells pain especially smell not 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.880
 because you want it or not even if you clean that 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.590
 every day the smell of good from the 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.210
 needs of a hundred puppies should not be 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.520
 nothing nice 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.200
 and there must be many hostels that 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.700
 they can just receive these 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.740
 animals and give them up for adoption 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.570
 lately a lot of campaigns of that 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.060
 I saw a lot here in Mexico I liked it 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.709
 very much that there are many 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.450
 organizations that work with puppies 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.459
 and there is already a friend of mine for example you 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.320
 He said he adopted a dog that is a 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.720
 beauty I love that animal because 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.880
 in the end he was raised the puppy for 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.410
 give you the leg you feel you know where to go 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.360
 and others but this little animal what 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.730
 rescued from the street they found him at 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.070
 newborn baby but in the 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.810
 bones you see the photographs now of the 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.810
 moment they found it and how 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.880
 is now a change that destroyed you 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.650
 the heart not to see what happened and she 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.930
 he told me that for example in coyoacán 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.660
 where she went to one of these many 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.400
 organizations and for example has a 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.050
 website where they show you the 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.550
 photographs of puppies for adoption 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.470
 that are usually dogs that 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.510
 find on the street some more 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.870
 small others good that already have more 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.420
 and you when you arrive, they make you 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.130
 a parade of dogs is to say that you are going 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.380
 showing no to each of the puppies 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.880
 they give you the animal's data to see if 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.490
 It's a funny little animal that can 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.770
 be at home or if you like more spaces 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.230
 open and then they give you the 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.510
 puppy for adoption they give you a 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.910
 sheet where you have to put all the 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.160
 data is to say if you have a partner if you are 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.000
 only if you have brothers and others who is 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.000
 stay with the puppy 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.830
 laborious but if they are checking 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.080
 who is the receiver of 100 even 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.060
 Then they go to your house after a 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.100
 week to see how the puppy is 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.020
 it is adopted if it is good if it can be 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.300
 or not at home if you got used to it or not 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.400
 to see if they leave it or not and they make you 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.700
 a follow up say is a job 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.800
 quite tedious is not to say or if 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.600
 are following each of the steps 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.130
 maybe see the option that you're 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.050
 organizations for example here in the 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.720
 note that I saw in this world patitas 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.730
 stapper gattuso are some of the 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.470
 shelters and possibly through 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.910
 these organizations if you can 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.920
 accommodate these puppies 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.200
 and of course without doubt and these animals that 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.810
 are rescued from adoption as well 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.520
 say it they are much more grateful than 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.380
 any other dog or like that 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.780
 They know it's you who freed them 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.760
 of the situation so impoverished that 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.310
 surely they were living are 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.600
 adorable yes and in many cases they are 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.850
 animals that are at the beginning 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.010
 scared because in many cases they are 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.270
 they left very violent environments or 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.180
 people who hit them are 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.710
 chained history very very sad yes 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.750
 at first they distrust much of the 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.360
 people do not want to approach they do not want 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.250
 doing nothing hurts like that and they also eat not 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.380
 they know many cases if they are dogs of the 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.200
 street as it is to eat on a plate is not 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:19.440
 say they do not know how to do it but 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.360
 little by little, since the baby already teaches them 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.490
 with that you already know how the puppy 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.320
 see getting used to your house if there 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.570
 many campaigns where you do not buy a 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.550
 animal adopt it the best because we're going 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.990
 if we pay impressive amounts for 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.450
 buy a puppy when there are so many 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.360
 others who are waiting for a place where 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:39.030
 be yes I remember going through a 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.730
 mobile one of these days seeing 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.770
 just animals because I said good 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.970
 how weird 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.980
 have dogs at the counters 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:50.760
 because I still do not know I do not know if that 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:52.260
 can or can not if there is not one but in the distance 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.270
 what is nice is only for 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.790
 see it and someone ask and how much is 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:01.110
 this dog says 25 thousand pesos 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:03.000
 5 - and I said pay 25 thousand pesos is fine 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.500
 if you want a dog of breed and that has 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.110
 to live and in the end but there are so many 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.810
 Puppies out with that you feed him 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.610
 two years I say nothing of the same if you have 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:15.290
 It has no pedigree, whatever it is 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.290
 your dog is everything
