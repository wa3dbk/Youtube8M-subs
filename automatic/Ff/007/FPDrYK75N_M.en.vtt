00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
black and sometimes dark gray I don't

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.440 
black and sometimes dark gray I don't
even<00:03:41.190> think<00:03:41.310> we're<00:03:41.519> gonna<00:03:41.609> get<00:03:41.820> yellow<00:03:42.180> I

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
even think we're gonna get yellow I

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.870 
even think we're gonna get yellow I
think<00:03:42.600> it's<00:03:42.959> just<00:03:43.109> gonna<00:03:43.320> be<00:03:43.530> yellow<00:03:44.430> but<00:03:44.760> you

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.599 
I think it'd actually be cool too I
think<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.739> would<00:03:46.859> kind<00:03:47.040> of<00:03:47.070> break<00:03:47.280> it<00:03:47.430> up<00:03:47.489> a

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
think it would kind of break it up a

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.599 
think it would kind of break it up a
little<00:03:47.700> bit<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.109> you<00:03:49.109> know<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.859> this<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.370> I

completely respect the right for these

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.289 
completely respect the right for these
movies<00:04:09.060> after<00:04:09.299> the<00:04:10.549> goofiness<00:04:11.549> that<00:04:11.970> came<00:04:12.150> out

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
movies after the goofiness that came out

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.420 
movies after the goofiness that came out
of<00:04:12.329> the<00:04:12.510> 90s<00:04:12.870> I<00:04:13.049> completely<00:04:13.590> respect<00:04:14.130> that<00:04:14.190> and

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
of the 90s I completely respect that and

it makes sense and I think but what's
happened<00:04:16.709> is<00:04:16.799> this<00:04:16.979> like<00:04:17.190> Nolan<00:04:17.459> ization<00:04:18.030> of

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
happened is this like Nolan ization of

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.409 
happened is this like Nolan ization of
everything<00:04:19.830> yeah<00:04:20.370> just<00:04:20.849> tough<00:04:21.000> to<00:04:21.030> convey

everything yeah just tough to convey

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.750 
everything yeah just tough to convey

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
does come off it's a little bit it's

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.210 
does come off it's a little bit it's
just<00:04:57.150> so<00:04:57.569> far<00:04:57.930> a<00:04:58.110> little<00:04:58.259> lighter<00:04:58.590> this<00:04:58.830> seems

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
just so far a little lighter this seems

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.920 
just so far a little lighter this seems
a<00:04:59.340> little<00:04:59.460> bit<00:04:59.699> inauthentic<00:05:00.419> and<00:05:00.599> a<00:05:00.630> little

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
a little bit inauthentic and a little

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.080 
a little bit inauthentic and a little
little<00:05:01.409> reads<00:05:02.009> false<00:05:02.280> to<00:05:02.460> me<00:05:02.550> sometimes<00:05:02.970> but

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
little reads false to me sometimes but

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.670 
little reads false to me sometimes but
then<00:05:03.210> we<00:05:03.330> look<00:05:03.539> back<00:05:03.750> also<00:05:04.020> at<00:05:04.319> the<00:05:04.409> flash

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
then we look back also at the flash

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.860 
then we look back also at the flash
trailer<00:05:05.190> that<00:05:05.310> we<00:05:05.460> just<00:05:05.669> examined<00:05:06.539> and<00:05:06.750> we're

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
trailer that we just examined and we're

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.469 
trailer that we just examined and we're
like<00:05:07.080> okay<00:05:07.470> there<00:05:08.039> were<00:05:08.220> some<00:05:08.520> hokey<00:05:08.880> elements

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
like okay there were some hokey elements

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.379 
like okay there were some hokey elements
from<00:05:10.050> the<00:05:10.259> Silver<00:05:10.650> Age<00:05:10.680> that<00:05:11.550> probably<00:05:12.000> needed

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
from the Silver Age that probably needed

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.600 
from the Silver Age that probably needed
to<00:05:12.419> be<00:05:12.620> modernized<00:05:13.620> so<00:05:14.069> that<00:05:14.220> people<00:05:14.490> would

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
to be modernized so that people would

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.330 
to be modernized so that people would
enjoy<00:05:14.729> it<00:05:15.060> is<00:05:15.180> modernize<00:05:15.780> the<00:05:16.080> same<00:05:16.289> as<00:05:16.650> Nolan

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
enjoy it is modernize the same as Nolan

the<00:05:34.650> writing<00:05:35.190> style<00:05:35.699> was<00:05:36.060> very<00:05:36.569> different

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 
the writing style was very different

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:38.959

though<00:05:37.349> wellhe<00:05:37.710> narrative<00:05:38.190> Lee<00:05:38.400> it<00:05:38.759> matched

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:38.969 
though wellhe narrative Lee it matched

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:40.790 
though wellhe narrative Lee it matched
the<00:05:39.180> aesthetic<00:05:39.569> but<00:05:39.900> the<00:05:40.020> question<00:05:40.380> that<00:05:40.560> I

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
the aesthetic but the question that I

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.700 
the aesthetic but the question that I
have<00:05:41.279> is<00:05:41.610> why<00:05:42.449> are<00:05:42.840> we<00:05:42.960> not<00:05:43.080> seeing<00:05:43.139> anything
