00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
an 8 foot by 8 foot platform so this is

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.790 
an 8 foot by 8 foot platform so this is
2<00:00:23.110> 4<00:00:23.410> by<00:00:23.560> 8<00:00:23.590> foot<00:00:24.520> sheets<00:00:24.970> of<00:00:25.180> 3/4<00:00:25.780> inch<00:00:25.810> spruce

plywood<00:00:26.980> I<00:00:27.460> have<00:00:28.000> 5<00:00:28.240> sheets<00:00:28.600> in<00:00:28.780> total<00:00:29.110> and<00:00:29.350> you

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
plywood I have 5 sheets in total and you

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.959 
plywood I have 5 sheets in total and you
can<00:00:29.740> see<00:00:29.950> here<00:00:30.370> that<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:32.439> seam<00:00:32.770> is<00:00:32.800> running<00:00:33.370> in

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
can see here that the seam is running in

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.229 
can see here that the seam is running in
this<00:00:34.449> direction<00:00:34.510> first<00:00:35.760> what<00:00:36.760> we'll<00:00:36.910> do<00:00:37.030> next

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
this direction first what we'll do next

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.569 
this direction first what we'll do next
is<00:00:37.480> apply<00:00:37.540> some<00:00:39.930> adhesive<00:00:40.930> and<00:00:41.190> lay<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:42.370> next

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
is apply some adhesive and lay the next

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.069 
is apply some adhesive and lay the next
two<00:00:42.790> sheets<00:00:43.030> of<00:00:43.149> plywood<00:00:43.390> in<00:00:43.630> the<00:00:43.780> opposing

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
two sheets of plywood in the opposing

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.160 
two sheets of plywood in the opposing
direction<00:00:44.770> and<00:00:45.040> then<00:00:45.700> with<00:00:46.600> some<00:00:46.750> flooring

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
direction and then with some flooring

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.710 
direction and then with some flooring
screws<00:00:47.560> we'll<00:00:47.829> attach<00:00:48.280> that<00:00:48.550> so<00:00:48.850> we'll<00:00:49.510> go<00:00:49.660> to

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
screws we'll attach that so we'll go to

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.560 
screws we'll attach that so we'll go to
a<00:00:49.899> one-and-a-half<00:00:50.320> inch<00:00:50.680> thickness<00:00:51.570> that's

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
a one-and-a-half inch thickness that's

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.690 
a one-and-a-half inch thickness that's
step<00:00:52.870> number<00:00:52.899> two<00:00:53.320> so<00:00:53.590> this<00:00:54.250> is<00:00:54.430> the<00:00:54.520> space

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
step number two so this is the space

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.450 
step number two so this is the space
we're<00:00:54.880> working<00:00:55.149> in<00:00:55.270> this<00:00:55.950> overhead<00:00:56.950> lamp<00:00:57.130> will

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
we're working in this overhead lamp will

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.850 
we're working in this overhead lamp will
be<00:00:57.610> removed<00:00:58.050> but<00:00:59.050> when<00:00:59.200> all<00:00:59.320> is<00:00:59.350> said<00:00:59.680> and<00:00:59.710> done

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
be removed but when all is said and done

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.740 
be removed but when all is said and done
we'll<00:01:00.160> have<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.520> 8<00:01:00.700> foot<00:01:00.969> by<00:01:01.149> 8<00:01:01.300> foot<00:01:01.329> lifting

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
we'll have the 8 foot by 8 foot lifting

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.499 
we'll have the 8 foot by 8 foot lifting
platform<00:01:02.230> and<00:01:02.730> hopefully<00:01:03.730> at<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.299> end<00:01:04.420> of

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
platform and hopefully at the end of

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.910 
platform and hopefully at the end of

going<00:01:25.389> to<00:01:25.450> be<00:01:25.509> done<00:01:25.749> and<00:01:26.049> now<00:01:26.679> we're<00:01:27.639> left<00:01:27.789> with

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
going to be done and now we're left with

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.510 
going to be done and now we're left with
the<00:01:28.209> two<00:01:28.450> foot<00:01:28.719> gaps<00:01:28.959> neither<00:01:29.289> side<00:01:29.529> to<00:01:30.310> fill

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
the two foot gaps neither side to fill

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.340 
the two foot gaps neither side to fill
in<00:01:30.670> with<00:01:30.819> our<00:01:31.029> style<00:01:31.240> rubber<00:01:31.509> and<00:01:31.749> we're<00:01:32.229> going

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
in with our style rubber and we're going

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.260 
in with our style rubber and we're going
to<00:01:32.380> start<00:01:32.619> from<00:01:32.709> the<00:01:32.829> back<00:01:32.979> work<00:01:33.700> our<00:01:33.849> way<00:01:33.939> up<00:01:33.969> 6

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
to start from the back work our way up 6

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.120 
to start from the back work our way up 6
feet<00:01:34.359> so<00:01:34.659> we<00:01:34.840> left<00:01:34.990> with<00:01:35.109> 2<00:01:35.259> feet<00:01:35.499> short<00:01:35.829> on<00:01:36.009> the

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
feet so we left with 2 feet short on the

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.099 
feet so we left with 2 feet short on the
front<00:01:36.369> and<00:01:36.579> we'll<00:01:37.450> just<00:01:37.599> fill<00:01:37.779> that<00:01:37.899> in<00:01:38.079> with

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
front and we'll just fill that in with

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:40.260 
front and we'll just fill that in with
additional<00:01:38.859> plywood<00:01:39.670> and<00:01:39.759> level<00:01:40.029> it<00:01:40.119> off

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
additional plywood and level it off

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.199 
additional plywood and level it off
later<00:01:40.619> alrighty<00:01:41.700> see<00:01:42.700> when<00:01:42.849> the<00:01:42.939> rubber<00:01:43.090> is

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:43.209 
later alrighty see when the rubber is

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:46.199 
later alrighty see when the rubber is
down<00:01:43.329> ok<00:01:43.479> and<00:01:43.719> step<00:01:44.560> two<00:01:44.829> is<00:01:45.130> once<00:01:46.060> you<00:01:46.179> have

00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:46.209 
down ok and step two is once you have

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:50.089 
down ok and step two is once you have
your<00:01:46.479> base<00:01:46.719> layer<00:01:46.959> down<00:01:47.429> I've<00:01:48.429> applied<00:01:48.759> some

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:50.099 
your base layer down I've applied some

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:54.659 
your base layer down I've applied some
what<00:01:51.099> adhesive<00:01:51.700> I'm<00:01:52.060> just<00:01:52.299> using<00:01:53.340> I'm<00:01:54.340> using<00:01:54.399> a

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:54.669 
what adhesive I'm just using I'm using a

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:56.870 
what adhesive I'm just using I'm using a
peel<00:01:54.880> premium<00:01:55.329> which<00:01:55.450> is<00:01:55.599> basically<00:01:55.899> just<00:01:56.020> a

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
peel premium which is basically just a

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.859 
peel premium which is basically just a
standard<00:01:58.200> construction<00:01:59.200> adhesive<00:02:00.419> using<00:02:01.419> in

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
standard construction adhesive using in

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.260 
standard construction adhesive using in
a<00:02:01.989> caulking<00:02:02.409> gun<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:02.829> just<00:02:02.880> going<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:03.939> apply<00:02:04.179> a

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
a caulking gun and just going to apply a

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.969 
a caulking gun and just going to apply a
nice<00:02:04.539> little<00:02:04.719> layer<00:02:04.989> there<00:02:05.289> for<00:02:05.619> my<00:02:05.739> next

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
nice little layer there for my next

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.330 
nice little layer there for my next
piece<00:02:06.159> of<00:02:06.219> plywood<00:02:06.609> so<00:02:07.679> we<00:02:08.679> get<00:02:08.860> a<00:02:08.890> good<00:02:09.130> little

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
piece of plywood so we get a good little

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.420 
piece of plywood so we get a good little
bit<00:02:09.520> of<00:02:09.700> extra<00:02:10.420> support<00:02:11.260> from<00:02:11.800> board<00:02:12.130> to<00:02:12.280> board

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
bit of extra support from board to board

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.710 
bit of extra support from board to board
and<00:02:12.700> then<00:02:13.120> we're<00:02:13.210> going<00:02:13.300> to<00:02:13.420> put<00:02:13.570> some

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
and then we're going to put some

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.880 
and then we're going to put some
flooring<00:02:14.110> screws<00:02:14.440> in<00:02:14.590> that

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
flooring screws in that

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.620 
flooring screws in that
so<00:02:15.010> we'll<00:02:15.370> take<00:02:15.550> a<00:02:15.610> look<00:02:15.819> at<00:02:15.910> a<00:02:15.940> second<00:02:16.360> once<00:02:16.510> I

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
so we'll take a look at a second once I

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.320 
so we'll take a look at a second once I
have<00:02:16.780> both<00:02:16.990> pieces<00:02:17.260> laid<00:02:17.620> down<00:02:17.830> at<00:02:18.730> the

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
have both pieces laid down at the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.830 
have both pieces laid down at the
process<00:02:19.870> of<00:02:20.020> putting<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.380> screw<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:21.840> second

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
process of putting the screw and second

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.330 
process of putting the screw and second
both<00:02:23.080> boards<00:02:23.410> are<00:02:23.530> lay<00:02:23.620> this<00:02:23.770> is<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:23.950> second

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
both boards are lay this is a second

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.250 
both boards are lay this is a second
layer<00:02:24.520> so<00:02:25.150> again<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.959> recap<00:02:26.910> first<00:02:27.910> layer<00:02:28.260> the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
layer so again to recap first layer the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.520 
layer so again to recap first layer the
board's<00:02:29.620> ran<00:02:29.830> this<00:02:30.160> way<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:32.140> second

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
board's ran this way and the second

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.280 
board's ran this way and the second
layer<00:02:32.620> we<00:02:33.220> have<00:02:33.370> them<00:02:33.550> running<00:02:33.760> horizontally

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
layer we have them running horizontally

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.880 
layer we have them running horizontally
now<00:02:35.290> I've<00:02:35.440> run<00:02:35.680> some<00:02:37.110> flooring<00:02:38.110> screws<00:02:38.470> or<00:02:38.709> one

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
now I've run some flooring screws or one

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.430 
now I've run some flooring screws or one
and<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.040> quarter<00:02:39.340> inch<00:02:39.490> flooring<00:02:39.880> screws<00:02:40.440> about

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
and a quarter inch flooring screws about

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.400 
and a quarter inch flooring screws about
12<00:02:42.100> inches<00:02:42.280> apart<00:02:42.489> a<00:02:42.940> lot<00:02:43.660> more<00:02:44.020> just<00:02:44.290> to

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
12 inches apart a lot more just to

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.510 
12 inches apart a lot more just to
secure<00:02:44.739> and<00:02:44.920> help<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.340> adhesive<00:02:46.000> stick<00:02:46.300> and

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
secure and help the adhesive stick and

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.130 
secure and help the adhesive stick and
that'll<00:02:48.520> make<00:02:48.610> sure<00:02:48.880> that<00:02:49.060> your<00:02:49.600> platform<00:02:49.810> is

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
that'll make sure that your platform is

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.680 
that'll make sure that your platform is
much<00:02:50.320> more<00:02:50.500> secure<00:02:50.890> when<00:02:51.100> you're<00:02:51.220> done<00:02:51.630> so<00:02:52.630> I'm

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
much more secure when you're done so I'm

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.910 
much more secure when you're done so I'm
going<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:52.870> get<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.019> other<00:02:53.110> board<00:02:53.410> done<00:02:53.680> and

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
going to get the other board done and

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.140 
going to get the other board done and
then<00:02:54.250> we're<00:02:54.340> going<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.489> be<00:02:54.610> onto<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:54.940> third

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
then we're going to be onto the third

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.110 
then we're going to be onto the third
layer<00:02:55.420> after<00:02:55.660> address<00:02:56.140> now<00:02:56.560> what<00:02:56.709> we<00:02:56.800> do<00:02:56.920> is

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
layer after address now what we do is

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.580 
layer after address now what we do is
you<00:02:58.120> make<00:02:58.360> sure<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.600> have<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.840> big<00:02:59.380> piece<00:02:59.560> of

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
you make sure you have a big piece of

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.449 
you make sure you have a big piece of
stall<00:03:00.010> rubber<00:03:00.280> here<00:03:00.519> this<00:03:00.670> is<00:03:00.850> 3/4<00:03:01.390> inch

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
stall rubber here this is 3/4 inch

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.830 
stall rubber here this is 3/4 inch
rubber<00:03:03.459> stall<00:03:03.850> matting<00:03:04.209> and<00:03:04.420> still<00:03:04.570> matting

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
rubber stall matting and still matting

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.120 
rubber stall matting and still matting
is<00:03:04.900> basically<00:03:05.140> like<00:03:05.380> they<00:03:05.709> call<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:05.950> stall

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
is basically like they call it stall

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.800 
is basically like they call it stall
matting<00:03:06.430> it's<00:03:06.519> from<00:03:06.640> like<00:03:06.760> horse<00:03:07.180> stalls<00:03:07.510> but

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
matting it's from like horse stalls but

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.930 
matting it's from like horse stalls but
it's<00:03:08.560> typical<00:03:08.980> of<00:03:09.070> what<00:03:09.220> they<00:03:09.310> use<00:03:09.489> in<00:03:09.640> gyms

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
it's typical of what they use in gyms

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.370 
it's typical of what they use in gyms
now<00:03:11.370> this<00:03:12.370> is<00:03:12.489> a<00:03:12.550> 4<00:03:12.790> by<00:03:12.910> 6<00:03:12.940> sheet<00:03:13.600> so<00:03:13.870> it's<00:03:14.290> not

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
now this is a 4 by 6 sheet so it's not

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.110 
now this is a 4 by 6 sheet so it's not
going<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.650> run<00:03:14.769> the<00:03:14.860> entire<00:03:15.100> length<00:03:15.370> of<00:03:15.580> our

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
going to run the entire length of our

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.420 
going to run the entire length of our
platform<00:03:16.690> but<00:03:16.930> enough<00:03:17.260> that<00:03:17.500> will<00:03:18.160> cushion

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
platform but enough that will cushion

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.910 
platform but enough that will cushion
the<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:19.450> weights<00:03:19.660> so<00:03:20.470> what<00:03:20.560> I've<00:03:20.650> done<00:03:20.769> is

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
the the weights so what I've done is

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.140 
the the weights so what I've done is
marked<00:03:21.250> off<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:22.360> middle<00:03:23.079> so<00:03:23.470> 2<00:03:23.590> feet<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:24.280> I've

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
marked off the middle so 2 feet and I've

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.699 
marked off the middle so 2 feet and I've
done<00:03:25.510> a<00:03:25.540> line<00:03:25.810> down<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:26.079> middle<00:03:27.480> using<00:03:28.480> this

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
done a line down the middle using this

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.319 
done a line down the middle using this
straight<00:03:29.709> edge<00:03:29.739> here<00:03:30.190> just<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.030> give<00:03:31.150> us<00:03:31.209> a

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
straight edge here just to give us a

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.120 
straight edge here just to give us a
guideline<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:32.049> we're<00:03:32.590> basically<00:03:32.739> going<00:03:32.950> to

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
guideline and we're basically going to

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.699 
guideline and we're basically going to
use<00:03:33.280> our<00:03:33.579> exacto<00:03:34.209> knife<00:03:34.390> and<00:03:34.630> score<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.470> line

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
use our exacto knife and score the line

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.060 
use our exacto knife and score the line
as<00:03:36.640> deep<00:03:36.820> as<00:03:36.970> we<00:03:37.000> can<00:03:37.329> and<00:03:37.570> then<00:03:38.170> use<00:03:38.769> a<00:03:38.799> bit<00:03:39.040> of

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
as deep as we can and then use a bit of

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.420 
as deep as we can and then use a bit of
leverage<00:03:39.459> to<00:03:39.489> help<00:03:39.670> peel<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.150> rubber<00:03:40.269> part<00:03:40.780> so

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
leverage to help peel the rubber part so

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.039 
leverage to help peel the rubber part so
this<00:03:42.430> part<00:03:42.760> is<00:03:42.940> a<00:03:42.970> little<00:03:43.060> bit<00:03:43.299> tricky<00:03:43.840> so<00:03:44.019> I

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
this part is a little bit tricky so I

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.170 
this part is a little bit tricky so I
got<00:03:44.230> to<00:03:44.290> put<00:03:44.410> you<00:03:44.560> away<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:45.040> focus<00:03:45.850> on<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.000> cut

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
got to put you away and focus on the cut

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.130 
got to put you away and focus on the cut
but<00:03:46.360> we'll<00:03:46.480> show<00:03:46.600> you<00:03:46.630> what<00:03:46.840> it<00:03:46.900> looks<00:03:47.019> like

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
but we'll show you what it looks like

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.240 
but we'll show you what it looks like
when<00:03:47.290> it's<00:03:47.410> done<00:03:47.560> I<00:03:47.680> just<00:03:47.709> want<00:03:47.950> to<00:03:48.040> show<00:03:48.190> you

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
when it's done I just want to show you

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.160 
when it's done I just want to show you
I've<00:03:49.150> got<00:03:49.390> it<00:03:49.510> propped<00:03:49.840> up<00:03:50.079> here<00:03:50.350> on<00:03:51.989> just<00:03:52.989> a

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
I've got it propped up here on just a

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.400 
I've got it propped up here on just a
piece<00:03:53.380> of<00:03:53.670> foam<00:03:54.670> roller<00:03:55.000> that<00:03:55.239> I<00:03:55.329> have<00:03:55.450> you<00:03:56.260> can

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
piece of foam roller that I have you can

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.100 
piece of foam roller that I have you can
see<00:03:56.650> has<00:03:56.950> I'm<00:03:57.940> scoring<00:03:58.600> that<00:03:58.750> sort<00:03:58.989> of<00:03:59.019> the

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
see has I'm scoring that sort of the

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
lights pretty back here right now that's

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.920 
lights pretty back here right now that's
better<00:04:01.690> as<00:04:02.560> I'm<00:04:02.769> scoring<00:04:03.280> this<00:04:03.600> it's<00:04:04.600> starting

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
better as I'm scoring this it's starting

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.530 
better as I'm scoring this it's starting
to<00:04:05.019> open<00:04:05.049> up<00:04:05.350> a<00:04:05.470> little<00:04:05.560> bit<00:04:05.739> more<00:04:06.040> and<00:04:06.190> more<00:04:06.540> so

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
to open up a little bit more and more so

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.670 
to open up a little bit more and more so
we'll<00:04:07.660> take<00:04:07.840> it<00:04:07.930> all<00:04:08.049> the<00:04:08.079> way<00:04:08.170> down<00:04:08.350> the<00:04:08.440> strip

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
we'll take it all the way down the strip

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.789 
we'll take it all the way down the strip
and<00:04:09.280> eventually<00:04:09.760> lock<00:04:09.880> tube<00:04:10.060> uses<00:04:10.269> a<00:04:10.299> rubber

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
and eventually lock tube uses a rubber

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.960 
and eventually lock tube uses a rubber
stick<00:04:11.799> it<00:04:11.920> takes<00:04:12.040> a<00:04:12.130> while<00:04:12.250> this<00:04:12.519> has<00:04:12.700> been

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
stick it takes a while this has been

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.349 
stick it takes a while this has been
about<00:04:13.260> 15<00:04:14.260> minutes<00:04:14.769> so<00:04:14.890> far<00:04:14.920> a<00:04:15.489> couple<00:04:15.970> of<00:04:16.209> deep

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
about 15 minutes so far a couple of deep

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.270 
about 15 minutes so far a couple of deep
scores<00:04:16.690> a<00:04:16.959> lot<00:04:17.049> of<00:04:17.109> pressure<00:04:17.380> watch<00:04:17.859> yourself

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
scores a lot of pressure watch yourself

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.520 
scores a lot of pressure watch yourself
with<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.519> knife<00:04:18.669> to<00:04:19.049> make<00:04:20.049> sure<00:04:20.200> you<00:04:20.289> get<00:04:20.380> your

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.490 
with the knife to make sure you get your
body<00:04:20.709> out<00:04:20.829> of<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.039> way

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
body out of the way

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.070 
body out of the way
last<00:04:21.680> thing<00:04:21.829> you<00:04:21.890> want<00:04:22.190> is<00:04:22.400> to<00:04:22.780> finish<00:04:23.780> with<00:04:24.050> a

don't have to lift the weights so let's

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.120 
don't have to lift the weights so let's
not<00:04:30.890> do<00:04:31.070> that<00:04:31.190> okay<00:04:31.340> next<00:04:31.850> step<00:04:32.090> is<00:04:32.950> down<00:04:33.950> the

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
sealed up you got yourself a nice

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:24.300 
sealed up you got yourself a nice
lifting<00:05:19.700> platform<00:05:21.340> so<00:05:22.340> that's<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:22.700> base<00:05:22.910> of

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
lifting platform so that's the base of

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.590 
lifting platform so that's the base of
this<00:05:25.310> room<00:05:25.669> basically<00:05:25.910> everything<00:05:26.479> will

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
this room basically everything will

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.060 
this room basically everything will
revolve<00:05:26.930> around<00:05:27.169> this<00:05:27.470> is<00:05:27.680> everything<00:05:27.979> you

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
revolve around this is everything you

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.370 
revolve around this is everything you
need<00:05:28.190> to<00:05:28.310> lift<00:05:28.520> and<00:05:28.729> then<00:05:28.820> I'll<00:05:28.940> build<00:05:29.150> a<00:05:29.450> power

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
need to lift and then I'll build a power

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.710 
need to lift and then I'll build a power
rack<00:05:30.710> that's<00:05:31.010> basically<00:05:31.430> going<00:05:31.760> to<00:05:31.850> be

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
rack that's basically going to be

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.280 
rack that's basically going to be
centered<00:05:33.440> off<00:05:34.000> the<00:05:35.000> the<00:05:35.390> platform<00:05:35.600> there<00:05:36.110> so

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
centered off the the platform there so

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.490 
centered off the the platform there so
it's<00:05:36.380> going<00:05:36.500> to<00:05:36.560> span<00:05:36.860> the<00:05:37.580> four<00:05:38.030> feet<00:05:38.440> for<00:05:39.440> the

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
it's going to span the four feet for the

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.550 
it's going to span the four feet for the
board<00:05:39.740> and<00:05:40.010> come<00:05:40.250> out<00:05:40.340> about<00:05:40.550> three<00:05:40.970> feet<00:05:41.180> and

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
board and come out about three feet and

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.490 
board and come out about three feet and
go<00:05:42.560> up<00:05:42.740> about<00:05:43.070> six<00:05:43.880> and<00:05:43.970> a<00:05:44.090> half<00:05:44.120> feet<00:05:44.600> so<00:05:44.960> be

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
go up about six and a half feet so be

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.520 
go up about six and a half feet so be
