00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.850
 today's video will show you how 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.519
 replace the battery with 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:13.530
 samsung galaxy tab gt and 1000 tablet 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.590
 I just came from China 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.620
 Battery capacity stated 4000 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.380
 milliampere hours and of course first of all 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:25.680
 we will need to disassemble the tablet 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.210
 remove the second idle battery for 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.670
 of this 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:33.530
 Tweezers, first remove the plastic 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.780
 the cap behind which the screws hide 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.120
 I will immediately say the screws 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.589
 non-standard try to show this 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.940
 need such a screwdriver 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:48.289
 triangle shaped camera unfortunately 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.289
 can't focus on her 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.479
 unscrew the screws 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:08.550
 there are only two screws in this tablet 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:10.260
 fasten the body parts unscrewed and 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.330
 Now we proceed to the most difficult 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.390
 we will need a post like this 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:22.640
 metal shovel thin enough 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:24.680
 while not very bending and start 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:30.360
 gently slowly 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.110
 hook up the display from the case having driven it with 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.310
 of this corner 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.600
 deeper as you can see on the video 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:42.290
 a little one corner has already risen 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:52.160
 now we need to gradually 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:52.160
 remove the entire unit from the housing 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:07.640
 be careful not to look for the display 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.640
 hurt the fetus 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.060
 our how 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.660
 their slave to become 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.170
 still chilkot 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.170
 lock 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:13.310
 in the department, the last angle z from the body 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:21.350
 better you noticed further we needed 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:24.810
 already an ordinary screwdriver 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:29.360
 unscrew the screw that holds the battery 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:32.269
 old and using all the same tweezers 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.530
 disable your photo 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:44.519
 the battery here is glued third-party 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:48.840
 Scotch tape peeled off her battery apparently already 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:53.190
 repaired we insert our lot 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.170
 battery to start adhesive tape double sided 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:04:01.640
 better update so it is good 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.640
 kept it cut off 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.500
 such pieces 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.930
 to pry pasted 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.530
 plum 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:41.370
 on tape with scotch country new 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.370
 battery 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.110
 We pass well in places to 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.820
 wrung scotch check it 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:03.880
 holding does not hang out sounds good and 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.880
 snap the power cable 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:19.720
 tighten the screw that holds the batteries 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:22.660
 and put on the case by the way the case 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:26.020
 put on much easier than 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.840
 and it closes the board out of it just 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:40.650
 first we pass through the side where the connector 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:40.650
 and gradually replace the screws 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.360
 and 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:17.500
 glue decorative caps here and 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.170
 All I think is that the tablet is not now 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.000
 will turn on as the battery has done 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.650
 long way and most likely completely 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.890
 size 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:31.330
 Onent view Chinese curator 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:34.960
 completely working and maybe even 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.670
 charged hopefully it was useful again 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.410
 I repeat, be very careful 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:42.490
 when will you work this metal 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:46.200
 remove the whole block with a spatula 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.200
 and motherboard from the case
