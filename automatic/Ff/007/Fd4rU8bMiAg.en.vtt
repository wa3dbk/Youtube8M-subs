00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:18.229
 so hello and welcome for this he was dismissed 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.029
 today let's play percent and part% and so water with a 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.029
 bide the simple steak a part of limit hold'em the trustee 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:30.419
 the goal must be to create equality with the numbers of this 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.419
 tool 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.940
 % and it's a kind of poker tracker 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.600
 the euro can be described as improving 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.870
 insofar as it offers a panel of statistics is much more advanced 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.200
 % and so here we go you project you started a little bit 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.600
 figures that Tunisians to make decisions against players 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.940
 so typically here a raise so cissed of shit no need to look 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.610
 for its baptism of fire the style that is to say in the fed because 63% 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.730
 example the red the players 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.620
 and that it was normal 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.440
 so that's for sure unique feeling during hotel constancy before thing 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.440
 but obviously if we're going to be dealing with some kind of crazy bastard 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.690
 de paul biya is holding 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.300
 e seill preflop people 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.690
 it is a big effort following a factor of the continuation is of +0 3% 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.910
 which is therefore quite weak 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.940
 e business to follow from France to move from chin recourent comment 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.400
 more about this player cold war kids 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.130
 for them I sat uncle on this table 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.780
 because 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.050
 but this player 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.480
 all that is human 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.110
 who invited 48-cent units 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.160
 why do we hurry from his team they can compromise 18 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.910
 so if for the ird 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.370
 too little aggressive for a table of suite max 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.110
 for sure without asking for it so why so here is typically 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.440
 as and precisely we see three animals extremely high three animals 18% 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.020
 it's really a lot that promised modes like 5 to 6 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.950
 August for example 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.979
 so against that day if I decide for the site effectiveness
