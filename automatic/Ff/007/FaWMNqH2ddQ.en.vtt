00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.149 
time but sit what if I don't get the
glitch<00:01:28.049> we'll<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.770> go<00:01:28.860> through<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
glitch we'll have to go through the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.730 
glitch we'll have to go through the
level<00:01:29.400> normally<00:01:29.820> yeah<00:01:30.780> all<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.439> have<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.619> do

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
level normally yeah all you have to do

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.170 
level normally yeah all you have to do
is<00:01:31.860> save<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.250> reload<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.610> file<00:01:32.790> which<00:01:33.030> will

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
is save and reload the file which will

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.940 
is save and reload the file which will
put<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.420> back<00:01:33.630> at<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.810> server<00:01:34.020> level<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.890> you

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
put you back at the server level so you

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.340 
put you back at the server level so you
can<00:01:35.369> try<00:01:35.490> again<00:01:35.810> unless<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.960> play<00:01:37.110> with<00:01:37.259> our

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
can try again unless you play with our

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.740 
can try again unless you play with our
memory<00:01:37.650> card<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.159> which<00:01:38.400> case<00:01:38.610> kill<00:01:39.390> yourself

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
memory card in which case kill yourself

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.370 
memory card in which case kill yourself
and<00:01:40.650> then<00:01:40.799> try<00:01:40.950> again<00:01:41.090> so<00:01:42.090> why<00:01:42.420> exactly<00:01:42.689> does

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
and then try again so why exactly does

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.740 
and then try again so why exactly does
this<00:01:43.619> glitch<00:01:43.829> work<00:01:44.159> well<00:01:44.759> I'm<00:01:45.030> no<00:01:45.210> programmer

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
this glitch work well I'm no programmer

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.840 
this glitch work well I'm no programmer
but<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.110> can<00:01:46.259> take<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.470> guess<00:01:46.680> my<00:01:47.340> guess<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.729> that

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
but I can take a guess my guess is that

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.429 
but I can take a guess my guess is that
during<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.240> small<00:01:48.509> cutscenes<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.170> make<00:01:49.320> use

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
during the small cutscenes that make use

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.200 
during the small cutscenes that make use
of<00:01:49.470> gameplay<00:01:49.890> assets<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.790> one<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
of gameplay assets like this one in the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.090 
of gameplay assets like this one in the
loop<00:01:51.390> victory<00:01:51.720> dances<00:01:52.020> Raymond<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.560> put<00:01:52.860> into

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
loop victory dances Raymond is put into

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.170 
loop victory dances Raymond is put into
a<00:01:53.130> different<00:01:53.460> state

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
a different state

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.270 
a different state
a<00:01:54.210> state<00:01:54.899> where<00:01:55.079> he<00:01:55.170> can<00:01:55.380> still<00:01:55.710> die<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.100> case

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
a state where he can still die in case

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.920 
a state where he can still die in case
the<00:01:56.430> custom<00:01:56.759> requires<00:01:57.180> him<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.840> way

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
the custom requires him to but the way

the custom requires him to but the way
the<00:01:57.990> power-ups<00:01:58.439> can<00:01:58.590> not<00:01:59.009> run<00:01:59.280> out<00:01:59.369> because

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
the power-ups can not run out because

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.789 
the power-ups can not run out because
well<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.869> would<00:02:00.990> look<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.200> bit<00:02:01.229> silly<00:02:01.560> for<00:02:01.770> a

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
well it would look a bit silly for a

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.380 
well it would look a bit silly for a
powerup<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.219> run<00:02:02.460> out<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.759> cutscene<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
powerup to run out of it cutscene the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.209 
powerup to run out of it cutscene the
little<00:02:03.899> twitching<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.530> camera<00:02:04.890> which<00:02:05.070> is

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
little twitching of the camera which is

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.770 
little twitching of the camera which is
caused<00:02:05.460> by<00:02:05.640> either<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.090> angle<00:02:06.360> change<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.689> the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
caused by either the angle change of the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.510 
caused by either the angle change of the
camera<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.290> effect<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.770> Raymond<00:02:08.099> gets<00:02:08.340> moved

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
camera to effect that Raymond gets moved

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.249 
camera to effect that Raymond gets moved
to<00:02:08.610> another<00:02:08.819> location<00:02:08.940> or<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> combination<00:02:09.959> of

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
to another location or a combination of

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.960 
to another location or a combination of
both<00:02:10.470> probably<00:02:11.009> causes<00:02:11.340> Raymond<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.819> get

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
both probably causes Raymond to get

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.550 
both probably causes Raymond to get
stuck

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
stuck
