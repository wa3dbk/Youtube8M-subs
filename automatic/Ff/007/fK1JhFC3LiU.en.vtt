00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:08.360

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.290
 This is what I bought today 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:19.270

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:27.289
 Nan de intuition Taka Tteyuu capital land tour Well of this Tteyuu issue r of nx 1 previous generation of guy 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:33.710
 I already have 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:37.489
 I say this way, and in that case it is the one who is entrusted with the pair 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:43.129
 Then when you ask me that it was the melt-in that I bought 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:46.309
 Rather than a photo, I use this kind of camera and it is a situation I would have been reported 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.310
 It is by all means that it is very easy to understand 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:52.620
 Our party 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:58.710
 0 Company Hey Oh that they want you to be or used towards the staff partners 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:04.890

 Good good camera if this is buy anyway Well I bought this camera in the fact that Na 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.300
 Because it is the first 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.110
 T 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:17.110
 So easy to use the number of makex r or the number of this latest model t Sony's best 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.520
 I recommend you think 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:24.890
 I will try only a 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:30.179
 It is acd taste EP 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:37.229
 But I think that can be seen and get a look at here from the version of 55 t 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:40.390
 This pan and touch it is to the camera next to bread and Tatchisumaho and a Well image transfer 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:46.240
 You seem to be able to 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:50.220
 I'd difference between that issue r and eh O and number t that 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.220
 I heard that there is no difference for most 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:02:04.240
 I think it's a boober update, but just ah ー orr itself 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:04.240
 The potential is very good and both woo 5 r 5 ato use both 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.200
 ducati paka and ah 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.840
 Your Man 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.270
 I definitely think that I'm right or wrong 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.410
 Yes 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.670
 Then 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.970
 It is contents eh 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.780
 Good morning yes this time 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.960
 I also like 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:34.140
 It has to White 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:40.150
 No. r Fiber dishes also a little 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:43.989
 I feel like I'm getting lighter now yes then the staff 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:48.069
 The amount of strap that course course here and here of the house 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:51.280
 It's the type of sandwich I know than I do not like so much 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:56.020
 Strap In fact, I used that person to another 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:03:00.330
 It is a type festival that supports this one point only 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:03.360
 Well it This is the flash 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.300
 Eh this 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.920
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.480
 So 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:19.069
 It's part of yeahkko 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:22.310
 Poton 5 so far to say r frequency s it with another exactly the same, it is now wildebeest Esashi US ports 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.040
 Now if the Well clicks into place because 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.799
 Well flash is healthy 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:32.819
 I have probably never used it since I bought it 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:36.120
 It is nice to use in battery 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:40.319
 Also 5 t be that this Ru fiber 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:43.650
 It 's the same as the Sony TV series because the battery plans are together 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:49.970
 You can now wear it 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:53.489
 So I got quite a lot of spare batteries, but it's the same as planning 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:58.230
 You can wear it 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:04:00.819
 I think that it is useful to have some spare batteries 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.069
 The last is Nea 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:07.569
 This time 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.950
 When the fine is short Hey before the 5 r 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.129
 number 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.450
 This that great of this battery charger 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:19.519
 That long long was so maybe this 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:26.030
 Maybe I think this one meter or less from one person etc. 1m freshness 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:27.770
 Conversely, when charging by connecting to that PC , this long without needing a long cable 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.400
 If it's about, you said your neck 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.370
 It is a useful 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.540
 so 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:38.500
 8 It is a form of saying Well directly in usb 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:41.560
 You can also plug it into that PC 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.289
 I say battery usb charger 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.930
 Easy but 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:51.070
 To in this 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:53.670
 It is Tteyuu Econo 5 in pointing Well outlet 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.670
 This part 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.870
 Hmm 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:01.199
 In this part 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.199
 Please insert 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:07.200
 Plug it into this part 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.070
 Charge by 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.860
 Also say 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:18.960
 By say 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:20.879
 I have n't used that yet, and I think there is a difference between the application and that kind of thing 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.860
 I think, but probably that 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:30.000
 Reflected was the I mean clear at the time say to thin pie of that SLR 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.880
 I think 5 r and 5 t are almost the same 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.750
 Take by a child 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:37.900
 Though it is 5 ra that is 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:45.810
 It is by all means in form 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:48.840
 This Sony nex absolutely when taking a camera with a movie or a still image 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.129
 5 r 5 t is recommended a 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:57.489
 Let's buy a 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:06:03.699
 There is already a memory card, so the memory card of the cat is not attached to the main unit, so it is separated by the sound 

00:05:57.489 --> 00:06:08.050
 You need to buy a good body and sd car together and buy now 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:12.639
 I think that I would like you to rapidly take Animated Picture 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:15.729

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:19.199
