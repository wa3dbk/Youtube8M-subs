00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.090 
alright I'm going to do a quick tip on

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.820 
alright I'm going to do a quick tip on
how<00:00:05.750> to<00:00:05.780> use<00:00:05.990> 0<00:00:06.470> measure<00:00:06.650> um<00:00:07.870> most<00:00:08.870> efficiently

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
how to use 0 measure um most efficiently

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.080 
how to use 0 measure um most efficiently
and<00:00:10.220> uh<00:00:10.280> and<00:00:11.140> and<00:00:12.140> just<00:00:12.380> most<00:00:12.940> just<00:00:13.940> the

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
and uh and and just most just the

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.569 
and uh and and just most just the
fastest<00:00:14.390> way<00:00:14.420> to<00:00:14.570> use<00:00:14.720> it<00:00:14.870> so<00:00:14.900> i<00:00:15.349> have<00:00:15.860> this<00:00:15.889> 3

00:00:16.569 --> 00:00:16.579 
fastest way to use it so i have this 3

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.239 
fastest way to use it so i have this 3
million<00:00:16.970> polygon<00:00:17.509> mesh<00:00:18.259> and<00:00:18.650> it's<00:00:18.829> just<00:00:19.099> a

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:19.249 
million polygon mesh and it's just a

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:21.849 
million polygon mesh and it's just a
happy<00:00:20.210> little<00:00:20.300> guy<00:00:20.570> and<00:00:20.869> it's<00:00:21.079> got<00:00:21.289> one<00:00:21.560> big

of little tiny skin detail and um it's
got<00:00:35.570> no<00:00:35.719> subdivision<00:00:36.050> levels<00:00:37.000> say<00:00:38.000> i've<00:00:38.179> been

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
got no subdivision levels say i've been

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.380 
got no subdivision levels say i've been
just<00:00:38.660> doing<00:00:38.750> dynamesh<00:00:39.320> and<00:00:40.030> it's<00:00:41.030> just<00:00:41.239> up<00:00:41.359> to

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
just doing dynamesh and it's just up to

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.450 
just doing dynamesh and it's just up to
3<00:00:41.690> million<00:00:41.870> and<00:00:42.170> i<00:00:42.199> want<00:00:42.379> to<00:00:42.440> do<00:00:42.620> a<00:00:42.829> zebra

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
3 million and i want to do a zebra

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.299 
3 million and i want to do a zebra
measure<00:00:43.789> so<00:00:44.120> you<00:00:44.870> know<00:00:45.039> we<00:00:46.039> could<00:00:46.129> talk<00:00:46.280> about

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
measure so you know we could talk about

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.310 
measure so you know we could talk about
using<00:00:46.879> the<00:00:47.000> settings<00:00:47.300> right<00:00:47.660> all<00:00:47.839> day<00:00:48.050> but<00:00:48.109> i

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
using the settings right all day but i

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.450 
using the settings right all day but i
mean<00:00:48.530> i<00:00:48.769> think<00:00:49.160> as<00:00:49.399> far<00:00:49.429> as<00:00:49.760> speed<00:00:50.149> goes<00:00:51.460> you

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
mean i think as far as speed goes you

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.739 
mean i think as far as speed goes you
know<00:00:52.579> i<00:00:52.609> want<00:00:52.969> to<00:00:53.030> take<00:00:53.149> this<00:00:53.179> guy<00:00:53.449> down<00:00:53.480> to

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:53.749 
know i want to take this guy down to

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:57.130 
know i want to take this guy down to
5,000<00:00:54.910> so<00:00:55.910> far<00:00:56.300> I<00:00:56.329> haven't<00:00:56.749> really<00:00:56.960> seen

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
5,000 so far I haven't really seen

5,000 so far I haven't really seen
anybody<00:00:57.379> talk<00:00:57.679> about<00:00:57.949> any<00:00:58.159> way<00:00:58.370> other<00:00:58.609> than

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
something like this like three million

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.100 
something like this like three million
down<00:01:06.620> to<00:01:06.740> 5,000<00:01:07.370> but<00:01:08.210> you<00:01:08.570> know<00:01:08.660> your<00:01:08.900> problem

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
down to 5,000 but you know your problem

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.010 
down to 5,000 but you know your problem
is<00:01:09.410> you<00:01:09.650> don't<00:01:09.770> really<00:01:10.040> care<00:01:10.430> about<00:01:10.580> all<00:01:11.480> the

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
is you don't really care about all the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.480 
is you don't really care about all the
stuff<00:01:12.260> is<00:01:12.440> trying<00:01:12.710> to<00:01:12.800> figure<00:01:13.010> out<00:01:13.070> right<00:01:13.310> now

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
stuff is trying to figure out right now

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.840 
stuff is trying to figure out right now
um<00:01:13.730> it's<00:01:14.240> trying<00:01:14.600> to<00:01:15.010> look<00:01:16.010> at<00:01:16.220> all<00:01:16.460> these

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
um it's trying to look at all these

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.210 
um it's trying to look at all these
little<00:01:17.210> cracks<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.200> crevices<00:01:18.710> and<00:01:18.740> and

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
little cracks and crevices and and

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.000 
little cracks and crevices and and
trying<00:01:19.880> to<00:01:19.970> apologize<00:01:20.300> based<00:01:20.840> on<00:01:21.050> that<00:01:21.230> but

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
trying to apologize based on that but

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.260 
trying to apologize based on that but
then<00:01:22.310> it's<00:01:22.490> trying<00:01:22.790> to<00:01:22.850> take<00:01:23.030> it<00:01:23.120> down<00:01:23.180> to

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
then it's trying to take it down to

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.740 
then it's trying to take it down to
5,000<00:01:23.840> or<00:01:23.960> I<00:01:24.230> don't<00:01:24.380> know<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.650> exact<00:01:25.100> order<00:01:25.370> of

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
5,000 or I don't know the exact order of

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.630 
5,000 or I don't know the exact order of
that<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:26.900> code<00:01:27.080> goes<00:01:27.290> in<00:01:27.500> but<00:01:27.650> anyway<00:01:28.010> this<00:01:28.490> is

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
that the code goes in but anyway this is

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.070 
that the code goes in but anyway this is
going<00:01:28.760> to<00:01:28.820> take<00:01:28.910> much<00:01:29.300> much<00:01:29.570> she<00:01:29.720> loved<00:01:29.870> so

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
going to take much much she loved so

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.790 
going to take much much she loved so
let's<00:01:30.650> try<00:01:30.830> it<00:01:30.890> faster<00:01:31.400> weight<00:01:31.550> right<00:01:31.790> um<00:01:32.090> and

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
let's try it faster weight right um and

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.800 
let's try it faster weight right um and
my<00:01:33.800> idea<00:01:34.190> is<00:01:34.400> that<00:01:34.430> you<00:01:34.610> just<00:01:35.060> duplicate<00:01:35.660> it

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
my idea is that you just duplicate it

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.740 
my idea is that you just duplicate it
and<00:01:36.550> you<00:01:37.550> just<00:01:37.670> want<00:01:37.940> to<00:01:38.030> die<00:01:38.180> nimesha<00:01:38.450> first

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
and you just want to die nimesha first

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.990 
and you just want to die nimesha first
that's<00:01:39.170> all<00:01:39.320> you<00:01:39.470> do<00:01:39.620> is<00:01:39.860> uh<00:01:39.920> we<00:01:40.460> could<00:01:40.760> even<00:01:40.880> do

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
that's all you do is uh we could even do

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.900 
that's all you do is uh we could even do
something<00:01:41.330> high<00:01:41.480> let's<00:01:41.690> do<00:01:41.840> 200<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:43.670> let's

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
something high let's do 200 and let's

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.420 
something high let's do 200 and let's
just<00:01:44.090> dynamesh<00:01:44.450> it<00:01:44.660> and<00:01:44.840> i<00:01:45.830> was<00:01:46.040> already<00:01:46.250> done

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
just dynamesh it and i was already done

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.720 
just dynamesh it and i was already done
now<00:01:47.320> now<00:01:48.320> let's<00:01:48.710> zero<00:01:49.070> rush<00:01:49.370> that<00:01:50.740> and<00:01:51.740> you

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
now now let's zero rush that and you

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
now now let's zero rush that and you
could<00:01:52.910> go<00:01:53.000> lower<00:01:53.270> depending<00:01:53.720> on<00:01:54.190> um<00:01:55.630> you<00:01:56.630> know

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
could go lower depending on um you know

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.780 
could go lower depending on um you know
how<00:01:56.900> complex<00:01:57.290> your<00:01:57.530> form<00:01:57.740> is<00:01:57.860> you<00:01:58.250> don't<00:01:58.580> want

that's the dynamesh and then that's a

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.280 
that's the dynamesh and then that's a
zero<00:02:22.819> might<00:02:23.060> afterwards<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.810> now<00:02:23.989> we<00:02:24.050> already

and<00:02:48.019> it's<00:02:48.380> one<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.709> best<00:02:48.980> features<00:02:49.190> of

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
and it's one of the best features of

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.580 
and it's one of the best features of
ZBrush<00:02:49.819> but<00:02:50.420> you<00:02:50.630> just<00:02:50.810> don't<00:02:51.049> want<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.380> feed

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
ZBrush but you just don't want to feed

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.699 
ZBrush but you just don't want to feed
it<00:02:52.299> three<00:02:53.299> million<00:02:53.569> polygons<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.319> tongue<00:02:54.560> to

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
it three million polygons and tongue to

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.430 
it three million polygons and tongue to
figure<00:02:54.950> it<00:02:55.069> all<00:02:55.160> out<00:02:55.220> so<00:02:55.819> you<00:02:56.720> just<00:02:56.870> dynamesh

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
at first and then see your mesh side and

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.440 
at first and then see your mesh side and
then<00:03:00.200> you're<00:03:00.319> good<00:03:00.519> that's<00:03:01.519> all<00:03:01.670> of<00:03:02.150> this<00:03:02.329> on
