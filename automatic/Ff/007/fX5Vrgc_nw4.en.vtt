but as you can see it does regenerate
all<00:01:30.970> the<00:01:31.090> time<00:01:31.360> then<00:01:32.229> that's<00:01:32.649> what<00:01:32.830> i<00:01:32.890> mean<00:01:33.070> by

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
all the time then that's what i mean by

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.830 
all the time then that's what i mean by
a<00:01:33.310> certain<00:01:33.670> amount<00:01:33.789> of<00:01:33.880> time<00:01:34.149> but<00:01:34.450> it<00:01:34.659> means

basically<00:01:41.380> what<00:01:41.830> mullet<00:01:42.220> mine<00:01:42.399> does<00:01:42.759> it<00:01:42.939> works

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
basically what mullet mine does it works

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.029 
basically what mullet mine does it works
with<00:01:43.360> every<00:01:43.899> block<00:01:44.110> in<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.409> game<00:01:44.619> as<00:01:44.830> you<00:01:44.890> can

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
with every block in the game as you can

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.980
