00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 Hello friends my name is Andrew and 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.490
 Now I will show you how to make bombs. 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.560
 for the bathroom, then does not know the bath bombs 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.240
 is such we can say who is not cosmetics 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.790
 designed for making watts you 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.830
 throw it into the water it starts to hiss 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.109
 the most highlighting all sorts of odorous healing 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.730
 note substances odorous healing will 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.770
 your bath bomb depends only 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.449
 from you that you put there for us 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.090
 need any capacity soda lemon 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.740
 acid and some flavor I took 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.000
 just a freshener for air new i 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.980
 already said you can take any 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.630
 healing substance and so the process itself 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.279
 cooking is extremely simple we need 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.590
 mix citric acid and vessels 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.660
 proportions two to one two parts dream and 1 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.820
 an hour of citric acid here 9 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.190
 a bag of citric acid each 20 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.960
 gram that is generally 180 grams of lemon 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.850
 acid i mean i spill out all this 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.980
 citric acid in a container and put in two 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.980
 times the court that is 360 grams 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.420
 after we mixed two parts of soda 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.610
 and 1 hour citric acid we need everything 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.320
 mix thoroughly and then add 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.149
 the smell that is the air trap 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.310
 reaction time between citric acid 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.229
 and soda and will start but very very tight 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.580
 the mass will get a little thick with it 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.580
 will dazzle small to flash drive 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.799
 well that's all most of the work we already 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.689
 completed as desired, you can add 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.220
 paint but I somehow do not really want 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.659
 take possession of the invited and be red and 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.460
 green as I said mass 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.810
 it will gradually be a matter for which 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.119
 can be sculpted roundels 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.039
 you need to wait for this periodically a minute 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.840
 minute you need to stir after some 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.690
 time the mixture has become ready on how to 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.010
 solid and need to sculpt balls but need 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.010
 compress them hard 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.870
 as you can see I already made three balls well 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.530
 On 4, I decided to make a small 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.540
 experiment 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.080
 add the same sweep as 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.080
 dye 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.209
 such a ball turned Zelenky but 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.600
 consistency you a lot wrong him 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.069
 what 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.140
 green water is still his liquid 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.790
 the computer is supplied but special weather 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.080
 it does not change and it does not bother him 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.330
 used for its intended purpose 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.190
 but often she was furious by the way 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.200
 you can not store such balls 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.030
 long and if you keep these balls you 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.500
 wet conditions that reaction may 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.090
 start premature therefore 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.489
 I recommend using them right after 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.760
 making but let's throw 1 ball 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.760
 water 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.390
 as you can see he hisses and hisses 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.400
 for quite a long time remember i talked 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.440
 that the green ball is very blurred 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.050
 but now it's the other way around he really 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.530
 very very strong and even the third one 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.530
 balloons 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.310
 if you like these balls for 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.680
 water subscribe to the channel and put 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.160
 Like, but I tell you thanks for watching 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.160
 bye everyone
