and i'll be showing some rest and
alternatives<00:00:15.059> with<00:00:15.299> this<00:00:15.619> so<00:00:16.619> let's<00:00:17.100> start

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
alternatives with this so let's start

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.500 
alternatives with this so let's start
off<00:00:17.580> with<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.240> clock<00:00:18.960> i<00:00:19.230> made<00:00:19.590> up<00:00:19.910> it's<00:00:20.910> already

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
off with a clock i made up it's already

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.529 
off with a clock i made up it's already
been<00:00:22.140> it's<00:00:23.010> already<00:00:23.519> been<00:00:23.730> invented<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
been it's already been invented in the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.859 
been it's already been invented in the
pc<00:00:25.289> version<00:00:25.490> with<00:00:26.490> like<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> command<00:00:27.420> block<00:00:27.599> and

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
pc version with like a command block and

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.470 
pc version with like a command block and
a<00:00:27.900> power<00:00:28.170> drill<00:00:28.619> under<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.119> would

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
a power drill under it so it would

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.170 
a power drill under it so it would
switch<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.410> daytime<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.730> kind<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.120> stuff

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
switch to daytime and that kind of stuff

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.450 
switch to daytime and that kind of stuff
so<00:00:33.829> um<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.399> was<00:00:35.790> thinking<00:00:35.850> like<00:00:36.540> maybe<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.860> should

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
so um I was thinking like maybe I should

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.780 
so um I was thinking like maybe I should
do<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.420> mcp<00:00:40.140> equal<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:41.070> doesn't<00:00:41.610> power

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
do it in a mcp equal it doesn't power

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.910 
do it in a mcp equal it doesn't power
anything<00:00:42.450> or<00:00:42.780> something<00:00:43.379> like<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.559> because

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
anything or something like that because

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.490 
anything or something like that because
we<00:00:44.640> don't<00:00:44.789> have<00:00:44.879> rats<00:00:45.300> them<00:00:45.629> yet<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.230> we<00:00:46.469> have

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
we don't have rats them yet but we have

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.049 
we don't have rats them yet but we have
power<00:00:46.829> drills<00:00:47.250> that's<00:00:47.550> actually<00:00:48.030> very

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
power drills that's actually very

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.369 
power drills that's actually very
strange<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:49.850> whatsoever<00:00:50.850> um<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.140> how<00:00:52.320> it

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
strange but whatsoever um this is how it

cannot be placed here because then the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.420 
cannot be placed here because then the
minecart<00:01:41.820> will<00:01:42.060> get<00:01:42.270> stuck<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.079> top<00:01:43.430> as

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
that you have to have a block over here

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.240 
that you have to have a block over here
otherwise<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.719> minecart<00:01:58.200> could<00:01:58.469> also<00:01:58.740> go<00:01:59.219> the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
otherwise the minecart could also go the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.850 
otherwise the minecart could also go the
opposite<00:01:59.820> way<00:01:59.880> as<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.360> want<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.649> is

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.160 
adventure map or something it's nothing
from<00:02:21.480> 0.8<00:02:22.440> 10<00:02:22.890> but<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.220> thought<00:02:23.610> like<00:02:23.850> oh

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
from 0.8 10 but I thought like oh

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.190 
from 0.8 10 but I thought like oh
actually<00:02:25.170> it's<00:02:25.320> pretty<00:02:25.560> cool<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.960> pour<00:02:27.960> some

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
actually it's pretty cool so pour some

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.570 
actually it's pretty cool so pour some
water<00:02:28.380> down<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:30.080> it<00:02:31.080> makes<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.980> door<00:02:32.190> fall

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
water down and it makes the door fall

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.870 
water down and it makes the door fall
down<00:02:33.050> now<00:02:34.050> basically<00:02:34.590> how<00:02:34.950> this<00:02:35.220> works<00:02:35.550> is

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
down now basically how this works is

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.810 
down now basically how this works is
meet<00:02:36.390> destroy<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.380> water<00:02:37.620> how<00:02:38.430> this<00:02:38.670> works<00:02:39.060> is

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
meet destroy the water how this works is

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.650 
meet destroy the water how this works is
you<00:02:41.820> got<00:02:42.500> just<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.710> hole<00:02:43.980> over<00:02:44.220> here<00:02:44.430> some<00:02:45.330> signs

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
you got just a hole over here some signs

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.930 
you got just a hole over here some signs
which<00:02:46.020> will<00:02:46.230> stop<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.830> water<00:02:47.070> from<00:02:47.190> falling

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
which will stop the water from falling

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.990 
which will stop the water from falling
down<00:02:47.970> this<00:02:48.930> point<00:02:49.200> will<00:02:49.410> also<00:02:49.800> break<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.640> sand

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
down this point will also break the sand

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.770 
down this point will also break the sand
or<00:02:51.210> gravel<00:02:51.450> whatever<00:02:52.080> your<00:02:52.260> place<00:02:52.470> down<00:02:52.800> um

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
or gravel whatever your place down um

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.340 
or gravel whatever your place down um
then<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.840> place<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.380> torch<00:02:55.740> over<00:02:56.100> here<00:02:56.810> so<00:02:57.810> the

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
then you place a torch over here so the

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.800 
then you place a torch over here so the
water<00:02:58.620> comes<00:02:59.160> down<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.700> will<00:03:00.060> break<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.540> torch

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
water comes down it will break the torch

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.070 
water comes down it will break the torch
and<00:03:01.110> then<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.310> gravel<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:02.940> sand<00:03:03.180> will<00:03:03.480> fall

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.290 

you<00:03:07.080> can<00:03:07.320> do<00:03:07.500> this<00:03:07.710> with<00:03:07.770> both<00:03:08.250> sand<00:03:09.090> and

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
you can do this with both sand and

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.020 
you can do this with both sand and
gravel<00:03:09.750> just<00:03:10.230> any<00:03:10.440> block<00:03:10.710> with<00:03:10.920> gravity<00:03:11.460> but

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
gravel just any block with gravity but

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.570 
gravel just any block with gravity but
the<00:03:12.390> only<00:03:12.570> blocks<00:03:12.960> of<00:03:13.110> gravity<00:03:13.620> or<00:03:13.890> sand<00:03:14.400> and

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
the only blocks of gravity or sand and

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.510 
the only blocks of gravity or sand and
gravel<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:15.210> yeah<00:03:15.540> let<00:03:16.530> me<00:03:16.650> show<00:03:16.680> you<00:03:16.950> guys<00:03:17.220> one

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
gravel so yeah let me show you guys one

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.150 
gravel so yeah let me show you guys one
more<00:03:17.700> time<00:03:17.910> that<00:03:18.180> works<00:03:18.570> and<00:03:18.870> then<00:03:19.740> there<00:03:20.040> it

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
more time that works and then there it

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.700 
more time that works and then there it
goes<00:03:20.370> so<00:03:20.940> it's<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.210> pretty<00:03:21.450> cool<00:03:21.720> thing<00:03:21.780> the

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
goes so it's a pretty cool thing the

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.160 
goes so it's a pretty cool thing the
only<00:03:22.980> thing<00:03:23.310> that<00:03:24.060> I<00:03:24.270> think<00:03:24.330> is<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:25.020> bit

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
only thing that I think is a bit

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.550 
only thing that I think is a bit
negative<00:03:25.440> about<00:03:25.950> this<00:03:26.220> is<00:03:26.460> the<00:03:26.910> water<00:03:27.240> and<00:03:27.600> the

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
negative about this is the water and the

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.090 
negative about this is the water and the
hole<00:03:29.420> so<00:03:30.420> yeah<00:03:30.690> you<00:03:30.750> can<00:03:31.050> it<00:03:31.290> jumps

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
hole so yeah you can it jumps

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.060 
hole so yeah you can it jumps
automatically<00:03:32.940> over<00:03:33.330> it<00:03:33.450> but<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:34.620> doesn't

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
automatically over it but it doesn't

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.130 
automatically over it but it doesn't
look<00:03:35.220> very<00:03:35.250> nice<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.240> I'll<00:03:36.420> show<00:03:36.630> you<00:03:36.660> guys<00:03:36.900> in

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
look very nice and I'll show you guys in

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.760 
look very nice and I'll show you guys in
the<00:03:37.170> next<00:03:37.260> one<00:03:37.680> what<00:03:38.580> is<00:03:38.850> so<00:03:39.150> bad<00:03:39.360> about<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:39.770> so

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
the next one what is so bad about it so

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.520 
the next one what is so bad about it so
this<00:03:41.220> one<00:03:41.550> as<00:03:42.300> you<00:03:42.450> can<00:03:42.570> see<00:03:42.780> it's<00:03:42.990> quite<00:03:43.200> big

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
this one as you can see it's quite big

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.650 
this one as you can see it's quite big
it's<00:03:43.830> also<00:03:44.070> retirement<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:45.180> can<00:03:45.330> make<00:03:45.450> as

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
it's also retirement you can make as

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.380 
it's also retirement you can make as
long<00:03:46.110> as<00:03:46.320> you<00:03:46.410> want<00:03:46.620> as<00:03:46.770> high<00:03:47.220> as<00:03:47.490> short<00:03:47.880> or<00:03:48.120> as

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
long as you want as high as short or as

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.880 
long as you want as high as short or as
small<00:03:48.810> as<00:03:49.140> one<00:03:49.380> of<00:03:49.410> course<00:03:49.800> so<00:03:50.580> it<00:03:50.850> says<00:03:51.890> place

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
small as one of course so it says place

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.030 
small as one of course so it says place
any<00:03:53.190> block<00:03:53.520> between<00:03:53.760> these<00:03:54.120> proofs<00:03:54.480> planks<00:03:55.080> so

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
any block between these proofs planks so

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.430 
any block between these proofs planks so
let<00:03:56.400> me<00:03:56.430> first<00:03:56.790> explain<00:03:57.300> you<00:03:57.660> guys<00:03:57.840> what<00:03:58.290> it

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
let me first explain you guys what it

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.720 
let me first explain you guys what it
does<00:03:58.650> if<00:03:59.400> you<00:03:59.700> place<00:04:00.000> any<00:04:00.330> block<00:04:00.750> over<00:04:01.440> here<00:04:01.730> so

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
does if you place any block over here so

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.120 
does if you place any block over here so
over<00:04:03.060> here<00:04:03.090> if<00:04:03.960> you<00:04:04.050> place<00:04:04.350> whoops<00:04:04.650> if<00:04:04.950> you

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
over here if you place whoops if you

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.350 
over here if you place whoops if you
place<00:04:05.370> any<00:04:05.610> block<00:04:06.530> there<00:04:07.580> well<00:04:08.580> one<00:04:09.150> higher

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
place any block there well one higher

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.570 
place any block there well one higher
but<00:04:09.690> if<00:04:09.720> you<00:04:09.930> place<00:04:10.170> blood<00:04:10.530> there<00:04:10.770> nevermind

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
but if you place blood there nevermind

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.890 
but if you place blood there nevermind
um<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:12.450> cacti<00:04:12.960> will<00:04:13.230> fall<00:04:13.820> which<00:04:14.820> will<00:04:15.660> break

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
um the cacti will fall which will break

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.810 
um the cacti will fall which will break
this<00:04:16.080> sign<00:04:16.380> which<00:04:17.010> will<00:04:17.190> break<00:04:17.400> this<00:04:17.549> time

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
this sign which will break this time

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.990 
this sign which will break this time
that<00:04:18.060> was<00:04:18.270> bandaged<00:04:19.170> on<00:04:19.380> this<00:04:19.739> sign<00:04:20.010> which

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
that was bandaged on this sign which

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.510 
that was bandaged on this sign which
will<00:04:21.270> make<00:04:21.419> this<00:04:21.690> sand<00:04:22.020> fall<00:04:22.410> down<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:22.890> that

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
will make this sand fall down and that

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.090 
will make this sand fall down and that
will<00:04:23.700> go<00:04:23.850> to<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.180> next<00:04:24.390> one

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
will go to the next one

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.930 
will go to the next one
and<00:04:25.250> it<00:04:25.460> just<00:04:25.490> keeps<00:04:26.120> on<00:04:26.450> going<00:04:26.870> all<00:04:27.170> the<00:04:27.500> way

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
and it just keeps on going all the way

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.090 
and it just keeps on going all the way
until<00:04:28.940> we<00:04:29.900> get<00:04:30.220> over<00:04:31.220> here<00:04:32.260> where<00:04:33.260> we<00:04:33.590> get

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
until we get over here where we get

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.380 
until we get over here where we get
where<00:04:34.550> we<00:04:34.700> got<00:04:34.940> a<00:04:35.180> door<00:04:35.710> just<00:04:36.710> the<00:04:37.250> sign<00:04:37.580> with

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
where we got a door just the sign with

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.130 
where we got a door just the sign with
two<00:04:38.420> pieces<00:04:39.230> of<00:04:39.380> sand<00:04:40.160> on<00:04:40.490> it<00:04:40.520> and<00:04:40.880> it<00:04:41.840> will

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
two pieces of sand on it and it will

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.920 
two pieces of sand on it and it will

cacti but not with the door system so
yeah<00:04:53.750> let's<00:04:53.990> check<00:04:54.560> out<00:04:54.710> if<00:04:54.860> it<00:04:55.010> works<00:04:55.250> this

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
yeah let's check out if it works this

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.060 
yeah let's check out if it works this
also<00:04:55.760> works<00:04:56.060> with<00:04:56.360> sand<00:04:56.690> and<00:04:56.840> gravel<00:04:57.590> it

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
doesn't matter we can also use them both

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.120 
doesn't matter we can also use them both
but<00:05:01.010> I<00:05:01.250> juiced<00:05:01.940> and<00:05:02.270> do<00:05:02.570> show<00:05:02.960> you<00:05:03.020> guys<00:05:03.290> so

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
door is open and you would be able to

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.400 
door is open and you would be able to
walk<00:05:16.340> through<00:05:16.400> the<00:05:17.120> only<00:05:17.480> thing<00:05:17.840> that<00:05:18.170> I<00:05:18.200> think

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
walk through the only thing that I think

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.160 
walk through the only thing that I think
is<00:05:18.740> not<00:05:18.980> so<00:05:19.220> positive<00:05:19.820> about<00:05:20.120> this<00:05:20.510> is<00:05:20.870> you

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
is not so positive about this is you

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.750 
is not so positive about this is you
can't<00:05:21.440> place<00:05:21.680> a<00:05:21.710> block<00:05:22.010> here<00:05:22.070> because<00:05:22.580> there

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
can't place a block here because there

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.860 
can't place a block here because there
was<00:05:22.880> a<00:05:23.120> cactus<00:05:23.480> over<00:05:23.900> here<00:05:24.220> so<00:05:25.420> it<00:05:26.420> would<00:05:26.660> make

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
was a cactus over here so it would make

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.540 
was a cactus over here so it would make
the<00:05:27.050> cactus<00:05:27.470> break<00:05:27.800> and<00:05:28.040> it<00:05:28.130> would<00:05:28.280> all<00:05:28.520> go

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
the cactus break and it would all go

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.420 
the cactus break and it would all go
down<00:05:29.060> and<00:05:29.360> the<00:05:29.390> door<00:05:29.960> with<00:05:30.140> already<00:05:30.500> fall<00:05:30.770> so

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
down and the door with already fall so

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.970 
down and the door with already fall so
you<00:05:31.490> have<00:05:31.940> a<00:05:32.150> large<00:05:32.540> hole<00:05:32.840> of<00:05:33.080> it<00:05:33.260> you<00:05:33.800> will<00:05:33.950> not

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
you have a large hole of it you will not

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.020 
you have a large hole of it you will not
make<00:05:34.460> the<00:05:34.700> jump<00:05:35.030> so<00:05:36.020> I<00:05:36.740> have<00:05:37.430> to<00:05:37.640> think<00:05:37.850> of

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
make the jump so I have to think of

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.410 
make the jump so I have to think of
anything<00:05:38.270> to<00:05:38.720> do<00:05:38.900> that<00:05:39.170> also<00:05:39.650> this<00:05:40.310> could<00:05:40.550> make

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:41.420 
anything to do that also this could make

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.280 
anything to do that also this could make
a<00:05:41.660> lack<00:05:42.140> machine<00:05:42.650> because<00:05:43.160> as<00:05:43.400> you<00:05:43.790> can<00:05:43.820> see

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
a lack machine because as you can see

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.550 
a lack machine because as you can see
many<00:05:45.340> many<00:05:46.340> cacti<00:05:46.760> on<00:05:47.150> the<00:05:47.270> ground<00:05:47.540> also<00:05:48.320> many
