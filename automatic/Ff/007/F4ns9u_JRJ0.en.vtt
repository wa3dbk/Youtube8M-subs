convert to both a regular swing arm or a
spool<00:01:09.290> conversion<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.500> if<00:01:10.620> I<00:01:10.740> were<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.890> flip

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
spool conversion so if I were to flip

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.300 
spool conversion so if I were to flip
this<00:01:11.340> guy<00:01:11.430> over<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:12.120> can<00:01:12.690> lift<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.050> bike<00:01:13.310> from

this guy over I can lift the bike from
the<00:01:14.430> spool<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> good<00:01:16.650> stand

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
the spool so this is a good stand

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.770 
the spool so this is a good stand
because<00:01:17.190> it's<00:01:17.430> flexible<00:01:17.580> if<00:01:18.510> you<00:01:18.660> were

and what we first have to do is loosen
up<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.930> accident<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:34.350> can<00:03:34.410> see<00:03:34.620> me<00:03:34.740> kind<00:03:34.920> of

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
up the accident you can see me kind of

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.110 
up the accident you can see me kind of
pushing<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:35.400> out<00:03:35.520> already

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
pushing it out already

pushing it out already
okay<00:03:36.540> now<00:03:37.170> as<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.410> axle<00:03:37.740> comes<00:03:37.950> loose<00:03:38.250> what<00:03:38.580> I

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
okay now as the axle comes loose what I

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.520 
okay now as the axle comes loose what I
generally<00:03:38.850> do<00:03:39.300> is<00:03:39.450> keep<00:03:39.630> my<00:03:39.870> foot<00:03:40.140> underneath

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
generally do is keep my foot underneath

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.220 
generally do is keep my foot underneath
the<00:03:40.860> wheel<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:42.180> tire<00:03:42.209> to<00:03:42.780> kind<00:03:42.990> of<00:03:43.050> give<00:03:43.200> it

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
the wheel the tire to kind of give it

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.900 
the wheel the tire to kind of give it
support<00:03:43.440> because<00:03:43.950> there's<00:03:44.220> really<00:03:44.490> that<00:03:44.670> it's

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
support because there's really that it's

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.760 
support because there's really that it's
just<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.390> open<00:03:45.810> air<00:03:45.990> right<00:03:46.200> underneath<00:03:46.410> here

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
just the open air right underneath here

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.600 
just the open air right underneath here
now<00:03:47.490> as<00:03:47.730> I<00:03:47.970> remove<00:03:48.300> this<00:03:48.570> axle<00:03:49.340> what<00:03:50.340> I'm<00:03:50.430> going

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
now as I remove this axle what I'm going

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.810 
now as I remove this axle what I'm going
to<00:03:50.640> do<00:03:50.820> is<00:03:51.030> hold<00:03:51.330> the<00:03:51.900> wheel<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.890> go<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.520> pull

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
to do is hold the wheel and go and pull

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.060 
to do is hold the wheel and go and pull
this<00:03:54.690> axle<00:03:55.140> out<00:03:55.760> okay<00:03:56.760> now<00:03:57.200> once<00:03:58.200> it's<00:03:58.380> out<00:03:58.590> the

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
this axle out okay now once it's out the

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.620 
this axle out okay now once it's out the
wheel<00:03:59.280> is<00:03:59.400> kind<00:03:59.670> of<00:03:59.730> free-floating<00:04:00.330> and

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
wheel is kind of free-floating and

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.390 
wheel is kind of free-floating and
there's<00:04:00.959> only<00:04:01.080> two<00:04:01.350> pieces<00:04:01.590> that<00:04:01.800> are<00:04:02.010> left<00:04:02.250> to

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
there's only two pieces that are left to

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.600 
there's only two pieces that are left to
do<00:04:02.550> on<00:04:02.820> the<00:04:03.690> brake<00:04:03.930> side<00:04:04.260> of<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.980> rear<00:04:05.400> wheel

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
do on the brake side of the rear wheel

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.610 
do on the brake side of the rear wheel
we're<00:04:06.270> going<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.450> go<00:04:06.570> ahead<00:04:06.660> and<00:04:06.870> drop<00:04:07.170> the

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
we're going to go ahead and drop the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.470 
we're going to go ahead and drop the
whole<00:04:08.340> wheel<00:04:08.580> just<00:04:08.850> a<00:04:08.940> little<00:04:09.120> bit<00:04:09.239> so<00:04:09.360> you

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
whole wheel just a little bit so you

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.880 
whole wheel just a little bit so you
just<00:04:09.600> lower<00:04:09.810> your<00:04:09.959> foot<00:04:10.200> so<00:04:10.350> you<00:04:10.410> can<00:04:10.590> get<00:04:10.709> some

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
just lower your foot so you can get some

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.710 
just lower your foot so you can get some
clearance<00:04:11.280> I'm<00:04:11.820> going<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.120> go<00:04:12.209> ahead<00:04:12.300> and<00:04:12.510> pull

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
clearance I'm going to go ahead and pull

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.070 
clearance I'm going to go ahead and pull
the<00:04:13.530> brake<00:04:13.739> caliper<00:04:14.160> off<00:04:14.540> now<00:04:15.540> back<00:04:15.780> on<00:04:16.019> the

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
the brake caliper off now back on the

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.170 
the brake caliper off now back on the
sprocket<00:04:16.470> side<00:04:16.919> we're<00:04:17.549> going<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.850> go<00:04:18.120> ahead

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
sprocket side we're going to go ahead

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.240 
sprocket side we're going to go ahead
and<00:04:18.510> push<00:04:18.870> let<00:04:19.229> the<00:04:19.350> tire<00:04:19.560> kind<00:04:20.010> of<00:04:20.100> give<00:04:20.220> it

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
and push let the tire kind of give it

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.190 
and push let the tire kind of give it
some<00:04:20.340> slack<00:04:20.760> on<00:04:20.970> this<00:04:21.120> prop<00:04:21.390> on<00:04:21.540> the<00:04:21.810> sprocket

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
some slack on this prop on the sprocket

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.350 
some slack on this prop on the sprocket
and<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.590> chain<00:04:22.830> so<00:04:23.520> that<00:04:23.669> you<00:04:23.760> can<00:04:23.910> get<00:04:24.060> enough

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
and the chain so that you can get enough
