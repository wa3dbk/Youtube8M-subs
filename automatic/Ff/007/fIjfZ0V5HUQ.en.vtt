00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
the entire helix right there and it does

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.670 
the entire helix right there and it does
start<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.660> read<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.050> go<00:00:46.110> all<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.350> way<00:00:46.379> up<00:00:46.530> into

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
called GPS apply and as us see right

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.570 
called GPS apply and as us see right
there<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.060> just<00:01:15.210> click<00:01:15.390> lock<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.369> now<00:01:17.369> it's

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.460 
there you just click lock and now it's
called<00:01:17.759> GPS<00:01:18.299> instead<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.720> tomtom<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.320> it's

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
called GPS instead of tomtom so it's

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.140 
called GPS instead of tomtom so it's
pretty<00:01:19.650> cool<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:20.490> definitely<00:01:20.670> nice<00:01:20.909> for

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
different types these are all the ones

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.100 
different types these are all the ones
that<00:02:59.760> are<00:02:59.850> included<00:03:00.060> with<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.540> barrel<00:03:00.870> hack

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
that are included with the barrel hack

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.810 
that are included with the barrel hack
so<00:03:01.320> you<00:03:01.380> do<00:03:01.530> have<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.740> lot<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.190> them<00:03:02.430> in<00:03:02.550> here<00:03:02.580> the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
so you do have a lot of them in here the

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.890 
so you do have a lot of them in here the
one<00:03:02.910> that<00:03:03.060> I<00:03:03.090> was<00:03:03.270> originally<00:03:03.390> using<00:03:03.810> is

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
one that I was originally using is

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.440 
one that I was originally using is
called<00:03:03.930> curl<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:04.680> roll<00:03:04.920> away<00:03:05.100> so<00:03:06.000> as<00:03:06.120> ESC

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
called curl and roll away so as ESC

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.660 
called curl and roll away so as ESC
right<00:03:06.540> here<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:07.650> kind<00:03:07.860> of<00:03:07.950> just<00:03:08.100> curls<00:03:08.430> and

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
right here it kind of just curls and

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.610 
right here it kind of just curls and
rolls<00:03:09.240> away<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:09.960> that<00:03:09.990> one's<00:03:10.230> really<00:03:10.350> fun

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
rolls away so that one's really fun

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.900 
rolls away so that one's really fun
especially<00:03:10.890> when<00:03:11.190> someone's<00:03:11.580> picking<00:03:11.760> up

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
especially when someone's picking up

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.070 
especially when someone's picking up
your<00:03:12.000> device<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.240> they<00:03:12.420> use<00:03:12.570> it<00:03:12.720> may<00:03:12.840> go<00:03:12.960> to<00:03:13.020> a

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
your device and they use it may go to a

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.840 
your device and they use it may go to a
different<00:03:13.230> page<00:03:13.500> they<00:03:14.010> ask<00:03:14.190> how<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.490> heck<00:03:14.700> to

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
to put answer and decline you had to

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.310 
to put answer and decline you had to
slide<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.160> unlock<00:03:26.240> now<00:03:27.240> they've<00:03:27.690> changed<00:03:27.720> that

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
slide to unlock now they've changed that

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.750 
slide to unlock now they've changed that
with<00:03:28.470> this<00:03:28.650> city<00:03:28.860> a<00:03:28.950> hack<00:03:29.220> which<00:03:29.430> is<00:03:29.550> called

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
with this city a hack which is called

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.610 
with this city a hack which is called
like<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.060> said<00:03:30.240> easy<00:03:30.450> decline<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.290> it's<00:03:31.440> back<00:03:31.590> to

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
like I said easy decline so it's back to

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.750 
like I said easy decline so it's back to
how<00:03:31.770> it<00:03:31.800> used<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:32.070> be<00:03:32.220> where<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.430> can<00:03:32.550> have<00:03:32.640> the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
how it used to be where you can have the

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.100 
how it used to be where you can have the
answer<00:03:33.060> or<00:03:33.240> you<00:03:33.270> can<00:03:33.480> just<00:03:33.570> have<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.810> decline

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
answer or you can just have the decline

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.900 
answer or you can just have the decline
button<00:03:34.140> in<00:03:34.530> case<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.770> want<00:03:34.950> to<00:03:35.010> turn<00:03:35.160> down<00:03:35.190> not

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
button in case I want to turn down not

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.350 
button in case I want to turn down not
important<00:03:36.390> calls<00:03:36.600> like<00:03:36.780> this<00:03:37.130> at<00:03:38.360> number

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
important calls like this at number

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.030 
important calls like this at number
three<00:03:39.630> we<00:03:39.780> have<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.900> classic<00:03:40.350> city<00:03:40.530> hack<00:03:40.770> called

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
three we have a classic city hack called

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.980 
three we have a classic city hack called
infinidock<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:42.030> essentially<00:03:42.720> what<00:03:42.750> this

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
infinidock and essentially what this

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.830 
infinidock and essentially what this
allows<00:03:43.200> you<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.500> do<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:43.860> to<00:03:43.890> put<00:03:44.850> more<00:03:45.090> icons<00:03:45.630> on

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
allows you to do is to put more icons on

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.199 
allows you to do is to put more icons on
your<00:03:45.870> dock<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.530> then<00:03:47.190> have<00:03:47.400> them<00:03:47.580> scrollable

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
your dock and then have them scrollable

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.330 
your dock and then have them scrollable
so<00:03:49.050> this<00:03:49.170> is<00:03:49.320> kind<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.590> like<00:03:49.709> its<00:03:49.890> own<00:03:50.100> unique

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
so this is kind of like its own unique

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.220 
so this is kind of like its own unique
page<00:03:50.880> flipping<00:03:51.270> instead<00:03:51.660> of<00:03:51.750> just<00:03:51.870> having<00:03:52.050> to

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
page flipping instead of just having to

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.699 
page flipping instead of just having to
do<00:03:52.350> this<00:03:53.270> you<00:03:54.270> can<00:03:54.420> also<00:03:54.570> put<00:03:54.900> more<00:03:55.200> important

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
do this you can also put more important

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.770 
do this you can also put more important
applications<00:03:56.370> down<00:03:56.580> here<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.480> can<00:03:57.600> also

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
applications down here and you can also

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.449 
applications down here and you can also
control<00:03:58.200> the<00:03:58.260> amount<00:03:58.590> of<00:03:58.709> applications<00:03:59.340> and

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
control the amount of applications and

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.550 
control the amount of applications and
icons<00:03:59.790> that<00:03:59.970> you<00:04:00.060> have<00:04:00.270> in<00:04:00.420> this<00:04:00.510> bar<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:01.410> can

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
icons that you have in this bar you can

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.620 
icons that you have in this bar you can
have<00:04:01.680> anywhere<00:04:01.950> from<00:04:02.070> I<00:04:02.220> think<00:04:02.430> like<00:04:02.610> one<00:04:03.420> app

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
have anywhere from I think like one app

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.690 
have anywhere from I think like one app
to<00:04:03.870> like<00:04:04.050> 10<00:04:04.350> different<00:04:04.530> icons<00:04:05.100> on<00:04:05.310> there<00:04:05.520> and

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
to like 10 different icons on there and

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.280 
to like 10 different icons on there and
they<00:04:06.060> all<00:04:06.209> kind<00:04:06.390> of<00:04:06.510> bunch<00:04:06.690> up<00:04:06.900> looking<00:04:07.140> like<00:04:07.170> a

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
they all kind of bunch up looking like a

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.660 
they all kind of bunch up looking like a
deck<00:04:07.440> of<00:04:07.470> cards<00:04:07.590> or<00:04:07.890> something<00:04:07.950> like<00:04:08.130> that<00:04:08.220> so
