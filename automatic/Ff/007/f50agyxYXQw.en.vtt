00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
ok first of all I want you to see the

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.960 
ok first of all I want you to see the
keyboard<00:03:38.099> and<00:03:38.480> it<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.870> made<00:03:40.680> full<00:03:41.159> hebrew<00:03:41.489> and

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
keyboard and it is made full hebrew and

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.270 
keyboard and it is made full hebrew and
english<00:03:42.239> like<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:43.019> letters<00:03:43.349> are<00:03:43.530> printed<00:03:44.069> in

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
english like the letters are printed in

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.619 
english like the letters are printed in
that<00:03:45.030> way<00:03:45.389> and<00:03:46.099> like<00:03:47.099> when<00:03:48.000> I<00:03:48.030> put<00:03:48.269> my<00:03:48.299> hand

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
that way and like when I put my hand

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.490 
that way and like when I put my hand
it's<00:03:48.810> supposed<00:03:49.109> to<00:03:49.230> be<00:03:49.409> in<00:03:49.560> more<00:03:49.739> natural<00:03:50.220> and

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
it's supposed to be in more natural and

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.399 
it's supposed to be in more natural and
pose<00:03:52.500> like<00:03:53.489> you<00:03:53.730> see<00:03:53.970> mind<00:03:54.239> is<00:03:54.420> not<00:03:54.629> unnatural

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
pose like you see mind is not unnatural

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.869 
pose like you see mind is not unnatural
is<00:03:55.889> posed<00:03:56.790> like<00:03:56.909> that<00:03:57.269> so<00:03:58.109> it's<00:03:58.379> more<00:03:58.829> easy<00:03:59.129> and

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
is posed like that so it's more easy and

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.599 
is posed like that so it's more easy and
comfort<00:04:00.540> hopefully<00:04:01.470> healthier<00:04:02.159> like<00:04:02.430> they

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
comfort hopefully healthier like they

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.259 
comfort hopefully healthier like they
say<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:03.379> when<00:04:04.379> you<00:04:04.530> type<00:04:04.829> it<00:04:05.790> doesn't<00:04:06.150> make

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
say and when you type it doesn't make

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.059 
say and when you type it doesn't make
much<00:04:06.480> sounds<00:04:06.870> awfully<00:04:07.260> to<00:04:07.379> make<00:04:07.590> my<00:04:07.799> strength

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
much sounds awfully to make my strength

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.670 
much sounds awfully to make my strength
