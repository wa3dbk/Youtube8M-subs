guitar<00:00:21.500> you<00:00:22.500> just<00:00:22.740> heard<00:00:22.890> some<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.279> clean

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
guitar you just heard some of the clean

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.519 
guitar you just heard some of the clean
tones<00:00:23.789> but<00:00:24.119> let<00:00:24.840> me<00:00:24.930> do<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> little<00:00:25.289> more<00:00:25.439> of

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
tones but let me do a little more of

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.029 
tones but let me do a little more of
that<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:25.980> can<00:00:26.099> really<00:00:26.250> hear<00:00:26.490> it

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:32.039 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:33.950 

that's<00:00:33.030> with<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.329> switch<00:00:33.539> in<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.719> middle

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
that's with the switch in the middle

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.569 
that's with the switch in the middle
position<00:00:34.079> here's<00:00:34.649> just<00:00:34.980> with<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.399> neck

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
position here's just with the neck

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.150 
position here's just with the neck
pickup

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.180 

and<00:00:41.660> here's<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.810> bridge<00:00:42.960> pickup

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.670 

I<00:00:48.359> really<00:00:49.359> find<00:00:49.510> that<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:49.809> best<00:00:50.019> tone<00:00:50.320> for<00:00:50.620> a

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
I really find that the best tone for a

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.650 
I really find that the best tone for a
clean<00:00:50.949> sound<00:00:51.309> is<00:00:51.609> somewhere<00:00:52.030> between<00:00:52.210> the

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
clean sound is somewhere between the

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.079 
clean sound is somewhere between the
neck<00:00:52.840> pickup<00:00:53.199> and<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:54.129> middle<00:00:54.370> the<00:00:55.059> middle

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
neck pickup and the middle the middle

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:56.970 
neck pickup and the middle the middle
selector<00:00:55.719> switch<00:00:55.960> it<00:00:56.170> really<00:00:56.440> makes<00:00:56.680> almost

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
selector switch it really makes almost

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.649 
selector switch it really makes almost
like<00:00:57.250> an<00:00:57.370> acoustic<00:00:57.579> tone<00:00:58.059> with<00:00:58.300> these<00:00:58.449> single

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659 
like an acoustic tone with these single

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.979 
like an acoustic tone with these single
coils<00:01:00.210> here's<00:01:01.210> a<00:01:01.300> little<00:01:01.539> bit<00:01:01.629> more<00:01:01.780> of<00:01:01.899> a

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
coils here's a little bit more of a

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.140 
coils here's a little bit more of a
dirtier<00:01:02.350> tone<00:01:02.620> I<00:01:02.829> actually<00:01:03.430> like<00:01:03.760> this<00:01:03.909> sound

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
dirtier tone I actually like this sound

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.460 
dirtier tone I actually like this sound
because<00:01:04.330> you<00:01:04.420> almost<00:01:04.570> get<00:01:04.839> like<00:01:05.080> a<00:01:05.110> beach

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
because you almost get like a beach

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:17.310 
because you almost get like a beach
sound<00:01:05.830> out<00:01:06.040> of<00:01:06.159> it

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.840

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
you really get a lot of tone with these

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.240 
you really get a lot of tone with these
single-coil<00:01:20.750> lipstick<00:01:21.260> pickups<00:01:21.620> here's

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
something a little bit softer this

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:38.430 
something a little bit softer this
preset<00:01:24.770> has<00:01:24.920> some<00:01:25.130> chorus<00:01:25.490> on<00:01:25.670> it

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.890 

and<00:01:39.670> you<00:01:40.670> could<00:01:40.850> really<00:01:41.090> get<00:01:41.300> some<00:01:41.540> punchy

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
and you could really get some punchy

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.360 
and you could really get some punchy
