 yet done is that you feel enough 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.270
 cute today's fashion is fashion 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.180
 perfect for Easter in fact the drag 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.250
 what is an easter egg in the egg of 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.409
 easter good chocolate good 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.409
 what you find is not found 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.170
 surprises and precisely in this fashion though 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.829
 they stop passing by various things 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.450
 we will find surprises as they speak 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.090
 these easter eggs these eggs of 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.070
 Easter randomly inside 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.610
 of the world so before I had it too 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.890
 identified one if I'm wrong 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.350
 looking for the easter egg is the 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.510
 most beautiful thing you know what it could be 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.710
 make a modality that is now proper 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.900
 came to mind now with this 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.570
 affirmation in which for example one goes 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.630
 looking for scattered easter eggs 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.610
 for the whole world, however, for one area 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.560
 of bounded map are the 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.990
 objects and what to do 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.410
 you create the paraphernalia you fight with i 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.390
 own friends or teams 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.400
 you know what I got it from one 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.959
 custom however year in america that is 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.490
 that of hiding easter eggs e 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.170
 let her find children at least I remember 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.450
 that I had studied stuff on the lines 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.340
 of the genre, however, the fashion of today 15 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.110
 introduces these easter eggs we have 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.180
 lots of easter eggs me 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.709
 I show a little but I am anyway 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.540
 these are quite the same 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.760
 therefore they have the same monochrome 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.100
 texture but different colors then 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.290
 this is exactly the same 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.930
 change only the lines you see 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.770
 they are opposed differently though 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.080
 I remind you the reward is always 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:51.049
 random random which are the cute ones 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.580
 these that have the forms of mobs 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.239
 rest with them are all the same 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.910
 we have those in the shape of a big room then 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.799
 that form of creeper and then the blue ones 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.750
 which in any case are all these colors 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.480
 here singles and then we have that form of 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.450
 she who has not yet understood what sense 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.110
 have it but now we try them there 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.430
 we all try, we don't know 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.660
 let's put it a little bit 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.830
 I show you a little bit the 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:23.090
 neither rewards nor we try among the big ones 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:25.130
 let's try 3 of the creeper for dm is a 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.970
 color that I like 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.900
 let's do this the rainbow color that 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.519
 lucky charm 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.890
 then what can we find 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.110
 within these surprises well 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.209
 meanwhile I am very easy to break ie 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.100
 you can simply break it with i 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.450
 punches when you find them so not 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.640
 you don't even need tools for 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.100
 example I call this boom with you see 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.760
 we were unlucky and gave us one 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.670
 lousy wooden pickaxe 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.920
 said piece or a little bit of luck 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.310
 he starts shooting at hammond shop 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.739
 or a blades can therefore be like 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.420
 you see they are not rare to find 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.610
 so you can also shoot enough 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.819
 for the way and find maybe a dozen 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.069
 maximum, however, there is a factor of luck 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:12.909
 which is variable for example we have it 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:15.099
 found a fan a diamond helmet 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.350
 these slime here as they mixed 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.539
 the smart macrÃ¬ but now it comes to me 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.729
 or even an emerald so we have 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:24.550
 different chances to find an object 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:26.650
 good or at least a bad object 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.539
 so even if you turn around enough 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.479
 the world must have a pretty ass 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.770
 great for finding good things 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.900
 the objects as you can see after a while 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.930
 they repeat or we also find objects 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.139
 useless a snowball had to spoil one 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.600
 snowball I can more clear pig 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:46.060
 tossing an apple or an apple now 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.960
 change everything to piguet as always 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.699
 they give me but they really brought it 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.710
 enough bad luck because two out of three are 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.900
 been really useless then damned 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.720
 peak was mode that still enough 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.479
 funny because I told you I had 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.090
 in mind to do this this way 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:06.190
 let's say then go around finding is 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.070
 a sort of unpacking because if 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.860
 you think you go there and it's random 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.139
 because we turn them and turn and turn 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.449
 in the end we arrive in front of a new one 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.880
 we open it and find ourselves a surprise 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.919
 that changes if it changes is not that they are 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.229
 I can even placed in the 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.090
 same position look why maybe 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.949
 someone says no i think it's in that 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.080
 determined chung that there is a 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:31.870
 certain reward we take two 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.780
 to be equal therefore those of big stack 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.639
 nor do we place one we break it c from 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.770
 blackpad al in the same position gives us 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.349
 a and her pearl so as you see it is 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.599
 totally different a brick a brick 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:46.419
 I never know what could give me bonn 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:48.460
 but that disgusts umbri that anyway 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.590
 we have so many rewards worth it 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.849
 logically because if you enter the fashions 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.070
 does not work 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:55.570
 however, it is an Easter fashion then 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.340
 I wanted to do them simply because we are 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.960
 in Easter time and since it is not one 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.600
 quite complicated fashion 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.040
 tomorrow I'll get right away 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.560
 another video because as you know 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.440
 lately i'm putting a video either 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.330
 Video is a video case study that the opa 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.250
 every other day a video 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.450
 simply due to time constraints 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:17.280
 connection because having an omega e 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.260
 steal a 10 minute video we use 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.510
 something like about 5 hours 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.980
 understand that in addition to the cost it is 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.570
 highest 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.280
 I need a moment too 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:28.260
 recover because while I load mine 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.300
 conviction not to do anything and since 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.310
 the new one should arrive by the 14th 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.930
 line I can load you anyway like 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.420
 always a video a day so there 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.790
 I invite you to leave as always a like 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.290
 we arrive in 1500 cedar yc for the 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.210
 next fad that will probably be 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.500
 also tomorrow and nothing reminds you 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:48.230
 subscribe to the next Julian channel 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.230
 square video all hello to everyone
