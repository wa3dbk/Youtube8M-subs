00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:14.240
 slide with you and today we'll talk about 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.700
 premium naughty su 122 122 44 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.240
 what is the cornerstone of the world 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.840
 tanks 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.960
 You said vigorous tank rubilovo 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.349
 homework 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.660
 and here is no economy and pumping it 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:30.369
 these are the cornerstones of our game 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:34.220
 and the economy is the experience of silver and gold 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:37.310
 someone says that money is evil and 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.980
 tanks in real life evil is often not 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.219
 enough that's why tankers buy 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.559
 premium machines farms evil and here 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:48.410
 here homework comes in and 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.730
 distribution of light but since we do not 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.920
 firefly about . 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.129
 it means you have to work on the damage 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.640
 I confess honestly the first 50 battles I could not 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:01.160
 comprehend the land su 122 44 many viewers 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.859
 know that I play too aggressively and 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.960
 because often do not live to the end of the battle 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:06.350
 statistics I survive about one 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.520
 the battle 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.580
 from three it turned out that su 122 44 is two 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.470
 cars in one bottle 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.110
 powerful bent over to on the seventh level and 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.830
 very neat support on the eighth and 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.380
 ninth level yes you heard right in 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.990
 carcass 2244 has no preferential level 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.570
 fights and at the ninth level gay happens 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.420
 hard because breaking through shirts 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.909
 only 175 and the Gold gives all for all 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.040
 200 17 millimeters it does not allow 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.890
 effective pizza by nick 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.810
 By the way the guard is not as you know 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.700
 soviet trunks have hidden perk 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.840
 distribution with the guard which is good 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.390
 works and su 122 44 believe me I know 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.270
 but if you start to come down and time 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.180
 aiming su 122 44 almost three seconds 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.350
 it came down to the end otherwise you will not get 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.890
 half the time 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.759
 scatter of guns 0 41 meters per 100 meters 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.039
 distances 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.469
 this is exactly how Soviet magic works. 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:09.350
 weapons gun d-25t 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.660
 nasusu 2244 bullet per minute seven 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.120
 half the time in the database and if you put 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.270
 ramier that one about that 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.900
 seven seconds we can send adversaries 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.220
 390 units tinkling joy talk about 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.739
 i will be incomplete without specifying 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.329
 characteristics of land mines 64 millimeters 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:31.810
 penetration and damage of 465 units by the way to carry 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:34.060
 land mines on soo 122 44 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.450
 after this fight by the way became 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.359
 arose on su 122 44 instead of two bombs 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.790
 4 left to tell about horizontals 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:45.519
 and vertikalku on horizon guns 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.079
 moves 8 degrees from the center this 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.359
 not the most prominent figure 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.430
 and lead the goal from such angles is not always 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:53.889
 just have to accordingly 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.069
 turn the case and this flies 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:58.540
 disguise and hover gun 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.060
 also not very nice 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.709
 the declination angle is only 4 degrees 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.810
 not enough for world maps of tanks that 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.349
 pretty dug up after anything you like 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.329
 physicists 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.310
 and 16 degrees up may not be enough 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.730
 to throw enemies standing in a lowland 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.120
 su 122 44 is not devoid of proprietary sores 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.159
 tips weak review he is only 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.079
 330 meters and this is on the seventh level 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.780
 therefore expands and review strictly 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:26.440
 recommended stereo but with a walkie-talkie 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.340
 lucky 700 meters out of 6 of such a walkie-talkie 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.910
 fiercely envy 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:34.209
 By the way, setups on su 122 44 can 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.760
 be 2 1 is a classic setup pt 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.659
 period ruby camouflage net and 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.480
 rammer 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:43.299
 but quite often the car is in the top and 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.909
 there you need to play the main role houses 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.669
 dealer to drive in the front row to play 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.769
 eyebrows and handing out homework for these 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:53.590
 goals better fit setup from rammer 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.359
 fan and drive aiming you were 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.099
 gear i stick to set 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.340
 consisting of a small repair kit 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.690
 large repair kit and first aid kit 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.389
 we do not need a fire extinguisher because the machine 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.120
 does not burn the front of the transmission is not a 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:09.970
 engine you a-44 with a capacity of 500 horses 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.790
 diesel has a 15 percent chance at 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.750
 fire cover 500 horses on 33 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.909
 ton mass give us 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.859
 power supply of about 15 horses 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:20.349
 per ton i.e. we have good dynamics 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.289
 and since we're talking about the engine 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:26.800
 it's time to talk about our highway 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:28.990
 the device is not in vain called su 122 44 two 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.560
 fours at the end hint at the highway she 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.360
 from medium tank t-44 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.310
 properly experienced tankers should 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.810
 guess this highway just by the outside 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.970
 mind and two fours 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.610
 finally helps to answer correctly 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.919
 This question that gives our frivolous highway 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.320
 medium tank 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:48.150
 Firstly the maximum speed ahead is already forty 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.630
 seven and a half kilometers per hour and 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:54.180
 back 13 secondly understeer y 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.790
 Once the chassis turns as much as forty two degrees 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.310
 per second and this is one of the highest 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.490
 indicators in the game that is, spin the su 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:05.850
 122 44 may not all of them. but 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.669
 su itself 122 44 can sometimes twist 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:12.930
 even the services of a scientist tyazha by the way su 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:15.479
 122 44 something like t18 good 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:19.800
 forehead booking is great fidgety and 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:21.450
 frontal armor dynamics su 122 44 this 90 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.240
 mm plate of armor steel with 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.440
 tilt as much as 60 degrees i.e. 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.639
 will lead to about a hundred and eighty 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.130
 millimeters 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:32.639
 such armor allows you to confidently tank 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.830
 being in top that is su 122 122 44 even 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.430
 It is far from the knockout itself 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.280
 is always 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.080
 And from vulnerable places in front there is NLD where 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.550
 reduced to about one hundred and thirty five 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.190
 millimeters to viewing instruments 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.010
 driver and battle only 90 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.960
 millimeters and almost no inclination before 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.090
 how to talk about the perks of the crew will remind 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.770
 that premium podeshki saved bonus 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.800
 shots in contrast to 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.050
 Linear Rings Small but Nice 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.680
 gingerbread from the developers and what to download 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.960
 carriages 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.120
 I recommend even to download active pt 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.100
 disguise first than later 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.950
 we will see the more chances we have for 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.990
 first and often the last shot 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.940
 so you need to download disguise in the first 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.880
 all the crew members except 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.830
 commander him swing the light bulb and then 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.700
 You can already download perks based on your 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.760
 preferences 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.470
 well and do not forget that su 122 44 this 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.600
 premium Fri-shka them for her not 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.669
 Be sure to download the personal type 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.919
 my hunter namely such a nickname 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:31.200
 got a car to drive the brave guys 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:33.270
 from the battlefield elephant ISU-152 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.490
 the battle smoothly comes to an end and we have to go 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:39.180
 summarize everything we learned about su 122 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:41.249
 44 of this video this premium fri-shka 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.679
 seventh level but 

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:46.079
 if you think that for 6750 gold 

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:48.209
 got a regiment naked beam then it is far 

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:50.609
 not so the machine has a specific 

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:52.289
 gameplay and not all fit as 

00:06:50.609 --> 00:06:54.719
 combines two completely different 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:57.449
 character bold rascher in battles 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:07:00.089
 seventh level and very timid but 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:03.389
 biting under the bush sideltz in battles 8 

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:06.029
 and level 9 and a couple of words about farm machine
