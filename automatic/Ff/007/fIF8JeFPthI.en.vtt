00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.020 
hole made it through just as much as the
slug<00:03:10.790> but<00:03:11.180> didn't<00:03:11.750> make<00:03:11.810> a<00:03:11.870> spammable

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
slug but didn't make a spammable

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.830 
slug but didn't make a spammable
so<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:16.090> think<00:03:17.090> that<00:03:17.330> we<00:03:17.450> should<00:03:17.630> either<00:03:17.750> take

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
so I think that we should either take

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.320 
so I think that we should either take
the<00:03:18.170> 44<00:03:18.739> Magnum<00:03:19.120> or<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.360> 16<00:03:21.080> gauge
