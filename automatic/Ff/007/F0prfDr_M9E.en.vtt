 this hinge is not as simple as it can 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.320
 seem right away the fact is that the tail

 exactly the same why it is needed 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.640
 if we put jointed monster b s 2 on 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.159
 water surface 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.390

 almost horizontally 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.710
