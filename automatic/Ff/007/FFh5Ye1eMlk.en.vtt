00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 the program that you use to make the helmet 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.540
 it's called pep acura design air and it's this 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.330
 what is on screen 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.120
 this program breaks down 3d models 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.400
 in plans to print I used paper 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.800
 of coarse gauge to print these 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.470
 planes and then I assembled it by cutting 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.539
 pieces and pasting them is how it was 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.720
 after arming it cost a lot 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.029
 I work xd for all those little ones 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.930
 details that it has but it was worth the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.930
 lol penalty 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.930
 then I put the fiberglass helmet 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.870
 in the interior this gave him a lot of hardness 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.810
 after all it is the same material that 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.470
 They use motorcycle helmets that way 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.470
 how it looks 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.300
 after having applied the fiber of 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.180
 glass pur and the outside part with 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.310
 putty for cars thanks to this the 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.310
 surface of the helmet is smooth and 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.880
 bright this is very important before 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.880
 to paint 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.470
 and then I painted it with spray paint 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.470
 red and gold xd 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.680
 as I mentioned before the putty that 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.210
 applied on the helmet gave this shine 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.790
 characteristic of this form is more 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.590
 realistic and gives the impression that it is 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.590
 Made of metal or plastic 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.850
 hahahahaha is true anyone would believe 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.530
 that you bought it by ebay 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.530
 and that's how I stay 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.050
 anyway 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.590
 very well
