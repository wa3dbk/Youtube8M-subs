because<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.620> passing<00:03:45.069> game<00:03:45.159> wasn't<00:03:45.519> so<00:03:46.209> poly

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
because the passing game wasn't so poly

playing<00:03:47.260> field<00:03:47.560> position<00:03:48.069> juju<00:03:48.760> I<00:03:48.970> guess<00:03:49.299> is

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
playing field position juju I guess is

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.360 
playing field position juju I guess is
an<00:03:49.629> all-american<00:03:49.870> punter<00:03:50.349> now<00:03:50.560> two<00:03:50.620> pins<00:03:51.159> and

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
an all-american punter now two pins and

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.270 
an all-american punter now two pins and
deep<00:03:51.549> gets<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.299> roll<00:03:52.510> so<00:03:52.750> it's<00:03:52.870> 65<00:03:53.409> yards<00:03:53.859> that

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
deep gets the roll so it's 65 yards that

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.160 
deep gets the roll so it's 65 yards that
means<00:03:54.489> Milliken<00:03:54.909> has<00:03:55.239> to<00:03:55.450> throw<00:03:55.599> it<00:03:55.720> deep<00:03:55.989> in

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
means Milliken has to throw it deep in

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.500 
means Milliken has to throw it deep in
there<00:03:56.319> oh<00:03:56.349> man<00:03:56.590> and<00:03:56.889> Justin<00:03:57.639> Calhoun<00:03:58.060> comes<00:03:58.359> up
