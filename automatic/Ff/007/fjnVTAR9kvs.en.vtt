00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.659
 As it is done to publish your first book I wish a lot of time to write 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.210
 percent I do not know if a long time without much effort but we reached agreements 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.089
 especially the 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:12.859
 the first article of the first articles 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.820
 where it seemed impossible to me that that could organize 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.420
 all those notes those ideas those phrases in a whole more or less consistent with 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.400
 beginning and end I despaired I felt that but the task really is very 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.599
 possible 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.300
 and for years that sensation lasted me for its barnacle art and now of 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.240
 writing an article sometimes results 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.660
 this very easy 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.240
 as I understood you that the thing is produced only some way that 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.330
 does not have to lend itself to the game of taking note follows and of flowing and comes from playing 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.850
 a little bit with those ideas that are appearing attack some way a 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.240
 I propose imposing in the case of the book 'my first book was one that is called the 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.730
 philosophy for boys where the experience is told in it was summoned 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.170
 of preadolescents 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.320
 trying more than teaching philosophy to put ourselves in the place of 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.750
 ie philosopher 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.570
 encourage them to pri hiram how is the world like love me 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.760
 and that they describe it from their function of view to pose any 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.830
 matter let's say the basic idea that philosophy more than being a 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.990
 discipline is an indiscipline 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.459
 per 100 and a village they try them base to a series 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.660
 It crowned logical moments of that experience which did not turn out 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.010
 easier than tackling it another way 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.950
 and if it took me some time but 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.510
 I do not remember it as an especially difficult experience, 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.770
 Remembering is of course nothing 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.110
 the experience of a lot of doubts and 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.130
 and of mental difficulties person nephron feeling that 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.659
 is what one is doing is a stupidity that does not have any 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.910
 sense that you will not achieve it that you do not see it 3 will make anyone who is wrong 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.910
 I hope all those things are for the part 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.660
 basic 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.460
 from the experience of d 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.299
 the work of the writer I do not believe that nobody is saved from that you have to know that 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.360
 that happen 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.640
 and somehow somehow ban it and keep going
