00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.720
 oh my God how can something terrible vereyko 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.940
 it turns out a whole cycle of video games like 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.790
 Slender Yes, this is already acute map 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.549
 I hope the hostel is wrong 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.800
 creepy as in the same film or rather 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.220
 already two parts in my opinion may even 3 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.199
 no poluduh all the same but it does not matter right here 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.689
 more terribly you will be here dark this creature 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.400
 can jump out of the dark it will 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.289
 much more terrible than the previous one 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.920
 a card that somehow passed easily on 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.009
 surprise 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.809
 from the first time wai wai wai immediately 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.390
 psychedel went in silent hill style 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.610
 carousel played some kind of background 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.510
 terrible atmosphere and I'm still nobody here 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:46.379
 this waltz 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:48.059
 and just knew that stumped some but not here 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.460
 interesting at all did not say anything 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.930
 need to do on the left button to hold 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.149
 accounts that you hold the flashlight and 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.520
 included yes and by the way kind of it 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.739
 cool because realism gives 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.760
 although on the other hand you're on a flashlight 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.650
 just pressed the button and turned on but in 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.750
 Anyway , this gives tension 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.119
 apparently in this door will need to go out 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.530
 until when you pass the player now we are bye 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:23.390
 we will wander just like that and his 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:25.650
 two more corridors do not know where you are 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.280
 goosebumps he is not so unexpected 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.619
 there are screams and not 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.799
 it's really real to me 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.710
 the quintessence of all horror which in general 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.590
 exist in video games I even films 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:45.030
 call curse level and even higher i would 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.579
 said so oh some strange rooms 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.930
 let's go let's see what we have 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:55.380
 so interesting so oh fu glory is derived 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.230
 back so what and this is mine 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.850
 mobile 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:08.530
 so this urinal will not understand clearly and 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:10.900
 again music again music started this 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.640
 Var appeared so suddenly I 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.580
 caught now tactics she can on any 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.190
 corner on any turn will appear and you 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.280
 gonna wipe your pants and scream 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.930
 maybe like me but some people 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.760
 fear factor to a friend they just shrink 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.040
 in the chair and die of heart 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.800
 seizures so i'm even lucky i 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.170
 I can shout and express my emotions 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.960
 so here so well nothing here there is no fu 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.850
 words over once from behind he did not appear but 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.970
 here right here he should definitely somewhere 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.680
 will appear therefore then breathing is like 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.650
 dining room in Hogwarts 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.610
 long this why in the area where a lot 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.780
 such long tables 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.030
 captain even breathing can't be transferred 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.500
 plainly because he is from any angle 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.570
 may jump out so unexpectedly 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:01.860
 happens so here the music began to play 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:04.810
 you know this will happen yes dick with 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.910
 definitely worth the cycle this raid on 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.730
 tighter than slander scares straight especially 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.620
 Now that the suddenness of his that's you 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.590
 appears about as slender 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.989
 only when it is close to so and here 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.480
 common sense is, before it came here 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.750
 or is it another dead end just a billiard 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.670
 can not play unfortunately I'm in 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.250
 billiards life it played only once 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.250
 three or four is not very successful 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.590
 no not killed not killed creature photo where it is 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.900
 everything came to the exit again 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:48.470
 well, yes, it is logical to play music again 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:55.550
 and fuck my warrior where where is the creature I 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:58.250
 I have not seen it, but where does the pancake come from? 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.220
 creator made this crap free 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.500
 Designer general shooters from the third 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.200
 faces initially yes and now also 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:11.590
 horror hike here is there anyone can 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:13.850
 make your game like well 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.799
 turned away from him lucky otherwise 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.200
 appearance thrown out of the game again sense 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.900
 to the main exit but it's kind of the last 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.360
 the room is not the last after all 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.650
 look ka yet however it is so 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:31.090
 sometimes you need to be careful so well 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.440
 somewhere full no like 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.990
 pancake on the tables, too, did not become 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.820
 Why would these strange objects be better? 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.780
 just empty rooms did it would 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:45.560
 at least not so insurance something so 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:48.640
 well, what I was here was not there however I 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.640
 I don't even know what to do 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.539
 here is some corridor found apparently 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:58.509
 the last utensil is not out of the game 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:01.000
 thank me so I found a diary 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:03.430
 what that chants incomprehensible chants 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.560
 apparently it's really the end of the game 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.660
 Now come to the main exit and then 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.190
 everything will be fine and think so accounting 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.500
 I do not like the sounds that I 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.840
 they began to pursue even louder 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.490
 in general what the whole game is than even his 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.470
 appearances hope he won't be after me 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.569
 chasing because the floors will 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.259
 the character will kill and I will have to again 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:26.259
 look for a diary I freaked out like that or that 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:28.599
 It is oh so great corridors Fu Well, sort of 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:30.250
 he doesn't follow me like this is just 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:33.370
 so for the discharge of the atmosphere made 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.960
 there were sounds some kind of diary we found 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.449
 could write and find canvases 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.440
 Ilyich's diary there to be already 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:41.860
 understand the purpose of the game 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.599
 okay cut the path to the exit so here 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.810
 like an exit hour must have a gold plate 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:49.120
 will something like this appear so well 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.280
 in short, this time no golden 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.020
 tiles color shit did not appear game 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.449
 just crashes to desktop 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.389
 which I understand the sign that I have passed all 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:00.729
 so here that the cycle of the rivers is not 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.560
 really really, really can 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:05.020
 be even more than a slender thanks 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.300
 to that panicked horror that causes 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.219
 the creature of this is rarely very accomplished in 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.250
 horror games can be well here at the creators 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:14.229
 it turned out even more slender scares 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.060
 unity only bride so when are you 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:19.180
 find a phone or now 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.699
 diaries found you just stupid should 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.539
 run back to the exit and exist and 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:24.550
 they chase 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:27.009
 although if he pursued it would be 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:30.340
 just a hard case here we will fill 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:32.789
 there watch meteor must all good luck not 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.789
 crap
