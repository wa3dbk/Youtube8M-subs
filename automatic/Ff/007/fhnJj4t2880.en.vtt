you<00:01:17.909> don't<00:01:18.090> really<00:01:18.180> have<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.600> right<00:01:18.930> there

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
you don't really have to right there

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.410 
you don't really have to right there
halfback<00:01:19.560> will<00:01:19.979> choose<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.580> once<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.180> I

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
halfback will choose that once you do I

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.820 
halfback will choose that once you do I
check<00:01:21.780> out<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> place<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.439> got<00:01:22.619> two

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
check out the place so you got two

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.350 
check out the place so you got two
natural<00:01:23.009> wheels<00:01:23.460> both<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.000> which<00:01:24.060> are<00:01:24.240> pretty

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
natural wheels both of which are pretty

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.359 
natural wheels both of which are pretty
much<00:01:24.540> broken<00:01:24.930> because<00:01:25.229> one<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.650> them<00:01:25.830> angle<00:01:26.189> to

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
much broken because one of them angle to

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.920 
much broken because one of them angle to
the<00:01:26.460> side<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.850> left<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.270> other<00:01:27.420> one<00:01:27.570> cuts

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
the side of the left the other one cuts

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.210 
the side of the left the other one cuts
in<00:01:28.080> more<00:01:28.259> shallow<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.799> both<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.009> those

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
in more shallow so both of those

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.280 
in more shallow so both of those
completely<00:01:29.640> destroy<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.090> AI<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.960> got<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
completely destroy the AI you got the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.200 
completely destroy the AI you got the
slant<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.770> go<00:01:31.890> post<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> left<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.060> you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
slant and go post on the left and you

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.850 
slant and go post on the left and you
can<00:01:33.360> auto<00:01:33.750> you're<00:01:33.990> tied<00:01:34.140> into<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.380> streak<00:01:34.680> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
can auto you're tied into a streak and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.010 
can auto you're tied into a streak and
then<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> drag<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.790> broken<00:01:36.240> too<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.840> see

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
then the drag is broken too you can see

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.510 
then the drag is broken too you can see
that<00:01:37.200> how<00:01:37.320> he<00:01:37.380> comes<00:01:37.650> in<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.070> charge<00:01:38.310> it's

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
that how he comes in and in charge it's

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.609 
that how he comes in and in charge it's
completely<00:01:39.270> ridiculous<00:01:39.630> those<00:01:40.110> are<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.470> many

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
completely ridiculous those are so many

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.160 
completely ridiculous those are so many
AI<00:01:40.799> breakers<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.579> game<00:01:41.759> just<00:01:42.720> almost<00:01:43.049> no

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
AI breakers in this game just almost no

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.789 
AI breakers in this game just almost no
stopping<00:01:43.560> it

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
stopping it

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.200 
stopping it
I<00:01:43.829> always<00:01:44.399> like<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.729> go<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.970> tight<00:01:45.180> end

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
I always like to go to the tight end

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.789 
I always like to go to the tight end
first<00:01:45.600> because<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.439> most<00:01:46.560> powerful

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
first because it's the most powerful

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.950 
first because it's the most powerful
most<00:01:47.310> direct<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.939> know<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.360> takes<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.780> lot<00:01:48.930> of

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
most direct you know it takes a lot of

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.899 
most direct you know it takes a lot of
user<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.530> stop<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:50.009> or<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> lot<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.520> committing

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
user to stop it or a lot of committing

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.399 
user to stop it or a lot of committing
people<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.570> if<00:01:51.630> they<00:01:51.720> commit<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.170> stopping

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
people and if they commit to stopping

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.230 
people and if they commit to stopping
that<00:01:52.649> with<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.890> defensive<00:01:53.399> ends<00:01:53.759> then<00:01:54.210> you

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
that with the defensive ends then you

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.990 
that with the defensive ends then you
can<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:54.570> run<00:01:54.720> draws<00:01:55.049> but<00:01:55.799> once<00:01:56.670> they<00:01:56.790> start

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
can just run draws but once they start

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.160 
can just run draws but once they start
doing<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.360> got<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> whole<00:01:57.659> bunch<00:01:57.689> look<00:01:58.079> on

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
doing this you got a whole bunch look on

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.600 
doing this you got a whole bunch look on
the<00:01:58.229> left<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.740> can<00:01:58.770> see<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.040> extra<00:01:59.189> Seaver<00:01:59.490> do

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
the left you can see the extra Seaver do

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.740 
the left you can see the extra Seaver do
a<00:01:59.640> little<00:01:59.820> in<00:01:59.939> right<00:02:00.240> there

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
a little in right there

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.950 
a little in right there
so<00:02:01.320> many<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.549> do<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:03.030> many<00:02:03.149> AI<00:02:03.420> beaters

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
so many I do that so many AI beaters

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.959 
so many I do that so many AI beaters
it's<00:02:04.140> kind<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.409> ridiculous<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.399> if<00:02:05.850> you

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
it's kind of ridiculous but and if you

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.370 
it's kind of ridiculous but and if you
want<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.329> know<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.509> can<00:02:06.689> just<00:02:06.840> keep<00:02:06.960> hitting

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
want you know you can just keep hitting

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.770 
want you know you can just keep hitting
him<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.799> halfback<00:02:08.009> wheel<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.670> cuts<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.390> really

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
him the halfback wheel it cuts in really

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.270 
him the halfback wheel it cuts in really
shallow<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:10.410> like<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.649> saw<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.979> screws<00:02:11.250> with

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
shallow so like you saw it screws with

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.160 
shallow so like you saw it screws with
the<00:02:11.489> coverage<00:02:11.790> they<00:02:12.270> cut<00:02:12.569> in<00:02:12.750> there<00:02:12.900> really

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
the coverage they cut in there really

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.930 
the coverage they cut in there really
sharp<00:02:13.500> turn

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
sharp turn

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.730 
sharp turn
and<00:02:14.030> then<00:02:14.630> if<00:02:14.900> you<00:02:14.990> want<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.500> know<00:02:15.620> the

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
and then if you want you know the

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.920 
and then if you want you know the
dump-off<00:02:16.160> is<00:02:16.370> always<00:02:16.790> there<00:02:17.060> almost<00:02:17.540> almost

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
dump-off is always there almost almost

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.960 
dump-off is always there almost almost
almost<00:02:18.260> always<00:02:18.920> there<00:02:19.520> unless<00:02:19.880> they

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
almost always there unless they

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.310 
almost always there unless they
specifically<00:02:20.330> user<00:02:20.540> but<00:02:20.810> if<00:02:20.870> they<00:02:20.960> use<00:02:20.990> that

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
specifically user but if they use that

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.290 
specifically user but if they use that
you<00:02:21.440> know<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.680> wheels<00:02:22.610> like<00:02:22.850> that<00:02:23.060> are<00:02:23.210> gonna

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
you know the wheels like that are gonna

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.820 
you know the wheels like that are gonna
be<00:02:23.420> open<00:02:23.750> or<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.170> other<00:02:24.290> wheels<00:02:24.530> are<00:02:24.650> gonna<00:02:24.740> be

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
be open or the other wheels are gonna be

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.760 
be open or the other wheels are gonna be
open<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.810> there's<00:02:26.810> just<00:02:26.960> so<00:02:27.170> many<00:02:27.260> ridiculous

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
open and there's just so many ridiculous

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.230 
open and there's just so many ridiculous
things<00:02:27.980> you<00:02:28.130> can<00:02:28.280> do<00:02:28.400> with<00:02:28.550> this<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:28.730> know<00:02:29.000> if

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
things you can do with this you know if

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.360 
things you can do with this you know if
they<00:02:29.720> drop<00:02:30.140> back<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.380> lot<00:02:30.680> in<00:02:30.800> coverage<00:02:31.130> you<00:02:31.280> can

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
they drop back a lot in coverage you can

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.830 
they drop back a lot in coverage you can
hit<00:02:31.460> the<00:02:31.640> under<00:02:31.940> wheels<00:02:32.120> that<00:02:32.390> are<00:02:32.480> coming<00:02:32.720> out

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
hit the under wheels that are coming out

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.330 
hit the under wheels that are coming out
you<00:02:33.080> can<00:02:33.110> always<00:02:33.290> scramble<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:34.130> can<00:02:34.220> always

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
you can always scramble you can always

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.280 
you can always scramble you can always
go<00:02:34.580> if<00:02:34.880> they<00:02:35.090> do<00:02:35.150> is<00:02:35.330> own<00:02:35.570> the<00:02:35.600> X<00:02:35.960> will<00:02:36.170> almost

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
go if they do is own the X will almost

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.050 
go if they do is own the X will almost
always<00:02:36.530> kill<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:36.980> zone<00:02:37.190> it's<00:02:37.460> it's<00:02:37.940> just

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.850 
be open but in here like look at the X
just<00:02:53.330> completely<00:02:53.660> destroy<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.320> zone<00:02:54.560> and

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
just completely destroy the zone and

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.070 
just completely destroy the zone and
then<00:02:55.370> you<00:02:56.270> know<00:02:56.390> there's<00:02:56.600> so<00:02:56.780> many<00:02:56.870> options

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
then you know there's so many options

then you know there's so many options
you<00:02:57.830> hit<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.100> tight<00:02:58.340> end<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:58.790> if<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:58.940> go-to

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
you hit the tight end and if the go-to

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.550 
you hit the tight end and if the go-to
zones<00:02:59.420> you<00:02:59.510> hit<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.720> X<00:02:59.840> receiver<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.470> if

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
zones you hit the X receiver and if

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.050 
zones you hit the X receiver and if
they're<00:03:00.650> doing<00:03:00.710> a<00:03:00.860> drop<00:03:01.070> in<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:01.400> whole<00:03:01.790> bunch<00:03:01.940> of

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
they're doing a drop in a whole bunch of

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.790 
they're doing a drop in a whole bunch of
coverage<00:03:02.540> then<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:03.320> can<00:03:03.470> always<00:03:03.560> just

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
coverage then you can always just

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.680 
coverage then you can always just
scramble<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:04.460> if<00:03:04.520> they<00:03:04.640> go<00:03:04.760> back<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:05.300> do<00:03:05.450> deep

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
scramble and if they go back and do deep

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:06.970 
scramble and if they go back and do deep
coverage<00:03:05.990> you<00:03:06.110> can<00:03:06.200> hit<00:03:06.290> those<00:03:06.440> under<00:03:06.770> zones

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
coverage you can hit those under zones

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.950 
coverage you can hit those under zones
and<00:03:07.280> if<00:03:07.760> they're<00:03:08.000> user<00:03:08.210> in<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.450> halfback<00:03:08.630> we
