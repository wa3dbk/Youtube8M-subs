00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.009 
as i know that's a one of a kind like a
pro<00:03:02.940> so<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.150> think<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.569> they<00:03:03.690> were<00:03:03.750> going<00:03:03.959> to

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
pro so I think that they were going to

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.410 
pro so I think that they were going to
use<00:03:04.230> this<00:03:04.440> for<00:03:05.129> like<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.640> art<00:03:05.819> direction<00:03:06.000> like

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
use this for like the art direction like

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.330 
use this for like the art direction like
in<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.599> backgrounds<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.409> show<00:03:07.620> I<00:03:07.859> don't

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
in the backgrounds of the show I don't

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.949 
in the backgrounds of the show I don't
know<00:03:08.459> this<00:03:08.700> particular<00:03:09.000> one<00:03:09.299> ever<00:03:09.540> made<00:03:09.810> it

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
know this particular one ever made it

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.839 
know this particular one ever made it
into<00:03:10.140> any<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:10.409> episodes<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:11.159> think<00:03:11.340> this

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
into any of the episodes I think this

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.930 
into any of the episodes I think this
one<00:03:12.090> was<00:03:12.269> like<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.450> prototype<00:03:12.989> so<00:03:13.890> there<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:14.819> go

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
one was like a prototype so there you go

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.900 
one was like a prototype so there you go
one<00:03:15.329> of<00:03:15.419> a<00:03:15.480> kind<00:03:15.829> papas<00:03:16.829> can<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:17.370> do<00:03:17.519> some<00:03:17.730> pop

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
one of a kind papas can you do some pop

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.740 
one of a kind papas can you do some pop
phase<00:03:18.120> impressions<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:21.169> guess<00:03:22.169> a<00:03:22.200> pop<00:03:22.470> is<00:03:23.750> what

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
phase impressions I guess a pop is what

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.020 
phase impressions I guess a pop is what
doesn't<00:03:24.989> say<00:03:25.200> I'm<00:03:25.380> out<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.950> motion<00:03:26.430> motion<00:03:26.790> in

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
doesn't say I'm out the motion motion in

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.360 
doesn't say I'm out the motion motion in
the<00:03:27.090> potion<00:03:27.510> which<00:03:27.750> is<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.930> potent<00:03:28.290> what's<00:03:29.250> your
