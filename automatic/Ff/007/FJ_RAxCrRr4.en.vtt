00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.750
 reflective face 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.320

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.660
 window mapped environment so will not 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.370

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.510

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.280
 I'm going to work with your notebook when 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.600
 you 're out of the house inside 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.260
 same house 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:52.120
 sometimes with the window back there three 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:54.550
 usb ports and the way this model is 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.760
 that it has a numeric keypad it 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.440
 here in the corner you can see 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.590
 notebook has a numeric keypad like 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.410
 if it was the keyboard this is normal 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.920
 Beauty, now, the people. 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.400
 The negative points of the notebook I said 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:17.110
 which had three usb beauty ports 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:21.160
 only three USB ports are 2.0 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.550
 at least 1 3.11 a port 3.0 and could 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:28.360
 see her right 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:30.519
 but beauty microphone but very low 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.940
 Notebook microphone, right? 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:37.060
 I had to buy a microphone that did not 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.920
 I know if it's going to sound very good, you bad 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.590
 I 'm sorry, I'm going to have to type 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:47.680
 much still but the sound of it is very low 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:51.280
 It's something I do not think I know for you. 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.040
 It's very bad for me here, his keyboard. 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.959
 the question mark normally 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.790
 another hp notebook and several is the point of 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.800
 question is right here on the side of the 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.810
 shift, man, then you're typing 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.780
 automatically you shift the shift 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.239
 the question mark is the point of 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.370
 interrogation is there in wk 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:16.660
 There you are typing, you're going to have to 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.760
 squeeze the alt gr eow then this one 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:26.050
 it will also be a matter of custom too 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:26.800
 Hey everyone, this notebook weighs two. 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.800
 pounds 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.490
 around 22 and a half, right? 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.759
 it's not too heavy it's compact like 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.430
 Can you see it in the photo? 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:43.060
 and if you like, you left it there and then any 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:46.870
 I'll be right in doubt, will not you? 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:50.500
 it's in the range of a price and you 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:54.430
 from 1,800 to 2,000 more than 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.530
 This or is bullshit you bought wait 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.680
 and the promotions you get there 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:03.610
 find a very affordable price then 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:09.280
 who likes game is a great option 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:12.069
 when there are several games there by graf and only 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.330
 that the 2015 launches there that are 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:16.240
 arriving 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.930
 You're not going to run funai, are you going? 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.960
 require a much better processor there and 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:26.169
 with the video card also more powerful 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.530
 It could be that you rode in normal 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:33.729
 Assassin's creed a new one and must roll 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:36.130
 No, crazy, this is just testing the galley. 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.120
 It's closing this way, it's not going to stay. 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.180
 very large 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:44.400
 If you liked your fan, then doubt it. 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.400
 just put it down
