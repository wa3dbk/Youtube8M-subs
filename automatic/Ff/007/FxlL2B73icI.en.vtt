00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
to be a little higher if you take a

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.570 
to be a little higher if you take a
shape<00:01:02.090> for<00:01:02.450> a<00:01:02.480> long<00:01:02.660> time<00:01:02.960> a<00:01:03.260> feeling<00:01:04.100> comes<00:01:04.369> an

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
shape for a long time a feeling comes an

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
inherent meaning kind of embodies the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.550 
inherent meaning kind of embodies the
shade<00:01:07.039> so<00:01:07.310> it's<00:01:07.520> a<00:01:07.640> lot<00:01:07.789> of<00:01:07.910> listening

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
shade so it's a lot of listening

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.910

urgency you're always aware without

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.100 
urgency you're always aware without

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
being felt here it's teaching truths you

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.249 
being felt here it's teaching truths you
know<00:01:46.369> instead<00:01:46.729> of<00:01:46.790> these<00:01:47.060> forms<00:01:47.659> and<00:01:47.990> without

know instead of these forms and without
meaning<00:01:48.759> and<00:01:50.170> then<00:01:51.170> against<00:01:51.590> this<00:01:51.770> against

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
meaning and then against this against

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.430 
meaning and then against this against
this<00:01:52.670> beautiful<00:01:53.539> movement<00:01:53.720> quality<00:01:54.320> you've

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
this beautiful movement quality you've

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.070 
this beautiful movement quality you've
got<00:01:54.619> beautiful<00:01:55.549> it<00:01:55.700> needs<00:01:55.940> some<00:01:56.090> surprise<00:01:59.080> it

got beautiful it needs some surprise it

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.800 
got beautiful it needs some surprise it
is<00:02:00.140> broken<00:02:00.649> into<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.250> many<00:02:01.399> fractions<00:02:02.000> then<00:02:02.720> we

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
is broken into so many fractions then we

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:15.790 
is broken into so many fractions then we
need<00:02:02.960> to<00:02:03.080> see<00:02:03.229> them<00:02:03.409> all<00:02:03.590> like<00:02:03.830> dappled<00:02:04.429> light
