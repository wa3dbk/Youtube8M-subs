00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.660
 ok since we are in full swing 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.970
 spring I decided to do some 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.340
 changes and I dedicate myself to the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.170
 haircut to color clearly 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.810
 they rely on me as an expert 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.730
 this case I am very bad and we go 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.109
 inside we see what they propose to me and 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.539
 then you will see final result I hope you 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.340
 like it but above all we go to 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.809
 discover the hair threads together 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.930
 obviously both the color and the cut 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.780
 for spring summer 2014 the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.890
 bob put that is what I will choose 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.200
 or a correct application of the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.149
 carriage and headband moved in the key 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.879
 absolutely contemporary and then the 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.210
 color whatever they choose 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.039
 more celebrities is the ronde 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.930
 shatush let's see what it is also 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.789
 it all looks great in a game of 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.370
 photonic because on one side present 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.770
 we have the riot of carts 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.010
 this summer from this spring summer 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:11.119
 and on the other is the opposite, that is this 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.119
 want to cut vertical wilder 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.760
 typical 80s 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.600
 she 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.860
 s 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.320
 allowing the most beautiful when it is 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.759
 done in an elegant way than in measuring 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.790
 the back of the head all this already in the 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.790
 twenties when chanel period 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.300
 we saw gordon maximum like these 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.770
 it was never very beautiful but there were many 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.900
 types of women then I saw that it is 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:54.890
 returned, however, the pixi that I am already 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:56.570
 we have seen we are not in fact 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.670
 have been important choices e 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.220
 courageous also the cut is born with the 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.540
 technology in the late 60s with the 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.790
 cut of my farrow and the fact that 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.470
 women of this type have chosen to 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.810
 cut your hair short to make a 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.570
 pinch pixie cut has influenced 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.700
 a lot women all over the world e 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.770
 all of them have been cut 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.250
 forms of lecce p woman then the pixie 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.990
 cut then the unique cut is better at 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.050
 everyone is not the pixie cut at what 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.720
 more universal, paradoxically, a thread 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.000
 longer is almost a medium a short 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.850
 average for cassano 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.280
 let's say from color cuts go immediately 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.820
 in the eyes as we have seen in 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.380
 spring summer collections as much 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.480
 actually the trendiest colors of the 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.500
 fuchsia is pink at the moment 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.680
 constant on ebay and the most sold color 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.680
 in the world 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.150
 it is very interesting even though it is a lot 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.900
 on him the former scudetto brand 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.900
 bronze is a neologism 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:04.610
 recent very recent because it combines 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.860
 bronte was born as a fusion between 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.570
 basically blond and brown 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.180
 kept out a sound that looks like 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:15.350
 to the word bronze working on with two 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:18.890
 an exterior shade for light then 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.930
 for the clear and often bronze part e 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.180
 an internal often chocolate 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.460
 even in some cases almost black 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.140
 of etna this is precisely chosen by the 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.060
 salami of weeks and that's a lot 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.390
 certainly because jessica biel and for example 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.920
 a very testimonial left in this way 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.270
 catwalk instead in all 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.760
 possibility concerns we have we are 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.860
 organizing braid parts designed 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.680
 just to indicate this 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.180
 desire to weave in so many ways 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.840
 all possible ways 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.010
 we brought up an idea behind 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.700
 splendid that the piercing for trolleys 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.000
 where accessory or accessory as mo 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.000
 such as 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.110
 we block them we decorate we create these 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.110
 fine buckles 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.870
 at this point, however , we give it 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.460
 the appointment again for 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.590
 summer we focused on 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.090
 form the curve before we have some 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.550
 I really enjoyed many trends together 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.430
 this great scam and approve the 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.470
 next time if we find there 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.280
