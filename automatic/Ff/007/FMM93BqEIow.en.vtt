00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Well, hello to all my dear friends and 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.140
 as promised, I will teach you how 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.150
 same keep your server in cs 1 6 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.340
 if you watched my first video on 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.620
 about this, then you already about all this 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.480
 you know if someone hasn't seen him yet 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.699
 link goto description go and 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.490
 look it was my such introduction 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.769
 before the main work but now 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.390
 We will begin as I said in the first 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.619
 video then my server is on this 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.060
 casting which is called 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.119
 playground.ru 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.130
 that's it for him on his example I'm you 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.290
 I will show everything because therefore 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.630
 hosting I know a lot more than 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.340
 to others and I will tell you that at all 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.300
 hosting and but there almost everything 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.250
 equally this is no big difference well 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.110
 well here we go to the site and so 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.789
 we had access to our control panel 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.140
 we need to register here 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.360
 check in 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.250
 This is such a procedure , it is mandatory here. 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.020
 not hard here you literally need 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.989
 will come up with your username and password and 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.270
 there write your phone number what do you 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.399
 Some sms came with a type code 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.860
 make sure you are not a robot but it is 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.869
 everywhere I think you know it as soon as 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.659
 we came registration procedures then us 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.610
 will need to go to the client panel 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.530
 click here here and here we need 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.760
 will specify our username and password which 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.760
 we indicated at registration 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.730
 I have entered my data now I click 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.960
 enter express such a sign if 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.770
 you can read 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.780
 just press ok and it closes well 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.520
 Well, here we go to our workplace 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.150
 panel where we will manage everything 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.970
 servers 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.550
 here here is the information column you have 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.820
 there will be no contract number here 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.530
 there will be nothing on your account 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.300
 neither active orders and system 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.000
 notifications will also be empty at all 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.729
 field well let's take a look at 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.340
 by the interface it is very simple here 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.950
 here, too , a lot of mind does not need that all this 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.520
 understand the profile here we can 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.710
 climb on a construction site to change our data 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.619
 change our phone number everything in general 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.510
 will change our settings further finance 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.150
 here we can replenish our account 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.600
 view history replenishment and history 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.820
 expenses replenish the account that is, we can 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.240
 webmoney and yandex money or some 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.489
 there is another way where all these go 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.550
 money they go here on this one 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.120
 counter that is it threw 67 hryvnia 40 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.340
 kopecks 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.110
 hosting this Ukrainian so if you 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.130
 You will throw themselves in the name of money 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.290
 rubles they will still 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.580
 transfer in hryvnia at the current rate 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.230
 that is, here he is doing more 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.810
 let's see who replenished the story 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.130
 spending and so on all the money goes here 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.130
 on this account that with them to do next 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.380
 I'll tell you later on we go masonry 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.709
 server server is probably the most 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.830
 the main tab is generally from this panel 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.810
 they will tell at the very end 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.420
 ticket tickets and I don't know what I am 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.890
 it does not touch help help you 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.799
 here you can contact support 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.350
 if you do not understand something but also the way out 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:12.650
 this is the exit from the working panel 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.660
 No, I do not want to go well, let's say 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.299
 we got acquainted with our work panel and 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.390
 Now we already want to order our 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:24.620
 server click on the service tab and that 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.870
 waiting for a new order here we see from 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.819
 server category server counter strike 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.920
 1 6 and second global offencive jackson 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.260
 some other server all 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.170
 faith on minecraft team fortress 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.750
 still drive 100 proxies to our server 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.660
 that is, we will hang around the clock 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.400
 healthy in our server and all haze there 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.209
 on the cards they will be there to merge on 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.760
 some website 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.489
 it is already a separate story here 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.330
 if we want a server while out of 16, then we 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.819
 choose here 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:00.170
 easy or medium here we direct and here we read 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.170
 which is an automatic server installation 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.940
 less than one minute is convenient 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.720
 This is some kind of server control protection 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.720
 by ddos 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.300
 and exploits and things like that we can 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.519
 here we can choose a server for 4 hryvnias 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.400
 for 5 that is, 4 hryvnia is the cost 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.430
 single slot 5 is as good now as 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.580
 times summer and all three months here are discounts 20 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.610
 percent when the years finish about the discount 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.010
 will pass but this by itself I have a server 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:32.540
 what 4 hryvnia slot because 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:35.389
 there is no difference what for 5 4 to pay a little 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.870
 more but to sense from this development in general 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:41.210
 I did not see the first server was that up to 5 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.000
 that is, here is this medium, I'm just bigger 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.490
 paid but much big difference i'm not 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.580
 saw him not at all if more precisely 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.440
 I now have this one here and I’m server 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.780
 development as i said i don't see 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.750
 just pay less hryvnia 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:00.400
 Well, let's say that you have decided and want 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:03.289
 order your server pick or raisin 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.080
 or medium I click on izi 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:08.750
 we now choose click continue 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.900
 here we choose the period we can choose 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.270
 month 2 3 and so on until the year I always 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.780
 I choose a month that's enough for me 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.039
 here we can choose the number of slots 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:23.479
 the minimum quantity is 10 that is 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:26.210
 five to five players and from sti to 32 and 16 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:29.150
 chance is the maximum I have to sit on 10 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.110
 This is the principle of the 20 normally choose 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.750
 number of slots 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.870
 here you will immediately be paid with 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:38.300
 considering the discount it will be you 30 hryvnia 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.160
 if you have all confirmed here you are already 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.380
 made sure everyone selected click on 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.230
 order a button but to order us 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.720
