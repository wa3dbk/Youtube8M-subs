now since we're going to be applying
this<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> vertical<00:01:09.869> surface<00:01:10.290> we're<00:01:10.619> going

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
this to a vertical surface we're going

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.070 
this to a vertical surface we're going
to<00:01:10.799> apply<00:01:10.920> just<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.400> drop<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.150> ten<00:01:12.659> thick's

runny liquid to a fixed tropic paste

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.450 
runny liquid to a fixed tropic paste
which<00:01:21.720> means<00:01:21.990> it'll<00:01:22.799> have<00:01:22.979> more<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.310> a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
which means it'll have more of a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.969 
which means it'll have more of a
frosting<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:24.630> consistency<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.439> won't<00:01:25.740> run

our cut or scrape or whatever we're
creating<00:01:35.990> now<00:01:36.990> you'll<00:01:37.140> notice<00:01:37.350> we

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
creating now you'll notice we

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.990 
creating now you'll notice we
transferred<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.220> back<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.610> forth<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.970> couple

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
transferred that back and forth a couple

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.940 
transferred that back and forth a couple
of<00:01:39.270> times<00:01:39.450> between<00:01:39.689> those<00:01:40.049> cups<00:01:40.350> because<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.860> a

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
of times between those cups because in a

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.800 
of times between those cups because in a
small<00:01:41.130> amount<00:01:41.549> it's<00:01:41.729> very<00:01:42.090> easy<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.540> get<00:01:42.689> out

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
small amount it's very easy to get out

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.899 
small amount it's very easy to get out
of<00:01:42.930> ratio<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:43.950> want<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.280> go<00:01:44.369> back<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.759> forth

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
of ratio so we want to go back and forth

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.670 
of ratio so we want to go back and forth
make<00:01:45.210> sure<00:01:45.390> every<00:01:45.869> bit<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.380> stirred

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
make sure every bit of that is stirred

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.530 
make sure every bit of that is stirred
into<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.100> mixture<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:48.000> we<00:01:48.030> don't<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.390> any

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
into the mixture so we don't have any

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.480 
into the mixture so we don't have any
cure<00:01:48.899> issues<00:01:49.290> later<00:01:49.530> on<00:01:49.740> especially<00:01:49.979> since

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
cure issues later on especially since

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.120 
cure issues later on especially since
we'll<00:01:50.640> be<00:01:50.670> applying<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.899> our<00:01:52.229> subjects

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
we'll be applying this to our subjects

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.450 
we'll be applying this to our subjects
skin<00:01:53.630> now<00:01:54.630> we're<00:01:55.110> gonna<00:01:55.200> start<00:01:55.560> by<00:01:55.860> spreading

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
skin now we're gonna start by spreading

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.249 
skin now we're gonna start by spreading
this<00:01:56.700> out<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:58.340> creating<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.460> cut<00:01:59.700> as<00:02:00.030> we<00:02:01.020> go

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
this out and creating the cut as we go

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.200 
this out and creating the cut as we go
and<00:02:01.560> one<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.460> key<00:02:02.670> things<00:02:02.939> when<00:02:03.060> you're

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and one of the key things when you're

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.270 
and one of the key things when you're
building<00:02:03.420> up<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.780> cut<00:02:04.020> like<00:02:04.259> this<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.130> make

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
building up a cut like this is to make

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.229 
building up a cut like this is to make
sure<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.549> feather<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.360> edges<00:02:07.069> that's

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
sure you feather in the edges that's

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.150 
sure you feather in the edges that's
super<00:02:09.239> important<00:02:09.720> because<00:02:09.810> if<00:02:10.050> we<00:02:10.080> if<00:02:10.530> we<00:02:10.590> wait

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
super important because if we if we wait

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.130 
super important because if we if we wait
to<00:02:11.340> do<00:02:11.489> that<00:02:11.520> step<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.420> end<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.930> pot

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
to do that step to the end of the pot

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.920 
to do that step to the end of the pot
life<00:02:13.379> or<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.680> work

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
life or the work

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.559 
life or the work
time<00:02:14.260> in<00:02:14.409> the<00:02:14.469> material<00:02:14.980> we<00:02:15.519> may<00:02:15.790> not<00:02:16.150> be<00:02:16.209> able

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
time in the material we may not be able

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.539 
time in the material we may not be able
to<00:02:16.719> smooth<00:02:17.290> out<00:02:17.439> those<00:02:17.590> edges<00:02:17.829> and<00:02:18.129> then<00:02:18.400> we'd

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
to smooth out those edges and then we'd

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.339 
to smooth out those edges and then we'd
have<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:18.819> add<00:02:18.939> another<00:02:19.209> batch<00:02:19.689> of<00:02:19.719> gel<00:02:20.170> tin

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
have to add another batch of gel tin

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.500 
have to add another batch of gel tin
over<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.680> top<00:02:20.859> to<00:02:21.579> further<00:02:21.879> feather<00:02:22.299> out

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
over the top to further feather out

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.330 
over the top to further feather out
those<00:02:22.719> edges<00:02:23.109> so<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.709> first<00:02:23.920> thing<00:02:24.099> you<00:02:24.189> want

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
those edges so the first thing you want

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.099 
those edges so the first thing you want
to<00:02:24.400> do<00:02:24.519> is<00:02:24.640> make<00:02:24.849> sure<00:02:24.879> it's<00:02:25.180> feathered<00:02:25.870> into

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
to do is make sure it's feathered into

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:28.380 
to do is make sure it's feathered into
that<00:02:26.260> surrounding<00:02:26.829> skin<00:02:27.129> and<00:02:27.549> you'll<00:02:28.180> notice

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
that surrounding skin and you'll notice

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.059 
that surrounding skin and you'll notice
that<00:02:28.689> even<00:02:28.989> though<00:02:29.200> we're<00:02:29.349> just<00:02:29.560> using<00:02:29.739> a

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
that even though we're just using a

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.250 
that even though we're just using a
generic<00:02:30.459> flesh<00:02:30.849> tone<00:02:31.150> here<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:31.989> we<00:02:32.109> have<00:02:32.230> a

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
generic flesh tone here that we have a

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.899 
generic flesh tone here that we have a
really<00:02:32.620> good<00:02:32.829> match<00:02:33.159> there<00:02:33.579> where<00:02:33.819> it

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
really good match there where it

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.539 
really good match there where it
feathers<00:02:34.329> out<00:02:34.569> into<00:02:35.439> her<00:02:35.620> surrounding<00:02:36.189> skin

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
feathers out into her surrounding skin

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.140 
feathers out into her surrounding skin
we<00:02:37.239> get<00:02:37.389> a<00:02:37.450> really<00:02:37.750> nice<00:02:38.489> blending<00:02:39.489> going<00:02:39.700> on

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
we get a really nice blending going on

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.740 
we get a really nice blending going on
there<00:02:40.389> now<00:02:41.069> keep<00:02:42.069> in<00:02:42.219> mind<00:02:42.250> that<00:02:42.670> gel<00:02:43.090> tin<00:02:43.359> has

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
there now keep in mind that gel tin has

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.869 
there now keep in mind that gel tin has
about<00:02:44.079> a<00:02:44.109> five-minute<00:02:44.769> working<00:02:45.129> time<00:02:45.370> or<00:02:45.639> pot

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
about a five-minute working time or pot

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.690 
about a five-minute working time or pot
life<00:02:46.230> before<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:47.349> starts<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.739> gel<00:02:48.189> and<00:02:48.430> become

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
life before it starts to gel and become

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.179 
life before it starts to gel and become
unworkable<00:02:49.480> so<00:02:50.079> the<00:02:50.349> key<00:02:50.560> things<00:02:50.829> we<00:02:50.919> want<00:02:51.129> to

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189 
unworkable so the key things we want to

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:53.069 
unworkable so the key things we want to
do<00:02:51.340> here<00:02:51.579> is<00:02:51.700> just<00:02:51.939> in<00:02:52.060> that<00:02:52.180> first<00:02:52.480> minute<00:02:52.989> or

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
do here is just in that first minute or

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.929 
do here is just in that first minute or
so<00:02:53.260> of<00:02:53.379> application<00:02:54.069> we<00:02:54.519> want<00:02:54.639> to<00:02:54.790> make<00:02:54.909> sure

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:54.939 
so of application we want to make sure

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.059 
so of application we want to make sure
we<00:02:55.329> spread<00:02:55.810> out<00:02:55.989> those<00:02:56.200> edges<00:02:56.620> and<00:02:56.769> get<00:02:56.889> those

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
we spread out those edges and get those

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.220 
we spread out those edges and get those
blended<00:02:57.579> in<00:02:57.760> before<00:02:58.120> we<00:02:58.239> start<00:02:58.480> focusing<00:02:58.689> on

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
blended in before we start focusing on

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.649 
blended in before we start focusing on
sculpting<00:03:00.129> our<00:03:00.250> cut<00:03:00.489> because<00:03:00.849> even<00:03:01.540> after

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
sculpting our cut because even after

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.979 
sculpting our cut because even after
we're<00:03:02.049> past<00:03:02.500> that<00:03:02.819> 5-minute<00:03:03.819> pot<00:03:04.000> life<00:03:04.269> the

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
we're past that 5-minute pot life the

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.229 
we're past that 5-minute pot life the
gelatin<00:03:05.650> just<00:03:05.829> turns<00:03:06.069> kind<00:03:06.400> of<00:03:06.549> stringy<00:03:07.030> at

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
gelatin just turns kind of stringy at

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.440 
gelatin just turns kind of stringy at
that<00:03:07.419> point<00:03:07.689> and<00:03:07.950> we<00:03:08.950> can<00:03:09.129> create<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.579> even<00:03:10.060> more

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
that point and we can create a even more

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.990 
that point and we can create a even more
realistic<00:03:10.959> wound<00:03:11.469> at<00:03:11.709> that<00:03:11.859> point<00:03:12.129> so<00:03:12.879> the

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
realistic wound at that point so the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.270 
realistic wound at that point so the
first<00:03:13.239> key<00:03:13.629> step<00:03:13.659> there<00:03:14.439> is<00:03:14.469> blending<00:03:15.189> out

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
first key step there is blending out

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.860 
first key step there is blending out
those<00:03:15.459> edges<00:03:15.669> and<00:03:15.879> feathering<00:03:16.359> those<00:03:16.629> into

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
those edges and feathering those into

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.719 
those edges and feathering those into
the<00:03:16.989> surrounding<00:03:17.469> skin<00:03:17.769> so<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.519> we<00:03:18.609> have<00:03:18.699> a

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:18.729 
the surrounding skin so that we have a

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:20.699 
the surrounding skin so that we have a
good<00:03:18.940> blending<00:03:19.359> edge<00:03:19.569> then<00:03:20.169> we<00:03:20.290> just<00:03:20.470> want<00:03:20.620> to

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
good blending edge then we just want to

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.009 
good blending edge then we just want to
come<00:03:20.829> back<00:03:21.010> in<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.549> create<00:03:22.269> our<00:03:22.479> cut<00:03:22.780> or

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
come back in and create our cut or

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.539 
come back in and create our cut or
scrape<00:03:23.409> or<00:03:23.620> whatever<00:03:23.859> going<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.099> do<00:03:24.280> with<00:03:24.519> a

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
scrape or whatever going to do with a

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.420 
scrape or whatever going to do with a
popsicle<00:03:25.180> stick<00:03:25.209> and<00:03:26.190> depending<00:03:27.190> on<00:03:27.280> what

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
popsicle stick and depending on what

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.009 
popsicle stick and depending on what
kind<00:03:27.519> of<00:03:27.639> cut<00:03:27.879> you're<00:03:28.060> going<00:03:28.299> for<00:03:28.540> you<00:03:28.690> can<00:03:28.810> see

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
kind of cut you're going for you can see

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.439 
kind of cut you're going for you can see
in<00:03:29.109> some<00:03:29.290> of<00:03:29.349> our<00:03:29.409> other<00:03:29.470> videos<00:03:29.859> we<00:03:30.579> we<00:03:31.150> show<00:03:31.419> a

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:31.449 
in some of our other videos we we show a

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:33.420 
in some of our other videos we we show a
lot<00:03:31.810> more<00:03:31.840> elaborate<00:03:32.560> cuts<00:03:32.799> than<00:03:33.040> this<00:03:33.189> where

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
lot more elaborate cuts than this where

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.699 
lot more elaborate cuts than this where
we<00:03:33.549> do<00:03:33.729> entire<00:03:34.510> ripped<00:03:34.810> out<00:03:34.989> throats<00:03:35.349> you<00:03:35.500> can

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
we do entire ripped out throats you can

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.399 
we do entire ripped out throats you can
always<00:03:35.889> add<00:03:36.189> subsequent<00:03:37.150> layers<00:03:37.359> of<00:03:37.780> gel<00:03:38.109> tin

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
always add subsequent layers of gel tin

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.640 
always add subsequent layers of gel tin
to<00:03:38.709> create<00:03:39.459> an<00:03:39.579> even<00:03:39.879> deeper<00:03:40.090> effect<00:03:40.449> now<00:03:41.409> here

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
to create an even deeper effect now here

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.550 
to create an even deeper effect now here
we're<00:03:41.799> just<00:03:41.829> going<00:03:42.069> to<00:03:42.159> go<00:03:42.280> in<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:43.530> make<00:03:44.530> sure

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
we're just going to go in and make sure

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.530 
we're just going to go in and make sure
again<00:03:44.979> that<00:03:45.159> we've<00:03:45.250> got<00:03:45.459> that<00:03:45.639> edge<00:03:45.909> all<00:03:46.180> blend

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
again that we've got that edge all blend

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.140 
again that we've got that edge all blend
it<00:03:46.659> down<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:47.109> just<00:03:47.590> create<00:03:48.099> some<00:03:48.310> claw<00:03:48.639> marks

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
it down and just create some claw marks

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.710 
it down and just create some claw marks
in<00:03:49.359> this<00:03:49.720> we're<00:03:49.959> gonna<00:03:50.079> create<00:03:50.439> a<00:03:50.790> like<00:03:51.790> some

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
in this we're gonna create a like some

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.210 
in this we're gonna create a like some
kind<00:03:52.900> of<00:03:52.959> creature<00:03:53.290> or<00:03:53.590> something<00:03:53.620> grabbed

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:02.199 
here is just just a very basic technique

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:04.740 
here is just just a very basic technique
what<00:04:02.680> you<00:04:02.829> can<00:04:03.009> do<00:04:03.159> with<00:04:03.400> just<00:04:03.430> just<00:04:04.359> straight

the gel tin cut kit and some blood

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.879 
the gel tin cut kit and some blood
we<00:04:10.209> didn't<00:04:10.479> even<00:04:10.720> attempt<00:04:11.199> to<00:04:11.290> do<00:04:11.470> any<00:04:11.620> kind<00:04:11.859> of

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
we didn't even attempt to do any kind of

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:14.189 
we didn't even attempt to do any kind of
blending<00:04:12.340> on<00:04:12.459> this<00:04:12.639> all<00:04:12.879> we<00:04:13.030> did<00:04:13.239> was<00:04:13.750> apply<00:04:14.079> it

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:14.199 
blending on this all we did was apply it

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:16.439 
blending on this all we did was apply it
let<00:04:14.650> it<00:04:14.680> gel<00:04:15.129> and<00:04:15.400> see<00:04:15.819> there<00:04:16.000> it's<00:04:16.150> gotten

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
let it gel and see there it's gotten

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.390 
let it gel and see there it's gotten
kind<00:04:16.599> of<00:04:16.690> stringy<00:04:17.019> and<00:04:17.289> as<00:04:17.799> soon<00:04:18.070> as<00:04:18.220> it's

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
kind of stringy and as soon as it's

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.360 
kind of stringy and as soon as it's
gelled<00:04:18.820> ready<00:04:19.150> to<00:04:19.359> apply<00:04:19.959> our<00:04:19.989> blood<00:04:20.440> so
