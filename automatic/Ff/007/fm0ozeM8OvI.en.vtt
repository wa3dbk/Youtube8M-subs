Anya<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.660> think<00:02:30.989> animation<00:02:31.769> is<00:02:31.860> very

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
Anya I think animation is very

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.330 
Anya I think animation is very
competitive<00:02:32.930> lots<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.140> lots<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.319> people<00:02:34.440> take

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
the courses and you have to separate

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.740 
the courses and you have to separate
yourself<00:02:37.790> as<00:02:38.790> much<00:02:39.000> as<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.180> can't<00:02:39.420> really

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
yourself as much as you can't really

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.580 
yourself as much as you can't really

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
calling card it's it's the most

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.370 
calling card it's it's the most
important<00:03:09.480> thing<00:03:09.510> no<00:03:09.780> matter<00:03:09.900> what<00:03:10.019> you're

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
important thing no matter what you're

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
doing and once you get experienced then

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.910 
doing and once you get experienced then
obviously<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:13.139> start<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.440> build<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.650> resume

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
obviously you start to build a resume

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.740 
obviously you start to build a resume
but<00:03:14.100> you're<00:03:14.280> really<00:03:14.489> was<00:03:14.609> sort<00:03:14.760> of<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.209> think<00:03:15.480> is

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
but you're really was sort of I think is

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.970 
but you're really was sort of I think is
the<00:03:15.900> most<00:03:16.049> important<00:03:16.470> thing<00:03:16.590> do<00:03:16.829> you<00:03:16.920> think

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
the most important thing do you think

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.370 
the most important thing do you think
yeah<00:03:17.790> I<00:03:17.819> think<00:03:18.150> about<00:03:18.600> animation<00:03:19.139> I<00:03:19.200> talk

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
yeah I think about animation I talk

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.080 
yeah I think about animation I talk
about<00:03:19.650> on<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:19.859> meters<00:03:20.190> because<00:03:20.400> I'm<00:03:20.730> not<00:03:20.940> an

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
about on the meters because I'm not an

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.250 
about on the meters because I'm not an
amateur<00:03:21.209> yeah<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:22.170> think<00:03:22.350> that<00:03:23.959> till<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:24.989> few

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
amateur yeah I think that till a few

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.900 
amateur yeah I think that till a few
weeks<00:03:25.470> ago<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:25.980> we<00:03:26.010> there<00:03:26.370> was<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.549> big

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
weeks ago that we there was a big

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.960 
weeks ago that we there was a big
difference<00:03:27.810> between<00:03:28.410> creatures<00:03:29.250> I<00:03:29.459> mean<00:03:29.700> the

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
difference between creatures I mean the

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.120 
difference between creatures I mean the
car<00:03:30.209> tomatoes<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.139> feels<00:03:31.410> like<00:03:31.709> to<00:03:31.950> me<00:03:32.100> that

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
car tomatoes it feels like to me that

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.170 
car tomatoes it feels like to me that
now<00:03:33.680> to<00:03:34.680> be<00:03:34.799> able<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.130> find<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:35.489> job<00:03:35.519> you<00:03:36.030> should

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
now to be able to find a job you should

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.819 
now to be able to find a job you should
be<00:03:36.709> good<00:03:37.709> at<00:03:38.099> both<00:03:38.849> so<00:03:39.510> maybe<00:03:39.870> my<00:03:40.230> advice<00:03:40.560> would

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
be good at both so maybe my advice would

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.349 
be good at both so maybe my advice would
be<00:03:40.889> to<00:03:41.040> don't<00:03:41.670> focus<00:03:42.269> on<00:03:42.690> only<00:03:42.989> one<00:03:44.209> aspect<00:03:45.209> of

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
be to don't focus on only one aspect of

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.659 
be to don't focus on only one aspect of
animation<00:03:45.959> you<00:03:46.290> know<00:03:46.470> focus<00:03:46.799> on<00:03:46.919> creature<00:03:47.400> and

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
animation you know focus on creature and

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:50.479 
animation you know focus on creature and
measure<00:03:47.849> only<00:03:48.540> or<00:03:49.049> characterization<00:03:49.799> only

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
measure only or characterization only

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.589 
measure only or characterization only
try<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.030> make<00:03:51.599> a<00:03:51.630> real<00:03:51.959> that<00:03:52.319> covers<00:03:52.859> both<00:03:53.599> so

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
try to make a real that covers both so

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.290 
try to make a real that covers both so
you<00:03:54.660> may<00:03:54.959> have

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
you may have

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.160 
you may have
your<00:03:56.510> chance<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:57.020> find<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.590> top<00:03:57.800> loop
