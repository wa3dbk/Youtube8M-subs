00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:04.170
 now it is finally on the market it is already three days in the market the new one 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.910
 iPad from Apple 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.650
 On the first weekend already 250 to 300 thousand copies were sold so 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.159
 appreciates the word for Jarno and we have so much time 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:15.999
 to test that 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:20.050
 the first impression is very positive the screen is very high and very bright 

00:00:20.049 --> 00:00:22.960
 dissolving 10 Zwolle big 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.679
 The use is very intuitive I enjoy it very much 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.130
 work it makes in particular a lot of fun with it 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.249
 to drink on the internet 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.610
 Apple has really solved that very well 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.890
 around on the 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.100
 the negative side is the weight of almost 700 grams, it is very heavy 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.769
 especially if you want to hold it with one hand and 10 in particular for 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.129
 Reading books really requires two hands around the individual 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.660
 To turn pages 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.270
 Dell, especially if you want to use that out there percent is a problem 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.940
 that the screen reflects very strongly I think you can do this here 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.880
 quite good to see that the reflections are very strong 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.980
 new and a lot of publishers have been waiting for it is the iBooks app over 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.830
 which you can buy also fishermen that is very elegant solved a very elegant 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.100
 user guidance 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.490
 At the moment there are about 60 000 titles 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.170
 Percent deliverable compared to just under 400,000 per cent on Amazon 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.710
 Percent the books are also very nicely presented it is fun 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.850
 to read the screen resolution 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.299
 speaks for it also for a long time 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.500
 can work with this device 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.630
 The good news also wants that all the books you already have for the 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.200
 Children bought can also be read about this Amazon 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.749
 One has developed a pediatrician iPad 

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:43.600
 and everything 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.010
 is available and really very nice to abuse 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.790
 whether the iPad will really prevail for reading books is due 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.450
 the weight in my opinion questionable but correct sense makes it if not 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.320
 only texts but also other media like videos KÃ¶hne pictures come together 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.300
 for daily newspapers or magazines especially if they are for the iPad 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.369
 are designed 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.030
 like the Wall Street Journal, for example, a few days ago 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.339
 has launched its own app for the market 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:13.709
 that's really fun and there 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.469
 Who will win the whole power this iPad really brings 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:23.209
 Obviously this is certainly one of the parade applications 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.309
 for the Alps 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:27.359
 The iPad is a bit like a sports car 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:31.299
 it's a lot of fun playing back it's super fast 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.500
 but and I also probably do not want it at the same time 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:40.420
 After I do not get used to it the first three days I want it 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:43.799
 probably not give up anymore 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.579
 Altogether we should see there as we are in 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.309
 the future will work with such or similar devices because that is 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:54.629
 the first first step i could imagine is that about the doctor 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.609
 Computer areas of life sneaking in until today computers were free 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.200
 such as the kitchen when I cook I could well imagine 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.390
 that I hang the thing on the wall or wrapped in a foil so that 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:12.049
 it is protected from splashing water why is there a movie to watch or in one 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.029
 So look over the cookbook 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:15.960
 the next six to twelve months 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.579
 will be very interesting 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.069
 and you'll see how the iPad evolves in the future
