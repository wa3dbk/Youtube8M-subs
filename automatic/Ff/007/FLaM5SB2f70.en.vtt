feral<00:01:54.520> mode<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:55.780> I<00:01:55.810> do<00:01:55.929> think<00:01:56.200> in<00:01:56.350> Giants

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
feral mode but I do think in Giants

defense<00:01:57.039> you<00:01:57.189> seem<00:01:57.340> to<00:01:57.399> be<00:01:57.490> pulling<00:01:57.640> back<00:01:57.909> a

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
defense you seem to be pulling back a

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.639 
defense you seem to be pulling back a
little<00:01:58.179> bit<00:01:58.329> here<00:01:58.569> which<00:01:59.079> i<00:01:59.170> think<00:01:59.229> is<00:01:59.380> good

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
little bit here which i think is good

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:00.899 
little bit here which i think is good
because<00:01:59.920> I<00:02:00.069> think<00:02:00.130> audiences<00:02:00.579> are<00:02:00.729> on<00:02:00.789> the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
because I think audiences are on the

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.399 
because I think audiences are on the
verge<00:02:01.119> of<00:02:01.329> having<00:02:01.390> that<00:02:01.659> we're<00:02:01.959> a<00:02:01.990> little<00:02:02.170> thin

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
verge of having that we're a little thin

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.069 
verge of having that we're a little thin
on<00:02:02.439> them<00:02:02.740> but<00:02:03.520> I<00:02:04.030> think<00:02:04.420> this<00:02:04.569> looks<00:02:04.810> like<00:02:04.929> is

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
on them but I think this looks like is

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.499 
on them but I think this looks like is
exciting<00:02:05.590> it<00:02:05.709> you<00:02:05.950> know<00:02:06.069> is<00:02:06.729> exciting<00:02:07.390> in<00:02:07.450> the

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
exciting it you know is exciting in the

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:08.759 
exciting it you know is exciting in the
movies<00:02:07.750> you<00:02:07.840> can<00:02:07.869> make<00:02:08.110> with<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.319> Western<00:02:08.649> I

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
movies you can make with the Western I

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.350 
movies you can make with the Western I
mean<00:02:08.920> they<00:02:09.039> really<00:02:09.519> don't<00:02:09.759> have<00:02:09.879> the<00:02:10.030> benefit

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
mean they really don't have the benefit

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.050 
mean they really don't have the benefit
of<00:02:10.420> a<00:02:10.690> lot<00:02:10.929> of<00:02:11.049> special<00:02:11.410> effects<00:02:11.819> but<00:02:12.819> you<00:02:12.940> know

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
of a lot of special effects but you know

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.030 
of a lot of special effects but you know
they<00:02:13.239> spent<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.630> money<00:02:13.780> here<00:02:14.079> and<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.950> know

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
they spent the money here and you know

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.009 
they spent the money here and you know
infamously<00:02:15.549> with<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.329> situation<00:02:16.870> with<00:02:16.989> the

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
infamously with the situation with the

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.809 
infamously with the situation with the
budget<00:02:17.470> out<00:02:17.769> of<00:02:17.890> control<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.400> they<00:02:18.579> had<00:02:18.700> to

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
budget out of control and they had to

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.640 
budget out of control and they had to
redo<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.269> and<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.840> almost<00:02:19.989> didn't<00:02:20.349> make<00:02:20.470> the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
redo it and it almost didn't make the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.470 
redo it and it almost didn't make the
movie<00:02:20.950> because<00:02:21.220> they<00:02:21.370> had<00:02:21.730> too<00:02:21.880> big<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.060> budget

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
movie because they had too big a budget

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.150 
movie because they had too big a budget
but<00:02:22.870> it's<00:02:22.900> nice<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.590> see<00:02:23.709> that<00:02:23.739> a<00:02:23.890> lot<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.069> the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
but it's nice to see that a lot of the

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.940 
but it's nice to see that a lot of the
money<00:02:24.310> seems<00:02:24.549> to<00:02:24.640> be<00:02:24.819> on<00:02:24.970> screen<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.750> so<00:02:26.560> I

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
money seems to be on screen and so I

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.589 
money seems to be on screen and so I
think<00:02:27.130> this<00:02:27.430> is<00:02:27.579> a<00:02:27.610> great<00:02:27.790> update<00:02:28.180> of<00:02:28.510> a

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
think this is a great update of a

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.080 
think this is a great update of a
Western<00:02:28.780> westerns<00:02:29.739> used<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.549> be<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.700> really

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
Western westerns used to be a really

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.819 
Western westerns used to be a really
wonderful<00:02:31.450> genre<00:02:32.079> for<00:02:32.260> Hollywood<00:02:32.620> but

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
wonderful genre for Hollywood but

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.830 
wonderful genre for Hollywood but
obviously<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.970> they<00:02:34.180> just<00:02:34.420> don't<00:02:34.569> have<00:02:34.630> the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
obviously that they just don't have the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.470 
obviously that they just don't have the
same<00:02:35.019> mainstream<00:02:35.440> appeal<00:02:35.709> as<00:02:35.890> they<00:02:36.040> once<00:02:36.220> did

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
same mainstream appeal as they once did

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
same mainstream appeal as they once did
even<00:02:37.480> with<00:02:37.569> shows<00:02:37.810> like<00:02:37.930> Deadwood<00:02:38.410> and

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
even with shows like Deadwood and

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.930 
even with shows like Deadwood and
everything<00:02:38.920> you<00:02:39.040> know<00:02:39.069> I<00:02:39.489> guess<00:02:39.790> on

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
everything you know I guess on

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.400 
everything you know I guess on
television<00:02:40.450> it's<00:02:40.599> more<00:02:40.750> acceptable<00:02:40.989> but

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
television it's more acceptable but

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.410 
television it's more acceptable but
movies<00:02:42.099> like<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.370> thought<00:02:42.549> 310<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:42.910> yuma<00:02:43.000> was<00:02:43.389> a

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
movies like I thought 310 to yuma was a

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.539 
movies like I thought 310 to yuma was a
