00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:46.320 
onto one shred of hair from this one
twist<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:42.520> looks<00:02:42.820> kind<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.630> weird<00:02:44.340> but<00:02:45.340> I

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
twist so it looks kind of weird but I

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.600 
twist so it looks kind of weird but I
really<00:02:47.110> do<00:02:47.260> like<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.620> outcome<00:02:48.040> of<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.310> style

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610

and<00:02:48.850> again<00:02:49.120> I'm<00:02:49.209> just<00:02:49.420> trying<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.720> do

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
and again I'm just trying to do

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.770 
and again I'm just trying to do
something<00:02:50.140> new<00:02:50.470> because<00:02:51.340> once<00:02:52.209> you<00:02:52.330> do<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.510> lot

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
something new because once you do a lot

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.570 
something new because once you do a lot
of<00:02:52.810> sounds<00:02:53.110> like<00:02:53.320> myself<00:02:53.650> here<00:02:54.040> on<00:02:54.160> YouTube
