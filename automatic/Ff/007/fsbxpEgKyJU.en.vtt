00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
from a linux machine i actually did this

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.800 
from a linux machine i actually did this
on<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:11.809> you<00:00:12.809> boom<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:16.640> 10.04<00:00:17.810> operating

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
on a you boom to a 10.04 operating

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.040 
on a you boom to a 10.04 operating
system<00:00:19.170> now<00:00:19.939> this<00:00:20.939> trick<00:00:21.240> will<00:00:21.390> only<00:00:21.630> work<00:00:22.020> for

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
system now this trick will only work for

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.380 
system now this trick will only work for
this<00:00:22.470> version<00:00:22.920> only<00:00:23.070> for<00:00:24.170> Ubuntu<00:00:25.170> 10.04<00:00:26.390> this

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
trick is so let let's open up terminal

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.369 
trick is so let let's open up terminal
command<00:00:40.559> like<00:00:41.520> always<00:00:41.930> terminal<00:00:42.930> command<00:00:43.230> is

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
command like always terminal command is

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.340 
command like always terminal command is
the<00:00:43.500> key<00:00:43.890> feature<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.840> i'm<00:00:46.140> going<00:00:46.260> to

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
the key feature in this so i'm going to

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.260 
the key feature in this so i'm going to
do<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> pseudo<00:00:47.660> w<00:00:48.660> get<00:00:49.820> HTTP<00:00:51.890> for<00:00:52.890> /<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.579> /<00:00:53.610> and

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
do a pseudo w get HTTP for / for / and

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.729 
do a pseudo w get HTTP for / for / and
i'm<00:00:54.360> going<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.570> move<00:00:54.690> my<00:00:54.750> terminal<00:00:55.410> command

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
i'm going to move my terminal command

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.590 
i'm going to move my terminal command
over<00:00:55.920> here<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.370> I'm<00:00:56.489> just<00:00:56.670> going<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.879> expand<00:00:57.449> a

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
over here and I'm just going to expand a

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.410 
over here and I'm just going to expand a
little<00:00:57.629> bit<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.460> while<00:00:59.460> i'm<00:00:59.550> typing<00:00:59.820> this<00:01:00.090> you
