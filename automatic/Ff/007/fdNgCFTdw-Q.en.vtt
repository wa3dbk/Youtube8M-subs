component one of the greatest factors
for<00:02:13.269> our<00:02:13.360> program<00:02:13.840> is<00:02:14.019> we<00:02:14.170> have<00:02:14.320> a<00:02:14.350> very<00:02:14.709> low

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
for our program is we have a very low

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.210 
for our program is we have a very low
student<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.150> faculty<00:02:16.330> ratio<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:17.650> we<00:02:17.769> can<00:02:17.980> give

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
student to faculty ratio so we can give

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.390 
student to faculty ratio so we can give
them<00:02:18.519> more<00:02:19.060> direct<00:02:19.420> hands-on<00:02:20.010> direction<00:02:21.010> or

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
them more direct hands-on direction or

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.210 
them more direct hands-on direction or
experience<00:02:22.180> also<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:23.080> faculty<00:02:23.620> is<00:02:23.799> quite

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
experience also the faculty is quite

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.490 
experience also the faculty is quite

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
procedures that are out there when you

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.620 
procedures that are out there when you
start<00:02:33.010> putting<00:02:33.220> up<00:02:33.370> your<00:02:33.549> scenarios<00:02:34.030> for<00:02:34.510> what

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
start putting up your scenarios for what

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.120 
start putting up your scenarios for what
you<00:02:34.720> might<00:02:34.870> hear<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.290> history<00:02:35.470> compared<00:02:36.010> to

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
you might hear the history compared to

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.039 
you might hear the history compared to
the<00:02:36.220> pathology<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.209> then<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.570> actually<00:02:37.840> dr.

I<00:03:18.150> love<00:03:18.660> this<00:03:18.750> little<00:03:18.930> theory<00:03:19.140> because<00:03:19.500> in

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
I love this little theory because in

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.870 
I love this little theory because in
this<00:03:19.800> field<00:03:20.100> you<00:03:20.280> can<00:03:20.400> take<00:03:20.580> what<00:03:20.730> you've

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
this field you can take what you've

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.520 
this field you can take what you've
learned<00:03:21.150> through<00:03:21.450> your<00:03:21.870> advanced<00:03:22.110> degrees

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
learned through your advanced degrees

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.780 
learned through your advanced degrees
and<00:03:22.710> you<00:03:22.770> can<00:03:22.890> really<00:03:23.010> apply<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.520> people's

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
and you can really apply it to people's

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:36.730 
and you can really apply it to people's
everyday<00:03:24.090> lives
