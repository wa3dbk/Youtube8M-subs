00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:05.789
 Olympus mirrorless one eye camera 

00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:11.000
 Exhibited "Olympus OM-D E-M5" at CP + 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.520
 "OM-D" is the same as "PEN series" 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.000
 Micro Four Thirds Standard 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.659
 It is a compact and lightweight one eye camera 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:20.230
 Shoot while looking at the viewfinder 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.069
 It is a new series stuck to the style 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:25.809
 The model announced this time is 

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:29.369
 In addition to the movable 3.0 type organic EL touch monitor 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.920
 Multifunctional Electronic Viewfinder 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.399
 Built in 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.120
 Mirrorless and serious 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.900
 I'm thinking of making a camera 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.400
 In trial and error in various forms 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.399
 After all without making this panel small 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.260
 Place a large finder 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.309
 After all it makes the lens the optical axis 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.250
 I wanted to place it right above 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.489
 When the lens gets bigger 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.069
 Even with that big lens 

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:56.659
 In the form of something that can be held 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:01.129
 If you are considering the mobility of the old OM 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.280
 I came to style and system 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.820
 The viewfinder is equipped with a 1.44 million dots LCD 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.909
 All functions necessary for drawing such as brightness and color 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.900
 Without taking your eyes off the finder 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.610
 It is devised to be able to set while confirming the effect 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.180
 Looking into the finder 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.529
 You can change the color yourself with these two dials 

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:28.990
 To be able to change colors while looking through 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.909
 Focusing on these two dial operations 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.310
 We have made it possible to operate the camera 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.309
 After all because it is the customer who receives in the photograph 

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:45.250
 New 16m New Live MOS Sensor 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.460
 After we are in the body 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.600
 As a camera shake correction mechanism is included 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.679
 It was only such a blur until now 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.629
 Such (translational) blur or such blur 

00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:59.469
 It corresponds to all directions that can correspond 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.899
 We developed such a camera shake correction mechanism 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.979
 The world's first 5-axis image stabilization mechanism is 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.909
 Start by pressing the shutter halfway 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:11.750
 A lens for the built-in body 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.000
 Even if it changes, the effect does not change 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.200
 In addition, we cope with blurring during video photography 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.370
 After all it is a place where it is full of sand even in the rain 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.280
 In order to use it, it has become the structure of the dustproof drip-proof 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.600
 Especially for making a solid body structure 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.330
 Material of magnesium Covered with metal 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.800
 As we build in, it is considerably strong 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.400
 Mirrorless Our company is with Olympus PEN series 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.550
 There is a series of this OM-D 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.620
 PEN series is still SNS or blog or so 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.850
 Make such things variously 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.120
 I want to take a good picture easily and always 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.180
 Customers want to use OM-D 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.230
 Become an assumed customer 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.640
 Immerse yourself in this camera and concentrate on photos 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.400
 For customers who take a piece of their own 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.330
 It is a camera I want you to use by all means
