00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690 

so<00:00:00.210> today<00:00:00.480> I<00:00:00.539> want<00:00:00.780> to<00:00:00.810> talk<00:00:00.989> about<00:00:01.610> people<00:00:02.610> who

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
so today I want to talk about people who

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.300 
so today I want to talk about people who
eat<00:00:02.790> more<00:00:03.000> fat<00:00:03.210> and<00:00:03.270> protein<00:00:03.840> why<00:00:04.799> they<00:00:05.040> gain

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
eat more fat and protein why they gain

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.780 
eat more fat and protein why they gain
more<00:00:05.490> muscle<00:00:05.549> mass<00:00:05.970> but<00:00:06.600> also<00:00:06.870> gain<00:00:07.519> more<00:00:08.519> fat

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
more muscle mass but also gain more fat

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.350 
more muscle mass but also gain more fat
mass<00:00:09.110> than<00:00:10.110> people<00:00:10.530> who<00:00:10.650> eat<00:00:10.920> higher<00:00:11.670> law<00:00:12.210> of

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
mass than people who eat higher law of

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.369 
mass than people who eat higher law of
fat<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.840> lower<00:00:13.530> protein<00:00:14.360> so<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.900> first<00:00:16.109> point

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
fat and lower protein so the first point

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.320 
fat and lower protein so the first point
I'd<00:00:16.529> like<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.710> make<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.460> protein<00:00:18.029> in

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
I'd like to make is that protein in

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.870 
I'd like to make is that protein in
particular<00:00:18.690> from<00:00:19.619> animal<00:00:19.980> sources<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.760> of

particular from animal sources and of
course<00:00:21.119> soy<00:00:21.300> products<00:00:21.769> is<00:00:22.769> very<00:00:23.160> insolent

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
course soy products is very insolent

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.830 
course soy products is very insolent
genic<00:00:24.199> because<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.500> amino<00:00:25.800> acid<00:00:26.220> profile

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
genic because of the amino acid profile

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.740 
genic because of the amino acid profile
now<00:00:27.840> insulin<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.939> potent<00:00:29.939> anabolic<00:00:30.359> hormone

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
now insulin is a potent anabolic hormone

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.840 
now insulin is a potent anabolic hormone

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
to process sugars in the blood and so

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.440 
to process sugars in the blood and so
this<00:02:01.770> will<00:02:01.950> lead<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.189> increased<00:02:03.060> insulin

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
this will lead to increased insulin

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.160 
this will lead to increased insulin

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
protein and got very strong but also a

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.210 
protein and got very strong but also a
lot<00:04:40.920> fatter<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.460> when<00:04:42.210> I<00:04:42.240> lost<00:04:42.660> weight<00:04:43.220> and

lot fatter and when I lost weight and
adapted<00:04:45.210> a<00:04:45.300> low<00:04:45.510> protein<00:04:45.840> low<00:04:46.260> fat<00:04:46.320> diet<00:04:46.860> I

adapted a low protein low fat diet I

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.160 
adapted a low protein low fat diet I
found<00:04:48.000> that<00:04:48.150> it's<00:04:48.300> much<00:04:48.510> harder<00:04:48.750> to<00:04:48.870> gain

muscle<00:04:49.890> mass<00:04:50.130> but<00:04:50.850> also<00:04:51.120> it's<00:04:51.480> a<00:04:51.570> lot<00:04:51.750> harder

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
muscle mass but also it's a lot harder

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.980 
muscle mass but also it's a lot harder
