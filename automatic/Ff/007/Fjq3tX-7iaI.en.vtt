something<00:01:53.610> I've<00:01:53.729> never<00:01:53.850> done<00:01:54.000> before<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.509> I'm

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
something I've never done before but I'm

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.300 
something I've never done before but I'm
always<00:01:54.810> open<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.200> new<00:01:55.259> techniques<00:01:55.799> let's

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
always open to new techniques let's

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.069 
always open to new techniques let's
check<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.670> out<00:01:56.759> essentially<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.899> going

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
check it out essentially this is going

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.270 
check it out essentially this is going
to<00:01:58.140> help<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.350> make<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.710> batter<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.040> little<00:01:59.070> bit

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
to help to make the batter a little bit

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.800 
to help to make the batter a little bit
on<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.399> thicker<00:01:59.670> side<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.540> that's<00:02:00.719> just

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
on a thicker side so that's just

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.149 
on a thicker side so that's just
basically<00:02:01.170> here's

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
basically here's

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.709 
basically here's
read<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.640> comes<00:02:03.060> out<00:02:03.210> with<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.359> really<00:02:03.600> good

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
read and comes out with a really good

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.480 
read and comes out with a really good
final<00:02:04.020> product<00:02:04.380> all<00:02:04.829> right<00:02:05.039> and<00:02:05.249> then<00:02:05.369> what

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
final product all right and then what

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.580 
final product all right and then what
I've<00:02:05.579> done<00:02:05.729> here<00:02:05.789> is<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.149> set<00:02:06.719> my<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:06.960> protein

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
I've done here is I set my to protein

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.469 
I've done here is I set my to protein
powder<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:07.979> side<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.459> have<00:02:08.700> one<00:02:09.179> scoop

of a quest vanilla protein powder and

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.059 
of a quest vanilla protein powder and
then<00:02:11.819> over<00:02:12.060> here<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.330> have<00:02:12.450> about<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:12.989> about<00:02:13.530> a

then over here I have about a about a
third<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.549> the<00:02:14.610> scoop<00:02:14.819> of<00:02:14.940> quest<00:02:15.120> protein

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
third of the scoop of quest protein

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.150 
third of the scoop of quest protein
powder<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.410> going<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.590> get<00:02:16.680> set<00:02:16.920> aside
