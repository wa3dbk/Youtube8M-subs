00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:11.490
 Bought at Amazon 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:11.490
 I tried to take the opening video because colorful Thunder 220 and tube for replacement came 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.530
 This is 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:19.100
 a is a replacement team 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:25.060
 This is 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:27.420
 It is the body of the colorful Thunder 220 try a little open 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.420
 Follow 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.360
 Oh 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.920
 right 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.220
 Patchekko It comes with a strong 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.780
 Follow 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.780
 Put out the contents 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.090
 This is a manual 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:49.980
 yeah 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:56.060
 There are various usages written on it, but now it is very versatile. 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:58.270
 It is exactly I do not know how to use and do not see this kind of manual 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.600
 It is a strap 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.800
 then 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.020
 Really 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.520
 I This is the body 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.730
 here 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.560
 The battery is just for consumption number 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:21.970
 Since there is insulation tape have it there pulled out by Isshotto 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.970
 How the replacement of omniscience is the part of the ass by turning the green onion 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.850
 When removed 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.840
 Battery 2 can be taken 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:35.439
 This way is very good 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:40.069
 This is a method to turn the Korikori and screw in something like 10 yen coin and Toka or worse flying screw 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:42.370
 It may be very hard to do it 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:47.220
 If this is the method 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:52.330
 I think it is possible to replace the battery during the live show 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.140
 The power switch is a little this to you in the ass mast 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.990
 When 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.300
 The lamp lights up The lamp is lit 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.730
 Change is a button here 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.140
 This button 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.980
 I will do 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:14.410
 Though color changes 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:14.410
 If it is a video, it may be a bit bright, so it may be difficult to see the change in color- 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:23.010
 Go and go back 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:26.440
 There are both buttons so it's a lap back and forth 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.000
 Even the video is very difficult to understand the color 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.000
 Now this tube 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.330
 It is a long press of the button to power 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:45.700
 Because it can be easily rotated 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:48.110
 I you were here in the tube for the exchange also tried to buy one 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.070
 Various names 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:56.730
 I think if the group name and whether I'll then have to place here 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:59.629
 If I can do good printing again, I will list it. 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.629
 that's all
