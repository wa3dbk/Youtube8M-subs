00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.130
 no American football is not 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.319
 reserved for men 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.150
 it's in the Paris region in villeneuve 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.670
 saint georges as the first team 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.880
 feminine was born 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.500
 they are the sparkle I have a 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.359
 vision america but no team 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.060
 so I decided to create one 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.109
 so the sparkles and I looked at little 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.189
 close like and there were screams that 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.820
 would be interested in the networks 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.170
 social etc. 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.070
 I managed to have that there was a 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.630
 fifteen or so girls 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.029
 interested so here I am 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.130
 close to buccaneers and that's it's 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.989
 from there stay focused all the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.309
 training time it's going to short loan 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.710
 we will do a lot of rehearsals 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.140
 okay remained attentive and focused 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.290
 first the break on the head if you 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.290
 please 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.110
 I discovered by chance on facebook 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.030
 had the sparks that what is created and 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.530
 so from the group to I had come to the first 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.570
 quarter without knowing no one 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.430
 nothing and that immediately ready with the 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.420
 girls we got along well all the 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.220
 world was coming from horizons 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.020
 different with the effect of the sport before 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.479
 others no I know this is my case 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.800
 I 'm not very athletic actually at the 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.360
 happening was not really a passion I 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.530
 came because it is a friend 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.119
 of childhood and hamadi that began to 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.350
 create a team 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.670
 so I wanted to test it was more to the 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.440
 goes on to make the buzz for a little bit 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.149
 of world for the first first 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.140
 training and finally I hung I 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.369
 told me it's not bad there was a 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.080
 good atmosphere the dogs are great 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.039
 nice 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.810
 finally chance did well 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.610
 things like the others 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.640
 lucie former player of the team 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.080
 France boxing has become attached to the team 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.179
 i went to meet sarah 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.709
 helped by her teammates and that's right 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.750
 that their project immediately pleased me 

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:50.200
 because we were talking about a first 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.009
 match 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.180
 a first female match in France and 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.619
 is in the end it was 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.729
 against a Spanish national team and 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.340
 I said to myself 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.350
 completely crazy and the day j but it's 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.219
 as fake as boxing in Egypt and 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.560
 from there it's true that I 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.939
 found all his feelings 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.769
 that is to say, a state of mind really 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.290
 conquering a warrior spirit 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.760
 and it really got me so much more 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.859
 that I felt less alone 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.380
 because in the ring I was alone 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:18.760
 for once we are in football we are you 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.320
 teammates you have a team we are 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:27.790
 super welded and that's it becomes a 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:28.780
 family As of my time 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.579
 girlfriends to whom I speak 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.780
 they want they are interested 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.430
 they want to see they will see the 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.170
 facebook page and that they want to 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.850
 come see the workouts but the 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.290
 most 1 since never ever 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.790
 would I take shots all that 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.930
 it scares them in fact they say that 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.220
 I'm a wild I'm crazy the 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.739
 most java I try to bring back a 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.690
 10 but no I'm afraid of hurting myself 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.620
 I did not want it's too hard but it 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.890
 there are many who are victims of 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.830
 really brave fingering 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.110
 it's continuous and for what it 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.110
 think we all have eggs that we have 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.520
 afraid of nothing finally vannes it does not happen 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.170
 not too much to imagine in fact I think 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.640
 it really takes to be tried 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.930
 training or have played once for 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.459
 really know what we look like 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.050
 that beyond banging in it's 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.180
 really an equipped sport has a very 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.500
 good mentality of a football us and that's it 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.820
 as long as we did not do it we can not 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.080
 really understand what we see in 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.880
 movies it's not fake it's 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.470
 you really have to be supportive 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.120
 we are really a real who all the 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.260
 world works together we protect ourselves 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.260
 each other is really that 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.730
 last year was the only team 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.880
 So suddenly we were played in Spain 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.530
 so the first French match of 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.660
 the story 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.250
 and yeah and this year's blow it's gonna ya 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.670
 had some craze on tonight so so much 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.739
 better 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.959
 lesparre since they opened 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:49.190
 the way about fifteen equipped have created 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:51.350
 their women's section that night 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.470
 precisely in tigers ne nancy that's 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.209
 the very first training 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.880
 your elbows tight so that 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.049
 that was cool the fact that the ball 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.459
 when they arrive they come there 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.470
 you see the basket is closed in 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.549
 a few steps passed between okay we kill 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.910
 the hatch like that is a lot more 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.690
 easy 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.970
 I also leave behind the practice 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:15.640
 This is an important thing we have 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:17.370
 already cheerleaders at the club level 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.750
 why not do american football 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.020
 since at the base of American football is 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.190
 still the sport of the club fath on 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.050
 catch the ball, treat it 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.700
 once caught, it has been proved 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.470
 the bullet in protection that's called that 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.380
 we're going to protect the ball 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.419
 take the ball from there but constantly 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.520
 bamako on the tip of the guard against 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:47.650
 mans to catch him I remember everything 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:50.230
 what attracted me first 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.210
 this jap to defense because it's not 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.880
 something in which I see myself but 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.160
 it is especially 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.660
 the spirit of equipped the sport in general the 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.850
 getting together with girls and 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.230
 to laugh more than to take the head 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.850
 really good after that may come 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.350
 when we already know the rules but 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.810
 for now it's fun to be 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.160
 together and decompress it's this 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.110
 that it takes to spend myself I think 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:15.670
 romp without benesova wrong i think 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.470
 after work and let off steam all the 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.210
 block by block what does that mean it 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.130
 means to prevent dale's opponent 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.590
 coming out of the bench so this is the part one 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.920
 little more virile 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.090
 we're going to say so that's not good already 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.090
 made the facts on the heels and that 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.970
 I say worldly taste takes that bag to 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:39.930
 back right here just show and not you say 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.930
 understand that you go there to the adventurous 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:58.420
 for now neither shoulder pads nor helmet 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:59.740
 the goal is to learn the basics for 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.760
 Female practice requires 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.760
 specific equipment 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.360
 and that the club we do not have so it goes 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.770
 we need to make requests for 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.349
 subsidies or things like that for 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:20.249
 to be equipped with equipment for the 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:23.770
 practice these mines ok that's going to show them 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:27.639
 to finish emma's hands over 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:29.110
 eyes where you said you put your kid 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:31.529
 like that shows that I ask this is 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.529
 to be here 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:37.199
 so that 's a brake it comes 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:37.199
 stop the wave 

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:42.470
 can not wait for 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.330
 the coach is interested a little in us all 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.130
 because I think we do not know 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.460
 really if we do well how the 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.139
 do and 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.330
 that's what's a bit frustrating it's 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:52.650
 that we want to do well and then 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.350
 example to hold the bags 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:57.150
 I got flown so 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.639
 here but otherwise not really good 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:03.020
 impression in all the six are 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:03.020
 nice the coach looks good 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.990
 the federation will be interested too 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.330
 since I already discussed with the dtn at 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.680
 this saying that told me that as the 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.199
 female practice begins to grow 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.550
 in France he would surely put the 

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:22.590
 feet in to open 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.090
 championships so there may be 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.340
 surely way to register a team 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:29.370
 women in the league in a year 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.690
 even two the time that all climbed in 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.120
 waiting as there are already teams 

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:35.070
 in France we can make matches 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:38.039
 against these teams there and it's in good 

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:39.599
 track from 2014 once a month the 

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:41.699
 different teams will meet on 

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:43.229
 time of a tournament a first for a 

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:55.880
 discipline that is growing at great 

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:55.880
 speed every live game
