bit<00:03:39.879> fuller<00:03:40.150> tone<00:03:40.480> than<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.409> straight<00:03:41.650> maple

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
bit fuller tone than the straight maple

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.970 
bit fuller tone than the straight maple
and<00:03:42.219> that's<00:03:42.819> due<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.209> bubinga<00:03:43.599> itself<00:03:44.349> the

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980
