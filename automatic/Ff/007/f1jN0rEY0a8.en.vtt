00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:10.160
 two 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.160
 a little more 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.890
 this is the video that you have most of us 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.560
 asked by facebook the animals playing 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.169
 how to interact with our rabbits and 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.630
 with our pets both within 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.630
 house like away from home and is that there is very 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.640
 few toys in the specific market 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.890
 for rabbits but we're going to give you 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.559
 solutions because you can interact 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.809
 in many different ways especially 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.220
 with other pets especially gathering 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.229
 animals with animals races and species 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.040
 yes they are compatible 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:51.900
 it is true antonio many toys 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.879
 prepared and special for rabbits 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.970
 example because there is not what can be 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.460
 to do is improvise yes and we also have 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.040
 using the toys as we have done 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.350
 in this case of other pets that yes 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.700
 that our rabbits can play and 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.369
 we can also do a lot of 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.619
 homemade things we always 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.330
 beware of the material that these have 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.580
 toys because we say that 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.260
 can use toys prepared for 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.420
 other animals but they must be rodents 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.000
 good you have to keep in mind that 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.650
 they are always going to nibble and go to 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.810
 try to eat the toys that we 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.400
 we put it for that reason always because the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.860
 raw material of toys as you see 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.689
 here then cardboard wood and things 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.369
 natural things that they can eat 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.380
 without any problem as 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.479
 example these hay tunnels that they 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.610
 they love it because when they are more 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.799
 little ones get in here besides that 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.049
 they use it as food and something else 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.000
 important rabbits get bored a 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.649
 pile all day in the cage you have to 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.840
 remove them from their cages have to 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.390
 interact and leave if you have other 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.190
 pets as you see here the coconut of me 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.869
 what a great time he is going to 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.380
 have a great time playing with others 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.210
 animals 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.869
 that's called environmental enrichment 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.369
 is that animals have toys and 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.530
 other living beings with whom 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.240
 interact and as we have all done 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.490
 when we are small, we fight to play 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.099
 laugh 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.200
 chase all this toy for 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.530
 example we have created it in with 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.720
 ipic that they make many, many, many 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.750
 Thanks to the bunnies, look what is 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.480
 here below why do you have these 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.000
 threads that tickle you in the 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.220
 mustaches and they play for hours 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.970
 besides that they can hide out 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.280
 through different holes here you have 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.280
 different types of wicker huts 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.930
 wood for example is here where 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.549
 the little bunnies have to 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.280
 adapt them to their size as they can 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.590
 enter and they will last a little longer than 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.780
 the sheds that are simply hay 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.430
 Hellene are going to eat it very quickly and the 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.440
 wood they're going to eat it too but 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.440
 they will last a little longer 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.440
 do not 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.690
 or 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.800
 obviously not all of you have a garden 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.050
 house but any balcony or terrace is 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.160
 can prepare for game environment 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.600
 for our little ones not also 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.020
 you can go to parks and 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.570
 city gardens with a strap a 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.480
 little longer so the animals do not not 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.490
 escape and another way to interact is 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.530
 how am I doing with this animal 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.620
 of long hair that is an angora rabbit 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.840
 English as you know you have to clean it and 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.400
 brush every week these 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.290
 animals that have such long hair 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.120
 because they need more care and it's a 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.580
 way to always interact also 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.350
 awarding them and reminding you that it is very 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.480
 interesting if you have several animals 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.970
 together so they can live together and 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.860
 can play with each other even though 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.200
 not yours, you can put them together 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.610
 of your friends because there are species 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.770
 among them that they have such a good time 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.090
 such as cats and rabbits 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.090
 you have seen in this case
