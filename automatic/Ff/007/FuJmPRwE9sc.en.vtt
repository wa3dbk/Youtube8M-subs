fairly smooth and nice in the back here
as<00:04:45.090> I<00:04:45.150> say<00:04:45.419> it's<00:04:46.110> all<00:04:46.199> the<00:04:46.319> standard<00:04:46.680> color<00:04:46.919> and

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
as I say it's all the standard color and

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:49.640 
as I say it's all the standard color and
everything<00:04:47.250> like<00:04:47.490> that<00:04:48.229> doesn't<00:04:49.229> come<00:04:49.409> with<00:04:49.620> a

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
everything like that doesn't come with a

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.950 
everything like that doesn't come with a
lot<00:04:49.860> that's<00:04:50.039> mine<00:04:50.310> but<00:04:51.300> everything<00:04:51.599> else<00:04:51.780> is

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
lot that's mine but everything else is

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.149 
lot that's mine but everything else is
all<00:04:52.819> is<00:04:53.819> all<00:04:54.000> their<00:04:54.330> tailgate<00:04:55.080> really<00:04:56.039> know

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:56.159 
all is all their tailgate really know

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:58.159

the both the bottom now get to seen

00:04:58.169 --> 00:04:59.480 
the both the bottom now get to seen
better<00:04:58.349> days<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.949> bottom<00:04:59.190> of<00:04:59.250> the<00:04:59.310> frame

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
better days the bottom of the frame

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.480 
better days the bottom of the frame
isn't<00:04:59.699> too<00:05:00.060> bad<00:05:00.330> but<00:05:00.599> the<00:05:01.259> Famers<00:05:01.680> as<00:05:02.129> split

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
isn't too bad but the Famers as split
