00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.540 
going to show you how to do multiple
beads<00:02:10.010> so<00:02:10.970> I've<00:02:11.090> picked<00:02:11.240> up<00:02:11.420> three<00:02:11.690> more<00:02:11.840> beads

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
beads so I've picked up three more beads

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.060 
beads so I've picked up three more beads
going<00:02:13.550> back<00:02:14.090> through<00:02:14.570> that<00:02:14.810> bead<00:02:15.500> which<00:02:15.710> was

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
going back through that bead which was

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.740 
going back through that bead which was
my<00:02:16.220> starting<00:02:16.670> beads<00:02:16.880> you<00:02:17.120> can<00:02:17.240> call<00:02:17.450> that<00:02:17.600> my

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
my starting beads you can call that my

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.780 
my starting beads you can call that my
first<00:02:18.050> or<00:02:18.350> my<00:02:18.530> fourth<00:02:18.860> depending<00:02:19.370> upon<00:02:19.460> how

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
first or my fourth depending upon how

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.240 
first or my fourth depending upon how
you<00:02:19.820> look<00:02:19.940> at<00:02:20.240> it<00:02:23.230> now<00:02:24.230> go<00:02:24.560> back<00:02:24.770> through<00:02:25.100> the

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
you look at it now go back through the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.750 
you look at it now go back through the
two<00:02:25.430> beads<00:02:25.640> next<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.300> it<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.630> back<00:02:27.020> out

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.860 

alright<00:02:31.760> you<00:02:31.910> can<00:02:32.090> see<00:02:32.120> we're<00:02:32.420> forming<00:02:32.750> a

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
alright you can see we're forming a

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.060 
alright you can see we're forming a
pattern<00:02:33.080> they<00:02:33.380> almost<00:02:33.500> look<00:02:33.710> like<00:02:33.740> little

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
pattern they almost look like little

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.760 
pattern they almost look like little
flowers<00:02:34.570> so<00:02:35.570> that<00:02:35.720> is<00:02:35.840> traditional<00:02:36.410> flat

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
flowers so that is traditional flat

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.160 
flowers so that is traditional flat
right<00:02:37.430> angle<00:02:37.760> weave<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.600> now<00:02:38.780> I<00:02:38.810> want<00:02:38.990> to<00:02:39.020> add

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
right angle weave and now I want to add

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.500 
right angle weave and now I want to add
some<00:02:40.100> multiple<00:02:40.430> beads<00:02:40.550> so<00:02:40.820> instead<00:02:41.150> of<00:02:41.300> just

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
some multiple beads so instead of just

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.180 
some multiple beads so instead of just
doing<00:02:41.720> three<00:02:42.080> beads<00:02:42.350> I'm<00:02:42.620> going<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:42.950> go<00:02:43.070> ahead

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
doing three beads I'm going to go ahead

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.830 
doing three beads I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:44.020> do<00:02:45.760> one<00:02:46.760> bead<00:02:47.000> here<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:47.540> then<00:02:47.660> I'm<00:02:47.720> going

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
and do one bead here and then I'm going

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.690 
and do one bead here and then I'm going
to<00:02:47.870> add<00:02:47.990> a<00:02:48.020> little<00:02:48.200> bit<00:02:48.320> of<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.590> larger<00:02:48.830> bead<00:02:49.220> to

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
to add a little bit of a larger bead to

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.910 
to add a little bit of a larger bead to
add<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.820> little<00:02:50.030> bit<00:02:50.240> more<00:02:50.360> interest<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:51.380> now

add a little bit more interest and now

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.020 
add a little bit more interest and now
I'm<00:02:52.100> going<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.310> add<00:02:52.430> three<00:02:53.360> beads<00:02:54.790> one<00:02:55.790> more

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
I'm going to add three beads one more

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.490 
I'm going to add three beads one more
larger<00:02:56.510> bead<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:58.480> finally<00:02:59.480> one<00:02:59.750> more<00:02:59.780> of<00:03:00.290> my

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
larger bead and finally one more of my

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.780 
larger bead and finally one more of my
seed<00:03:00.710> beads<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.130> you're<00:03:01.310> going<00:03:01.430> to<00:03:01.490> see<00:03:01.640> why

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
seed beads and you're going to see why

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.000 
seed beads and you're going to see why
in<00:03:01.820> one<00:03:02.120> moment<00:03:02.540> here<00:03:02.870> alright<00:03:03.710> so<00:03:03.770> I'm<00:03:03.890> going

in one moment here alright so I'm going

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.340 
in one moment here alright so I'm going
to<00:03:04.040> take<00:03:04.190> all<00:03:04.370> of<00:03:04.400> that<00:03:04.960> and<00:03:05.960> I'm<00:03:06.080> going<00:03:06.200> to<00:03:06.230> go

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
to take all of that and I'm going to go

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.800 
to take all of that and I'm going to go
back<00:03:06.620> through<00:03:07.100> that<00:03:08.140> original<00:03:09.140> bead<00:03:10.810> you

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
back through that original bead you

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:12.970 
back through that original bead you
notice<00:03:12.080> that<00:03:12.230> I'm<00:03:12.350> going<00:03:12.590> in<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.800> direction

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
notice that I'm going in the direction

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.000 
notice that I'm going in the direction
that<00:03:13.550> my<00:03:14.030> so<00:03:14.750> my<00:03:14.840> thread<00:03:15.110> is<00:03:15.140> coming<00:03:15.440> out<00:03:15.650> here

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
that my so my thread is coming out here

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.370 
that my so my thread is coming out here
it's<00:03:16.190> looping<00:03:16.790> around<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.450> my<00:03:17.660> needle<00:03:18.050> now<00:03:18.200> is

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
it's looping around and my needle now is

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.050 
it's looping around and my needle now is
sticking<00:03:18.830> out<00:03:18.950> in<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.130> same<00:03:19.340> direction<00:03:19.610> that

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
sticking out in the same direction that

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
sticking out in the same direction that
thread<00:03:20.390> was<00:03:20.600> originally<00:03:21.820> alright<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:23.750> pull

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
thread was originally alright and pull

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.810 
thread was originally alright and pull
that<00:03:24.260> around<00:03:27.160> and<00:03:28.160> now<00:03:28.280> hopefully<00:03:28.459> you<00:03:28.700> can

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
that around and now hopefully you can

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.660 
that around and now hopefully you can
see<00:03:29.060> why<00:03:29.270> I<00:03:29.300> did<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.170> one<00:03:30.470> then<00:03:31.100> a<00:03:31.130> large<00:03:31.400> one

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
see why I did the one then a large one

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.610 
see why I did the one then a large one
and<00:03:31.850> then<00:03:31.970> three<00:03:32.300> of<00:03:32.330> the<00:03:32.600> seed<00:03:32.810> beads<00:03:33.050> a<00:03:33.320> large

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
and then three of the seed beads a large

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.010 
and then three of the seed beads a large
one<00:03:33.830> and<00:03:33.980> then<00:03:34.070> one<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.340> seed<00:03:34.520> beads<00:03:34.870> so<00:03:35.870> that

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
one and then one the seed beads so that

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.080 
one and then one the seed beads so that
I<00:03:36.050> have<00:03:36.320> a<00:03:36.350> balance<00:03:36.920> and<00:03:37.310> now<00:03:37.580> I'm<00:03:37.640> going<00:03:37.760> to<00:03:37.820> go

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
I have a balance and now I'm going to go

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:48.360 
I have a balance and now I'm going to go
back<00:03:38.950> and<00:03:39.950> then<00:03:40.100> go<00:03:40.310> through<00:03:42.160> four<00:03:43.160> beads

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.630 

you<00:03:48.849> can<00:03:49.000> see<00:03:49.150> I'm<00:03:49.239> gonna<00:03:49.360> lay<00:03:49.510> it<00:03:49.540> flat<00:03:50.640> once

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
you can see I'm gonna lay it flat once

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.390 
you can see I'm gonna lay it flat once
you<00:03:51.760> can<00:03:51.909> take<00:03:52.060> a<00:03:52.090> look<00:03:52.360> at<00:03:52.480> it<00:03:52.659> I<00:03:53.190> have<00:03:54.190> my

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
you can take a look at it I have my

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.180 
you can take a look at it I have my
anchor<00:03:54.819> bead<00:03:55.060> which<00:03:55.629> is<00:03:55.659> joining<00:03:56.230> my<00:03:57.010> other

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
anchor bead which is joining my other

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.850 
anchor bead which is joining my other
cluster<00:03:57.760> and<00:03:58.540> then<00:03:58.629> I've<00:03:58.780> got<00:03:58.989> an<00:03:59.140> archway<00:03:59.440> of

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
cluster and then I've got an archway of

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.399 
cluster and then I've got an archway of
three<00:04:00.129> beads<00:04:00.370> another<00:04:01.120> anchor<00:04:01.420> bead<00:04:01.780> and<00:04:02.049> an

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
three beads another anchor bead and an

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:03.990 
three beads another anchor bead and an
archway<00:04:02.680> of<00:04:02.980> three<00:04:03.280> beads<00:04:03.459> and<00:04:03.670> that's<00:04:03.819> why<00:04:03.970> I

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
archway of three beads and that's why I

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.420 
archway of three beads and that's why I
strung<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:05.019> three<00:04:05.349> beads<00:04:05.590> in<00:04:05.890> between<00:04:05.950> the

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
strung the three beads in between the

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.130 
strung the three beads in between the
two<00:04:06.579> large<00:04:06.790> ones<00:04:06.970> let<00:04:07.599> me<00:04:07.690> show<00:04:07.900> you<00:04:07.989> that

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
two large ones let me show you that

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.110 
two large ones let me show you that
again<00:04:08.640> so<00:04:09.640> we've<00:04:09.849> got<00:04:10.060> one<00:04:10.629> bead<00:04:10.840> a<00:04:12.120> larger

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
again so we've got one bead a larger

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.409 
again so we've got one bead a larger
bead<00:04:17.130> three<00:04:18.130> of<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.340> seed<00:04:18.519> beads<00:04:18.820> another

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
bead three of the seed beads another

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.740 
bead three of the seed beads another
large<00:04:19.750> bead<00:04:20.729> and<00:04:21.729> another<00:04:21.789> seed<00:04:22.330> bead<00:04:22.539> and

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
large bead and another seed bead and

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.750 
large bead and another seed bead and
we're<00:04:22.840> going<00:04:22.990> to<00:04:23.020> go

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
we're going to go

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.279 
we're going to go
so<00:04:24.760> our<00:04:24.850> needle<00:04:25.300> is<00:04:25.479> going<00:04:25.570> to<00:04:25.720> come<00:04:25.930> out<00:04:26.080> the

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
so our needle is going to come out the

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:33.350 
so our needle is going to come out the
same<00:04:26.440> direction<00:04:26.710> our<00:04:27.039> thread<00:04:27.400> was<00:04:27.610> originally

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:41.260 

that<00:04:34.360> form<00:04:34.750> a<00:04:34.840> loop

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:47.950 

go<00:04:41.840> back<00:04:42.050> through<00:04:42.319> four<00:04:42.680> beads

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.940 

and<00:04:48.560> pull<00:04:48.889> up

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
and pull up

00:04:50.950 --> 00:05:13.830 
and pull up
I<00:04:51.040> just<00:04:51.640> do<00:04:51.820> a<00:04:51.850> couple<00:04:52.240> more

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.020 

there<00:05:14.650> you<00:05:14.740> go<00:05:14.860> and<00:05:15.130> you'll<00:05:15.250> just<00:05:15.400> continue<00:05:15.580> on

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
there you go and you'll just continue on

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.790 
there you go and you'll just continue on
like<00:05:16.180> that<00:05:16.389> until<00:05:16.930> you<00:05:17.050> have<00:05:17.290> as<00:05:17.440> much<00:05:17.590> of<00:05:17.650> a

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
like that until you have as much of a

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.830 
like that until you have as much of a
length<00:05:18.010> as<00:05:18.190> you<00:05:18.340> want<00:05:18.550> and<00:05:18.790> then<00:05:19.389> you<00:05:19.540> can<00:05:19.690> also

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
length as you want and then you can also

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.020 
length as you want and then you can also
loop<00:05:20.290> back<00:05:20.590> around<00:05:20.620> and<00:05:21.250> create<00:05:21.460> a<00:05:21.490> second<00:05:21.910> row

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
loop back around and create a second row

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.520 
loop back around and create a second row
and<00:05:22.210> you<00:05:22.300> do<00:05:22.479> that<00:05:22.570> the<00:05:22.720> same<00:05:22.900> way<00:05:22.960> as<00:05:23.350> you

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
and you do that the same way as you

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.920 
and you do that the same way as you
would<00:05:23.740> the<00:05:24.010> more<00:05:24.850> traditional<00:05:25.360> flat<00:05:25.660> right

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
would the more traditional flat right
