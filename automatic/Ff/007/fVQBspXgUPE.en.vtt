video fully ready to go I tried to

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.040

over<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.500> weekend<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.570> I<00:00:24.570> saved<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:25.710> a

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
over the weekend and I saved it in a

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.620 
over the weekend and I saved it in a
different<00:00:26.099> format<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.000> normally<00:00:27.119> do

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
different format that I normally do

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.910 
different format that I normally do
because<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:28.019> thought<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.320> would<00:00:28.560> make<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
because I thought it would make the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.220 
because I thought it would make the
video<00:00:29.189> even<00:00:29.640> better<00:00:29.849> quality<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.720> then<00:00:31.140> I

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
video even better quality and then I

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.160 
video even better quality and then I
deleted<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.890> raw<00:00:32.070> footage<00:00:32.149> so<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.570> tried<00:00:33.989> to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
deleted the raw footage so I tried to

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.870 
deleted the raw footage so I tried to
take<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.620> back<00:00:34.800> because<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.309> found<00:00:35.670> out<00:00:35.850> later

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
take it back because I found out later

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.209 
take it back because I found out later
that<00:00:36.450> YouTube<00:00:37.079> actually<00:00:37.469> doesn't<00:00:37.770> accept

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
that YouTube actually doesn't accept

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.150 
that YouTube actually doesn't accept
this<00:00:38.550> format<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:40.020> i<00:00:40.050> tried<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.590> take<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.890> back

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
this format so i tried to take it back

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.740 
this format so i tried to take it back
into<00:00:41.460> my<00:00:41.579> editor<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.030> then<00:00:42.510> re<00:00:43.110> i<00:00:43.590> guess

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
into my editor and then re i guess
