00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
disappointed by that

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.520 
disappointed by that
but<00:03:10.799> my<00:03:11.799> lashes<00:03:12.100> are<00:03:12.549> solid<00:03:13.269> my<00:03:13.510> hair<00:03:13.989> cross<00:03:14.230> I

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.880 
have got a lot of volume in my lashes so
maybe<00:03:16.840> it's<00:03:17.080> something<00:03:17.260> that<00:03:17.470> will<00:03:17.560> come<00:03:17.709> with

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
maybe it's something that will come with

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.009 
maybe it's something that will come with
time<00:03:18.040> if<00:03:18.250> I<00:03:18.370> come<00:03:18.580> closer<00:03:18.850> I<00:03:19.269> have<00:03:19.480> got<00:03:19.660> mascara

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
time if I come closer I have got mascara

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.150 
time if I come closer I have got mascara
on<00:03:20.230> as<00:03:20.380> you<00:03:20.500> can<00:03:20.680> see<00:03:21.120> but<00:03:22.320> my<00:03:23.320> lashes

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
on as you can see but my lashes

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.260 
on as you can see but my lashes
a<00:03:25.220> pretty<00:03:26.090> volumous<00:03:27.010> but<00:03:28.010> they're<00:03:28.220> not<00:03:28.490> long

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
a pretty volumous but they're not long

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.770 
a pretty volumous but they're not long
in<00:03:29.750> fact<00:03:29.960> they're<00:03:30.170> quite<00:03:30.380> normal<00:03:30.800> I<00:03:30.920> feel

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
in fact they're quite normal I feel

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.850 
in fact they're quite normal I feel
there<00:03:32.780> may<00:03:32.900> be<00:03:32.930> a<00:03:33.050> tiny<00:03:33.260> bit<00:03:33.350> of<00:03:33.530> length<00:03:33.650> but

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
there may be a tiny bit of length but

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.770 
there may be a tiny bit of length but
it's<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.040> minimum<00:03:34.340> so<00:03:35.210> I'm<00:03:35.390> a<00:03:35.420> little<00:03:35.600> bit

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
it's a minimum so I'm a little bit

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.110 
it's a minimum so I'm a little bit
disappointed<00:03:35.960> and<00:03:36.440> be<00:03:36.560> honest<00:03:36.770> and<00:03:36.920> say<00:03:37.100> so<00:03:38.090> I

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
disappointed and be honest and say so I

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.490 
disappointed and be honest and say so I
suppose<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:38.510> question<00:03:38.630> is<00:03:38.990> or<00:03:39.170> that<00:03:39.290> you<00:03:39.350> can

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
suppose the question is or that you can

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.960 
suppose the question is or that you can
probably<00:03:39.680> guess<00:03:40.070> by<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.310> review<00:03:40.700> would<00:03:40.910> I
