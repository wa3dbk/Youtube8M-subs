00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
it will take a second because my

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.700

computer's<00:01:33.390> got<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> lot<00:01:33.780> going<00:01:34.049> on<00:01:34.110> today<00:01:34.290> but

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
computer's got a lot going on today but

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.170 
computer's got a lot going on today but
here<00:01:35.670> we<00:01:35.790> go

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
here we go

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.649 
here we go
I<00:01:36.210> really<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.619> pinkness<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.759> color

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
I really like the pinkness of this color

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.960 
I really like the pinkness of this color
that<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.020> adds<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.920> one<00:01:41.100> thing<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.549> don't

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
that it adds the one thing that I don't

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.539 
that it adds the one thing that I don't
love<00:01:42.240> about<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.810> though<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:44.340> I

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
love about this though is that it I

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.429 
love about this though is that it I
think<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.880> adds<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.149> little<00:01:45.360> bit<00:01:45.600> too<00:01:45.869> much<00:01:46.079> pink

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
think it adds a little bit too much pink

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.230 
think it adds a little bit too much pink
to<00:01:46.680> his<00:01:46.829> hair<00:01:47.159> where<00:01:47.399> his<00:01:47.549> hair<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.909> already

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
to his hair where his hair is already

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.819 
to his hair where his hair is already
red<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.509> think<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.990> adds<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.320> little<00:01:49.439> bit<00:01:49.560> too

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
red I think it adds a little bit too

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.569 
red I think it adds a little bit too
much<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.310> we're<00:01:51.180> going<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.979> erase<00:01:52.979> some<00:01:53.280> of

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
much so we're going to erase some of

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.630 
much so we're going to erase some of
this<00:01:53.729> preset<00:01:54.270> from<00:01:54.450> his<00:01:54.689> hair<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.310> then<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
this preset from his hair and then the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.609 
this preset from his hair and then the
other<00:01:56.790> thing<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.270> wish<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:58.380> had<00:01:58.590> a

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
other thing that I wish is that it had a

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.280 
other thing that I wish is that it had a
little<00:01:58.890> bit<00:01:59.130> more<00:01:59.189> on<00:01:59.610> her<00:01:59.790> skin<00:02:00.149> over<00:02:00.420> here<00:02:00.689> so

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
little bit more on her skin over here so

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.530 
little bit more on her skin over here so

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
more pinkness hair to her okay so I'm

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.310 
more pinkness hair to her okay so I'm
gonna<00:04:16.289> apply<00:04:16.620> another<00:04:17.039> of<00:04:17.959> preset<00:04:18.959> from<00:04:19.140> the

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
gonna apply another of preset from the

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.990 
gonna apply another of preset from the
luminous<00:04:19.680> collection<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.400> I<00:04:20.459> know<00:04:20.640> that<00:04:20.820> this

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
luminous collection and I know that this

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.480 
luminous collection and I know that this
one's<00:04:21.239> going<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.570> be<00:04:21.660> a<00:04:21.780> radial<00:04:22.229> filter<00:04:22.490> that's

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
one's going to be a radial filter that's

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.190 
one's going to be a radial filter that's
the<00:04:23.789> reason<00:04:24.120> I<00:04:24.240> can<00:04:24.390> layer<00:04:24.599> them<00:04:24.840> because

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
the reason I can layer them because

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.020 
the reason I can layer them because
they're<00:04:25.410> not<00:04:25.560> both<00:04:25.890> graduated<00:04:26.669> filter

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
they're not both graduated filter

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.810 
they're not both graduated filter
they're<00:04:27.390> not<00:04:27.540> both<00:04:27.840> radio<00:04:28.590> filters<00:04:29.040> and<00:04:29.460> you

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
they're not both radio filters and you

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.880 
they're not both radio filters and you
might<00:04:30.000> ask<00:04:30.240> how<00:04:30.660> do<00:04:30.720> I<00:04:30.900> know<00:04:31.020> that<00:04:31.200> well<00:04:31.710> I<00:04:31.740> know

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
might ask how do I know that well I know

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.010 
might ask how do I know that well I know
that<00:04:32.280> from<00:04:32.550> just<00:04:32.850> playing<00:04:33.180> around<00:04:33.510> with<00:04:33.810> these

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
that from just playing around with these

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.320 
that from just playing around with these
presets<00:04:34.620> so<00:04:34.950> it's<00:04:35.430> always<00:04:35.820> good<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.090> play

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330
