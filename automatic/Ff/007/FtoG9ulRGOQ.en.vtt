00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.929 
some blade wash solution I've already
removed<00:00:15.820> the<00:00:16.540> tea<00:00:17.170> blade<00:00:17.470> from<00:00:17.830> the<00:00:17.939> trimmer

removed the tea blade from the trimmer
and<00:00:19.450> I've<00:00:20.730> filled<00:00:21.730> this<00:00:21.970> cup<00:00:22.330> up<00:00:22.599> about<00:00:23.290> half

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
and I've filled this cup up about half

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.560 
and I've filled this cup up about half
way<00:00:23.950> with<00:00:24.340> a<00:00:24.550> blade<00:00:25.330> watch<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:26.650> what<00:00:27.070> idea<00:00:27.430> was

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
way with a blade watch so what idea was

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.190 
way with a blade watch so what idea was
took<00:00:28.570> the<00:00:28.750> blade<00:00:28.960> completely<00:00:29.680> apart<00:00:31.020> broke<00:00:32.020> it

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
took the blade completely apart broke it

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.310 
took the blade completely apart broke it
down<00:00:32.410> all<00:00:33.160> the<00:00:33.370> way<00:00:33.579> all<00:00:33.970> the<00:00:34.000> way<00:00:34.239> down<00:00:34.600> and

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
down all the way all the way down and

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.310 
down all the way all the way down and
basically<00:00:36.309> just<00:00:36.700> soaking<00:00:37.120> it<00:00:37.239> in<00:00:37.570> this

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
basically just soaking it in this

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.940 
basically just soaking it in this
solution<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:40.000> basically<00:00:40.480> you<00:00:41.469> know<00:00:41.590> I'm<00:00:41.739> going

solution so basically you know I'm going
to<00:00:41.980> clean<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.579> blade<00:00:42.790> black<00:00:43.149> back<00:00:43.600> off<00:00:45.930> wiping

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
to clean the blade black back off wiping

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:57.150 
to clean the blade black back off wiping
all<00:00:47.110> of<00:00:47.290> the<00:00:47.410> residue<00:00:47.920> away<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:56.040> put<00:00:57.040> the

all of the residue away and put the

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.310 
all of the residue away and put the
blade<00:00:57.550> back<00:00:57.579> down<00:00:58.150> to<00:00:58.300> the<00:00:58.390> zero<00:00:58.750> gapping

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
blade back down to the zero gapping

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.250 
blade back down to the zero gapping
there's<00:00:59.940> plenty<00:01:00.940> of<00:01:01.000> ways<00:01:01.240> that<00:01:01.570> you<00:01:01.750> can<00:01:01.870> zero

the<00:01:50.260> trimmer<00:01:50.560> now<00:01:51.190> one<00:01:51.460> of<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.730> things<00:01:51.970> that

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
the trimmer now one of the things that

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.530 
the trimmer now one of the things that
people<00:01:52.920> don't<00:01:53.920> pay<00:01:54.340> too<00:01:54.400> much<00:01:54.610> attention<00:01:54.820> to

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
people don't pay too much attention to

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.110 
people don't pay too much attention to
is<00:01:55.860> when<00:01:56.860> you're<00:01:57.010> putting<00:01:57.280> your<00:01:57.550> blade<00:01:57.760> back

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
is when you're putting your blade back

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.080 
is when you're putting your blade back
on<00:01:58.150> your<00:01:58.540> trimmer<00:02:02.370> how<00:02:03.370> the<00:02:03.430> blade<00:02:03.850> is

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
on your trimmer how the blade is

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.590 
on your trimmer how the blade is
actually<00:02:04.270> positioned<00:02:05.080> can<00:02:05.500> determine<00:02:06.600> how

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
actually positioned can determine how

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.080 
actually positioned can determine how
the<00:02:07.660> trimmer<00:02:08.200> actually<00:02:08.740> cuts<00:02:09.040> sounds<00:02:09.850> and

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
the trimmer actually cuts sounds and

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.940 
the trimmer actually cuts sounds and
performs<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.950> what<00:02:12.700> I<00:02:12.730> mean<00:02:13.000> by<00:02:13.060> that<00:02:13.950> even

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
performs so what I mean by that even

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.670 
performs so what I mean by that even
after<00:02:15.190> I<00:02:15.220> put<00:02:15.490> my<00:02:15.640> screws<00:02:16.230> back<00:02:17.230> on<00:02:17.470> the

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
after I put my screws back on the

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.490 
after I put my screws back on the
trimmer<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:21.670> blade<00:02:22.030> was<00:02:22.450> until<00:02:23.020> I<00:02:23.050> tighten

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
trimmer the blade was until I tighten

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.830 
trimmer the blade was until I tighten
the<00:02:23.560> screws<00:02:23.860> all<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.250> way<00:02:24.400> down<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:25.030> can

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
the screws all the way down I can

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.430 
the screws all the way down I can
position<00:02:26.050> or<00:02:26.530> move<00:02:26.710> the<00:02:26.920> blade<00:02:27.160> up<00:02:27.900> down<00:02:28.900> side

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
position or move the blade up down side

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.250 
position or move the blade up down side
to<00:02:29.470> side<00:02:29.970> so<00:02:30.970> basically<00:02:31.180> what<00:02:31.720> I<00:02:31.750> want<00:02:32.050> to<00:02:32.080> do

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.120 
notice when I turn it back on the blade
is<00:03:06.910> moving<00:03:07.390> more<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.320> right<00:03:08.500> side<00:03:08.830> of<00:03:09.010> the

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
is moving more to the right side of the

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.150 
is moving more to the right side of the
trimmer<00:03:10.050> so<00:03:11.050> basically<00:03:11.590> I'm<00:03:11.769> going<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:12.010> loosen

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
trimmer so basically I'm going to loosen

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.680 
trimmer so basically I'm going to loosen
it<00:03:12.430> back<00:03:12.610> up<00:03:12.880> and<00:03:13.080> I'm<00:03:14.080> going<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.500> move<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:16.360> top

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
it back up and I'm going to move the top

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.020 
it back up and I'm going to move the top
blade<00:03:17.050> over<00:03:18.300> slightly<00:03:19.300> to<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:19.900> right<00:03:20.880> so<00:03:21.880> the

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
blade over slightly to the right so the

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.880 
blade over slightly to the right so the
moving<00:03:22.420> blade<00:03:22.690> will<00:03:23.080> distribute<00:03:23.500> lis

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
moving blade will distribute lis

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:30.060 
moving blade will distribute lis
distribute<00:03:24.760> evenly<00:03:26.010> out<00:03:27.010> so<00:03:28.950> loosen<00:03:29.950> that

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
distribute evenly out so loosen that

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.150 
distribute evenly out so loosen that
back<00:03:30.310> up<00:03:30.550> and<00:03:31.380> basically<00:03:32.380> just<00:03:32.709> move<00:03:32.950> the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
back up and basically just move the

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.150 
back up and basically just move the
blade<00:03:33.370> over<00:03:33.400> a<00:03:33.730> little<00:03:34.000> bit<00:03:34.950> tighten<00:03:35.950> it<00:03:36.010> back

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160
