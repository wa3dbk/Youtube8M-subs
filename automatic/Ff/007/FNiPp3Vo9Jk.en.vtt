to<00:01:45.250> make<00:01:45.670> both<00:01:46.150> throws<00:01:46.630> go<00:01:47.320> up<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.619> same

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
to make both throws go up the same

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.800 
to make both throws go up the same
height<00:01:48.250> that<00:01:49.060> will<00:01:49.210> help<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:49.600> maintain

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
height that will help you maintain

height that will help you maintain
control<00:01:50.049> and<00:01:51.240> now<00:01:52.240> once<00:01:52.450> you<00:01:52.540> have<00:01:52.689> that<00:01:52.720> down

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
control and now once you have that down

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.060 
control and now once you have that down
you<00:01:53.470> do<00:01:53.830> left<00:01:54.400> right<00:01:54.670> right<00:01:55.630> left<00:01:55.659> and<00:01:56.320> you<00:01:56.950> can

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
you do left right right left and you can

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.010 
you do left right right left and you can
speed<00:01:57.369> it<00:01:57.400> up<00:01:57.580> this<00:01:58.270> looks<00:01:58.720> a<00:01:58.810> whole<00:01:58.960> lot

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
speed it up this looks a whole lot

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.289 
speed it up this looks a whole lot
better<00:01:59.350> because<00:01:59.619> it's<00:01:59.979> more<00:02:00.520> like<00:02:00.729> juggling

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.230 
one is up you're going to thread third
so<00:02:29.860> basically<00:02:30.250> when<00:02:30.520> you<00:02:30.610> do<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.850> three<00:02:31.060> ball

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
so basically when you do the three ball

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.570 
so basically when you do the three ball
cascade<00:02:31.420> it's<00:02:31.990> just<00:02:32.500> a<00:02:32.620> giant<00:02:32.950> figure<00:02:33.250> eight

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.330 

pretty<00:02:36.580> easy<00:02:36.730> you<00:02:36.850> can<00:02:37.060> see<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.570> pattern<00:02:41.340> just

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
pretty easy you can see the pattern just

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.500 
pretty easy you can see the pattern just
like<00:02:42.400> that<00:02:42.640> don't<00:02:43.090> even<00:02:43.210> worry<00:02:43.390> about

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
like that don't even worry about

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.430 
like that don't even worry about
catching<00:02:43.840> it<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:45.640> doesn't<00:02:45.910> even<00:02:46.000> matter<00:02:46.440> just

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
catching it it doesn't even matter just

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.140 
catching it it doesn't even matter just
get<00:02:47.710> used<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.100> throwing<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.580> up<00:02:49.590> and

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
get used to throwing it up and

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.680 
get used to throwing it up and
eventually<00:02:52.150> work<00:02:52.480> on<00:02:52.630> catching<00:02:52.990> it<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:54.690> it

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
eventually work on catching it and it

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.160 
eventually work on catching it and it
should<00:02:55.840> be<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:55.960> smooth<00:02:56.290> motion<00:02:56.560> like<00:02:57.130> this<00:02:58.170> okay

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
should be a smooth motion like this okay

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.199 
should be a smooth motion like this okay
so<00:02:59.230> some<00:02:59.560> common<00:02:59.830> mistakes<00:02:59.950> are<00:03:00.550> juggling

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
so some common mistakes are juggling

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.000 
so some common mistakes are juggling
sort<00:03:01.660> of<00:03:01.750> like<00:03:01.959> in<00:03:02.200> a<00:03:02.290> circle<00:03:02.680> like<00:03:02.709> you're

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
sort of like in a circle like you're

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.330 
sort of like in a circle like you're
gonna<00:03:03.130> fight<00:03:03.550> someone<00:03:03.940> so<00:03:04.690> it's<00:03:04.810> going<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:05.020> be

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
gonna fight someone so it's going to be

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.440 
gonna fight someone so it's going to be
when<00:03:06.340> you're<00:03:06.520> doing<00:03:06.730> it<00:03:06.790> wrong<00:03:06.970> it<00:03:07.150> looks<00:03:07.300> like

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
when you're doing it wrong it looks like

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.040 
when you're doing it wrong it looks like
this<00:03:09.240> what<00:03:10.240> you<00:03:10.330> want<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.570> do<00:03:10.660> is<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:10.810> want<00:03:10.840> to

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
this what you want to do is you want to

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.730 
this what you want to do is you want to
widen<00:03:11.230> up<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:12.510> throw<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:13.600> across<00:03:13.720> your<00:03:14.050> body

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.060 

not<00:03:17.740> in<00:03:17.860> front

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.740 

another<00:03:21.070> common<00:03:21.310> mistake<00:03:21.550> is<00:03:22.000> throwing<00:03:22.660> the

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
another common mistake is throwing the

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.300 
another common mistake is throwing the
third<00:03:22.990> ball<00:03:23.230> way<00:03:23.800> out<00:03:24.010> in<00:03:24.040> front<00:03:24.190> of<00:03:24.460> you<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:27.190> it

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
third ball way out in front of you so it

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.310 
third ball way out in front of you so it
makes<00:03:27.490> so<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:27.820> forces<00:03:28.060> you<00:03:28.300> to<00:03:28.330> go<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.630> chase

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
makes so it forces you to go and chase

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.510 
makes so it forces you to go and chase
after<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:29.710> an<00:03:29.920> easy<00:03:30.370> way<00:03:30.520> to<00:03:30.640> fix<00:03:30.880> this<00:03:31.120> is<00:03:31.360> to

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
after it an easy way to fix this is to

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.250 
after it an easy way to fix this is to
go<00:03:33.520> up<00:03:33.640> to<00:03:33.760> like<00:03:33.850> a<00:03:33.910> tree<00:03:34.240> or<00:03:34.690> something<00:03:34.720> and

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
go up to like a tree or something and

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.500 
go up to like a tree or something and
you're<00:03:36.220> just<00:03:36.400> going<00:03:36.520> to<00:03:36.580> juggle<00:03:36.730> in<00:03:37.030> front<00:03:37.420> a

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
you're just going to juggle in front a

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.800 
you're just going to juggle in front a
tree<00:03:37.720> that<00:03:38.340> way<00:03:39.340> in<00:03:39.580> the<00:03:40.270> event<00:03:40.390> that<00:03:40.630> you

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
tree that way in the event that you

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.430 
tree that way in the event that you
throw<00:03:41.710> it<00:03:41.800> up<00:03:42.150> comes<00:03:43.150> right<00:03:43.300> back<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:43.690> that'll

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
throw it up comes right back and that'll

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.910 
throw it up comes right back and that'll
get<00:03:44.560> you<00:03:44.680> used<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:44.980> having<00:03:45.310> bounce<00:03:46.650> yeah<00:03:47.650> so
