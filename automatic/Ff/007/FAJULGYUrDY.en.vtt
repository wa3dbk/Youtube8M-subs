00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.890
 new friends 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.410
 I hope you liked the videos 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.900
 previous ones that have been going up and then in 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.390
 one occasion he uploaded a video of a ford 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.939
 scape of red color that brought doors of 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.910
 good gym work because here they can 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.180
 observe here we have the car so 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.430
 to compete in that pl 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.180
 We are in the cinema but michoacán them 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.950
 I'm going to give a small 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.870
 with a little tour on what is the 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.420
 system that this has this 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.060
 vehicle good first our club 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.940
 that we belong is the morelia commerce 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.840
 after his legs of lamborghini type 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.870
 lam 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:02.129
 the 20 and brings this what are the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.379
 the coi lovers or adjustable springs are 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.420
 can go down you can go down yet but 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.420
 at the moment we're just going to do it 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.750
 we have 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.140
 what is a panasonic sékou study of 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.659
 1,300 euros 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.819
 this is a good good audio quality 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.759
 in the doors after the media that yes 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:27.520
 I have not seen them much of what brands 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.619
 are 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.729
 and then there we are traders yes 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.729
 they are medium large and 2 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:43.240
 over here we have 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.370
 the knob for what is the epicenter 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.450
 it's an audio control because it 's going to 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.450
 move to the back so that 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.390
 you can watch it we have an equalizer 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.890
 outotec the 7000 7 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.520
 here we go to what are the 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.520
 amplifiers 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.990
 the amplifier with which they feed 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.360
 these 215 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.940
 with millward crossfire the gaming 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.550
 all that is the wiring of poles of 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.110
 current voltage and on the ground 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.770
 zero gauge reaction here because it brings 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.270
 a producer from 0 to 4 because then the 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.860
 Amplifier inputs are not very 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.040
 large so that it fits directly to the 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.040
 zero 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.620
 we have here the restorative epicenter of 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.569
 bass audio control 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.660
 Well practically you are very 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.650
 known here in america 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.909
 and in other places like as a 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.159
 the main image of what the 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:46.390
 they refer when they talk about epicenter and 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:49.060
 here we have the crossfire I feel strong 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.390
 and 140 watts is a green 142 of the 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.390
 channels 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.519
 this does give a very good clarity to 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.700
 the speakers what are the media the 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.530
 vehicle 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:07.380
 it sounds very clear 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:12.750
 and here we have the Gunners 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:14.670
 these are the 10 15-inch audio and 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.000
 Well now it would be practically 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.000
 a 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.380
 a ride through the vehicle encompassing 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.480
 which is the most general 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.210
 and in a few more moments we will be 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.690
 showing them a comfortable demo how 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.690
 this sounds
