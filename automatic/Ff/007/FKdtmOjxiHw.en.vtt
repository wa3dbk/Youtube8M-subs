and<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.740> way<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:58.979> does<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.430> this<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.119> scans

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
and the way it does it is this it scans

and the way it does it is this it scans
the<00:02:01.320> surface<00:02:01.890> where<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.790> finds<00:02:03.119> state<00:02:03.479> 1

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750

through<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.390> rhodopsin<00:02:06.680> unchanged<00:02:07.680> but<00:02:08.580> when

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
through the rhodopsin unchanged but when

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.880 
through the rhodopsin unchanged but when

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
it comes across a state 0 molecule it

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.030 
it comes across a state 0 molecule it
flips<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.640> state<00:02:11.849> 1<00:02:12.120> as<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.390> result<00:02:13.200> some<00:02:13.739> and

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
flips it to state 1 as a result some and

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.770 
flips it to state 1 as a result some and
she<00:02:14.159> is<00:02:14.250> absorbed<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:15.269> change<00:02:15.569> in

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
she is absorbed and the change in

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.690 
she is absorbed and the change in
brightness<00:02:16.049> of<00:02:16.469> the<00:02:16.500> beam<00:02:16.739> is<00:02:16.769> measured<00:02:17.459> by<00:02:17.670> a

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
brightness of the beam is measured by a

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.899 
brightness of the beam is measured by a
sensor<00:02:18.180> behind<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.629> chip<00:02:19.370> however<00:02:20.370> in<00:02:20.640> being

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
sensor behind the chip however in being

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.360 
sensor behind the chip however in being
detected<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.780> bit<00:02:21.989> has<00:02:22.170> also<00:02:22.439> been<00:02:22.799> destroyed

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
detected the bit has also been destroyed

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.209 
detected the bit has also been destroyed
so<00:02:24.209> it's<00:02:24.359> now<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.599> job<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:25.079> the<00:02:25.200> red<00:02:25.409> laser<00:02:25.709> to

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219 
so it's now the job of the red laser to

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:39.790 
so it's now the job of the red laser to
reset<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.849> type

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.160 
familiar with I believe in most cases it
is<00:02:49.890> because<00:02:50.670> these<00:02:50.880> devices<00:02:51.330> because<00:02:51.930> they

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
is because these devices because they

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.710 
is because these devices because they
are<00:02:52.230> so<00:02:52.470> small<00:02:52.830> can<00:02:53.430> operate<00:02:53.850> at<00:02:54.030> speeds<00:02:54.060> ten

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
are so small can operate at speeds ten

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.030 
are so small can operate at speeds ten
to<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:54.900> hundred<00:02:54.960> times<00:02:55.410> faster<00:02:56.010> than

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
to a hundred times faster than

to a hundred times faster than
semiconductors<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.180> in<00:02:57.870> much<00:02:58.050> smaller

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260

semiconductors and in much smaller
operating<00:02:59.220> environments<00:02:59.790> and<00:02:59.940> therefore<00:03:00.720> as

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
computers become faster and faster

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.760 
computers become faster and faster
eventually<00:03:03.870> we'll<00:03:04.110> have<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.470> outgrow

eventually we'll have to outgrow

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.130 
eventually we'll have to outgrow
semiconductors<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:05.940> replace<00:03:06.480> them<00:03:06.720> with
