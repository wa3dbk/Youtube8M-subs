00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
incredible value this is huge this

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.260 
incredible value this is huge this
compact<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.770> could<00:02:05.040> easily<00:02:05.250> last<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:06.119> few

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
compact this could easily last a few

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.300 
compact this could easily last a few
years<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:06.899> one<00:02:07.170> I've<00:02:07.380> had<00:02:07.530> for<00:02:07.590> over<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.009> year

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
years this one I've had for over a year

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.940 
years this one I've had for over a year
and<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.539> can<00:02:09.660> see<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:10.020> pan<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.410> beginning<00:02:10.830> to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
and you can see the pan is beginning to

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.410 
and you can see the pan is beginning to
kind<00:02:11.129> of

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
kind of

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.420 
kind of
it's<00:02:12.050> not<00:02:12.230> really<00:02:12.440> hitting<00:02:12.650> pan<00:02:12.980> but<00:02:13.220> you<00:02:13.310> can

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
it's not really hitting pan but you can

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.690 
it's not really hitting pan but you can
see<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:14.960> ridges<00:02:15.290> in<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.500> pan<00:02:15.890> but<00:02:16.160> it's<00:02:16.400> I've

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
see the ridges in the pan but it's I've

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.699 
see the ridges in the pan but it's I've
had<00:02:16.850> this<00:02:16.970> forever<00:02:17.270> and<00:02:17.420> it's<00:02:17.840> still<00:02:18.530> going

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
had this forever and it's still going

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.650 
had this forever and it's still going
strong<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:19.819> this<00:02:19.940> could<00:02:20.090> probably<00:02:20.240> easily

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
strong so this could probably easily

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.699 
strong so this could probably easily
last<00:02:21.020> three<00:02:21.260> years<00:02:21.530> I<00:02:22.330> love<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:24.020> feel<00:02:24.260> of<00:02:24.290> Marc
