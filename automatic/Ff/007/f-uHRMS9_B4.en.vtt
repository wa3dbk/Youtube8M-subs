00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.200
 conquered by guinea pigs as 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.430
 you can see the cages are on 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.619
 dates so it's been a while 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.990
 they were asked but I did not 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.340
 videos on it so here is the cage 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.250
 gries but for now it's useless 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.390
 and we will sell it to buy the same 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.590
 cage but in fact it's a chicken coop 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.080
 so in a lot much bigger 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.160
 for co fonda is there for now 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.620
 ten pigs in second in the cage 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.390
 brown so I removed the tarpaulins while 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.440
 what my little better see so I 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.760
 immediately start by showing you 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.820
 quickly the cage because there have been 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.260
 changes so there as always it's 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.890
 where they sleep so with straw 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:52.270
 below is the room the suite here 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.899
 there is their stainless steel bowl with kaya 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.360
 complete 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:59.200
 there is singing and where they have their backs 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.640
 and here their brake balls so 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.619
 then by the stairs they go down 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.630
 here so there is a second workshop 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.890
 then it's straw singing 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.440
 finally there is the reporter at tac la 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.709
 carrot so in white it's bounty after 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.970
 these creams and next to it is cinnamon the 

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:17.729
 another bowl with caddies to 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.039
 complete otherwise we put the vegetables 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.860
 then they have a cabin and their bowl 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.390
 of water so here they all go very well 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.459
 so for now the little is not 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.390
 with them because we integrate a pig 

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:28.660
 of India like that in the middle of 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.459
 Winter 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.720
 and then she's still small and then 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:33.720
 did not finish quarantine 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.400
 now I go through and slide our 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.730
 feet in the corner here a bis the euro 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.190
 side 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:56.690
 yes manor so as you can see 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.240
 it is no longer in my room it was 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.250
 went down where there are who leave because 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.340
 that my mother was too allergic to 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:08.450
 points so that's it has not changed too much 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.660
 there are these corner toilets next 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.560
 here is the gombe 1100 points 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:18.110
 she has a country that with her bridge the cck 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.600
 via complete his bowl of water and snow it's 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.680
 the polar ikea and where it 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.770
 often makes Croatians especially 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.920
 in the corners we put paper 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.920
 newspaper 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.450
 So here it is the cage cock so 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.610
 obviously I will not go to you 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.620
 show since we are in daylight 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.940
 but I quickly show you his 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.530
 cage so in any case she not very well 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.799
 so here it's always 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.390
 this is his little cage which is in addition 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.280
 so with his moment road I had bought 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.600
 a road bigger than the drian 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.160
 shown in a video to everything 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.170
 that she does not do it fan actually does not 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.580
 at all she prefers this one and then 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.500
 hey his back he is well positioned 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.850
 so it's not very serious here it's a 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.340
 little hammock so that I had made him 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.560
 underneath, I put some slivers of 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.910
 what sometimes loves the lie to 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.850
 a little wooden bridge or and can ride 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.180
 on his cabin where there is his bowl of water and 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.880
 of seeds so the litter is of 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.830
 hemp after there is this pipe that leads into 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.640
 down so I'm going to remove the top for 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.920
 to be able to show you down so that's it 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:24.620
 it's said to be the main rampage so with 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:26.329
 openings like that so here there a 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.880
 small to have embellished with you have 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.829
 bought on or pets and it's a 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.480
 little pipe is it actually happens 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.640
 per year place the platform after 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.850
 their scale so to go down on the 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.280
 next to her land ah ben there in it 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.090
 would like a small house so the 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.079
 bedding subtended room so here 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.609
 it's actually a shoebox 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.500
 noko the one who put the hemp in full 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.250
 do it like that and we cadors to 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.350
 interior 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.340
 there are corn cobs so at the base 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.300
 I did not want her there sleep his 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.610
 judges so she can dig 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.140
 except that valve has installed his so he 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:03.230
 this is just a little favorite toy 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:05.510
 do not play and here is the block her 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.930
 thousand I thought of getting wet at 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:14.959
 thousand millet I believe finally brief 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:16.430
 so here it is and here it is an air of 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.440
 old documents awaken through the 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.209
 grids actually 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.209
 but here she goes but she does not go too much 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.920
 and so here is where there are the 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.230
 wavy parakeets 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:46.760
 so in fact they are in this case banon 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.990
 the genial looks like that so here it's 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.600
 lahoud to their transport cages 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.420
 I rejected before the blue bin as I 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.470
 has joined grilled older you are there everywhere 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.000
 where there are things that we can 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.530
 actually fly in the room 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.820
 so we have not done it yet because he 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.280
 must first install researchers and 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.010
 all this but it will be done soon 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.360
 really looting by all and so had 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.680
 the idea there is their case so always on 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.980
 slabs like that in pigs 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.980
 turkey 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.400
 so there is 6 l / 100 blue sky blue 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.320
 turquoise 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:21.230
 there is eavis snow and that militates us 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.770
 behind these two there is a blur 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.390
 and of the two others it is another 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.630
 here we are there there is their drink to 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:33.050
 birds their seeds that are here and 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:38.060
 here they foiled the jenlain a little 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:40.630
 everywhere so here it is that then the 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.950
 night preparing this broad cloth and there to 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.930
 background is of Plexiglas fact that 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.340
 puts everywhere around the cage but no 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.340
 only they are sheltered from the wind already 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.990
 with the can and of course we close the 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.130
 door 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.130
 at night or when there is wind 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.750
 c 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.620
 it 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.240
 look 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.070
 chan 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.320
 or
