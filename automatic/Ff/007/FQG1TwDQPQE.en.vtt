meant a an enemy the famous or infamous
pic<00:00:16.580> after<00:00:18.369> so<00:00:19.369> this<00:00:19.939> pig<00:00:22.869> is<00:00:23.869> going<00:00:24.170> to<00:00:24.439> be

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
pic after so this pig is going to be

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:37.410 
pic after so this pig is going to be
physic<00:00:27.050> object<00:00:27.560> as<00:00:27.829> well

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.920 

we<00:00:38.420> are<00:00:38.510> going<00:00:38.960> to<00:00:39.140> create<00:00:39.500> a<00:00:39.590> couple<00:00:39.920> of<00:00:40.930> I'm

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
we are going to create a couple of I'm

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:49.810 
we are going to create a couple of I'm
sorry<00:00:43.360> couple<00:00:44.360> of<00:00:45.160> pigs<00:00:48.489> let's<00:00:49.489> try<00:00:49.760> to

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
sorry couple of pigs let's try to

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.890 
sorry couple of pigs let's try to
position<00:00:50.210> them<00:00:50.629> not<00:00:51.530> moving<00:00:52.239> I'm<00:00:53.239> go<00:00:53.540> we<00:00:53.839> all

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
position them not moving I'm go we all

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.170 
position them not moving I'm go we all
go<00:00:53.930> we're<00:00:54.350> going<00:00:54.559> to<00:00:54.710> apply<00:00:55.129> force<00:00:55.610> all<00:00:55.910> the

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
go we're going to apply force all the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.509 
go we're going to apply force all the
time<00:00:56.800> to<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:57.949> pigs

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
time to the pigs

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.569 
time to the pigs
assuming<00:00:59.510> that<00:00:59.540> the<00:00:59.750> pigs<00:01:00.070> don't<00:01:01.070> leave<00:01:01.280> the

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
assuming that the pigs don't leave the

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.210 
assuming that the pigs don't leave the
gravity<00:01:02.150> field<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:02.690> that<00:01:03.440> they<00:01:03.650> are<00:01:03.860> very

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
gravity field and that they are very

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.600 
gravity field and that they are very
close<00:01:04.519> to<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.089> surface<00:01:05.330> of<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:06.080> earth<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:07.190> we

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
close to the surface of the earth so we

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.950 
close to the surface of the earth so we
are<00:01:07.820> going<00:01:08.330> to<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:09.580> system<00:01:11.590> every<00:01:12.590> tick<00:01:13.960> an

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
are going to the system every tick an

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.560 
are going to the system every tick an
action<00:01:15.680> over<00:01:16.100> big<00:01:17.590> force<00:01:18.700> apply<00:01:19.700> for<00:01:20.030> stored

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
action over big force apply for stored

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.800 
action over big force apply for stored
position<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:22.310> position<00:01:22.490> is<00:01:22.910> going<00:01:23.060> to<00:01:23.210> be<00:01:23.360> the

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
position the position is going to be the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:33.010 
position the position is going to be the
center<00:01:24.440> of<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:24.890> earth<00:01:29.440> and<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:31.670> force<00:01:32.030> could

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
center of the earth and the force could

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.279 
center of the earth and the force could
be<00:01:33.080> this<00:01:33.500> one<00:01:34.179> but<00:01:35.179> it's<00:01:35.420> very<00:01:35.479> close<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:35.869> once

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
be this one but it's very close to once

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.279 
be this one but it's very close to once
we<00:01:36.530> are<00:01:36.649> going<00:01:36.979> to<00:01:37.100> use<00:01:37.280> one<00:01:37.869> let's<00:01:38.869> see<00:01:39.110> what

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
we are going to use one let's see what

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:54.460 
we are going to use one let's see what
happens<00:01:42.130> okay<00:01:43.180> so<00:01:44.590> now<00:01:45.590> we<00:01:45.650> can<00:01:47.409> get<00:01:48.909> the<00:01:53.470> the

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
happens okay so now we can get the the

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:01.719 
happens okay so now we can get the the
pigs<00:01:56.680> that's<00:01:59.409> well<00:02:00.409> now<00:02:00.649> we<00:02:00.710> are<00:02:00.950> going<00:02:01.189> to<00:02:01.549> add

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
pigs that's well now we are going to add

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.550 
pigs that's well now we are going to add
a<00:02:02.950> ops<00:02:04.090> we<00:02:05.090> are<00:02:05.149> going<00:02:05.360> to<00:02:05.479> add<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:05.869> reload

restart the layout okay we're going to
save<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.650> project<00:03:02.590> space<00:03:07.630> okay<00:03:09.580> let's<00:03:10.580> run

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
save the project space okay let's run

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:19.920 
save the project space okay let's run
the<00:03:11.300> try<00:03:12.290> again<00:03:13.390> so<00:03:14.390> now<00:03:15.880> okay<00:03:16.880> you<00:03:17.540> can<00:03:18.319> reload

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
the try again so now okay you can reload

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.820 
the try again so now okay you can reload
whenever<00:03:20.930> we<00:03:21.200> want

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
whenever we want

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:33.400 
whenever we want
using<00:03:22.580> the<00:03:22.760> reload<00:03:23.180> button<00:03:25.209> okay<00:03:32.290> our<00:03:33.290> last

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
using the reload button okay our last

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.250 
using the reload button okay our last
step<00:03:34.100> is<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.910> add<00:03:36.069> touch<00:03:37.069> input<00:03:37.880> so<00:03:38.600> we<00:03:38.630> insert

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
step is to add touch input so we insert

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:46.000 
step is to add touch input so we insert
a<00:03:39.530> new<00:03:39.950> object<00:03:41.380> touch<00:03:43.870> and<00:03:44.870> we<00:03:45.350> are<00:03:45.470> going<00:03:45.739> to

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
a new object touch and we are going to

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.120 
a new object touch and we are going to
add<00:03:47.500> one<00:03:48.500> event<00:03:49.150> which<00:03:50.150> is<00:03:50.330> going<00:03:50.540> to<00:03:50.660> be<00:03:51.130> the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
add one event which is going to be the

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.039 
add one event which is going to be the
same<00:03:52.549> that<00:03:52.850> this<00:03:53.030> one<00:03:53.269> so<00:03:53.510> we<00:03:53.570> are<00:03:53.690> going<00:03:53.750> to

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
same that this one so we are going to

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:05.850 
same that this one so we are going to
copy<00:03:54.470> this<00:03:56.290> I'm<00:03:57.290> sorry

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:13.660 

but<00:04:06.860> if<00:04:10.150> instead<00:04:11.150> of<00:04:11.210> mouse<00:04:11.900> input<00:04:12.640> we<00:04:13.640> are

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
but if instead of mouse input we are

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:26.910 
but if instead of mouse input we are
going<00:04:14.090> to<00:04:14.330> use<00:04:14.630> a<00:04:18.340> touch<00:04:19.720> input<00:04:25.150> touch<00:04:26.150> start

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
going to use a touch input touch start

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.790 
going to use a touch input touch start
and<00:04:27.920> we're<00:04:28.730> going<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.030> do<00:04:29.300> these<00:04:29.510> tours<00:04:30.350> the

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
and we're going to do these tours the

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:41.170 
and we're going to do these tours the
touch<00:04:31.540> X<00:04:36.190> touch<00:04:37.990> y<00:04:39.040> so<00:04:40.040> now<00:04:40.070> if<00:04:40.520> we<00:04:40.550> touch<00:04:40.880> the

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
touch X touch y so now if we touch the

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.710 
touch X touch y so now if we touch the
screen<00:04:41.650> we<00:04:42.650> are<00:04:42.680> going<00:04:42.770> to<00:04:43.280> impose<00:04:43.730> the<00:04:44.390> birth

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
screen we are going to impose the birth

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:51.740
