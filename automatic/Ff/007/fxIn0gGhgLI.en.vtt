00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.359 
use something like cold laser or
low-level<00:01:44.970> energy<00:01:45.659> laser<00:01:46.130> dr.<00:01:47.130> Don

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
low-level energy laser dr. Don

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.609 
low-level energy laser dr. Don
recommended<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.689> do<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.049> decompression

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
recommended that I do the decompression

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.670 
recommended that I do the decompression
and<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.640> thought<00:01:50.970> okay<00:01:51.570> let's<00:01:51.720> try<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.290> and

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
and so I thought okay let's try it and

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.999 
and so I thought okay let's try it and
it<00:01:53.189> was<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.399> six-week<00:01:54.180> period<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:55.200> going<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.770> to

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
it was a six-week period of going on to

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.620 
it was a six-week period of going on to
the<00:01:56.100> machine<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.759> all<00:01:56.909> they<00:01:57.060> were<00:01:57.119> going<00:01:57.509> to

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
the machine and all they were going to

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.469 
the machine and all they were going to
be<00:01:57.750> doing<00:01:57.930> was<00:01:58.590> stretching<00:01:59.219> me<00:01:59.430> out<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.969> believe

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
be doing was stretching me out I believe

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.719 
be doing was stretching me out I believe
it<00:02:00.570> was<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> 30-minute<00:02:01.409> period<00:02:01.680> four<00:02:02.520> days<00:02:02.700> a

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
it was a 30-minute period four days a

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.819 
it was a 30-minute period four days a
week<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.780> thought<00:02:03.990> that's<00:02:04.110> perfect<00:02:04.590> no

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
week and I thought that's perfect no

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.520 
week and I thought that's perfect no
surgery<00:02:05.250> no<00:02:05.549> cutting<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.180> ended<00:02:06.630> up<00:02:06.719> feeling<00:02:06.990> so

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
surgery no cutting I ended up feeling so

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.840 
surgery no cutting I ended up feeling so
much<00:02:07.680> better<00:02:07.740> after<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.670> third<00:02:08.970> we

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
much better after the third we

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.390 
much better after the third we
and<00:02:09.940> now<00:02:10.600> I<00:02:10.630> am<00:02:11.110> able<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.560> stand<00:02:12.720> sit<00:02:14.400> exercise

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
and now I am able to stand sit exercise

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.690 
and now I am able to stand sit exercise
bent<00:02:16.120> over<00:02:16.660> I<00:02:17.020> still<00:02:17.650> pick<00:02:17.890> up<00:02:18.040> my<00:02:18.190> kids<00:02:18.490> which

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
I probably shouldn't do but I feel no

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.440 
I probably shouldn't do but I feel no
pain<00:02:20.770> so<00:02:21.490> it<00:02:21.670> was<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.880> best<00:02:22.060> thing<00:02:22.240> that<00:02:22.420> I

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
pain so it was the best thing that I

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.450 
pain so it was the best thing that I

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
could have done you know every single

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.190 
could have done you know every single
patient<00:02:24.640> comes<00:02:25.240> in<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.510> office<00:02:25.840> they're<00:02:26.050> all

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
patient comes in the office they're all

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.780 
patient comes in the office they're all
different<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:27.070> can<00:02:27.220> have<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.370> patient<00:02:27.610> that

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
different you can have a patient that

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.180 
different you can have a patient that
has<00:02:28.030> neck<00:02:28.360> pain<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:28.900> another<00:02:29.650> page<00:02:29.860> that<00:02:29.890> his

has neck pain and another page that his
neck<00:02:30.340> pain<00:02:30.520> they<00:02:30.640> are<00:02:30.700> not<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.000> same<00:02:31.150> patient

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
neck pain they are not the same patient

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.240 
neck pain they are not the same patient
they're<00:02:31.750> going<00:02:31.960> to<00:02:32.080> respond<00:02:32.470> different<00:02:32.860> they

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
they're going to respond different they

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
different mechanism maybe of injury it's

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.420 
different mechanism maybe of injury it's
fun<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:38.110> see<00:02:38.320> these<00:02:38.530> new<00:02:38.710> patients<00:02:39.160> because

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
fun to see these new patients because

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.250 
fun to see these new patients because
every<00:02:39.910> single<00:02:40.240> new<00:02:40.360> patient<00:02:40.810> is<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:40.960> new

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
every single new patient is a new

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:50.210 
every single new patient is a new
challenge

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220
