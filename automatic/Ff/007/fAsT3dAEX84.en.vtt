00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
another video up of it running but I

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.160 
another video up of it running but I
have<00:00:25.590> worn<00:00:25.980> engine<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.580> replace<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:27.090> with<00:00:27.170> I'm

have worn engine to replace it with I'm
thinking<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.680> maybe<00:00:28.800> using<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.250> original

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
thinking of maybe using the original

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.450 
thinking of maybe using the original
carburetor<00:00:29.939> setup<00:00:31.009> and<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:34.980> keep<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.340> running

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
carburetor setup and and keep it running

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.119

pretty<00:00:36.149> much<00:00:36.239> original<00:00:37.129> but<00:00:39.590> this<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.770> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
pretty much original but this is the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:49.450 
pretty much original but this is the
replacement<00:00:41.550> engine<00:00:43.489> has<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.700> b10<00:00:45.300> carb<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.119 

this<00:00:50.460> one<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.789> made<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.539> Australia<00:00:52.129> whereas

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
this one is made in Australia whereas

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.500 
this one is made in Australia whereas
that<00:00:53.520> one<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.730> think<00:00:54.120> he's<00:00:54.300> made<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.199> England<00:00:55.530> I

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.069 
that one I think he's made in England I
don't<00:00:57.510> know<00:00:57.600> if<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.719> parts<00:00:57.989> are

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
don't know if the parts are

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.689 
don't know if the parts are
interchangeable<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:58.739> I'm<00:00:58.890> gonna<00:00:59.160> soon<00:00:59.460> find

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
interchangeable but I'm gonna soon find

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.700 
interchangeable but I'm gonna soon find
