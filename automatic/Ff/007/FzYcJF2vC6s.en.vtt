00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.599
 all 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.940
 here I am back with a new video 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.980
 today I wanted to make people live like and tighten 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.859
 trousers from the center back front 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:25.769
 how much like in the arc and therefore the sign 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:29.460
 and that the shooting facility it will make a 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.550
 stitching from this sign to wear out up 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.829
 in the horse here I can first 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.040
 remove the pin and apply it only from 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.140
 a part so free duty the 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.340
 fence for pants first thing to do 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:50.129
 it is to scucare the passer-by finds a 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:54.090
 passerby let's say how maybe it will take one 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:01:01.879
 some time to untie the passerby on the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.879
 upper part and the passer-by unstitched 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.400
 we have to unpick the seam of the boundary 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.790
 here in this case the trouser does not have 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.070
 a belt a central seam behind 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.780
 we will make a new reason for it 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.640
 otherwise it would be necessary to move the whole 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.860
 the cisco cirla from the beginning and move it 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.180
 all but not wanting to hang it up 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.710
 everything can be done very well sewing 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.650
 central also to the city where it is 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:34.100
 then we push so much this will precede 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.100
 the passer-by breaks out here 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.619
 not even put the banks because 31 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.659
 I see poignant peter here we have to 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.600
 in short enough to escape it 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.659
 we have this in this case August in 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.630
 a lot of germs so I have to unpick 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:06.990
 enough to unpick just take the 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:06.990
 son and pulling and simple here and there 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.569
 however this is the seam above the 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.790
 civilization the trousers to another 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.170
 rightly internal seam and we have to 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.040
 also scroll the game then you have to 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.909
 go to tighten here we also apologize 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.909
 the internal one 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:43.200
 and there is also the part that makes the machine 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:43.200
 bearing we go 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.230
 I'm doing 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.790
 and that this black and unseen picture 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.790
 anything 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:10.430
 even this pant sewed with 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:17.390
 then cut and sew internally 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:20.980
 i will go to know very careful april 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:26.390
 it comes from cuts and sews because 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:28.310
 one hundred cut the trousers c just a 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.390
 cut here you see what there is 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.990
 these must be taken away from these children 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.990
 this 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.200
 so 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.620
 to the right than to the left 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:05.570
 that's it done now we also remove the 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.570
 passer because there is boredom 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:18.109
 now we have our pants book 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:20.870
 we have to do a seam not 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.880
 I looked at this one as well as him 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.880
 typing on the seam you see 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:34.840
 we need to remove this retaliation 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:38.500
 also this because take many do 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.500
 otherwise the seam does not 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.650
 well good all a difficult job 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.650
 let's say 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.879
 and how much 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.820
 it is minimal we will arrive we will tighten i 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:18.450
 let's say 2 300 million commensurate with here 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:18.450
 to wear out the horse of the pantheon e 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:28.990
 so this seam I will write the for 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.370
 comfort listening to a lot of why 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.370
 otherwise it bothers me 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.510
 so far 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.690
 point 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.660
 we have ours and there are also children 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.449
 peak 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:04.370
 let's proceed now to tighten the 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:06.770
 pant this was the first part 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.590
 let's say the video in the second video vi 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.749
 i will show how to do the stitching put back 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:16.310
 also tighten the belt and put it back 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:18.139
 in the passer all for the moment vi 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:22.279
 greeting the next video I will upload to 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:23.689
 certainly short and I wanted to thank you 

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:25.550
 I wanted to thank you members who 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:25.999

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.199
