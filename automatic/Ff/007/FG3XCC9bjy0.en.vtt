00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.809
 I would like to thank you for the 60's 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.089
 subscribers good let's start 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.580
 discover that Cooper has a garden with 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.730
 many birds are likely to have 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.000
 brought the birds of the planet earth is 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.430
 the third appearance of cÃºber is the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.460
 third episode about short fables 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.850
 being the first five short fables and 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.520
 the second five other short fables are 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.160
 see that the fox is very positive the phrase 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.920
 end of each grable is repeated at the beginning 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.290
 of the next one by another character the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.570
 newspaper that has an end and since it says 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.570
 morning newspaper instead of saying just 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.579
 newspaper or newspaper today is discovered 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.920
 that does not have an alarm if it comes in 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.110
 some stranger in the bread room of 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.190
 cinnamon there is a poster of a human with 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.109
 wig similar to benjamin franklin 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.840
 it also seems that cinnamon bread won 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.180
 a unicycle trophy looks like the king 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.900
 ice cream has a similar console 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.300
 xbox according to the cartoon network page 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.880
 use this episode would try stories 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.650
 about parents, however, since 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.840
 Cooper did not say what it was the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.030
 fable is likely that the fable of 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.490
 cubber it has been about five 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.460
 stages of grief the first is the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.100
 acceptance the second is the denial the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.010
 third is the negotiation the fourth is 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.440
 the anger and the fifth is depression this 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.780
 it's because he finally accepted an aha package 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.330
 that cinnamon bread refuses to sleep 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.220
 without night light the ice king negotiates 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.800
 with the penguins to watch a movie 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.990
 the sour lemon count gets angry with his 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.119
 clone and Mr. Fox said that in the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.600
 bed had accumulated a depression 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.920
 verbal reference is also made to all 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.110
 you are except for anger 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.670
 it's the first time there are two episodes 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.770
 short fables in the same season 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.490

 she has a different hairstyle 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.930
 jr as the future is concerned as 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.689
 if it were something very dark 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.870
 this episode was a special for the day 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:30.120
 of the father the sour lemon count and the 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.930
 lemon sour lemon clone are parents of 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.510
 a marble doll 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.640
 maybe this is the end of the clone of 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.739
 lemon sour count since the original 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.500
 I was eating him for killing his son 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.140
 the ice king was watching a movie 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.940
 of crimes where the protagonists were 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.130
 humans 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.890
 it is the second time that it is also seen 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.160
 other humans in movie possibly 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.170
 be from before the war according to the sweet 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.460
 princess the cinnamon bread has 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:04.550
 practically 30 years in total there were two 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.770
 checking lamps in the episode the 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.810
 Mr. Fox's conscience was 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.570
 indicating something on a map until the 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.330
 cinnamon bread interrupted him when 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.640
 cooper talks to the audience the screen 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.430
 it moves as if it were a show 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.620
 of children like 'dora the explorer' the 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.720
 Count of Sour Lemon wanted his son 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.700
 dancing while the clone of the count 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.070
 Sour lemon wanted him to sleep 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.260
 before the lemon count sour 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.420
 Retake your son the clone of 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.460
 sour lemon count is choosing hats 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.130
 small for your child and you see that there 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.350
 one similar to the one of end when the count 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.450
 sour lemon was eating the clone 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.570
 of the count sour lemon he was screaming the end 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.750
 may in what the end means my final 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:50.180
 the insects that were in the house of 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.020
 Mr. Fox were negotiating for 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.660
 buy the house on the left 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:59.890
 it seems that Mr. Fox knows bread 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.350
 of cinnamon since yesterday was all the 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.660

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.470
 a magazine with a woman on the cover 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:11.680
 since jr says is 30 years old 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.260
 currently when tim is going to receive the 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.680
 time machine you can hear the 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.239
 music of the title letter where 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.220
 when the ice king shows his 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.920

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.750
 which looks like a parody of barney and the 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.330
 abc dinosaur is a chain 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.460

 birds takes the cube cube but 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.140

 there comes his name all the actors 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.250
 from the film of the frozen king appear 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.440
