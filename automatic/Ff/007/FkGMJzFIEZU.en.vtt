00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.920
 This presentation is made for 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.840
 help you better understand your mechanism 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.689
 of natural defense against threats 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.910
 for health then let's talk about the 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.710
 immune system system 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.650
 immunological is what protects you from 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.809
 diseases is our first line of 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.519
 defense against diseases and their 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.770
 role is to go after the invaders that 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:45.900
 constantly attack our organism 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.270
 to protect the system better 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.580
 immune must recognize the threats 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.460
 respond to them and remember them if 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.530
 they attack us again what interests us 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.220
 is that our immune system is 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.010
 smart strong and balanced so 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.540
 let's see how it works and since it's common 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.140
 let's use the virus of the 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.420
 chickenpox little Juan is a child 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.100
 happy but someone in the nursery that 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.260
 has the chickenpox virus sneeze 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.060
 and in a few days the little Juan 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.550
 begins to have red spots that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.310
 they turn into blisters Juan contracted the 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.440
 varicella immune system dejuan 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.540
 he has never seen the chickenpox virus and 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.270
 I did not know what it was that made him feel 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.220
 so bad after several days the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.170
 Juan's immune system identifies 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.600
 the chickenpox virus and it starts to 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.580
 produce defenses to defeat him but 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.590
 for several days Juan was quite 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.750
 sick of the blisters were formed 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.670
 crust the coasts then disappeared 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.790
 and juanse got better but it was a great 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.790
 battle 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.579
 once the immune system 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.469
 recognizes and defeats the enemy has the 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.869
 ability to store the identity of the 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:55.450
 invader creating what is called a cell 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.310
 of memory that's the reason why 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.060
 the people who had chickenpox only 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.060
 they have it once 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.230
 a memory cell is like a warning 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.090
 of you are looking for the memory cell will carry 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.880
 forever the identity of the virus of 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.700
 chickenpox throughout your body if the 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.520
 Varicella virus appears again 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.110
 the memory cells immediately 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.090
 will turn on the alarm and start a 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.490
 immediate and intense production of 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.090
 defenses of the immune system of 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:28.030
 This way you will not get sick even 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.790
 you will know that you were exposed because 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.730
 now you have immunity is not that 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.220
 wonderful immunity immunity 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.510
 means that you have protection but the 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.430
 problem with the development of the 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.200
 immunity in this way is that first 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.060
 You must get sick like little Juan 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.830
 before feeling good 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.349
 the second way to develop 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.209
 immunity is through a vaccine like this 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.550
 it's how a vaccine works again 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.010
 using as an example the virus of the 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.200
 chickenpox 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.239
 It weakens the chickenpox virus 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.760
 so that it can not reproduce and cause 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.230
 damage still has the same appearance 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.230
 but it can not cause illness 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.150
 a person is vaccinated with a virus 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.160
 harmless chickenpox the system 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.080
 immune thinks he has been attacked 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.880
 for the true and harmful virus and 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.770
 develops defenses to combat 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.850
 supposed threat thinks that really 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.850
 you had chickenpox 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.019
 the immune system develops 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.140
 memory cells because if a virus 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.510
 harmful chickenpox enters the body 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.640
 you can recognize it immediately and have 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.840
 an intense immune response for 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.129
 Do not get sick 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.439
 he has developed that 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.960
 wonderful world of immunity this 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.760
 is the way a vaccine works 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.980
 however the problem is that there 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.930
 many microbes virus bacteria 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.600
 parasites and fungi and there are not many 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.210
 vaccinations 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.260
 then let's review a moment as we have 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.560
 developed immunity 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.200
 we can develop immunity and so 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.519
 both protection having a disease 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.170
 like chicken pox with which finally 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.870
 we discover the identity of the invader and 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.879
 we keep a memory cell that we 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.840
 protects against exposure in a 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.150
 future 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.100
 we can also receive a vaccine that 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.090
 basically cheats our system 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.959
 immune responding and therefore 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.820
 reproducing those memory cells 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.080
 that recognize a particular threat 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:30.810
 and they give us protection or immunity and even 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.490
 recently these were the only two 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.199
 ways that could assure you that 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.620
 you were protected against diseases 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:39.930
 invasive now there is a third way and 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.669
 you should know it would not be wonderful if 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.100
 we had a factory where we can 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.930
 play memory cells ie 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.820
 the same cell type as our 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.040
 immune system produces after 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.470
 suffer from a disease such as chickenpox 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.300
 or after receiving a vaccine it would not be 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.490
 wonderful to have machines in that 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.080
 memory cell factory and that the 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.310
 we could consume to educate and 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.060
 strengthen our systems 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.060
 immunological 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:10.189
 We also have said multiple factory 

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:12.860
 factories that are on farms and 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:15.620
 these machines are birds and the cow and 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.690
 hen enriches 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.169
 and you should know how they can help 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.169
 protect us 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.760
 cows and chickens have contact 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.070
 with exactly the same threats and 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.710
 microbes that we and have 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.950
 exactly the same type of response to 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.010
 those threats 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.990
 are exposed they resolve how to fight 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.730
 against the enemy and produce a 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.060
 immune response of it 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.190
 way that we also memorize in 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.840
 those threats in specific cells of 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:51.240
 Memory like we do 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.310
 the cows transfer their cells 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.560
 their newborns memory when 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:59.550
 they feed with a special milk called 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:02.669
 Colostrum like humans the 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.590
 chickens also do the same 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.690
 deposit memory cells in the bud 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.729
 of the eggs so that the newborn 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.160
 have the education and the strength of 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:13.940
 immune system that the mother had 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.940
 when I in cube 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:19.070
 and those memory cells that cows 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.930
 and the hens produce they have the same 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.210
 function memory cells that 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.070
 the humans we produce recognize 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.430
 instantaneously the threats and 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.530
 they respond immediately 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.380
 and those memory cells are called 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.820
 transfer factors the cells of 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.120
 memory are called factors of 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.120
 transfer 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:41.500
 and those ads are looking for those cells 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.560
 of memory are called factors of 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.780
 transfer and we have learned how 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.270
 get those memory cells those 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.640
 transfer factors we get them 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.050
 of colostrum and egg yolk to 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.340
 through a special process of 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.790
 filtration 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:01.860
 then we put them in a capsule so 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.860
 that we can consume them daily 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.580
 We can consume cells 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.980
 recognition or factors of 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.540
 transfer so we can educate and 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.930
 strengthen our immune system 

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:14.850
 that system that protects us therefore 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.620
 now we do not have to go through the 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.120
 learning process every time 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.430
 we are exposed to a disease 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.770
 our immune system has the 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:24.420
 strength the knowledge has the 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.400
 ability to respond thanks to 

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.960
 factors of transfer factors 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.580
 transfer or memory cells 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.260
 that educate our system 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.150
 immune and they train it for 

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.040
 answer immediately can 

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.510
 recognize threats through those 

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.889
 memory cells that act as 

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:40.749
 seeks notices 

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:42.789
 if we are exposed to a disease 

00:07:40.749 --> 00:07:45.099
 these memory cells gives us the 

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:46.719
 ability to respond immediately from 

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:48.879
 intense way and we do not have to 

00:07:46.719 --> 00:07:50.770
 get sick like little Juan and we can 

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:51.729
 receive the same protection as if 

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.610
 we would have received a vaccine 

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:55.960
 producing transfer factors 

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:57.580
 cell transfer factors 

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.560
 memory that give us the ability to 

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:03.300
 respond immediately to threats 

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.300
 and have a long and healthy life
