how important this is I have learnt the

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.170 
how important this is I have learnt the
hard<00:00:39.660> way<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.350> going<00:00:41.280> out<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> Sun<00:00:41.910> is

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
hard way that going out in the Sun is

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.450 
hard way that going out in the Sun is
not<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.630> way<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.780> make<00:00:43.079> bad<00:00:43.469> skin<00:00:43.829> better<00:00:44.070> and

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
not the way to make bad skin better and

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.580 
not the way to make bad skin better and
I<00:00:45.180> used<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.510> think<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:45.989> went<00:00:46.079> out<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.469> the

I used to think if you went out in the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.860 
I used to think if you went out in the
Sun<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.370> dry<00:00:48.059> up<00:00:48.180> your<00:00:48.210> spots<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.100> obviously

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
Sun you dry up your spots and obviously

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.110 
Sun you dry up your spots and obviously
everything<00:00:51.870> be<00:00:52.170> hidden<00:00:52.469> by<00:00:52.710> by<00:00:53.399> your<00:00:53.550> tan<00:00:53.760> but

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
everything be hidden by by your tan but

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.779 
everything be hidden by by your tan but
that's<00:00:54.570> not<00:00:54.660> true<00:00:54.960> all<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.950> does<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.160> make<00:00:56.430> any

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
that's not true all it does is make any

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.520 
that's not true all it does is make any
pigmentation<00:00:57.480> you've<00:00:57.600> got<00:00:57.809> worse<00:00:58.110> it<00:00:58.440> makes

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
pigmentation you've got worse it makes

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.979
