on<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.460> panic<00:01:45.000> when<00:01:45.619> because<00:01:46.619> I

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
on that so like I panic when because I

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.260 
on that so like I panic when because I
always<00:01:46.920> think<00:01:47.159> i'm<00:01:47.369> at<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.670> disadvantage

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
always think i'm at the disadvantage

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.700 
always think i'm at the disadvantage
it's<00:01:48.420> like<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.600> stuff<00:01:48.840> I've<00:01:48.990> been<00:01:49.170> graded<00:01:49.560> into

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
it's like I stuff I've been graded into

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.139 
it's like I stuff I've been graded into
my<00:01:49.829> memory<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.399> always<00:01:50.640> think<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:51.000> you're

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
my memory to always think that you're

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.389 
my memory to always think that you're
always<00:01:51.360> down<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.560> never<00:01:52.740> assume<00:01:52.979> you're

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
always down and to never assume you're

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.010 
always down and to never assume you're
going<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.579> win<00:01:53.790> because<00:01:54.000> I've<00:01:54.479> assumed<00:01:54.810> I'm

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
going to win because I've assumed I'm

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.260 
going to win because I've assumed I'm
going<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.259> win<00:01:55.380> too<00:01:55.560> many<00:01:55.740> times<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.369> it

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
going to win too many times and it

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.969 
going to win too many times and it
doesn't<00:01:57.659> work<00:01:57.750> out<00:01:57.930> like<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.680> mean

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
doesn't work out like that so I mean

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.240 
doesn't work out like that so I mean
just<00:01:59.820> trying<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.479> always<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.439> kind<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.860> put<00:02:02.130> it

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
just trying to always I kind of put it

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.700 
just trying to always I kind of put it
too<00:02:02.460> much<00:02:02.610> into<00:02:02.969> my<00:02:03.119> head<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:04.049> almost<00:02:04.290> a

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
too much into my head that I almost a

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.319 
too much into my head that I almost a
disadvantage<00:02:05.219> in<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.759> kind<00:02:06.270> of

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
disadvantage in that I kind of

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.270 
disadvantage in that I kind of
second-guessing<00:02:06.840> my<00:02:07.140> skills<00:02:07.439> now<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:07.950> mean

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
second-guessing my skills now so I mean

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.010 
second-guessing my skills now so I mean
you<00:02:08.970> have<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.149> have<00:02:09.270> some<00:02:09.420> confidence<00:02:09.629> in

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
you have to have some confidence in

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.360 
you have to have some confidence in
yourself<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.500> can't<00:02:10.709> always<00:02:10.890> assume<00:02:11.160> that

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
yourself you can't always assume that

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.610 
yourself you can't always assume that
you're<00:02:11.760> going<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.060> lose<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.959> way<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.140> have<00:02:13.440> been

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
you're going to lose the way I have been

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.870 
you're going to lose the way I have been

obviously<00:03:08.030> is<00:03:08.390> like<00:03:08.570> you<00:03:08.870> you<00:03:09.230> get<00:03:09.350> killed

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
obviously is like you you get killed

obviously is like you you get killed
pretty<00:03:09.890> fast<00:03:10.160> we'll<00:03:10.970> know<00:03:11.630> i<00:03:11.660> should<00:03:11.960> say<00:03:12.140> the

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
pretty fast we'll know i should say the

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.470 
pretty fast we'll know i should say the
wing<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:12.710> phrases<00:03:13.040> accurate<00:03:13.940> bullets<00:03:14.270> are

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
wing and phrases accurate bullets are

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.930 
wing and phrases accurate bullets are
more<00:03:14.990> effective<00:03:15.800> than<00:03:16.010> like<00:03:16.280> a<00:03:16.310> spammable

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
more effective than like a spammable

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.580 
more effective than like a spammable
it's<00:03:17.240> essentially<00:03:17.810> it<00:03:17.930> looks<00:03:18.140> it<00:03:18.290> up<00:03:18.410> when

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
it's essentially it looks it up when

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.700 
it's essentially it looks it up when
you're<00:03:18.710> using<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:19.070> p90<00:03:19.540> obviously<00:03:20.710> but

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
you're using the p90 obviously but

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.220 
you're using the p90 obviously but
having<00:03:22.250> accurate<00:03:22.490> bullets<00:03:23.030> is<00:03:23.240> a<00:03:23.750> lot<00:03:24.050> better

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
having accurate bullets is a lot better

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.140 
having accurate bullets is a lot better
than<00:03:24.560> like<00:03:24.770> spraying<00:03:25.160> bullets<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:25.760> trying<00:03:26.060> to

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
than like spraying bullets and trying to

counter-strike go it it gives you a
better<00:04:14.990> idea<00:04:15.080> of<00:04:15.440> how<00:04:15.590> to<00:04:15.650> place<00:04:15.950> yourself

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
better idea of how to place yourself

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.800 
better idea of how to place yourself
like<00:04:16.549> where<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:16.910> different<00:04:17.239> groups<00:04:17.420> people

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
like where the different groups people

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.750 
like where the different groups people
can<00:04:17.989> take<00:04:18.170> into<00:04:18.799> a<00:04:18.830> bump<00:04:19.100> side<00:04:19.340> where<00:04:19.609> the

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
can take into a bump side where the

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.490 
can take into a bump side where the
different<00:04:20.060> ways<00:04:20.209> that<00:04:20.510> people<00:04:20.989> can<00:04:21.170> cover

different ways that people can cover

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.920 
different ways that people can cover
those<00:04:21.709> roots<00:04:22.070> in<00:04:22.310> where<00:04:22.610> are<00:04:22.790> different<00:04:23.780> ways

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
those roots in where are different ways

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.100 
those roots in where are different ways
people<00:04:24.050> set<00:04:24.530> up<00:04:24.710> in<00:04:25.010> how<00:04:25.640> to

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
people set up in how to

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.629 
people set up in how to
just<00:04:27.349> kind<00:04:27.500> of<00:04:27.530> position<00:04:27.949> themselves<00:04:28.159> better

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
just kind of position themselves better

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.969 
just kind of position themselves better
so<00:04:28.849> that<00:04:28.939> you<00:04:29.150> have<00:04:29.300> a<00:04:29.330> way<00:04:29.569> to<00:04:29.629> fall<00:04:29.960> back<00:04:30.169> not

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
so that you have a way to fall back not

because aggressive well aggressive
playing<00:04:42.139> is<00:04:42.379> good<00:04:42.830> at<00:04:43.009> times<00:04:43.250> it's<00:04:43.550> fair<00:04:43.759> to

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
playing is good at times it's fair to

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:45.490 
playing is good at times it's fair to
play<00:04:44.120> more<00:04:44.300> passive<00:04:44.810> it's<00:04:45.020> better<00:04:45.259> to<00:04:45.379> let

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
play more passive it's better to let

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.129 
play more passive it's better to let
people<00:04:45.830> come<00:04:46.009> to<00:04:46.039> you<00:04:46.250> and<00:04:46.699> just<00:04:47.080> try<00:04:48.080> and

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
people come to you and just try and

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.439 
people come to you and just try and
stack<00:04:49.099> the<00:04:49.280> odds<00:04:49.310> in<00:04:49.520> your<00:04:49.580> favor<00:04:49.849> in<00:04:50.030> terms<00:04:50.240> of

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
stack the odds in your favor in terms of

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:53.529 
stack the odds in your favor in terms of
players<00:04:51.259> so<00:04:52.159> if<00:04:52.580> you<00:04:52.699> get<00:04:52.819> a<00:04:52.879> pick<00:04:53.090> off<00:04:53.210> the<00:04:53.389> bat

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
players so if you get a pick off the bat

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:55.689 
players so if you get a pick off the bat
you're<00:04:53.930> automatically<00:04:54.530> at<00:04:54.680> a<00:04:54.710> 10<00:04:55.340> a<00:04:55.580> 10

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
you're automatically at a 10 a 10

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.769 
you're automatically at a 10 a 10
advantage<00:04:56.539> because<00:04:57.500> people<00:04:58.490> are<00:04:58.849> not<00:04:59.629> sure

00:04:59.769 --> 00:04:59.779 
advantage because people are not sure

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:02.559 
advantage because people are not sure
where<00:04:59.930> you're<00:04:59.990> coming<00:05:00.259> from<00:05:00.289> or<00:05:00.650> not<00:05:01.240> no<00:05:02.240> not

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:02.569 
where you're coming from or not no not

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.409 
where you're coming from or not no not
that<00:05:02.840> that<00:05:03.289> you<00:05:03.650> have<00:05:03.830> more<00:05:04.099> people<00:05:04.310> than<00:05:05.180> they

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
that that you have more people than they

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.570 
that that you have more people than they
are<00:05:05.569> so<00:05:05.779> you<00:05:05.900> can<00:05:06.139> stack<00:05:06.560> positions<00:05:07.340> better

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
are so you can stack positions better

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.890 
are so you can stack positions better
and<00:05:07.759> stuff<00:05:07.939> like<00:05:08.090> that<00:05:08.150> so<00:05:08.360> I<00:05:08.539> mean<00:05:08.750> it's<00:05:08.870> just

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
and stuff like that so I mean it's just
