00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
there are some variations on this one

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.639 
there are some variations on this one
and<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.149> first<00:00:57.329> one<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.199> can<00:00:58.379> try

and the first one is that you can try

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.920 
and the first one is that you can try
different<00:00:58.890> angles<00:00:59.609> so<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.879> can<00:01:00.300> place<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
different angles so you can place the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.070 
different angles so you can place the
rest<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.410> your<00:01:01.649> body<00:01:02.039> under<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.300> inner<00:01:03.660> side

rest of your body under the inner side

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.130 
rest of your body under the inner side
or<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.530> other<00:01:04.799> side<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.640> your<00:01:06.240> front<00:01:06.810> leg

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
or on the other side of your front leg

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.140 
or on the other side of your front leg
and<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.799> will<00:01:08.010> help<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.490> stretch<00:01:08.850> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
and this will help you to stretch the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.090 
and this will help you to stretch the
leg<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.080> back<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.500> different

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
leg that is in the back in different

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.649 
leg that is in the back in different
angles<00:01:11.280> which<00:01:11.970> will<00:01:12.180> increase<00:01:12.570> your

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
angles which will increase your

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.499 
angles which will increase your
flexibility<00:01:13.549> when<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.580> are<00:01:14.790> doing<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.270> regular

flexibility when you are doing a regular

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.539 
flexibility when you are doing a regular
step<00:01:16.110> out<00:01:16.290> then<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:16.710> important<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.280> you

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
step out then it's important that you

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.020 
step out then it's important that you
keep<00:01:17.759> your<00:01:17.909> body<00:01:18.320> neutral<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:20.030> preferably

straight and also that you push your

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.760 
straight and also that you push your
hips<00:01:23.850> forward<00:01:24.000> when<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.930> are<00:01:25.049> trying<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.560> do

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
hips forward when you are trying to do

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.670 
hips forward when you are trying to do
this<00:01:25.950> exercise<00:01:26.509> so<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.720> next<00:01:27.900> variation<00:01:28.560> is

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
this exercise so the next variation is

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.920 
this exercise so the next variation is
the<00:01:28.890> elevated<00:01:29.460> step<00:01:29.909> out<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.509> course<00:01:30.540> this

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
the elevated step out and of course this

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.230 
the elevated step out and of course this
is<00:01:31.140> by<00:01:31.320> putting<00:01:31.619> your<00:01:31.799> front<00:01:32.340> leg<00:01:32.610> on<00:01:32.909> an

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
is by putting your front leg on an

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.690 
is by putting your front leg on an
elevated<00:01:33.689> object<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.530> for<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.460> use<00:01:35.670> a

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
elevated object and for this I use a

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.149 
elevated object and for this I use a
bench<00:01:36.030> which<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.450> pretty<00:01:36.990> low<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.009> can

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
bench which is pretty low so you can

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.550 
bench which is pretty low so you can
also<00:01:38.310> use<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> chair<00:01:39.090> but<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:39.990> you're<00:01:40.259> more

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
also use a chair but if you're more

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.649 
also use a chair but if you're more
advanced<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.040> might<00:01:41.369> want<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.729> use<00:01:42.000> something

names<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.810> gave<00:01:52.079> these<00:01:52.320> exercises<00:01:53.130> are

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
names that I gave these exercises are

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.069 
names that I gave these exercises are
completely<00:01:53.880> made<00:01:54.090> up<00:01:54.270> because<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.869> pretty

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
completely made up because it's pretty

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.440 
completely made up because it's pretty
difficult<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.740> find<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.310> actual<00:01:56.850> names<00:01:57.119> for

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
difficult to find the actual names for

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.660 
difficult to find the actual names for
some<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.840> these<00:01:57.990> stretches<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.340> next

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
some of these stretches the next

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.450 
some of these stretches the next
exercise<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.780> lion<00:02:01.079> knee<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.799> chest<00:02:02.130> and

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
exercise is the lion knee to chest and

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.510 
exercise is the lion knee to chest and
this<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.210> also<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.930> very<00:02:04.290> familiar<00:02:04.890> exercise

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
this is also a very familiar exercise

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.219 
this is also a very familiar exercise
and<00:02:05.759> what<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.000> will<00:02:06.149> do<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.450> basically<00:02:06.689> lay

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
and what you will do is basically lay

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.740 
and what you will do is basically lay
down<00:02:07.259> on<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.770> floor<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.340> wrap<00:02:08.910> one<00:02:09.270> knee<00:02:09.509> and

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
down on the floor and wrap one knee and

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.140 
down on the floor and wrap one knee and
then<00:02:10.110> pull<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.500> towards<00:02:10.920> your<00:02:11.099> chest

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
then pull it towards your chest

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.940 
then pull it towards your chest
of<00:02:12.209> course<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.629> have<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.959> make<00:02:13.110> sure<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.409> you

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
of course you have to make sure that you

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.030 
of course you have to make sure that you
hold<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.610> stretch<00:02:15.209> for<00:02:15.540> an<00:02:16.019> equal<00:02:16.500> amount<00:02:16.890> of

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
hold the stretch for an equal amount of

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.960 
hold the stretch for an equal amount of
time<00:02:17.099> for<00:02:17.819> both<00:02:17.849> sides<00:02:19.099> next<00:02:20.099> one<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.640> the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
time for both sides next one is the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.449 
time for both sides next one is the
lighting<00:02:21.450> need<00:02:21.689> to<00:02:21.959> side<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:22.769> is<00:02:22.950> kind<00:02:23.280> of

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
lighting need to side so this is kind of

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.850 
lighting need to side so this is kind of
the<00:02:23.730> knee<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.510> chest<00:02:24.780> but<00:02:25.079> this<00:02:25.260> time<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.709> will

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
the knee to chest but this time you will

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.429 
the knee to chest but this time you will
turn<00:02:26.189> it<00:02:26.370> away<00:02:27.120> from<00:02:27.450> your<00:02:27.659> body<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.200> this

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
turn it away from your body and this

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.319 
turn it away from your body and this
will<00:02:28.620> also<00:02:28.709> help<00:02:29.129> you<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.519> increase<00:02:29.790> your

will also help you to increase your

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.589 
will also help you to increase your
flexibility<00:02:31.170> of<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.709> hips<00:02:32.209> next<00:02:33.209> up<00:02:33.359> is<00:02:33.569> a

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
flexibility of the hips next up is a

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.530 
flexibility of the hips next up is a
pretty<00:02:33.959> advanced<00:02:34.530> exercise<00:02:35.189> which<00:02:35.640> involves

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
pretty advanced exercise which involves

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.380 
pretty advanced exercise which involves
lying<00:02:36.959> on<00:02:37.349> your<00:02:37.680> leg<00:02:38.010> please<00:02:38.519> note<00:02:38.909> that<00:02:38.939> in

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
lying on your leg please note that in

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.449 
lying on your leg please note that in
most<00:02:39.599> of<00:02:39.870> these<00:02:40.019> clips<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.799> will<00:02:40.980> see<00:02:41.280> me

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
most of these clips you will see me

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.460 
most of these clips you will see me
performing<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.150> exercise<00:02:42.629> in<00:02:43.019> a<00:02:43.140> way<00:02:43.290> that

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
performing the exercise in a way that

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.710 
performing the exercise in a way that
you<00:02:43.620> might<00:02:43.799> not<00:02:44.069> be<00:02:44.280> able<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.700> do<00:02:44.879> yet<00:02:45.180> because

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
you might not be able to do yet because

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.990 
you might not be able to do yet because
it<00:02:46.019> requires<00:02:46.590> quite<00:02:46.920> some<00:02:47.220> flexibility

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
it requires quite some flexibility

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.390 
it requires quite some flexibility
already<00:02:48.659> to<00:02:49.019> hold<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.590> position<00:02:49.769> that<00:02:50.280> I

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
already to hold the position that I

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.000 
already to hold the position that I
demonstrate<00:02:51.120> in<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.450> clips<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.620> should

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
demonstrate in the clips so you should

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.160 
demonstrate in the clips so you should
just<00:02:53.280> try<00:02:53.639> to<00:02:53.700> go<00:02:53.940> as<00:02:54.090> far<00:02:54.299> as<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.629> can<00:02:54.840> without

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
just try to go as far as you can without

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.759 
just try to go as far as you can without
having<00:02:56.040> any<00:02:56.280> pain<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:57.019> when<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.139> exercise<00:02:58.590> is

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
having any pain and when the exercise is

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.470 
having any pain and when the exercise is
too<00:02:58.950> difficult<00:02:59.430> for<00:02:59.489> you<00:02:59.730> you<00:02:59.760> can<00:03:00.180> try<00:03:00.420> to

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
too difficult for you you can try to

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.530 
too difficult for you you can try to
modify<00:03:01.079> it<00:03:01.139> by<00:03:01.500> not<00:03:02.040> going<00:03:02.519> down<00:03:02.670> as<00:03:02.730> far<00:03:03.269> or

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
modify it by not going down as far or

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.309 
modify it by not going down as far or
not<00:03:03.930> stretching<00:03:04.620> as<00:03:04.829> far<00:03:04.889> as<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.609> do<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.870> final

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
not stretching as far as I do the final

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.979 
not stretching as far as I do the final
exercise<00:03:07.439> is<00:03:08.189> what<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.459> call<00:03:08.849> the<00:03:09.060> Frog<00:03:09.420> stretch

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
exercise is what I call the Frog stretch

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.530 
exercise is what I call the Frog stretch
finally<00:03:10.769> I<00:03:10.799> want<00:03:11.129> to<00:03:11.189> tell<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:11.639> that<00:03:11.879> hips<00:03:12.269> are

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
finally I want to tell you that hips are

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.530 
finally I want to tell you that hips are
supposed<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.439> stabilize<00:03:14.129> your<00:03:14.340> body<00:03:14.609> and<00:03:15.090> in

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
supposed to stabilize your body and in

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.750 
supposed to stabilize your body and in
contrary<00:03:16.319> to<00:03:16.530> your<00:03:16.889> shoulders<00:03:17.370> they<00:03:17.579> are

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
contrary to your shoulders they are

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.689 
contrary to your shoulders they are
pretty<00:03:18.120> inflexible<00:03:18.629> to<00:03:19.199> start<00:03:19.560> with<00:03:19.859> so<00:03:20.430> it

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:20.699 
pretty inflexible to start with so it

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.699 
pretty inflexible to start with so it
will<00:03:20.849> probably<00:03:21.180> take<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.720> long<00:03:21.959> time<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.530> see

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
will probably take a long time to see

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.280 
will probably take a long time to see
some<00:03:23.010> really<00:03:23.220> good<00:03:23.549> progress<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.449> you<00:03:25.139> will

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
some really good progress and you will

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.920 
some really good progress and you will
not<00:03:25.500> speed<00:03:25.949> up<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.280> progress<00:03:26.579> by<00:03:27.150> stretching

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
not speed up the progress by stretching

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.819 
not speed up the progress by stretching
further<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.530> then<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.769> actually<00:03:28.949> can<00:03:29.310> manage

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
further and then you actually can manage

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.939 
further and then you actually can manage
so<00:03:31.829> tell<00:03:32.069> me<00:03:32.099> cats<00:03:32.699> or<00:03:33.060> dogs<00:03:33.680> subscribe<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.829> my
