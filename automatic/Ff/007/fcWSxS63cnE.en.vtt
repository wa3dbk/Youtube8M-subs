00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:03.799
 'crazy about the outbreak of e by then several delegations 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.550
 pto 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.550
 6 there is an injury 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.270
 many are the rpg that have been coming the different platforms in the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.350
 last weeks 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.720
 either before losing the most classic and tactical court time by 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.490
 example 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.930
 and among all of them there is a product that combines two genres in one 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.150
 unusual combination and curious approach 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.100
 we talk about kimbiri moar 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.890
 developed by bani the uif creators of disgaea hello puche he for example 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.160
 he poses them a game that he drinks mainly from the counts of 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.800
 Strategy games 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.110
 presenting them to the main protagonists almost from the beginning 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.180
 this proposal does not put a magic school a goal and sorcery 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.870
 and we will have to learn different enchantments to affect the 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.150
 enemies and want to end with expulsion and annihilate the magical creatures 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.880
 perhaps in its plot base it may resemble what young Egypt lives 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.560
 but it is far from each other 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.610
 tusquets 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.730
 current to me yes I also 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.350
 said this implies roof 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.150
 He stressed that this 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.530
 which initially they would have to act 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.800
 drenthe who this one 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.490
 the taxi driver 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.530
 happened we will see the role of the interior a young apprentice who will receive classes 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.200
 teachers say 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.390
 to learn the different techniques offered by the four types of 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.490
 training 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.739
 Necromancy Clamor Sorcery and Alchemy 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.900
 we will learn them from the different magical books in the first missions 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.519
 and how much authorial we will learn to perform them as well as use the inter 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.519
 very intuitive country very easy execution 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:25.279
 in kimbiri ward we will have to select a character to several or 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:29.459
 a dior group of restoration that may well be 15 to a place 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.099
 concrete of the stage recover your life bar thanks to the crystals 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.469
 week multiply our go foucher against the demons 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.149
 and all with the philosophy of choosing and using a goal 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:43.229
 very simple and direct 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:47.159
 the scenarios where battles take place are limited and we can only 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.059
 move slightly to any direction 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:52.419
 in order to see the screen completely 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:56.309
 before each combat or practice we have our choice in which they are 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:59.859
 protagonists the dialogues in text format and abounding in game 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.959
 some of them will also refer to talks between students and 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.689
 Busts between the sexes 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:10.040
 under a two-dimensional perspective the Israeli characters are presented 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.309
 the biggest colorful some wounded school spaces 

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:15.869
 giving them a good visual contrast 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:18.909
 in the dialogues we can tighten the characteristic design of the 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:20.119
 characters 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:23.439
 well fine warren 6 steels mtg usual thanks 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:27.599
 its temper and its interference and its possibilities of game 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:29.969
 and quite recommendable
