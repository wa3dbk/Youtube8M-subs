00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.810
 and Hello to you as always and I Lech 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:10.139
 take all he will speak quietly because 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:15.080
 that night I wrote down at night decided 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:21.660
 remove the ozone guide when you immediately craft 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:23.869
 it's called nuclear control and I 'll show you 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:30.260
 you torment and on a nuclear reactor for 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:33.030
 begin we will do just such a thing 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.600
 industrial formal it fell as if 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.570
 called process central without it 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:47.250
 nothing at all nowhere but how did 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:50.489
 it will be easy to put it all oh this is like 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.949
 cpu then we need 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:58.079
 Now it is generally easy to go as it were 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:02.160
 if we just put them so see 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.619
 Here the boundaries and here is the extreme information 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.400
 panel then here 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:11.189
 Well, so the side appears such kranchik 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:17.939
 so that it works let's get away 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:22.170
 put it to work we need it 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:25.890
 will have to power it like that 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:31.290
 take and cpu became here 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:34.700
 so the lever so now we take this here 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.700
 repair center kit 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.610
 poke right on our nuclear 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.210
 reactor 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:53.619
 there is such a thing coordinates 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:56.659
 the reactor is the most here so its what we see 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.990
 heat but how much does it beat the reactor 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.210
 maximum heat of 10,000 per grade 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.610
 Taurus What is a weekend 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.310
 energy is how much time is left 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.800
 I worked there a full cycle 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.550
 so a little 2 hours and 45 minutes left 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:18.739
 20 seconds let's turn on non-nuclear 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:25.670
 the reactor here is included here is the output 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:27.340
 power 230 all let's check how 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:37.880
 where are we 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:42.019
 sensor sensor now so now 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:57.709
 wait can't find him his fortress 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:03:01.280
 but check 10:30 and now we and I 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:06.200
 I forgot to show just to the brandy 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.780
 can be painted a cheap thermometer here 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:15.230
 this is frequency trans mister and 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:18.200
 usually there is nothing difficult and now 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.019
 we need from this thing this thing 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.329
 crafting out 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:27.609
 filter detector 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:33.230
 fries or quincy trance mr and paper 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:36.890
 and poke and take the right button on our from 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:41.349
 we have such signs of energy 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:51.959
 sense allocation cards removable here 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:54.549
 and what we see energy so now we remove 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.280
 matter generator see that energy 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.739
 arrives 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.099
 free maximum percentage in 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.109
 legality is how many percent are we 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:12.250
 supplemented here can even walk here 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:13.889
 see and the further yours will be yours 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.440
 panel this 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:19.840
 Well, how to say shorter if you have it 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.759
 far in regards to correct these here this 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.070
 Here is an update Well, it increases 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:30.580
 range 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:32.650
 she asked so that is if we have 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.289
 the vector will be very far from home on 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.120
 table at the hotel reactor that is, we 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:43.419
 let's go to the dashboard mind 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:49.360
 leave we can brighten up this concrete 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:53.229
 Well, this is this is our color 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:57.039
 characters, for example, we have wells like this 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:05:03.570
 button and open it is easy to see how 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:06.669
 craft as a form so not this all 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:11.710
 our beauty is easy and simple everything 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:12.400
 wire dyes are all more than kind 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.169
 letters t 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:22.840
 look here is this background background on this color 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:27.090
 Well, who will be so beautiful and not 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.300
 we know them somehow I did n't care 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:33.729
 is always 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:40.150
 as it was, well, who needs that 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:44.580
 let changing beautiful there okay and here 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:49.120
 my nuclear reactor he 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:51.370
 they treat me here but he 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:56.170
 worked out 230 per digit on 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.950
 and he in the world butting for a full cycle 52 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.210
 million 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:06.820
 energy and in doing so none of these 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:08.310
 cooling components well before not 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.840
 burn out 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:14.010
 they are all a station that is a fad we 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.770
 working put uranium rods again and 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:20.530
 nothing not to craft crafting is not necessary 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:26.760
 just early serge put her to the attack 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:32.220
 Here we have already developed 700 thousand for 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:34.210
 how many are we here well a minute to 5 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.610
 see how fast the energy is 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:39.570
 accumulates 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:42.700
 effective nuclear reactor so 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:46.890
 like a video subscribe 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.890
 to the channel everyone thanks everyone bye
