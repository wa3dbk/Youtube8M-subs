00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello friends you are looking at a cropper 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.049
 channel with you as always screamer and me 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.320
 I am finally showing you a new weapon 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.179
 Attica is a lightning volley 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.539
 deadly arrows allow you 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:20.010
 perform crossbow optics with auto charge 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.859
 Generally how did this weapon of opinion 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.570
 immediately divided into two sides 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.119
 They say that they do not want complete shit at all 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.369
 know him there are old who say 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.050
 that in principle the gun is cool kayfovaya 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:37.430
 Zdorovskaya here but looking at the damage you can 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.320
 say that she has problems with him and 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.980
 the status is also not high and kreed well in 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.190
 In general, everything is somehow weird 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.530
 the bolt is flying with an arc along the path such 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.039
 not very correct cartridge slow 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.070
 stay 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.070
 generally inferior to attic all well to all 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:03.780
 let's show a couple of builds on it without 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:09.470
 field cancer just with catalyst first 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.470
 build on corrosion like this 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:20.729
 looked aha and so here he beats 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:23.990
 1350 corrosion 484 piercing given 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.090
 the fact that the status of 37 percent 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.850
 good build but i like it more 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.329
 this one on crit, that is, three modules on 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.299
 critical damage and three on normal and 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:39.450
 We look that turns out it turns out 484 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.430
 piercing but at 42 and every second 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.890
 shot 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:48.329
 let me show you it to 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:53.360
 rub the key well and basically everything is there 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.360
 it will be clear well as they say here and i 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.060
 it's not always possible to get there. 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.009
 and because patron as I spoke on 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.509
 slow logic recharge too so you 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:14.120
 see so slow damage too you 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:16.880
 see which flies provided that 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.230
 there are 2 free and 6 years old and a couple 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.500
 Pole and you can stick 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.660
 anything else on elemental 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.610
 any damage or speed 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.610
 recharging either on fast-fire 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.819
 let's get a look 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.650
 you are stupid 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:49.720
 look at yourself add that pretty 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.459
 late 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:03:04.180
 you need to get it straight 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:06.190
 to adapt himself but when military coffee in 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.620
 general i will say so not 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:15.760
 Attica liked the idea that is 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.730
 shooting mechanics almost good little 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:23.019
 the other must be she of course 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:25.409
 I liked it needs this ballet you see 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.409
 the boards 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.410
 ahead you need to shoot with 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.780
 candles which are half mega bad weather on 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.050
 him 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:45.860
 frankly weak and common childhood 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:48.080
 will come out which received damage either strong 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:54.700
 would have thought anything else the weapons would 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.700
 fine well at this stage she is rather weak 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.990
 see advice 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:13.520
 fall and this talent gets 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.520
 we please 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.750
 that is, from males 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.510
 eg 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.340
 have loved ones 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.260
 him accordingly 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.420
 and generally and 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:45.500
 pulpard arms becomes significantly 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:45.500
 see less yourself as a weapon 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.750
 I would like to 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.919
 something is forced to us after the bar already 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.009
 was more powerful 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.819
 as quickly as possible in the store more 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.819
 there would be arrows 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:05.490
 because I know that she is judging a lot 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.490
 liked 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:14.069
 its here these obvious minuses of course 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:17.429
 she is not very popular 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:19.880
 that is, almost no one puts her 

00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:21.470
 polarity 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.230
 no one tries to squeeze out of it 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:27.170
 maximum because initially she herself 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:33.290
 showed bad I think the weapon 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:34.990
 raw honestly I don't even know what 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.000
 say about him at the end 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.570
 I liked the gun and look and 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.860
 I liked the idea 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.170
 execution 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.290
 I hope that the developers are all like that 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:50.660
 I will not sell it either Fixed 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.400
 damage will increase or creed will increase either 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.260
 status or something but something must 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.250
 change because she frankly 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.640
 rather weak 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.350
 with you there was a screamer on the screamer channel 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.910
 channel 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.960
 subscribe be sure to like 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.960
 and bye
