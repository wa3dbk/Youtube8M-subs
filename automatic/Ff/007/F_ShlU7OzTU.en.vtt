said he's got a magnetic cover for this

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.330 
said he's got a magnetic cover for this
ticket<00:02:39.970> this<00:02:40.810> is<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.049> one<00:02:41.170> that's<00:02:41.290> more<00:02:41.889> of<00:02:42.220> a

I got rubber gloves on that there's no
it<00:03:12.180> feels<00:03:12.600> very<00:03:12.990> very<00:03:13.770> smooth<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:15.080> understand

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
it feels very very smooth I understand

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.790 
it feels very very smooth I understand
that<00:03:16.520> although<00:03:17.520> it<00:03:17.970> feels<00:03:18.240> smooth<00:03:18.660> it<00:03:18.930> still

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
that although it feels smooth it still

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:27.380 
that although it feels smooth it still
may<00:03:19.980> require<00:03:20.780> only<00:03:21.780> work<00:03:22.230> but<00:03:23.390> to<00:03:24.390> me<00:03:26.390> it's

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
may require only work but to me it's

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.590 
may require only work but to me it's
really<00:03:29.090> not<00:03:30.090> bad<00:03:30.360> enough<00:03:30.870> for<00:03:31.230> me<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:32.420> not<00:03:33.420> at

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
really not bad enough for me to not at

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.970 
really not bad enough for me to not at
least<00:03:33.630> try<00:03:38.990> to<00:03:39.990> do<00:03:40.140> what<00:03:40.350> I'm<00:03:40.470> doing<00:03:40.500> you<00:03:40.890> know

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.800 

feels<00:04:17.570> very<00:04:17.930> my<00:04:18.200> neat<00:04:18.910> but<00:04:19.910> I<00:04:20.180> mean<00:04:20.480> that's<00:04:20.600> my

but I've got a got a 63 but i just think
this<00:04:32.180> it's<00:04:32.570> just<00:04:32.870> too<00:04:33.020> small<00:04:35.800> let's<00:04:36.800> bring

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
this it's just too small let's bring

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.409 
this it's just too small let's bring
this<00:04:37.130> over<00:04:37.310> here<00:04:37.840> when<00:04:38.840> comparing<00:04:40.330> trying<00:04:41.330> to

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
this over here when comparing trying to

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.240 
this over here when comparing trying to
watch<00:04:41.570> the<00:04:41.750> screen<00:04:42.139> and<00:04:42.470> it's<00:04:42.650> using<00:04:43.160> the

watch the screen and it's using the

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:55.030 
watch the screen and it's using the
iPads<00:04:51.400> that<00:04:52.400> will<00:04:52.550> now<00:04:52.669> be<00:04:53.800> everything<00:04:54.800> the

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
iPads that will now be everything the

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.790 
iPads that will now be everything the
the<00:04:55.550> angle<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.300> way<00:04:56.419> the<00:04:56.600> lip<00:04:56.810> feels<00:04:57.200> up<00:04:57.470> here

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
the angle the way the lip feels up here

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.540 
the angle the way the lip feels up here
in<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:58.640> 63<00:04:59.240> that<00:04:59.720> has<00:04:59.870> been<00:05:00.430> schooling<00:05:01.430> some

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
in the 63 that has been schooling some

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.570 
in the 63 that has been schooling some
focus<00:05:02.500> then<00:05:03.500> untouched<00:05:04.930> and<00:05:05.930> you<00:05:06.080> feel<00:05:06.380> it<00:05:06.590> and

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
focus then untouched and you feel it and

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.450 
focus then untouched and you feel it and
then<00:05:08.060> you<00:05:08.180> go<00:05:08.330> into<00:05:08.660> the<00:05:08.780> 82<00:05:09.260> I<00:05:11.860> just<00:05:12.860> I<00:05:13.130> don't

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
then you go into the 82 I just I don't

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.920 
then you go into the 82 I just I don't
think<00:05:13.789> it's<00:05:13.940> bad<00:05:14.300> enough<00:05:16.390> let's<00:05:17.390> focus<00:05:17.810> around

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
think it's bad enough let's focus around

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.270 
think it's bad enough let's focus around
here

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.910 

I<00:05:22.370> just<00:05:23.180> don't<00:05:23.389> think<00:05:23.660> it's<00:05:23.780> anything<00:05:24.590> that<00:05:24.800> a

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920 
I just don't think it's anything that a

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.210 
I just don't think it's anything that a
good<00:05:27.920> you<00:05:28.340> know<00:05:28.460> sandpaper<00:05:29.000> to<00:05:29.270> above<00:05:30.220> can

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
good you know sandpaper to above can

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.150 
good you know sandpaper to above can
take<00:05:31.430> care<00:05:31.639> of<00:05:31.700> especially<00:05:32.300> in<00:05:32.389> the<00:05:32.510> aluminum

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
take care of especially in the aluminum

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.060 
take care of especially in the aluminum
you<00:05:34.160> know<00:05:34.280> you're<00:05:34.430> taking<00:05:34.610> material<00:05:35.090> away<00:05:35.360> I

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
you know you're taking material away I

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.950 
you know you're taking material away I
just<00:05:37.070> think<00:05:37.220> it's<00:05:37.400> very<00:05:39.010> insignificant

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
just think it's very insignificant

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:48.250 
just think it's very insignificant
compared<00:05:41.960> to<00:05:44.950> finally<00:05:45.950> today<00:05:47.020> so<00:05:48.020> anyway

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
compared to finally today so anyway

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.820 
compared to finally today so anyway
that's<00:05:48.530> my<00:05:49.780> that's<00:05:50.780> my<00:05:50.990> thought<00:05:51.260> I<00:05:51.500> still

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
that's my that's my thought I still

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.460 
that's my that's my thought I still
don't<00:05:52.010> have<00:05:52.070> the<00:05:52.490> shaft<00:05:52.910> that<00:05:53.180> just<00:05:53.419> got<00:05:53.600> that

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
don't have the shaft that just got that

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.070 
don't have the shaft that just got that
