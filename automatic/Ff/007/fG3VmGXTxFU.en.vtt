00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
opinion and this is a

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.770 
opinion and this is a
opinion<00:02:22.460> only<00:02:22.790> there's<00:02:22.970> no<00:02:23.060> facts<00:02:23.450> that<00:02:23.690> will

opinion only there's no facts that will

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.590 
opinion only there's no facts that will
be<00:02:23.930> said<00:02:24.170> at<00:02:24.200> this<00:02:24.440> point<00:02:24.530> but<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.220> will<00:02:26.000> mix<00:02:26.390> in

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
be said at this point but I will mix in

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.360 
be said at this point but I will mix in
some<00:02:26.630> facts<00:02:27.050> to<00:02:27.260> why<00:02:27.410> I<00:02:27.470> believe<00:02:27.860> this<00:02:28.100> but

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
some facts to why I believe this but

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.920 
some facts to why I believe this but
let's<00:02:28.580> go<00:02:28.700> ahead<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:28.970> break<00:02:29.210> it<00:02:29.360> down<00:02:29.480> anyway

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
let's go ahead and break it down anyway

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.120 
let's go ahead and break it down anyway
I<00:02:30.250> believe<00:02:31.250> they<00:02:31.520> are<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:32.000> best<00:02:32.210> of<00:02:32.480> all<00:02:32.630> time

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
I believe they are the best of all time

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.860 
I believe they are the best of all time
especially<00:02:34.130> pass<00:02:34.370> defense<00:02:34.910> but<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.330> think

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
especially pass defense but I think

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.320 
especially pass defense but I think
overall<00:02:36.230> defensively<00:02:36.980> they<00:02:37.280> are<00:02:37.550> number<00:02:38.090> one

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
overall defensively they are number one

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.790 
overall defensively they are number one
and<00:02:39.460> this<00:02:40.460> is<00:02:40.670> my<00:02:40.820> reasons<00:02:41.270> to<00:02:41.390> support<00:02:41.570> it<00:02:42.020> one

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
and this is my reasons to support it one

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.800 
and this is my reasons to support it one
they<00:02:43.490> didn't<00:02:43.730> play<00:02:43.910> with<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.300> same<00:02:44.510> rules

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
they didn't play with the same rules

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.450 
they didn't play with the same rules
that<00:02:44.960> the<00:02:45.140> other<00:02:45.320> guys<00:02:45.530> play<00:02:45.800> with<00:02:45.980> I<00:02:46.100> mean<00:02:46.280> now

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
that the other guys play with I mean now

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.430 
that the other guys play with I mean now
if<00:02:46.610> you<00:02:46.730> breathed<00:02:47.000> on<00:02:47.180> a<00:02:47.210> guy<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:48.170> know<00:02:48.260> they

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
if you breathed on a guy you know they

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.020 
if you breathed on a guy you know they
got<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.800> helmet<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.250> helmet<00:02:49.280> you<00:02:49.820> can't

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
got the helmet to helmet you can't

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.270 
got the helmet to helmet you can't
really<00:02:50.180> hit<00:02:50.420> cubies<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.740> biggest<00:02:52.130> thing

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
really hit cubies and the biggest thing

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.410 
really hit cubies and the biggest thing
is<00:02:52.400> you<00:02:52.490> really<00:02:52.640> can't<00:02:52.940> touch<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.270> wide

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
is you really can't touch the wide

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.910 
is you really can't touch the wide
receivers<00:02:53.870> like<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:54.170> used<00:02:54.320> to<00:02:54.440> be<00:02:54.590> able<00:02:54.650> to

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
receivers like you used to be able to

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.030 
receivers like you used to be able to
that<00:02:55.640> changes<00:02:56.270> everything<00:02:56.960> not<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:57.740> I<00:02:57.800> don't

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
that changes everything not that I don't

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.560 
that changes everything not that I don't
think<00:02:58.280> those<00:02:58.430> other<00:02:58.460> defensive<00:02:59.210> teams<00:02:59.390> could

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
think those other defensive teams could

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.860 
think those other defensive teams could
play<00:02:59.840> and<00:03:00.140> adapt<00:03:00.890> but<00:03:01.640> it<00:03:01.850> makes<00:03:02.330> it<00:03:02.570> a<00:03:02.690> lot

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
play and adapt but it makes it a lot

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.200 
play and adapt but it makes it a lot
different<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:03.590> mean<00:03:03.740> points<00:03:04.040> now<00:03:04.520> compared<00:03:05.120> to

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
different I mean points now compared to

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.420 
different I mean points now compared to
what<00:03:05.360> they<00:03:05.480> used<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:05.840> be<00:03:05.930> is<00:03:06.430> dramatically

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
what they used to be is dramatically

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.240 
what they used to be is dramatically
different<00:03:07.550> and<00:03:08.210> you<00:03:09.170> know<00:03:09.200> cubies<00:03:09.740> are<00:03:09.950> having

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
different and you know cubies are having

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.640 
different and you know cubies are having
more<00:03:10.570> successful<00:03:11.570> numbers<00:03:11.840> due<00:03:12.020> to<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.350> the

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
more successful numbers due to the the

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.740 
more successful numbers due to the the
new<00:03:12.830> rules<00:03:13.070> and<00:03:13.280> things<00:03:13.310> like<00:03:13.610> that<00:03:13.670> so<00:03:13.850> that

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
new rules and things like that so that

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.110 
new rules and things like that so that
alone<00:03:15.110> I<00:03:15.470> think<00:03:16.040> puts<00:03:16.340> them<00:03:16.520> at<00:03:16.700> a<00:03:16.730> big

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
alone I think puts them at a big

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.640 
alone I think puts them at a big
advantage<00:03:17.750> when<00:03:18.050> you're<00:03:18.170> talking<00:03:18.500> about

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
advantage when you're talking about

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.680 
advantage when you're talking about
who's<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:19.010> best<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.400> all<00:03:19.550> time<00:03:19.850> because<00:03:20.600> I

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
who's the best of all time because I

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.430 
who's the best of all time because I
feel<00:03:20.900> like<00:03:21.490> with<00:03:22.490> those<00:03:22.700> rules<00:03:23.320> you<00:03:24.320> know

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
feel like with those rules you know

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.720 
feel like with those rules you know
they've<00:03:24.620> had<00:03:24.830> to<00:03:24.920> overcome<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.400> little<00:03:25.640> bit

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
they've had to overcome a little bit

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.750 
they've had to overcome a little bit
more<00:03:26.320> defensively<00:03:27.320> now<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.100> next<00:03:28.190> thing<00:03:28.580> I

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
more defensively now the next thing I

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.570 
more defensively now the next thing I
want<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:28.970> point<00:03:29.030> out<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:29.980> this<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.250> me<00:03:31.400> is

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
want to point out and this to me is

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.890 
want to point out and this to me is
probably<00:03:31.760> one<00:03:32.060> of<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.180> biggest<00:03:32.360> things<00:03:32.690> is

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
probably one of the biggest things is

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.860 
probably one of the biggest things is
the<00:03:33.470> three<00:03:33.800> offensive<00:03:34.310> teams<00:03:34.760> they<00:03:35.060> faced<00:03:35.480> i

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
the three offensive teams they faced i

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.560 
the three offensive teams they faced i
will<00:03:36.500> take<00:03:36.650> those<00:03:36.980> three<00:03:37.400> against<00:03:37.970> any<00:03:38.209> of<00:03:38.450> the

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
will take those three against any of the

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.710 
will take those three against any of the
offenses<00:03:39.200> that<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.890> older<00:03:40.640> defense<00:03:41.300> is<00:03:41.450> faced

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
offenses that the older defense is faced

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.449
