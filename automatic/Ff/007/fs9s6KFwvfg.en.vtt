00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
about ovarian a Sun Moon and fire symbol

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.799 
about ovarian a Sun Moon and fire symbol
and<00:00:10.730> Moon<00:00:11.730> is<00:00:11.910> important

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
and Moon is important

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.120 
and Moon is important
Sun<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.710> important<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.549> fire<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.960> most

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 
Sun is important and fire is the most

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.550 
Sun is important and fire is the most
important<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.539> a<00:00:18.539> muggles<00:00:18.990> think<00:00:19.320> that

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
important and a muggles think that

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.099 
important and a muggles think that
humans<00:00:20.310> are<00:00:21.320> managed<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.949> become<00:00:24.109> developed

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
humans are managed to become developed

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.040 
humans are managed to become developed
intelligent<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.420> managed<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.510> create<00:00:27.960> a

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
intelligent and managed to create a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.880 
intelligent and managed to create a
civilization<00:00:28.789> because<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.970> fire<00:00:30.779> if<00:00:31.470> our

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
civilization because of fire if our

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.959 
civilization because of fire if our
planet<00:00:32.520> did<00:00:32.910> not<00:00:33.649> had<00:00:34.649> any<00:00:34.980> fire<00:00:36.380> we<00:00:37.380> couldn't

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
planet did not had any fire we couldn't

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.590 
planet did not had any fire we couldn't
be<00:00:38.969> such<00:00:39.930> developed<00:00:40.649> with<00:00:40.829> creatures<00:00:41.610> and

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
be such developed with creatures and

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.680 
be such developed with creatures and
that's<00:00:43.590> why<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.280> fire<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.820> believed<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.510> be<00:00:45.539> a

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
that's why the fire is believed to be a

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.540 
that's why the fire is believed to be a
symbol<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.500> truth<00:00:48.079> so<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.890> course<00:00:50.129> there's<00:00:50.460> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
symbol of truth so of course there's a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.950 
symbol of truth so of course there's a
lots<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:51.300> symbols<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.440> truth<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.600> one<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.750> them

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
lots of symbols of truth and one of them

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.160 
lots of symbols of truth and one of them
is<00:00:55.940> swastika<00:00:57.079> and<00:00:58.079> somehow<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.100> swastika<00:00:59.550> is

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
is swastika and somehow the swastika is

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.310 
is swastika and somehow the swastika is
related<00:01:01.170> with<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.440> Sun<00:01:01.800> but<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.110> not

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
related with the Sun but this it is not

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.250 
related with the Sun but this it is not
a<00:01:04.379> Sun<00:01:05.840> why<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.320> because<00:01:08.450> Sun<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.689> something

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
a Sun why it is because Sun is something

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.880 
a Sun why it is because Sun is something
that<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.710> one<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.060> something<00:01:12.890> round

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
that is one and that is something round

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.359 
that is one and that is something round
but<00:01:14.700> swastika<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.630> like<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.280> cross<00:01:18.259> so<00:01:19.259> if<00:01:20.159> you

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
but swastika is like a cross so if you

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.399 
but swastika is like a cross so if you
live<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.150> cold<00:01:21.810> North<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.740> mean<00:01:23.689> not<00:01:24.689> today

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
live in and cold North I mean not today

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.260 
live in and cold North I mean not today
from<00:01:26.009> equator<00:01:26.960> you<00:01:28.280> think<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.520> this

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
from equator you think that this

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.010 
from equator you think that this
clockwise<00:01:31.020> swastika<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.520> swastika<00:01:33.020> truth

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
clockwise swastika is a swastika truth

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.179 
clockwise swastika is a swastika truth
and<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:35.840> anti-clockwise<00:01:36.840> swastika<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:38.100> a

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
and this anti-clockwise swastika is a

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.090 
and this anti-clockwise swastika is a
swastika<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.329> lives<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:41.329> if<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.390> live<00:01:43.100> south

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
swastika of lives and if you live south

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.420 
swastika of lives and if you live south
from<00:01:44.729> equator<00:01:46.070> you<00:01:47.070> think<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.780> a

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
from equator you think that this is a

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.910 
from equator you think that this is a
good<00:01:50.430> swastika<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> swastika<00:01:52.380> for

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
good swastika and this is a swastika for

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.069 
good swastika and this is a swastika for
good<00:01:53.640> person<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.710> this<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:56.840> negative<00:01:57.869> I

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
good person and this is a negative I

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.660 
good person and this is a negative I
mean<00:01:58.409> swastika<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.490> bad<00:02:00.240> person<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:02.130> depends

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
mean swastika a bad person so it depends

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.249 
mean swastika a bad person so it depends
on<00:02:02.909> where<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.630> live<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:05.240> if<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.420> live<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:07.229> the

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
on where you live and if you live to the

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.369 
on where you live and if you live to the
north<00:02:07.759> some<00:02:08.759> would<00:02:09.030> imagine<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.229> a

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
north some would imagine that this is a

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.610 
north some would imagine that this is a
start<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.849> see<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.360> sign<00:02:12.900> in<00:02:13.290> the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
start and you see a sign in the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.500 
start and you see a sign in the
shaft<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.390> Sun<00:02:15.390> rises<00:02:15.900> from<00:02:16.049> the<00:02:16.140> east<00:02:16.560> and

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
shaft and Sun rises from the east and

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.880 
shaft and Sun rises from the east and
sets<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.959> west<00:02:19.730> so<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.790> see<00:02:21.890> this

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
sets in the west so you see this

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.309 
sets in the west so you see this
movement<00:02:24.379> this<00:02:25.379> movement<00:02:26.060> like<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.299> and<00:02:27.900> if

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
movement this movement like this and if

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.890 
movement this movement like this and if
you<00:02:28.349> live<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.569> south<00:02:30.569> you<00:02:30.930> see<00:02:31.739> this<00:02:32.069> as

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
you live to the south you see this as

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.710 
you live to the south you see this as
moving<00:02:33.900> like<00:02:34.110> this<00:02:34.379> so<00:02:35.069> you<00:02:35.400> think<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.760> this

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
moving like this so you think that this

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.140 
moving like this so you think that this
movement<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:37.950> good<00:02:38.810> so<00:02:40.519> the<00:02:41.519> religion<00:02:42.000> is

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
movement is good so the religion is

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.030 
movement is good so the religion is
different<00:02:42.720> because<00:02:43.019> of<00:02:43.370> this<00:02:44.599> equator<00:02:46.040> people

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
different because of this equator people

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.089 
different because of this equator people
of<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.310> north<00:02:47.549> have<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:47.940> similar<00:02:48.750> idea<00:02:49.500> and

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
of the north have a similar idea and

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.800 
of the north have a similar idea and
beliefs<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:52.430> people<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:53.670> staff<00:02:53.940> seem<00:02:54.629> to

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
beliefs and people of the staff seem to

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.970 
beliefs and people of the staff seem to
have<00:02:54.989> a<00:02:55.019> different<00:02:57.470> mentality

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
have a different mentality

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.660 
have a different mentality
so<00:03:00.019> mom<00:03:01.019> goes<00:03:01.230> believe<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.859> this<00:03:02.099> is<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.340> good

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
so mom goes believe that this is a good

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.589 
so mom goes believe that this is a good
swastika<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.750> this<00:03:04.349> is<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.560> bad<00:03:05.340> swastika<00:03:06.030> I

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
swastika and this is a bad swastika I

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.509 
swastika and this is a bad swastika I
mean<00:03:07.109> this<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.709> a<00:03:07.739> right<00:03:08.549> path<00:03:09.030> this<00:03:09.870> is<00:03:10.049> a<00:03:10.519> both

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
mean this is a right path this is a both

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.640 
mean this is a right path this is a both
bad<00:03:11.849> and<00:03:12.060> wrong<00:03:12.720> half<00:03:13.470> but<00:03:15.470> Mongols<00:03:16.470> are

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
bad and wrong half but Mongols are
