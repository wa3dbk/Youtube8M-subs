be patient with them roll away when

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:16.440 
be patient with them roll away when
possible

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.810 

and<00:01:16.810> this<00:01:17.170> will<00:01:17.320> be<00:01:17.439> another<00:01:17.619> fight<00:01:18.039> area<00:01:18.490> I

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
and this will be another fight area I

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.240 
and this will be another fight area I
would<00:01:19.479> stay<00:01:19.990> at<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.200> bottom<00:01:20.740> of<00:01:20.829> the<00:01:20.950> area

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
would stay at the bottom of the area

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.480 
would stay at the bottom of the area
because<00:01:22.090> if<00:01:23.020> I<00:01:23.409> had<00:01:23.530> Lucas<00:01:23.890> or<00:01:24.100> so<00:01:24.219> you<00:01:24.280> make

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
because if I had Lucas or so you make

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.760 
because if I had Lucas or so you make
things<00:01:24.640> much<00:01:24.880> easier<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:26.110> staying<00:01:26.500> at<00:01:26.649> the

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
things much easier but staying at the

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.370 
things much easier but staying at the
bottom<00:01:27.509> allows<00:01:28.509> you<00:01:28.810> to<00:01:30.360> attack<00:01:31.360> from<00:01:31.689> below

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
bottom allows you to attack from below

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.059 
bottom allows you to attack from below
and<00:01:34.049> pretty<00:01:35.049> much<00:01:35.110> ensures<00:01:35.560> that<00:01:35.590> you<00:01:35.799> don't

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:36.069 
and pretty much ensures that you don't

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:39.849 
and pretty much ensures that you don't
get<00:01:36.189> hurt

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:39.859 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:43.399 

or<00:01:40.859> not<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:42.240> be<00:01:42.329> careful<00:01:42.539> and<00:01:42.960> you'll<00:01:43.259> be

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
or not just be careful and you'll be

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:51.430 
or not just be careful and you'll be
fine<00:01:43.670> don't<00:01:44.670> be<00:01:44.850> like<00:01:45.030> me<00:01:45.060> right<00:01:45.960> now

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.320 

see<00:01:52.440> if<00:01:52.620> I<00:01:52.710> had<00:01:52.860> why<00:01:53.340> i<00:01:53.370> said<00:01:53.610> if<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.760> had<00:01:53.880> Lucas<00:01:54.210> I

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
see if I had why i said if I had Lucas I

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.150 
see if I had why i said if I had Lucas I
could<00:01:54.480> just<00:01:54.630> keep<00:01:54.870> sending<00:01:55.230> PK<00:01:55.530> thunders<00:01:55.950> and

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
could just keep sending PK thunders and

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.950 
could just keep sending PK thunders and
attacking<00:01:57.120> with<00:01:57.390> it<00:02:00.560> from<00:02:01.560> from<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:01.920> set

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
attacking with it from from this set

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.390 
attacking with it from from this set
from<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.080> vantage<00:02:04.260> point<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.890> can't<00:02:05.340> really

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
from this vantage point you can't really

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.710 
from this vantage point you can't really
get<00:02:05.760> hurt<00:02:05.910> and<00:02:07.520> PK<00:02:08.520> Thunder<00:02:08.820> bounces<00:02:09.360> them<00:02:09.540> off

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
get hurt and PK Thunder bounces them off

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.120 
get hurt and PK Thunder bounces them off
and<00:02:09.960> they'll<00:02:10.649> just<00:02:10.679> by<00:02:11.250> pretty<00:02:11.580> quickly<00:02:11.880> and
