00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
by picking some cabbage we're going to

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.459 
by picking some cabbage we're going to

four<00:01:00.239> days<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.809> ferment<00:01:01.230> both<00:01:01.770> days<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.309> rot

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
four days to ferment both days to rot

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.149 
four days to ferment both days to rot
Dave<00:01:02.820> days<00:01:03.000> lots<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.570> days<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.680> rot<00:01:04.890> and

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
that's what gives it its authentic kind

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.460 
that's what gives it its authentic kind
of<00:01:06.540> flavor<00:01:06.720> but<00:01:06.869> we're<00:01:06.990> going<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.170> cheat<00:01:07.320> it

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
of flavor but we're going to cheat it

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.080 
of flavor but we're going to cheat it
coz<00:01:07.560> we<00:01:07.650> can<00:01:07.770> do<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.040> pickle<00:01:08.369> instead<00:01:08.670> okay

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
coz we can do it in pickle instead okay

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.700 
coz we can do it in pickle instead okay
okay<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.570> salt<00:01:09.750> you'll<00:01:09.869> get<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> pickle<00:01:10.350> so

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
okay so the salt you'll get a pickle so

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.950 
okay so the salt you'll get a pickle so
we've<00:01:10.799> got<00:01:10.890> cider<00:01:11.159> vinegar<00:01:11.549> layering<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.600> with

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
we've got cider vinegar layering in with

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
the cabbage apple juice and then a very

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.270 
the cabbage apple juice and then a very
distinct<00:01:16.049> flavor<00:01:16.080> often<00:01:16.799> associated<00:01:17.130> with

well I suppose so they make gin from
juniper<00:01:23.159> berries<00:01:23.400> mmm<00:01:24.000> they're<00:01:24.119> quite<00:01:24.240> strong

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
they're not actually a berry but they're

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.770 
they're not actually a berry but they're
gonna<00:01:25.799> go<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.070> as<00:01:26.250> well<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.610> think<00:01:27.570> you're

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
gonna go in as well I think you're

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.060 
gonna go in as well I think you're
supposed<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.020> recompose<00:01:28.350> no<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.650> think<00:01:28.950> it's

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
supposed to recompose no I think it's

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.710 
supposed to recompose no I think it's
very<00:01:29.159> confusing<00:01:29.460> apart<00:01:29.939> no<00:01:30.030> flavor<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.420> here<00:01:30.479> a

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
very confusing apart no flavor in here a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.270 
very confusing apart no flavor in here a
few<00:01:31.020> fennel<00:01:31.320> seeds<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.770> then<00:01:32.070> we'll<00:01:32.189> leave

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
few fennel seeds and then we'll leave

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.859

the<00:04:29.290> skin<00:04:29.410> off<00:04:29.470> that's<00:04:29.860> like<00:04:29.980> a<00:04:30.010> waxy<00:04:30.400> seal<00:04:30.640> to

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
the skin off that's like a waxy seal to

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:31.530 
the skin off that's like a waxy seal to
keep<00:04:30.940> it<00:04:31.120> fresh

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
keep it fresh

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.180 
keep it fresh
as<00:04:31.630> soon<00:04:31.840> as<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.050> butter<00:04:32.260> is<00:04:32.470> foaming<00:04:32.740> a<00:04:33.010> nice

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
as soon as the butter is foaming a nice

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.210 
as soon as the butter is foaming a nice
and<00:04:33.400> hot<00:04:33.580> we<00:04:34.030> can<00:04:34.060> add<00:04:34.270> our<00:04:34.360> spaetzle<00:04:34.870> in<00:04:34.990> I

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
and hot we can add our spaetzle in I

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.800 
and hot we can add our spaetzle in I
guess<00:04:36.220> is<00:04:36.340> that<00:04:36.430> should<00:04:36.610> be<00:04:36.640> like<00:04:36.790> gnocchi<00:04:36.970> not

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
guess is that should be like gnocchi not

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.450 
guess is that should be like gnocchi not
potato<00:04:38.140> gnocchi<00:04:38.350> gnocchi

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
potato gnocchi gnocchi

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.340 
potato gnocchi gnocchi
yeah<00:04:39.730> then<00:04:39.910> going<00:04:40.060> to<00:04:40.120> fry<00:04:40.300> on<00:04:40.480> now<00:04:40.960> for<00:04:41.020> our

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
yeah then going to fry on now for our

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.980 
yeah then going to fry on now for our
construction<00:04:41.680> so<00:04:42.430> one<00:04:42.670> flour<00:04:43.060> tortilla<00:04:43.510> yep

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
construction so one flour tortilla yep

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.900 
construction so one flour tortilla yep
and<00:04:44.590> plenty<00:04:44.890> of<00:04:45.130> spats<00:04:45.430> so<00:04:45.610> this<00:04:45.790> is

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
and plenty of spats so this is

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.430 
and plenty of spats so this is
equivalent<00:04:46.330> to<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:46.510> rice<00:04:46.720> you<00:04:46.960> might<00:04:47.170> put<00:04:47.350> in

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
equivalent to the rice you might put in

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.320 
equivalent to the rice you might put in
