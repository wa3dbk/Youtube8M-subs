00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.930
 hello to all and welcome to the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.360
 techno chain and welcome to the world of 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.160
 the car here in paris the cars are from 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.570
 more and more connected it's a real 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.570
 trend here we talk right now 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.309
 vic buyster the mobile is used to pay 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.559
 register now on 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.500
 low-land point fr and bought on 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.930
 internet in all serenity and we 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.030
 are here in an audi it's an audi 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.180
 a3 very nice cars pretty vehicle 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.890
 is also very much fun no doubt 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.019
 one of the most connected vehicles 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.960
 that we can find on this world 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.760
 2012 a screen obviously so that's it 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.890
 did a lot but behind lots of 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.720
 services then it's an audi who audi 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.159
 a3 which has just been launched on the 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.750
 French market this is the third 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.369
 generation is actually we have 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.990
 thought about a number of services 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.460
 important that they can facilitate the 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.140
 driver and traffic 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.240
 first of all actually the fact of being able 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.240
 register the destination directly 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.360
 without a finger without leaving the road 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.220
 eyes on the central button this 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.170
 car and after you have a 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.359
 number of connections on your 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.979
 destination both through 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:34.030
 google earth that tell you one a 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.399
 real-time relief of your 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.460
 google street destination with a 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.679
 visualization of where you are going and 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.270
 as well as a number of services more 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.219
 important that it existed before to know 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.829
 weather that can make your traffic easier 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:49.030
 and the weather as well of the place you are 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.299
 than the place of your destination 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.060
 the next the pump the gas pump 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.549
 the fastest available and then 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.689
 real time information at a time 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.579
 about events that can happen 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.130
 unfold in our city the news 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.030
 the famous facebook and twitter that does not 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.659
 lack of present in our lives 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.639
 daily 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.350
 and then information on arrivals 

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:11.080
 the arrival and departure times of 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.060
 planes or trains and well them in 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.310
 terms of ergonomics a small innovation 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.760
 now for example between is 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.860
 a destination 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.360
 with her we want to go we have 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.890
 worked on several systems a 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.540
 actually the idea was to be able 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.400
 enter a destination while being in 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.079
 complete security then there are some 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.909
 today's recognition systems 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.260
 voice that exists and then we worked 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.689
 on a new system that is a touch 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.129
 pad that has integrated the center console and 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.170
 which allows you to record your finger in 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.980
 destiny in drawing the letters the 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.870
 future destination 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.280
 with character recognition with 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.750
 character recognition for 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.450
 actually validated that the letter is 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.970
 well the good so how does this 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.799
 car actually connects to the internet 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.739
 it connects simply via 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:54.980
 your mobile phone use you 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.420
 3g connection or tomorrow 4g mobile 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.099
 exactly your cell phone 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.349
 recorded in addition all in the car 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.909
 and we rely on this data there then 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.590
 yes it's true it's nice this system of 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.609
 connected cars but he'll have to 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.010
 still go to checkout 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.959
 it costs around 3,000 euros 1,7 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.849
 option at audi then the technologies 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.409
 by car and well these are also 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.239
 driving aids then for example 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.099
 to park more easily and also 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.609
 to save time even when there is 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.680
 red lights 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:21.260
 today the idea is to connect the 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.459
 car with the traffic lights and 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.139
 quincy the car receive a 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.879
 information that tell him how much 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.440
 roll for the next fire to be 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.250
 open without the car needing to 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.829
 stop 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.870
 we gain in fluidity of traffic and 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.940
 then in gas mileage and that's it 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.680
 will happen when that is today 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.730
 a technology that is mastered which 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.230
 is known to us all depends on 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.609
 infrastructures it's technologies 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.530
 that we are testing in size 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.090
 real about the city of munich and who 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.489
 could happen in our cities from here 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.569
 about ten years 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.549
 being able to park your car 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.139
 now without a driver it's 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.910
 thing that is I was going to say almost 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.590
 common finally audi among others 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.840
 builders it's a technology that 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.599
 is now under control then 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.409
 today the technology that is 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.609
 installed on our vehicles was 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:02.900
 actually to be inside the 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.549
 car to press a button and 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.010
 she conveyed face these maneuvers 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.299
 all alone we are today we studied 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.919
 today new technologies that 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.930
 did we move outside the 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:13.340
 car and with the key we launch a 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.750
 command that allows the car to go 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.099
 to park alone 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.349
 location intended 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.699
 these technologies today which is 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:20.959
 mastered remains after the appearance 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.639
 legislative since today a 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.560
 driverless car is not yet 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.520
 validated by legislator so this 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.070
 car can not go out today 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.570
 can not be sold 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.590
 do in the frame of equal life 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.330
 today no we do not want to be 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.440
 sold good there again it's a dream 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.790
 this car that parks itself and 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.080
 then the final step jérôme is good 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.500
 sure to have a car driving 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.330
 all alone 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.010
 and yes, we know that it exists on the 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.540
 from google waiting it's me who 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.740
 must drive the keys I have the keys 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.180
 and then we'll meet again tomorrow on the 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.250
 techno chain if we did not have a 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.360
 accident by then with Jerome would be 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.360
 no salvation to everyone and to tomorrow 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.250
 here we are in an audi you tell us 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.840
 say to three to be precise without doubt 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.600
 a very nice gift thank you Jerome and that 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.870
 makes me very happy for our eight years 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.870
 of marriage
