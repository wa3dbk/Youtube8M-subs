00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.750
 is going to focus on the market the most 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.580

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.330
 colombia mid next year 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.280
 we can see it somewhere to 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.550
 the internet already if you can find 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.940
 information is called 1 250 or about 150 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.920

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:52.120
 It's a separate two-seater with a certain trait 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.610
 sports a front more tourism a tail 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.680

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.350
 superbike style by calling it from 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.150
 some way and well all a 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.460
 engineering throughout the part of 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.590
 structure in suspension in that 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.590
 aluminum swingarm that I think 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.090
 so a great attribute that speed that 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.230
 the performance we can talk about that 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.420
 motorcycle that we can anticipate people 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.990
 we are talking a speed between 230 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.380
 240 kilometers per hour 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.490
 in an average performance between 55 and 65 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.950
 kilometers per gallon 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.660
 How many cylinders four cylinders in 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.090
 line that is not characteristic of ben 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.530
 heli this is the first four moto 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.060
 cylinders in line after much 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.490
 time that ends in him and although ben 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.070
 heli was the first brand in the past 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.140
 who took out an Italian four-cylinder 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.310
 he stopped doing them he focused the most on 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.160
 our cylinders but now we 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.990
 presents a four cylinder that yes with 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.640
 the indisputable feature the sound 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.640
 in him and that is something exquisite 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.480
 let's listen to it 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.239
 well jesus let me tell you that it's a 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:23.280
 sound much quieter with certain 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.500
 characteristic of rattlesnake bell 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.169
 correct benelli is a little sound 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.600
 quieter in low but in minimum and 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:33.180
 then in highs when we compare it 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.850
 with his sisters like the 3 ko century 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.129
 king be a motorcycle that retains the sound 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.860
 characteristic in the 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:44.189
 the fund that he handled in it and is a 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.769
 exquisite sound or is it a taste for 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:49.259
 I'm hearing that I would amount to 

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:51.899
 know that tetracilÃ­ndricos and responds 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:54.479
 down clear that yes we are going to sin of 

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:56.039
 many is not a sin many but I 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.910
 I think you 're going to be surprised a lot with 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.500
 these four cylinders
