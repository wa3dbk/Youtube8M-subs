00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.569 
slits in it it turns out this is part of
some<00:03:24.599> brilliant<00:03:24.930> engineering<00:03:25.799> which

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
some brilliant engineering which

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.449 
some brilliant engineering which
actually<00:03:27.359> uses<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.379> stainless<00:03:28.950> steel<00:03:29.129> band

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
actually uses the stainless steel band

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:41.960 
actually uses the stainless steel band
as<00:03:29.819> part<00:03:30.239> of<00:03:30.329> the<00:03:30.420> antenna<00:03:30.900> system<00:03:31.519> and<00:03:32.519> so<00:03:40.970> so

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
as part of the antenna system and so so

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.140 
as part of the antenna system and so so
it's<00:03:42.239> got<00:03:42.480> these<00:03:42.989> integrated<00:03:43.620> antennas<00:03:44.370> right

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
it's got these integrated antennas right

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.750 
it's got these integrated antennas right
in<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.959> structure<00:03:46.620> of<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:46.920> phone<00:03:47.160> it's<00:03:47.400> never

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
in the structure of the phone it's never

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.940 
in the structure of the phone it's never

IPS<00:04:15.359> technology<00:04:15.739> this<00:04:16.739> is<00:04:16.950> a<00:04:16.979> very<00:04:17.459> advanced

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
IPS technology this is a very advanced

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.870 
IPS technology this is a very advanced
LCD<00:04:18.630> technology<00:04:18.870> which<00:04:19.769> is<00:04:19.950> quite<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.430> bit<00:04:20.700> in

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
LCD technology which is quite a bit in

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.339 
LCD technology which is quite a bit in
our<00:04:21.000> opinion<00:04:21.389> quite<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.720> bit<00:04:21.900> better<00:04:22.049> than<00:04:22.200> the

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
our opinion quite a bit better than the

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:23.990 
our opinion quite a bit better than the
OLED<00:04:22.770> technology<00:04:22.950> for<00:04:23.520> these<00:04:23.639> types<00:04:23.880> of

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
OLED technology for these types of

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.350 
OLED technology for these types of
products<00:04:24.360> and<00:04:25.130> provides<00:04:26.130> much<00:04:26.639> more<00:04:26.700> accurate

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
products and provides much more accurate

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.339 
products and provides much more accurate
color<00:04:27.630> and<00:04:28.970> much<00:04:29.970> higher<00:04:30.210> resolution<00:04:30.450> you

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 
color and much higher resolution you

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:33.260 
color and much higher resolution you
can't<00:04:31.710> make<00:04:32.039> an<00:04:32.190> OLED<00:04:32.520> display<00:04:32.910> with<00:04:33.120> this

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
can't make an OLED display with this

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.839 
can't make an OLED display with this
type<00:04:33.450> of<00:04:33.479> resolution<00:04:33.870> right<00:04:34.289> now<00:04:34.470> and<00:04:34.889> so<00:04:35.639> we

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
type of resolution right now and so we

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:38.210 
type of resolution right now and so we
think<00:04:35.970> the<00:04:36.120> IPS<00:04:36.630> technology<00:04:36.840> is<00:04:37.380> really<00:04:37.800> quite

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
think the IPS technology is really quite

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.170 
think the IPS technology is really quite
superior<00:04:39.289> and<00:04:40.289> it<00:04:41.010> results<00:04:41.490> in<00:04:41.580> incredibly

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
superior and it results in incredibly

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.360 
superior and it results in incredibly
sharp<00:04:42.599> text<00:04:43.190> images<00:04:44.190> and<00:04:44.400> video
