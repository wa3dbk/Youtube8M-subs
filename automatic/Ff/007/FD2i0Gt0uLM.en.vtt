00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.880
 in the field of electronic control systems 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.070
 we have three new motor controllers which 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.980
 now new at the c4 at the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.800
 University Motor Controller is in the C4 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.050
 that the day 1-draining recalls the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.840
 can thus draining data generate draining 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.000
 data supply the lenz data are good 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.700
 for different things on the one hand 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.510
 you show the pose on the b 2 4 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.430
 hand unit 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.410
 there you have this land data 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.480
 display and can for example see how 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.829
 much how big the depth of field 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.500
 is of course we can see that 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.579
 Objectively adjusted is also objective 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.649
 can not see because, for example 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.260
 on the crane is the second thing 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.170
 you can do data with such latency 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.760
 is that you do focus mapping too 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.280
 previously highlighted focus 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.579
 that is the markings on the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.530
 Objectively are, so to speak, noticed 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.500
 this ring and that has the consequence that 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.729
 you can use a ring for 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.150
 different objective and you have to 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.480
 not for each objectively individual 9 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.910
 they label the third thing now 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.430
 really new is really with the c4's 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.860
 focus tracking for focus tracking 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.710
 you need an ultra sonic distance 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.530
 Men like the dm 1 or 1 in aetate 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.520
 Can it with the joke with the c4 engine 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.860
 connect controller 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.730
 if you then press the user button 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.730
 the b 2 4 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.100
 then the focus engine moves on 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.870
 Reading that is my hand now 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.510
 It's like that 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.400
 autofocus I would then worth it 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.490
 it drove me very much, too 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.960
 the position where my focus knob on it 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.810
 is and then I can do it again 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.340
 people and in accordance 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.300
 so if i have this user button 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.790
 let go again 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.220
 then the engine does not jump that was 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.390
 now the application for the advance data 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.550
 but are also very useful for that 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.340
 postproduction because the virtual camera 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.990
 For the woman to fix production must be 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.910
 have the same focal length and so on 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.400
 be focused on the same distance 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.770
 like my real camera the pictures 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.640
 That's why I like to record 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.769
 if there is data to record in the c4 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.300
 we have an integrated timecode module in the 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.930
 multi four in there i can james 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.209
 limping with my camera for example 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.160
 and can then use the team offered a 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.620
 lenz data records on sd card 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.989
 the un c4 is just the three-axle engine 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.730
 controller with latency data etc 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.260
 of course , application is everything 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.739
 not so we may need one 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.269
 motor for focus on steadycam you want 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.050
 that have a nice little something light 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.910
 there we have something new when I have the 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.280
 single motor controller it on 21 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.769
 is a lance or you can do that 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.049
 connect to the sx1 or the b24 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.460
 can really be the owner of one 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.990
 lightweight one axle system 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.230
 and then we have another one 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.120
 model that is the emc 1 you can 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.950
 directly with a fujinon person 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.580
 simply connect the cable 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.730
 here's it 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.460
 bauer here finished then you can with 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.220
 the b24 focus aperture and zoom of 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.410
 wireless control and you even get 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.580
 still financial data from the thing on wc 4 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:19.730
 display emc and smc 1 both cost 1800 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:25.610
 euro will be available from june 2014 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:28.010
 and the un c48 4490 euros included 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.570
 mounting bracket also expected 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.570
 June 2014 disposal
