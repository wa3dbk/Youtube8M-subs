00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
get one of these things let's say you

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.340 
get one of these things let's say you
have<00:02:16.390> worse<00:02:16.570> salad<00:02:16.930> you're<00:02:17.019> going<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.200> assume

have worse salad you're going to assume

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.440 
have worse salad you're going to assume
that<00:02:17.410> all<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.890> souths<00:02:18.130> people<00:02:18.519> have<00:02:18.730> include

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
lettuce so if you have pasta you're

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:21.930 
lettuce so if you have pasta you're
going<00:02:20.829> to<00:02:20.890> zoom<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.160> they<00:02:21.220> all<00:02:21.340> have<00:02:21.519> pasta

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
going to zoom that they all have pasta

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.060 
going to zoom that they all have pasta

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.900 
bacon and I'm looking at the judge and
thinking<00:02:47.890> wine<00:02:48.070> I<00:02:48.100> don't<00:02:48.490> think<00:02:48.640> they<00:02:48.700> like

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
thinking wine I don't think they like

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.450 
thinking wine I don't think they like
bacon<00:02:49.300> so<00:02:49.480> maybe<00:02:49.690> that's<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.110> so<00:02:51.100> then<00:02:51.220> we<00:02:51.280> put

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
bacon so maybe that's it so then we put

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.830 
bacon so maybe that's it so then we put
