00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.509
 Hello, today I want to show you 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.519
 how to make a new year snowflake 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.250
 beads and beads 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:13.969
 so let's start with the fact that we cut off here 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:24.080
 such a piece of wire 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:30.810
 so cut off take the beads here and string 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:39.079
 3 things here we connect the two ends 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:41.750
 together and pierce through the bead here 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:47.280
 that's what happened 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:50.280
 doing these 6 stuff now I'll show 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.719
 what kind of connect here i take such a bead 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:02.120
 medium sized and strung on one 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:05.690
 side take 2 2 our our billet and 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.690
 permeate the middle 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.369
 that's what we have 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:35.090
 these two ends I still knit in 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:38.500
 one here then take 3 here and pervade 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:44.770
 second medium bead 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.770
 so if 2 and here's the first 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:02:02.860
 All this stream on this principle I do 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:07.790
 all here further 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:12.140
 connect but I connected everything and here 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:16.460
 got such a snowflake then we need 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:23.200
 take small beads and further decorated 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:32.709
 her first year there is a thin wand 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:32.709
 I think enough to strengthen it 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:44.730
 strung up 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.730
 eight little beads 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.180
 here 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:59.730
 like this 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:03.689
 District's swathes of so and so 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:09.680
 continue to do with each 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:13.049
 get and do the same with the rest 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:18.620
 here I got such a snowflake now 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:22.310
 there is still a rope left and can be done 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.310
 cling to the Christmas tree 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.810
 It turns out such a decoration if you 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:42.750
 interesting yet some kind of snowflakes from 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.040
 beads then write in the comments I 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.260
 sure to show 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.260
 Thank you for your attention before the meetings
