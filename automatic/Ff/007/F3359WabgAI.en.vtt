00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:20.639 
my opinion in a case like that people

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:22.580 
my opinion in a case like that people
should<00:01:20.880> be<00:01:20.909> criminalized<00:01:21.749> and<00:01:22.020> put<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:22.380> jail

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
should be criminalized and put in jail

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.919 
should be criminalized and put in jail
for<00:01:22.649> putting<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.159> dog<00:01:23.340> down<00:01:23.520> after<00:01:23.899> 24<00:01:24.899> hours

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
for putting a dog down after 24 hours

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.870 
for putting a dog down after 24 hours
without<00:01:25.499> giving<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.039> owner<00:01:26.219> ample<00:01:26.670> time<00:01:26.819> to

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
without giving the owner ample time to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.039 
without giving the owner ample time to
come<00:01:27.119> up<00:01:27.209> with<00:01:27.359> the<00:01:27.420> money<00:01:27.539> and<00:01:27.840> it's

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
come up with the money and it's

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.239 
come up with the money and it's
important<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.469> mention<00:01:28.619> too<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.979> was

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:29.249 
important to mention too that that was

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:30.859 
important to mention too that that was
just<00:01:29.490> one<00:01:29.759> particular<00:01:30.209> case<00:01:30.630> that's

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
just one particular case that's

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.319 
just one particular case that's
certainly<00:01:31.109> not<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.319> case<00:01:31.529> for<00:01:32.399> all<00:01:32.639> animal

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
certainly not the case for all animal

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.879 
certainly not the case for all animal
care<00:01:33.569> and<00:01:33.600> control<00:01:33.779> agencies<00:01:34.590> across<00:01:34.799> the

care and control agencies across the

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:37.569 
care and control agencies across the
country<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:35.670> if<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.659> just<00:01:36.869> one<00:01:37.109> example

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.980 
country but if that is just one example
one<00:01:38.579> can<00:01:38.850> imagine<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.299> perhaps<00:01:39.600> there<00:01:39.929> are

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
one can imagine that perhaps there are

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.569 
one can imagine that perhaps there are
other<00:01:40.079> instances<00:01:40.380> like<00:01:40.889> that<00:01:41.130> happening

other instances like that happening

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.199 
other instances like that happening

bottom line well it seems like they're

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.600 
bottom line well it seems like they're
doing<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:28.680> in<00:02:28.830> all<00:02:28.920> sorts<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.130> cases<00:02:29.250> you

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
tickets and you know it's gaps in

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.839 
tickets and you know it's gaps in
budgets<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.780> it's<00:02:34.680> companies<00:02:35.130> taking<00:02:35.340> the

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
situations and it seems to me like it's

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.530
