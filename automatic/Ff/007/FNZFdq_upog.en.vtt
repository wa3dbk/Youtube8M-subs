well<00:00:04.370> I'm<00:00:05.370> thinking<00:00:05.940> this<00:00:06.029> this<00:00:06.240> video<00:00:06.480> might

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
well I'm thinking this this video might

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.480 
well I'm thinking this this video might
be<00:00:06.690> after<00:00:07.200> my<00:00:07.350> mother<00:00:07.560> books<00:00:07.799> I'm<00:00:08.069> actually

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
be after my mother books I'm actually

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.890 
be after my mother books I'm actually
recording<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:09.000> videos<00:00:09.240> it's<00:00:09.450> you<00:00:09.540> know<00:00:09.690> sort

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
recording the videos it's you know sort

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.009 
recording the videos it's you know sort

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
of poised me after my new CBO and I mean

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.420 
of poised me after my new CBO and I mean

tool<00:00:25.230> cache<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.699> think<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.000> might<00:00:27.180> tear<00:00:27.449> and

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
tool cache and I think I might tear and

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.150 
tool cache and I think I might tear and
get<00:00:27.750> cousin<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.199> lot<00:00:28.380> closer<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.949> think<00:00:29.130> I

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
get cousin a lot closer so I think I

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.259 
get cousin a lot closer so I think I
might<00:00:29.279> try<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.580> get<00:00:29.670> have<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.820> fool<00:00:30.029> gigahertz

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
might try and get have a fool gigahertz

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
can use a key to organize okay it's

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.040 
can use a key to organize okay it's
obvious<00:00:45.120> plan<00:00:45.390> there<00:00:47.960> that<00:00:48.960> it's<00:00:49.079> not<00:00:49.110> working

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
for me as well actual CPU itself is

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.940 
for me as well actual CPU itself is
there<00:01:29.119> it's<00:01:30.119> pretty<00:01:30.329> heavy<00:01:30.570> as<00:01:30.750> well<00:01:30.960> yeah<00:01:31.920> I

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
there it's pretty heavy as well yeah I

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.679 
there it's pretty heavy as well yeah I
wasn't<00:01:32.100> expecting<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.700> another<00:01:33.570> thing

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
wasn't expecting this another thing

wasn't expecting this another thing
that's<00:01:33.750> weeks<00:01:34.140> I've<00:01:34.290> been<00:01:34.409> using<00:01:34.560> Intel<00:01:34.920> M

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
that's weeks I've been using Intel M

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.830 
that's weeks I've been using Intel M
chipsets<00:01:35.640> for<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.850> while<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.210> one<00:01:36.420> has<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
chipsets for a while this one has the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.590 
chipsets for a while this one has the
pins<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> CPU<00:01:37.710> itself<00:01:37.939> not<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.119> as<00:01:39.240> cool<00:01:39.509> as

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
pins on the CPU itself not so as cool as

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.649 
pins on the CPU itself not so as cool as
well<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.020> fluidity

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
well the in fluidity

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.039 
well the in fluidity
focus<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:43.290> do<00:01:43.470> their<00:01:43.649> MD<00:01:44.250> sticker<00:01:44.930> speaker<00:01:45.930> I

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
focus to do their MD sticker speaker I

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.090 
focus to do their MD sticker speaker I
think<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.290> metallic<00:01:46.530> as<00:01:46.740> well<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.040> that's

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
think it's metallic as well so that's

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.690 
think it's metallic as well so that's
pretty<00:01:47.340> cool

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
pretty cool

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.440 
pretty cool
do<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.180> one<00:01:48.329> side<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> second<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:49.340> have<00:01:50.450> my

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
do that one side a second I have my

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.350 
do that one side a second I have my
arrived<00:01:52.079> late<00:01:52.560> should<00:01:53.130> have<00:01:53.460> documentation

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
arrived late should have documentation

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.800 
arrived late should have documentation
with<00:01:54.630> one<00:01:54.930> side<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.040> CPU<00:01:56.810> loft

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
with one side and this is the CPU loft

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.130 
with one side and this is the CPU loft
which<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.110> won't<00:01:58.200> be<00:01:58.350> using<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:59.689> box<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:00.990> of

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
which I won't be using a box in so of

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.530 
which I won't be using a box in so of
the<00:02:01.290> video<00:02:01.740> I'll<00:02:02.070> be<00:02:02.100> doing<00:02:02.490> an<00:02:02.969> unboxing<00:02:03.090> on

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
the video I'll be doing an unboxing on

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.310 
the video I'll be doing an unboxing on
this<00:02:03.719> too

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.680 

well<00:02:07.010> I<00:02:07.040> think<00:02:07.310> pill<00:02:07.700> news<00:02:08.090> needs<00:02:08.390> just<00:02:08.660> to

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
well I think pill news needs just to

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.940 
well I think pill news needs just to
like<00:02:08.869> make<00:02:08.899> sure<00:02:09.200> that<00:02:09.290> the<00:02:09.410> rigs<00:02:09.590> working

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
like make sure that the rigs working

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.890 
like make sure that the rigs working
before<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.550> install<00:02:11.030> at<00:02:11.240> after<00:02:11.540> mother

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
before the install at after mother

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.120 
before the install at after mother
cooler<00:02:12.410> just<00:02:12.530> in<00:02:12.650> case<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:12.920> didn't<00:02:13.070> actually

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
cooler just in case it didn't actually

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:26.770 
cooler just in case it didn't actually
work<00:02:24.880> well<00:02:25.880> there<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.150> is<00:02:26.240> there's<00:02:26.540> the

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
work well there it is there's the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.380 
work well there it is there's the
standard<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.740> block<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:28.910> there's<00:02:29.240> no
