and<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:26.010> is<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.190> spoon<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.700> you've<00:01:27.000> already

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
and this is a spoon that you've already

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:36.770 
and this is a spoon that you've already
done<00:01:28.200> already<00:01:28.650> made<00:01:28.979> our<00:01:29.159> hair<00:01:33.890> so<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.780> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
done already made our hair so the the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.800 
done already made our hair so the the
axe<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.830> first<00:01:38.100> part<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.700> idx<00:01:39.479> is

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
axe is the first part of the idx is

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.230 
axe is the first part of the idx is
really<00:01:40.350> trying<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.430> do<00:01:41.490> as<00:01:41.550> much<00:01:41.610> for<00:01:41.820> roughing

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
really trying to do as much for roughing

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.320 
really trying to do as much for roughing
out<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.930> with<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:43.170> axe<00:01:43.350> as<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.830> can<00:01:44.330> take

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
out you can with the axe as you can take

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.560 
out you can with the axe as you can take
off<00:01:46.100> woods<00:01:47.100> really<00:01:47.460> quickly<00:01:47.850> with<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.330> axe

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
off woods really quickly with the axe

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.770 
off woods really quickly with the axe
and<00:01:49.080> do<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.259> lot<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:50.119> may<00:01:51.119> be<00:01:51.180> roughing<00:01:51.659> out

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
and do a lot of it may be roughing out

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.770 
and do a lot of it may be roughing out
first<00:01:52.229> with<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.590> axe<00:01:53.360> but<00:01:54.360> then<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.600> get<00:01:54.750> to

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
first with the axe but then you get to

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.100 
first with the axe but then you get to
stage<00:01:55.200> where<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:56.330> need<00:01:57.330> to<00:01:57.539> start<00:01:57.570> defining

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
stage where you need to start defining

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.169 
stage where you need to start defining
the<00:01:58.410> shape<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.830> then<00:01:58.950> probably<00:01:59.670> better<00:01:59.910> to<00:01:59.970> go

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
the shape and then probably better to go

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.160 
the shape and then probably better to go
over<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.890> whistling<00:02:01.890> tools<00:02:02.810> knives<00:02:03.810> and

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
over to whistling tools knives and

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:11.600 
over to whistling tools knives and
carving<00:02:04.950> tools<00:02:07.759> refine<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.910> shape<00:02:10.100> um<00:02:11.100> how

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
carving tools refine the shape um how

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.490 
carving tools refine the shape um how
can<00:02:11.880> people<00:02:12.209> learn<00:02:12.390> how<00:02:12.630> to<00:02:12.690> do<00:02:13.019> what<00:02:13.380> you're

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
can people learn how to do what you're

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.960 
can people learn how to do what you're
doing<00:02:13.530> if<00:02:14.250> they<00:02:14.400> want<00:02:14.519> to<00:02:14.610> do<00:02:15.380> well<00:02:16.970> that's

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
doing if they want to do well that's

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.180

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.090 
you have sapling a flexible bendy piece
of<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.980> young<00:02:55.980> tree<00:02:56.280> really<00:02:56.609> living<00:02:57.150> tree<00:02:58.100> very

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
of a young tree really living tree very

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.340 
of a young tree really living tree very
young<00:02:59.310> sapling<00:02:59.760> and<00:02:59.880> you

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
young sapling and you

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.400 
young sapling and you
bend<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.490> over<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.000> tie<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.450> string<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.230> and

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
bend it over and tie a string to it and

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.060 
bend it over and tie a string to it and
the<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.700> spring<00:03:06.120> in<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.480> sapling<00:03:06.990> is<00:03:07.830> what

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
the the spring in the sapling is what

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.780 
the the spring in the sapling is what
Creek<00:03:08.520> creates<00:03:08.910> your<00:03:09.110> motor<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.350> your<00:03:10.470> power

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
Creek creates your motor and your power

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.300 
Creek creates your motor and your power
so<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.820> wrap<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.240> string<00:03:12.480> around<00:03:12.540> your<00:03:13.310> your

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
so you wrap the string around your your

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.330 
so you wrap the string around your your
work<00:03:14.550> piece<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.900> then<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.200> string<00:03:16.800> fixes<00:03:17.220> to

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
work piece and then the string fixes to

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.190 
work piece and then the string fixes to
a<00:03:17.370> treadle<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:17.940> board<00:03:18.270> which<00:03:18.600> you<00:03:18.750> press<00:03:19.020> with

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780

backwards<00:03:22.110> and<00:03:22.380> forwards<00:03:22.740> and<00:03:23.010> then<00:03:23.250> use
