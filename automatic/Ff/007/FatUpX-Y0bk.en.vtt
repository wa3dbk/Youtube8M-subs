squirt<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.640> there<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.960> we<00:01:58.110> want<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.380> rub

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
squirt it on there and we want to rub

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.950 
squirt it on there and we want to rub
some<00:01:59.310> fresh<00:01:59.550> oil<00:01:59.759> around<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.210> gasket<00:02:00.509> and

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
some fresh oil around that gasket and

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.499 
some fresh oil around that gasket and
this<00:02:01.650> will<00:02:01.860> help<00:02:02.100> keep<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.550> gasket<00:02:03.090> from

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
this will help keep that gasket from

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.480 
this will help keep that gasket from
baking<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.050> the<00:02:04.140> engine<00:02:04.500> when<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.160> made<00:02:05.369> the

it's time to install the new oil filter

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.070 
it's time to install the new oil filter
put<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.310> place<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.850> turn<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.600> clockwise<00:02:18.690> to

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
put it in place and turn it clockwise to

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.900 
put it in place and turn it clockwise to
tighten<00:02:21.920> when<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.010> filter<00:02:23.340> first<00:02:23.580> makes

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
tighten when the filter first makes

tighten when the filter first makes
contact<00:02:24.299> with<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.510> engine<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:25.049> need<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.410> turn

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
contact with the engine I need to turn

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.060

another<00:02:26.130> 1/2<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:27.030> 3/4<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.690> turn<00:02:27.870> just<00:02:28.830> enough

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
another 1/2 to 3/4 of a turn just enough

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.070 
another 1/2 to 3/4 of a turn just enough
to<00:02:29.190> seal<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.519> so<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.730> doesn't<00:02:30.000> leak<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.810> never

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
to seal it so it doesn't leak you never

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.800 
to seal it so it doesn't leak you never
use<00:02:31.320> a<00:02:31.350> wrench<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.769> tighten<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.220> oil<00:02:32.340> filter

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.730 

you

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.640 

now<00:02:41.280> we<00:02:41.340> need<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.760> add<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.120> fresh<00:02:42.390> oil<00:02:42.660> first

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
now we need to add the fresh oil first

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.190 
now we need to add the fresh oil first
we<00:02:43.860> remove<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.280> old<00:02:44.520> cap<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:45.150> place<00:02:45.960> the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
we remove the old cap and place the

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.280 
we remove the old cap and place the
funnel<00:02:46.590> in<00:02:46.740> proper<00:02:47.640> position<00:02:48.150> now<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:48.960> really

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
funnel in proper position now you really

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.110 
funnel in proper position now you really
can't<00:02:49.530> tell<00:02:49.710> from<00:02:49.890> this<00:02:50.040> angle<00:02:50.100> but<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.760> truck

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
can't tell from this angle but the truck

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.910 
can't tell from this angle but the truck
is<00:02:51.300> still<00:02:51.480> on<00:02:51.660> lamps<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.290> it's<00:02:52.410> quite<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.680> bit

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
is still on lamps so it's quite a bit

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.520 
is still on lamps so it's quite a bit
higher<00:02:53.190> than<00:02:53.490> normal<00:02:54.170> obviously<00:02:55.170> we<00:02:55.290> can't

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
higher than normal obviously we can't

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.830 
higher than normal obviously we can't
crank<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.280> truck<00:02:56.550> to<00:02:56.820> back<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.150> off<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.450> ramps

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
crank the truck to back it off the ramps

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.390 
crank the truck to back it off the ramps
because<00:02:58.080> it<00:02:58.230> doesn't<00:02:58.530> have<00:02:58.620> any<00:02:58.770> oil<00:02:58.830> in<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.250> so

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
because it doesn't have any oil in it so

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.820 
because it doesn't have any oil in it so
in<00:03:00.210> order<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.570> reach<00:03:00.780> up<00:03:00.990> there<00:03:01.170> in<00:03:01.350> some<00:03:01.590> cases

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
in order to reach up there in some cases

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.770 
in order to reach up there in some cases
you<00:03:02.220> might<00:03:02.400> need<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.610> step<00:03:02.910> stool<00:03:02.940> or<00:03:03.390> some<00:03:03.570> type

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
you might need a step stool or some type

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.100 
you might need a step stool or some type
of<00:03:03.810> stand<00:03:05.240> that<00:03:06.240> will<00:03:06.330> help<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.630> add<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.960> oil

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
of stand that will help you add the oil

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.350 
of stand that will help you add the oil
in<00:03:07.350> there<00:03:07.560> without<00:03:08.310> having<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.940> reach<00:03:09.180> up

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
in there without having to reach up

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.390 
in there without having to reach up
there<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.600> stretch<00:03:10.080> and<00:03:10.380> potentially<00:03:11.070> maybe

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
there and stretch and potentially maybe

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.270 
there and stretch and potentially maybe
risk<00:03:11.760> spilling<00:03:12.150> it

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
risk spilling it

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.430 
risk spilling it
now<00:03:15.280> we're<00:03:15.520> ready<00:03:15.610> to<00:03:15.730> remove<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.090> funnel<00:03:16.570> and

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
put the oil cap back on now we check the

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.550 
put the oil cap back on now we check the
old<00:03:21.670> level<00:03:21.970> first<00:03:22.540> remove<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:22.990> dipstick<00:03:23.140> and

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460 
wipe the old oil off we'll reinsert the

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:35.070 
wipe the old oil off we'll reinsert the
dipstick<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:33.270> now<00:03:34.270> we<00:03:34.330> remove<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.780> dipstick

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
dipstick and now we remove the dipstick

dipstick and now we remove the dipstick
the<00:03:36.040> OL<00:03:36.190> level<00:03:36.490> will<00:03:36.610> probably<00:03:36.640> be<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:36.970> little

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
the OL level will probably be a little

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.640 
the OL level will probably be a little
high<00:03:37.270> at<00:03:37.420> this<00:03:37.540> point<00:03:37.660> because<00:03:38.170> there's<00:03:38.350> no

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
high at this point because there's no

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.350 
high at this point because there's no
