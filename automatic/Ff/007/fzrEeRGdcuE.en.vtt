give you money basically so the synergy
essentially<00:00:47.430> as<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.149> say<00:00:48.360> design<00:00:48.719> for<00:00:48.960> ladies

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
essentially as I say design for ladies

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.310 
essentially as I say design for ladies
and<00:00:49.489> it's<00:00:50.489> an<00:00:50.670> entry-level<00:00:51.000> wetsuits<00:00:51.510> next<00:00:52.079> to

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
and it's an entry-level wetsuits next to

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.260 
and it's an entry-level wetsuits next to
expensive<00:00:52.890> than<00:00:53.160> for<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.489> flat<00:00:53.730> box<00:00:53.969> seats

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
expensive than for the flat box seats

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.479 
expensive than for the flat box seats
which<00:00:55.110> refers<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> seams<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.280> wet

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
which refers to the seams of the wet

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.729 
which refers to the seams of the wet
suit<00:00:56.730> you're<00:00:57.450> talking<00:00:57.809> well<00:00:57.989> over<00:00:58.200> 100<00:00:58.559> pounds

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
suit you're talking well over 100 pounds

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.740 
suit you're talking well over 100 pounds
so<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.399> really<00:00:59.760> good<00:00:59.850> quality<00:01:00.329> see<00:01:00.480> for

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
so it's a really good quality see for

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.229 
so it's a really good quality see for
that<00:01:00.780> sort<00:01:01.110> of<00:01:01.140> price<00:01:01.559> point<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.789> when<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.120> do

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
that sort of price point so when we do

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.310 
that sort of price point so when we do
talk<00:01:03.390> about<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> same<00:01:03.809> thing<00:01:04.049> you've<00:01:04.170> got<00:01:04.289> a

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
talk about the same thing you've got a

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.920 
talk about the same thing you've got a
two<00:01:04.500> different<00:01:04.649> option<00:01:05.189> flatlock<00:01:05.930> basically

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
two different option flatlock basically

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.779 
two different option flatlock basically
flat<00:01:07.109> lock<00:01:07.319> for<00:01:07.499> that<00:01:07.529> returns<00:01:07.889> as<00:01:08.130> refers<00:01:08.609> to

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:08.789 
flat lock for that returns as refers to

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:10.459 
flat lock for that returns as refers to
as<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:08.969> say<00:01:09.149> is<00:01:09.359> the<00:01:09.479> seen<00:01:09.749> something<00:01:10.139> like<00:01:10.170> soup

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:10.469 
as I say is the seen something like soup

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:12.319 
as I say is the seen something like soup
and<00:01:11.340> basically<00:01:11.639> that's<00:01:11.759> two<00:01:11.999> pieces<00:01:12.299> of

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
and basically that's two pieces of

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:13.910 
and basically that's two pieces of
neoprene<00:01:12.719> buttered<00:01:13.079> up<00:01:13.139> together<00:01:13.319> and<00:01:13.679> then

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
neoprene buttered up together and then

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.730 
neoprene buttered up together and then
stitched<00:01:14.249> flat<00:01:14.609> together<00:01:14.819> okay<00:01:15.659> makes<00:01:16.619> it

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
stitched flat together okay makes it

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.499 
stitched flat together okay makes it
very<00:01:16.829> robust<00:01:17.219> but<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.639> does<00:01:17.819> mean<00:01:17.999> that<00:01:18.060> it's

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
very robust but it does mean that it's

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.330 
very robust but it does mean that it's
breathable<00:01:18.990> seems<00:01:19.349> so<00:01:19.799> they<00:01:20.009> will<00:01:20.130> release

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
breathable seems so they will release

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.039 
breathable seems so they will release
basically<00:01:21.029> water<00:01:21.270> does<00:01:21.539> come<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.810> through<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
basically water does come in through the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.440 
basically water does come in through the
seems<00:01:22.349> just<00:01:23.099> fine<00:01:23.159> for<00:01:23.490> summer<00:01:23.729> honestly<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
to have a bit of technology they stitch

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.199 
to have a bit of technology they stitch
the<00:01:34.439> two<00:01:34.679> piece<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.950> new<00:01:35.099> bring<00:01:35.310> together<00:01:35.459> they

00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:36.209 
the two piece of new bring together they

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:37.819 
the two piece of new bring together they
stitch<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.569> halfway<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.529> other<00:01:37.590> side

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829

they<00:01:38.009> glue<00:01:38.219> it<00:01:38.369> basically<00:01:39.149> as<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.329> can

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
they glue it basically as you can

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.629 
they glue it basically as you can
imagine<00:01:39.569> that<00:01:39.749> just<00:01:40.049> seals<00:01:40.289> the<00:01:40.409> same<00:01:40.679> means

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:41.639 
imagine that just seals the same means

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:43.519 
imagine that just seals the same means
that<00:01:41.789> no<00:01:42.270> water<00:01:42.479> comes<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:42.990> through<00:01:43.169> there<00:01:43.319> so

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:43.529 
that no water comes in through there so

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:45.499 
that no water comes in through there so
it<00:01:43.590> keeps<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.219> lot<00:01:44.549> drier<00:01:44.849> more

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
it keeps you a lot drier more

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.019 
it keeps you a lot drier more
comfortable<00:01:45.989> and<00:01:46.229> warmer<00:01:46.619> for<00:01:47.369> longer<00:01:47.459> in<00:01:47.880> the

00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:48.029 
comfortable and warmer for longer in the

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:49.720 
comfortable and warmer for longer in the
water<00:01:48.239> so

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
water so

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.840 
water so
picture<00:01:50.270> I<00:01:50.800> just<00:01:51.800> met<00:01:51.950> sue<00:01:52.130> obviously<00:01:52.580> harder

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
picture I just met sue obviously harder

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.120 
picture I just met sue obviously harder
to<00:01:52.970> make<00:01:53.120> it<00:01:53.300> it<00:01:53.390> makes<00:01:53.540> it<00:01:53.720> more<00:01:53.840> expensive

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
to make it it makes it more expensive

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.900 
to make it it makes it more expensive
but<00:01:55.130> that's<00:01:55.280> what<00:01:55.430> you<00:01:55.490> get<00:01:55.610> for<00:01:55.670> your<00:01:55.850> money

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
but that's what you get for your money

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.450 
but that's what you get for your money
essentially<00:01:56.450> okay<00:01:57.320> maybe<00:01:57.860> wants<00:01:58.070> a<00:01:58.130> different

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
essentially okay maybe wants a different

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.220 
essentially okay maybe wants a different
start<00:01:58.700> our<00:01:58.880> parts<00:01:59.210> of<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.390> Signet<00:01:59.750> equality

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
start our parts of the Signet equality

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.110 
start our parts of the Signet equality
in<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.380> near<00:02:00.530> free<00:02:00.830> and<00:02:01.400> now<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.640> xmas<00:02:02.000> of

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
in the near free and now the xmas of

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.090 
in the near free and now the xmas of
neutering<00:02:02.420> with<00:02:02.600> both<00:02:02.720> pieces<00:02:03.140> are<00:02:03.320> 32<00:02:03.740> so<00:02:04.040> you

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
neutering with both pieces are 32 so you

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.890 
neutering with both pieces are 32 so you
get<00:02:04.220> three<00:02:04.460> million<00:02:05.090> on<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.300> lower<00:02:05.450> body<00:02:05.690> and

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
get three million on the lower body and

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.810 
get three million on the lower body and
then<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.530> know<00:02:06.710> on<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:06.980> other<00:02:07.160> body<00:02:07.310> we<00:02:07.580> need<00:02:07.790> a

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
then to know on the other body we need a

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.080 
then to know on the other body we need a
bit<00:02:07.970> more<00:02:08.000> flexibility<00:02:08.660> okay<00:02:09.500> so<00:02:10.130> that's

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
bit more flexibility okay so that's

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.390 
bit more flexibility okay so that's
basically<00:02:11.210> we<00:02:11.480> refer<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:11.990> an<00:02:12.110> was<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.350> 3-2<00:02:12.860> now

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
basically we refer to an was a 3-2 now

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.800 
basically we refer to an was a 3-2 now

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
having said that it's not the most

having said that it's not the most
flexible<00:02:29.780> in<00:02:29.870> agreeable<00:02:30.320> market<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:31.580> still

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
flexible in agreeable market you still

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.190 
flexible in agreeable market you still
get<00:02:31.910> that<00:02:32.090> but<00:02:32.300> you<00:02:32.390> get<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:32.540> at<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.720> very<00:02:32.960> small

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
get that but you get it at a very small

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.390 
get that but you get it at a very small
portion<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.680> suit<00:02:33.950> where<00:02:34.100> it<00:02:34.220> really

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
portion of the suit where it really

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.680 
portion of the suit where it really
shouldn't<00:02:34.670> make<00:02:34.880> too<00:02:34.910> much<00:02:35.120> of<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.330> difference

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
shouldn't make too much of a difference

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.660 
shouldn't make too much of a difference
around<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.620> sort<00:02:36.800> of<00:02:36.830> little<00:02:36.980> part<00:02:37.280> here<00:02:37.340> and

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
around the sort of little part here and

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.790 
around the sort of little part here and
then<00:02:38.600> on<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.810> upper<00:02:38.990> body<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.290> get<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.530> ultra

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
then on the upper body you get the ultra

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.560 
then on the upper body you get the ultra
stretch<00:02:40.040> which<00:02:40.220> is<00:02:40.370> very<00:02:40.670> very<00:02:40.850> soft<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.450> very

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
stretch which is very very soft and very

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.600 
stretch which is very very soft and very
flexible<00:02:42.230> instead<00:02:42.740> of<00:02:42.770> demonstrated<00:02:43.400> their

feels great on the skin sticks to your
body<00:02:45.890> better<00:02:46.130> gives<00:02:46.550> you<00:02:46.640> more<00:02:46.760> flexibility

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
body better gives you more flexibility

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.180 
body better gives you more flexibility
and<00:02:47.690> makes<00:02:48.380> you<00:02:48.440> more<00:02:48.530> comfortable<00:02:48.590> in<00:02:49.130> the

and makes you more comfortable in the
water<00:02:49.220> as<00:02:49.610> well<00:02:49.730> ok<00:02:50.300> so<00:02:50.810> i'll<00:02:50.870> see<00:02:51.080> the

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
water as well ok so i'll see the

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.570 
water as well ok so i'll see the
difference<00:02:51.500> between<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:51.860> two<00:02:52.010> grades<00:02:52.340> there

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
difference between the two grades there

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.820 
difference between the two grades there
we<00:02:53.570> still<00:02:53.750> got<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:53.870> shiny<00:02:54.140> stuff<00:02:54.410> on<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.590> top

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
we still got a shiny stuff on the top

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.100 
we still got a shiny stuff on the top
and<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.490> course<00:02:55.730> of<00:02:55.880> stuff<00:02:56.060> on<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.300> bottom<00:02:56.330> ok

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
and the course of stuff on the bottom ok

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.810 
and the course of stuff on the bottom ok
further<00:02:57.770> down<00:02:57.950> you<00:02:58.160> get<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:58.370> as<00:02:58.520> well<00:02:58.670> you

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
further down you get that as well you

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.070 
further down you get that as well you
get<00:02:58.940> it<00:02:59.030> run<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.209> ankles<00:02:59.570> so<00:02:59.780> it<00:02:59.840> makes<00:02:59.990> it

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
get it run the ankles so it makes it

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.449 
get it run the ankles so it makes it
easier<00:03:00.440> to<00:03:00.470> get<00:03:00.650> your<00:03:00.740> foot<00:03:00.890> through<00:03:01.160> you<00:03:01.310> get

easier to get your foot through you get

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.130 
easier to get your foot through you get
around<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.760> knees<00:03:02.000> you<00:03:02.390> get<00:03:02.570> unrestricted

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
around the knees you get unrestricted

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.720 
around the knees you get unrestricted
movement<00:03:03.170> really<00:03:03.709> needs<00:03:03.890> then<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:04.490> get<00:03:04.640> it

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
movement really needs then you get it

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.900 
100 pounds and looks great as well and
once<00:04:35.740> you<00:04:35.830> pay<00:04:35.979> for<00:04:36.190> a<00:04:36.220> little<00:04:36.340> bit<00:04:36.490> more<00:04:36.760> then

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
once you pay for a little bit more then

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.330 
once you pay for a little bit more then
basically<00:04:37.120> with<00:04:37.870> GBS<00:04:38.260> soup<00:04:38.500> primarily<00:04:39.190> the

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
basically with GBS soup primarily the

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.500 
basically with GBS soup primarily the
biggest<00:04:39.610> difference<00:04:39.729> obviously<00:04:40.030> being<00:04:40.389> the

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
biggest difference obviously being the

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.330 
biggest difference obviously being the
seams<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:41.380> quality<00:04:41.770> of<00:04:41.800> neoprene<00:04:42.160> is

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
seams the quality of neoprene is

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.530 
seams the quality of neoprene is
actually<00:04:42.610> pretty<00:04:42.820> much<00:04:42.940> the<00:04:43.090> same<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.419> whole

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
actually pretty much the same the whole

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.520 
actually pretty much the same the whole
way<00:04:43.690> through<00:04:43.930> the<00:04:44.020> suit<00:04:44.200> so<00:04:44.320> you<00:04:44.410> get<00:04:44.500> a

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
way through the suit so you get a

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.500 
way through the suit so you get a
flexible<00:04:45.040> stuff<00:04:45.280> in<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.490> other<00:04:45.610> body<00:04:45.850> on<00:04:46.360> the

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
flexible stuff in the other body on the

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.460 
flexible stuff in the other body on the
lower<00:04:46.660> ball<00:04:46.840> you<00:04:46.930> get<00:04:47.080> a<00:04:47.110> bit<00:04:47.229> more<00:04:47.290> at<00:04:47.410> the

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
lower ball you get a bit more at the

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.080 
lower ball you get a bit more at the
core<00:04:47.680> stuff<00:04:48.010> you<00:04:48.340> still<00:04:48.550> get<00:04:48.610> the<00:04:48.669> duraflex

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
core stuff you still get the duraflex

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.120 
core stuff you still get the duraflex
and<00:04:49.300> knee<00:04:49.360> pads<00:04:49.389> so<00:04:50.200> the<00:04:50.289> main<00:04:50.620> difference

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
and knee pads so the main difference

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.980
