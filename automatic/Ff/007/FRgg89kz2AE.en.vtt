 so with which he was then 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.590

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:20.720
 I normally hang out 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.539
 the balance is good 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.390
 the ultimate number 10 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.390
 at midnight but for the 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.350
 their weapons 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.350
 the new relay runner 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.750
 the balanced is precarious 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.190
 currently the country is in the grip of a rebellion 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.540
 do the guests have any regrets compared to October 2009 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.190
 Too beautiful role individually 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.149

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.390
 no 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.430
 this time against 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.370
 for example 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.740
 there were the Maghreb people 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.010
 how can they 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.530

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.729

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.729
 to achieve this is not true 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.840
 in Germany the year 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.840
 come what may 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.040
 to get there the day before 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.010

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.500
 indeed a month ago 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.060
 my husband was telling me 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.460
 daniel bellemare 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.460
 trichet 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.950
 you are 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.080
 he has written afp 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.080
 that's at least 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.039
 him at least 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.039
 the criirad at the 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:20.090
 first he is 'green' Palestinian mahmoud abbas I was informed 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.390
 the authorities not to have held a table as soon as possible during 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.719
 harvest 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.719

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:32.030

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.600
 web page addresses and he believes in it 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.879
 three of them managed his next outing 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.400
 that's where 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.099
 that's going to happen 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.099
 he could come back 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:12.190
 that's why it's so easy that it's done 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.299
 in this sense 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.859
 it is 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.069

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.529
 you will have it 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:26.969
 That's what happened 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:29.969
 this service is for 

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:32.730
 in this sense 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.859
 in this sense 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.859
 if I'm on

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:08.679

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.109
 although she was 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.759
