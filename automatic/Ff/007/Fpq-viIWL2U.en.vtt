00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.850
 Too expensive, too cumbersome, and indeed 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.139
 Why do we have side-by-side, if we live together? 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:09.139
 But the four-door refrigerator from Sharp can be an alternative to it. 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:11.290
 Sharp says big fridge is big 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.290
 opportunities. 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.769
 Let's see if this is so. 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.720
 Before us are representatives of the four-door type, squad 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.720
 ordinary. 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.300
 Ordinary because Sharp has more design 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.489
 series, but they are much more expensive. 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.430
 But our copies are not inferior to them in attractiveness. 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.899
 Symmetrical doors, the ability to choose the appropriate color. 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.259
 Moreover, they are not as huge as most. 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.259
 Sides 

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:35.940
 Here everything is compact and to the point. 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.970
 The doors are thin and light - even a child is not difficult 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.379
 open them and they take up less space when 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:42.379
 opening 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.531
 Most products can be put inside by opening 

00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:47.100
 only one door - this way less going out 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.289
 cold air, and it also saves electricity. 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.329
 But tighter recall that it is still side-by-side 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.739
 and their sizes are larger than ordinary refrigerators, therefore 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.559
 There may be difficulties with the passage of the standard 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.010
 doorway. 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.159
 However, doors are removed from refrigerators, which allows 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.720
 still carry them through the doorway of an ordinary apartment. 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.220
 Immediately say about the differences. 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.110
 In addition to volume and color, refrigerators differ in handles - they 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.650
 can be located on the door or be hidden 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.330
 there is already someone more comfortable. 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.440
 The internal design is no frills, but it provides a large 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.330
 amount of free space. 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.720
 Shelves made of shock-resistant glass - you can safely 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.380
 put heavy pans. 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.350
 There is a convenient folding shelf for a bottle or 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.700
 small cans. 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.000
 Capacious box for fruits and vegetables with a lid 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.920
 - easily and conveniently put forward. 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.590
 Near two smaller drawers - the so-called zone of freshness. 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.610
 Lower temperatures are maintained in these areas. 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.540
 and high humidity, and these conditions are perfect 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.880
 for the long-term preservation of freshness of fruits, herbs, 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.470
 chilled meat or fish. 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.210
 By the way, these departments can be used for careful 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.910
 defrosting products. 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.860
 Of course, the doors also have shelves and a compartment with a lid 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.140
 for spicy products. 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.670
 An interesting solution is a wide lower shelf-balcony. 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.640
 Volumetric cans or bottles fit perfectly here. 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.340
 And if you install a separator, you can put the capacity 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.229
 standard sizes in two rows - very roomy! 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.000
 In the refrigerator compartment is good lighting. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.749
 Here, too, there are differences - with refrigerators with hidden 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:18.409
 the handles use ordinary lamps, and the models with handles 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.019
 on the doors - LED-lights. 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.219
 As we have said many times, each manufacturer 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.230
 have their own trick. 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.240
 And Sharp has 3 interesting technologies. 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.850
 First, note the hybrid cooling system. 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.260
 It consists of the familiar and painfully familiar Nou 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.150
 Frost, and also from a simple, but effective detail - aluminum 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.599
 plate, which not only cools the air, but also nourishes 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.950
 its moisture. 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.319
 Cold and humid air evenly distributed 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.980
 by separation, preventing chapping and dryness 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.639
 products. 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:51.010
 The next technology that deserves attention is Plasmacluster. 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.719
 The system saturates the air inside the refrigerator positively 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:56.609
 and negatively charged particles that impede 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.020
 multiplication of bacteria, and it allows you to forget about 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.349
 foul odor inside the fridge and extend 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.629
 shelf life of various products. 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.450
 The freshness of the air in the refrigerator compartment is maintained and special. 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.829
 cellular freshener. 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.041
 The freezer is also roomy and comfortable. 

00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:12.041
 is organized. 

00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:14.599
 There are boxes for freezing and storage of different sizes. 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.680
 - each product will be in its place, it is easy to find 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.680
 and get it. 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.200
 The highlight of the freezer is 2 ice generators. 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.049
 We fill these containers with water, let them freeze, and then 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.349
 pour ready ice into the container in one turn 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:27.349
 pens. 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.139
 Refrigerators with handles on the door second generator 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.109
 ice is slightly improved - here the capacity is 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.469
 metal plate made of special 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:37.610
 metal, which perfectly keeps the cold and accelerates 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.090
 The process of freezing ice cubes. 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.950
 Fridge control is push-button and there is a display 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:43.950
 backlit. 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.840
 It seemed to us not very successful block location 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.139
 management - a tall person will have to bend every time. 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.780
 But there are all the necessary functions. 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.120
 The temperature is set separately for refrigeration. 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.419
 and freezer. 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.939
 By the way, models with hidden handles have built-in 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:59.909
 Thermometer in the refrigerator compartment. 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.620
 To verify compliance with a given and existing 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.889
 temperature in the refrigerator, click here this 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.719
 button - if within an hour it becomes blue 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:10.579
 colors, so the temperature is all right. 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.340
 Other familiar features include Vacation mode to save 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.209
 electricity during your absence, blocking 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.669
 from children and fast freezing in the freezer. 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.069
 Separately, we note 2 functions. 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:22.120
 Fast ice - in 20 minutes you can get 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.490
 a whole container of ice, which is useful in summer 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.430
 or during a party; Timer - refrigerator can 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.740
 program for a specific time after which he 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.270
 will beep. 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.310
 A very convenient function - for example, while cooking, 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.960
 when you put in the fridge infuse some 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.110
 sauce and after a certain time you need to get it. 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.110
 Let's sum up. 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.550
 Sharp side buy sides are really roomy and really 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.890
 capable refrigerators. 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.680
 A bunch of interesting technologies and solutions makes devices 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.860
 very attractive. 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.190
 And believe me, if you have this refrigerator, you will find, 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.650
 how to fill it and feel the benefits of such 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.009
 amount of free space what to say 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:00.379
 about the ability to properly store each product!
