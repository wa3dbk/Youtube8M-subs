00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.389 
nose of a polar bear is apparently uber
sensitive<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:04.170> if<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.829> strike<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.130> hard

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
sensitive and if you strike it hard

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.449 
sensitive and if you strike it hard
enough<00:02:05.490> that's<00:02:06.090> usually<00:02:06.360> enough<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:07.340> scare<00:02:08.340> it

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
enough that's usually enough to scare it

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.510 
enough that's usually enough to scare it
away<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:09.209> he<00:02:09.450> did<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.050> he<00:02:10.440> reared<00:02:11.160> up<00:02:11.340> as

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
away so he did just that he reared up as

and the group got together and actually

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.449 
and the group got together and actually
tried<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.020> track<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.500> but<00:02:43.709> at<00:02:44.100> three<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.430> the

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459

tried to track it but at three in the
morning<00:02:44.790> in<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:44.940> middle<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.959> summer<00:02:46.230> and

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410

none<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:46.769> I<00:02:46.920> guess<00:02:47.100> it<00:02:47.250> gets<00:02:47.370> quite<00:02:47.580> a<00:02:47.610> foggy

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
none of it I guess it gets quite a foggy

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.130 
none of it I guess it gets quite a foggy
up<00:02:48.090> there<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:48.360> they<00:02:48.420> weren't<00:02:48.570> able<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.930> track

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
have happened if the guy had actually

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.810 
have happened if the guy had actually
had<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.320> shotgun<00:02:55.650> closed<00:02:56.100> what<00:02:56.400> you've<00:02:56.580> gotten

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
a raw shot off would it have been enough

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.550 
a raw shot off would it have been enough
to<00:02:59.370> stop<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.700> polar<00:02:59.850> bear<00:03:00.260> would<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.350> polar
