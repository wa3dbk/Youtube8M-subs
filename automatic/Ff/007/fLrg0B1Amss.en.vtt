00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:06.600
 DVD review and next week starts in 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.639
 the german cinemas one 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.860
 Music documentary about one direction 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.690
 and watching this teen boyband 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.460
 most are either absolute fan 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.870
 there can find absolutely ridiculous but I 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.550
 still want to try some 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.250
 most neutral look at it 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.170
 and I have seen the doku in advance and 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.699
 there is now also the action 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.699
 until is 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:50.000
 this costs the eu minister trade 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.829
 more 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.870
 Session of the sg 92 minutes from 0 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.870
 released years and runs from the 12th 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.450
 september 2013 in German cinemas 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.610
 tells the story of these five 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.890
 guys at the year 2010 at x-factor 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.660
 occurred briefly to a band together 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.910
 have been closed and only 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.370
 third place was short on the ground 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.320
 but they realize that it destroyed 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.780
 a huge fanbase behind him 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.250
 are they without hesitation Support 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.560
 and she actually in the billboard 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.120
 move charts to the top and 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.010
 this phenomenon then becomes a worldwide one 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.170
 chrysler from one direction with one of 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.900
 most successful bands of their generation 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.670
 and role models for many young fans and 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.090
 them around the world and no 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.740
 accompanied lower than in the morning blog 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.180
 The whole morning burger might know 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.070
 you choose the other like super size 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.570
 me or even the documentation of the 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.070
 greatest mobile what's up here 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.450
 he has always been introduced 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.280
 a slightly ironic look at things 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.200
 can now throw a staged notice 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.030
 that he does not want to expose the boys 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.770
 still the whole to teenie lastig 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.270
 wants to design and that's why one 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.140
 direction I'm completely honest myself 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.640
 never had anything against you 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.040
 Documentation like Justin Biebers never 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.990
 say never on the one hand for fans 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.060
 an absolute must I what your idols 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.710
 experience different private moments 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.910
 but I think so too 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.440
 actually I can say yes with his 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.960
 band still does not start anything yet 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.490
 interesting look at a phenomenon of 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.680
 castingshows and that's what I mean 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.790
 successful casting shows not like in 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.080
 germany this whole germany 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.000
 look for the superstar shit where 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.860
 In the meantime, never get out of it . No 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.810
 on the international parquet he stand 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.100
 really sometimes a real talent 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.590
 great look at such a phenomenon 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.420
 on fans on love on the big stage 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.130
 so does your children on parents too 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.600
 to let little into the wide world 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.580
 need and a big big adventure 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.440
 where the camera live and 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.000
 so it is interesting to see 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.400
 cinema like the big stage of 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.050
 visited by thousands and thousands of people 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.400
 played these few guys and how 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.560
 the experience then still behind the 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.390
 stage further but will in the end also 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.040
 somehow small teams are just that 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.840
 Just want to play everything sounds 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.610
 funny but exactly this easy 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.020
 psychological aspect as a human 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.700
 behaves when he is such a world 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.470
 being thrown in is interesting 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.640
 here also respectfully implemented 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.800
 that's why the action 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.970
 This is a music documentary that I 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.080
 A little expected in this direction 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.490
 just stop with a little circle 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.349
 already the fans and around the globe 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.490
 but also with the certain charm and 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.229
 respect that I have to say that is 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.030
 somehow quite interesting and cool 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:40.069
 boys partly stayed on the ground 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.539
 and not just celebrate yourself 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:43.250
 that's why it's one for fans 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:44.990
 definitive recommendation and for all 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.430
 others that could possibly be one 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.659
 then you might even look at it 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.389
 strike must say look at the 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:51.560
 but only the 3d with the 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:52.939
 I have to present the film 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.969
 attack that is not really 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:57.169
 worthwhile at this point but yes man 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:58.580
 Of course, try the last euro 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:00.169
 to squeeze out water as 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.819
 Documentation there are none with me 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.349
 Evaluation I 'm curious what he has to do 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:04.669
 says I would guess that anyway 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:05.840
 although I try to go here 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.849
 most differentiate either 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.110
 generally find the band toy or stupid 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:11.449
 That's why I'm curious and excited 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.129
 I'm also curious if you have ideas or 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:14.569
 tips have similar stripes in 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:16.039
 this direction likes to write in the 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:17.900
 comments of all pigs sorry or 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:19.490
 I'm so curious if I'm something 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.000
 are blanket what I do not know ok 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.529
 friends 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.110
 that 's it for me too 

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:25.789
 my speech immigrant action stars like 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.740
 said there is no rating ball 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:29.060
 Documentation like to read a thumb there 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.740
 if you made my territory leave it 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.270
 stay if not like when you look 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.680
