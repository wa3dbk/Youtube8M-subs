purposes a the fact that I'm playing it
with<00:00:51.199> sticks<00:00:51.559> is<00:00:51.769> going<00:00:52.219> to<00:00:52.280> make<00:00:52.429> it<00:00:52.519> a<00:00:52.579> lot

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
with sticks is going to make it a lot

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.219 
with sticks is going to make it a lot
more<00:00:52.819> musical<00:00:53.300> than<00:00:53.420> if<00:00:53.539> I'm<00:00:53.690> just<00:00:53.899> using<00:00:54.079> a

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:54.229 
more musical than if I'm just using a

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:56.399 
more musical than if I'm just using a
mouse<00:00:54.409> to<00:00:54.469> click<00:00:54.829> it<00:00:55.039> into<00:00:55.249> a<00:00:55.280> grid<00:00:55.670> and

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
mouse to click it into a grid and

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:59.529 
mouse to click it into a grid and
another<00:00:57.409> aspect<00:00:58.100> of<00:00:58.339> doing<00:00:58.729> it<00:00:58.940> this<00:00:59.089> way<00:00:59.149> is

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
another aspect of doing it this way is

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.270 
another aspect of doing it this way is
you're<00:00:59.960> actually<00:01:00.350> creating<00:01:00.589> parts<00:01:01.129> that

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
you're actually creating parts that

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.729 
you're actually creating parts that
people<00:01:01.309> can<00:01:01.699> then<00:01:01.850> play<00:01:02.589> because<00:01:03.589> you've

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
people can then play because you've

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.760 
people can then play because you've
already<00:01:03.859> done<00:01:04.070> it<00:01:04.250> once<00:01:05.380> so<00:01:06.380> let's<00:01:06.560> take<00:01:06.740> a

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
already done it once so let's take a

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.200 
already done it once so let's take a
look<00:01:06.979> at<00:01:07.100> how<00:01:07.190> you<00:01:07.250> put<00:01:07.520> this<00:01:07.640> together<00:01:07.820> to

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
look at how you put this together to

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.000 
look at how you put this together to
create<00:01:09.140> a<00:01:09.230> drum<00:01:09.470> corps<00:01:09.650> style<00:01:09.920> part<00:01:11.770> okay<00:01:12.770> as

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
create a drum corps style part okay as

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.250 
create a drum corps style part okay as

ahead<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:08.209> use<00:04:08.299> that<00:04:08.599> so<00:04:08.780> all<00:04:08.900> I<00:04:08.959> need<00:04:09.140> to<00:04:09.230> do

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
ahead and use that so all I need to do

00:04:09.349 --> 00:05:19.590 
ahead and use that so all I need to do
is<00:04:09.470> slip<00:04:09.650> it<00:04:09.769> back<00:04:09.890> in<00:04:10.069> to<00:04:10.160> record

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.880 

there<00:05:20.600> they<00:05:20.660> go<00:05:20.690> it's<00:05:21.200> not<00:05:21.320> simple<00:05:21.680> to<00:05:21.710> put

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
there they go it's not simple to put

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.760 
there they go it's not simple to put
together<00:05:21.980> a<00:05:22.220> group

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.740 

now<00:05:27.770> that's<00:05:27.980> occupies<00:05:28.550> just<00:05:28.880> one<00:05:29.120> group<00:05:29.420> spot

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
now that's occupies just one group spot

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.590 
now that's occupies just one group spot
within<00:05:30.020> the<00:05:30.200> bfd2<00:05:30.560> groove<00:05:30.950> engine<00:05:31.390> you<00:05:32.390> can<00:05:32.510> go

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
within the bfd2 groove engine you can go

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.060 
within the bfd2 groove engine you can go
ahead<00:05:32.690> and<00:05:32.930> start<00:05:33.110> with<00:05:33.230> a<00:05:33.260> fresh<00:05:33.500> clean<00:05:33.740> one

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
ahead and start with a fresh clean one

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.360 
ahead and start with a fresh clean one
and<00:05:34.490> then<00:05:34.910> you<00:05:34.970> can<00:05:35.120> use<00:05:35.240> b-52's<00:05:35.980> tools<00:05:36.980> and

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
and then you can use b-52's tools and

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.340 
and then you can use b-52's tools and
start<00:05:37.850> interchanging<00:05:38.630> parts<00:05:38.870> from<00:05:39.020> different

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
start interchanging parts from different

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.100 
start interchanging parts from different
grooves<00:05:39.530> moving<00:05:40.010> things<00:05:40.220> around<00:05:40.870> also<00:05:41.870> to

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
grooves moving things around also to

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.140 
grooves moving things around also to
draw<00:05:42.440> your<00:05:42.620> attention<00:05:43.010> to<00:05:43.040> the<00:05:43.340> left-hand
