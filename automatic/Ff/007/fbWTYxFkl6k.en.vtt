00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.610 
there's one problem with this which
you'll<00:02:13.280> see<00:02:13.310> shortly<00:02:17.200> makes<00:02:18.200> finishing<00:02:18.560> a

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
you'll see shortly makes finishing a

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.780 
you'll see shortly makes finishing a
little<00:02:18.860> trivial<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:21.590> explosion<00:02:22.010> again<00:02:22.430> can

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
little trivial the explosion again can

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.000 
little trivial the explosion again can
kill<00:02:23.090> you<00:02:23.239> is<00:02:23.329> he<00:02:23.389> had<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.540> be<00:02:23.630> careful<00:02:24.010> but

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
kill you is he had to be careful but

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.430 
kill you is he had to be careful but
that's<00:02:25.160> not<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.340> biggest<00:02:25.579> problem<00:02:26.290> now<00:02:27.290> that

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
that's not the biggest problem now that

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.039 
that's not the biggest problem now that
i<00:02:27.470> finished<00:02:27.769> level<00:02:27.889> guess<00:02:28.220> what<00:02:28.720> they<00:02:29.720> take<00:02:29.930> it

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
i finished level guess what they take it

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:37.260 
i finished level guess what they take it
away<00:02:30.760> sucks<00:02:31.760> doesn't<00:02:31.940> it<00:02:33.639> but

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.990 

because<00:02:38.170> of<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:38.770> and<00:02:39.130> because<00:02:39.220> it's<00:02:39.640> so<00:02:39.850> much

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
because of that and because it's so much

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.400 
because of that and because it's so much
more<00:02:40.150> difficult<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.600> kill<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.050> things<00:02:41.230> with

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
more difficult to kill the things with

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.070 
more difficult to kill the things with
bombs<00:02:42.210> and<00:02:43.210> because<00:02:43.600> there's<00:02:43.720> really<00:02:43.780> no

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
bombs and because there's really no

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.600 
bombs and because there's really no
incentive<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.530> do<00:02:44.650> so<00:02:44.680> I<00:02:44.920> just<00:02:45.250> stay<00:02:45.400> out<00:02:45.430> in

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
incentive to do so I just stay out in

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.120 
incentive to do so I just stay out in
this<00:02:45.700> part<00:02:46.260> it's<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.320> lot<00:02:47.500> easier<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.890> work<00:02:48.070> with

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
this part it's a lot easier to work with

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.560 
this part it's a lot easier to work with
cuz<00:02:48.370> you<00:02:48.460> have<00:02:48.550> an<00:02:48.640> actual<00:02:48.730> gun<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.420> can<00:02:49.510> shoot

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
cuz you have an actual gun you can shoot

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.030 
cuz you have an actual gun you can shoot
down<00:02:49.780> their<00:02:50.110> bullets<00:02:50.470> instead<00:02:50.680> of<00:02:50.830> having<00:02:50.950> to

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
down their bullets instead of having to

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.440 
down their bullets instead of having to
completely<00:02:51.310> avoid<00:02:51.520> them<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:52.150> have<00:02:52.240> more

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
completely avoid them and you have more

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.950 
completely avoid them and you have more
room<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.810> move<00:02:52.840> around<00:02:53.050> in<00:02:57.060> but<00:02:58.060> you've<00:02:58.750> seen

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
room to move around in but you've seen

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.590 
room to move around in but you've seen
