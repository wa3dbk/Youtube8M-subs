00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 let's show the heroic battle that 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.180
 they were asking me a lot but I could 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.639
 knowing mole was on a spree 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.490
 compose being that has its trick in the end 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.040
 I'm going to show you the children 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.129
 here the only trick is to follow the 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.800
 comic book sequence therefore we're going to 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:22.210
 let me put cool talk to you 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.210

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.140
 started the that's fine then let's go 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.990
 first to 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.980
 damage it a little bit the safest thing is that 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.980
 write the pony jr 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.649

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.649

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.140
 exact 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.230
 we hope that Moli gives him good 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.780
 We took turns to load a bit of 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.860
 blood and we want time to talk to the 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.860
 Punch 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.520

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.520
 how is it going 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.800
 now if we apply the diet 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.460
 the poor thing is a little bad 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.460

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.770
 ándale punchbowl is 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.180

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.180
 he still does not speak 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.570
 sleep a little 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.570

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.770
 and keeps dodging I do not care much 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.850

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.980
 I was throwing 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.189
 we keep perfect 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.810
 and a half in a little while 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.860

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.860
 pure fun with its kind 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.340
 to see what time it occurs to the 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.340
 artist speak 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.340
 i 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.870
 until finally 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.650
 when blood is little we 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.090
 to finish the fight like in the comic 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.130
 throwing his truck at him and my show goes 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.510
 Get your truck 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.159
 it automatically goes 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.159
 we are more or less well of blood 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.420
 nothing else is body in a little while is not 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.859
 so complicated the fight as it seems 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.859
 know if they give me one of the two children 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.060
 the healing cooked and finally I'm going 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.060
 to explain what I put to my mole 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.819
 that above all is the 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:49.130
 and made rest the placid this was 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.070
 optional but it is not so necessary this 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.970
 is the interesting one and see those life 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:04:01.030
 general 1 defense attack and that's all 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.030
