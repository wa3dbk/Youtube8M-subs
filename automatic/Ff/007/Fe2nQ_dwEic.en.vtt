00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.270
 i 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.209
 sometimes he does not think that he receives the one 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.160
 gathers the one who recovers the most the ball is the 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:15.589
 that has more party poetry than gala 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.720
 and they recovered much more than the 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.210
 that we recover in games 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.640
 keys because the first two goals of 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.029
 they are two ball recovery 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.160
 in their field what worries me 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.439
 is that in the second half before the 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.960
 five minutes is not the first time 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.290
 we end up turning a goal that 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.910
 it would disappear from what 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.290
 the vision is that he will put to think that 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.760
 maybe it 's better that we stay in the 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.670
 playing field 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.780
 in the middle of the locker room because every time 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.850
 that we go back to the locker room when 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.350
 we return to the field of play it would seem 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.190
 of nation we do not have the same 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.229
 concentration 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.359
 it may well be that they tie us 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:54.329
 match to the minute of game and it's not the 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:57.150
 first time it turns us into goals 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.520
 before five minutes 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.480
 find explanations of what was 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.480
 gone a while ago 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.179
 I already said earlier the divided the 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.750
 they won the first two goals 

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:14.600
 come from balls divided an aerial and 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.030
 another down in the midfield the two 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.580
 ahead of me 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.860
 the first one is air that goes cause entrance 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.600
 of avendaÃ±o will reject it twice from 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.670
 head 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.979
 and that's where the plays come from 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.619
 of the goal and the other is a ball that 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.540
 lock 34 times later it turns to 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.070
 further work in the field not these 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.220
 three or four times and they finish it 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:41.620
 leading from them 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:43.770
 and there one shows that maybe we did not have 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.990
 aggressiveness 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.939
 what do you have to have to recover a 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.700
 ball one has to know very well that 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.950
 the parties are all different the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.470
 first time of ours was was 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.800
 Right 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.420
 and the second one for sure that we 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.590
 we have to continue persevering in 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.940
 try to do what we did the 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.130
 last Sunday what we did in the 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.880
 first time and know very well I think of the 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.160
 second time 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.940
 if we keep making the mistakes that 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.330
 we have committed, I think it will cost us 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.330
 expensive
