like which gods in there but the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.639 
like which gods in there but the
starting<00:00:46.800> pop-up<00:00:47.280> box<00:00:47.520> if<00:00:47.760> you've<00:00:47.940> never<00:00:48.210> done

these<00:00:49.649> statues<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.579> severely<00:00:51.030> easy<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.780> I

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
these statues is severely easy it's I

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.860 
these statues is severely easy it's I
think<00:00:53.010> there's<00:00:53.340> like<00:00:53.489> four<00:00:53.760> choices<00:00:54.000> three<00:00:54.719> of

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
think there's like four choices three of

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.830 
think there's like four choices three of
them<00:00:54.960> ends<00:00:55.260> up<00:00:55.500> being<00:00:56.030> Slayer<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.329> then<00:00:57.539> want

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
them ends up being Slayer and then want

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.569 
them ends up being Slayer and then want
to<00:00:57.960> end<00:00:58.109> up<00:00:58.289> being<00:00:58.559> prayer<00:00:58.859> if<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.160> choose

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
to end up being prayer if you choose

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.209 
to end up being prayer if you choose
that<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.879> think<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.420> god<00:01:00.600> for<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:00.930> area<00:01:01.260> ends

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
that I think the god for that area ends

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.670 
that I think the god for that area ends
up<00:01:02.309> being<00:01:02.520> prayer<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.120> then<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.170> guess<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
up being prayer and then I guess the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.710 
up being prayer and then I guess the
gods<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.309> God<00:01:05.549> does<00:01:05.820> not<00:01:05.850> like<00:01:06.270> ends<00:01:06.600> up

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
gods that God does not like ends up

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.270 
gods that God does not like ends up
being<00:01:06.900> Slayer<00:01:07.350> because<00:01:07.650> one<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.890> them<00:01:08.100> will

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
being Slayer because one of them will

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.330 
being Slayer because one of them will
pop<00:01:08.490> out<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:09.659> fight<00:01:09.960> him<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.229> then<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:11.159> end

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340

than<00:03:53.769> using<00:03:53.980> i<00:03:54.190> think<00:03:54.400> i<00:03:54.489> have<00:03:54.519> a<00:03:54.610> maple<00:03:55.060> now<00:03:55.239> i

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
than using i think i have a maple now i

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.940 
than using i think i have a maple now i
know<00:03:55.720> i'm<00:03:55.959> not<00:03:56.110> going<00:03:56.290> to<00:03:56.320> be<00:03:56.440> fletching

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950
