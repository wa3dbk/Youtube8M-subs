we're<00:00:45.839> going<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.050> make<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.379> rail<00:00:46.589> 1.4<00:00:47.519> meters

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
we're going to make the rail 1.4 meters

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.540 
we're going to make the rail 1.4 meters
long<00:00:48.179> and<00:00:48.559> we're<00:00:49.559> going<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.769> make<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.070> 70

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
long and we're going to make it 70

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.430 
long and we're going to make it 70
centimeters<00:00:51.210> wide<00:00:51.449> which<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.839> the<00:00:52.079> width<00:00:52.289> of

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
centimeters wide which is the width of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.009 
centimeters wide which is the width of
the<00:00:52.589> bath<00:00:52.940> we've<00:00:53.940> also<00:00:54.120> measured<00:00:54.570> from<00:00:54.839> the

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
the bath we've also measured from the

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.829 
the bath we've also measured from the
plughole<00:00:55.230> up<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.159> made<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> mark<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.719> wall

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839

some masking tape on there so it's easy

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.380 
some masking tape on there so it's easy
to<00:01:25.229> mark<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.799> also<00:01:26.040> easy<00:01:26.399> to<00:01:26.579> drill<00:01:26.820> you're

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
to mark and also easy to drill you're

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.270 
to mark and also easy to drill you're
going<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.600> get<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.810> lined<00:01:28.049> up<00:01:28.259> properly<00:01:28.500> and

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
going to get it lined up properly and

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.499 
going to get it lined up properly and
then<00:01:29.399> we<00:01:29.549> going<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.790> make<00:01:31.219> some<00:01:32.219> marks<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:33.360> we

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
then we going to make some marks so we

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.889 
then we going to make some marks so we
can<00:01:33.689> drill<00:01:33.899> properly<00:01:35.509> so<00:01:36.509> now<00:01:36.689> we've

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
can drill properly so now we've

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:38.840 
can drill properly so now we've
translating<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.590> measurements<00:01:38.130> onto<00:01:38.759> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
translating the measurements onto the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.480 
translating the measurements onto the
pole<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:40.229> measurements<00:01:40.740> with<00:01:40.979> wise<00:01:41.250> are

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
pole and the measurements with wise are

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.450 
pole and the measurements with wise are
70<00:01:41.759> centimeters<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.920> remember<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.189> also

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
70 centimeters and remember you also

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.910 
70 centimeters and remember you also
have<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.210> include<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.020> elbow<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.680> and

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
have to include the elbow in this and

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.300 
have to include the elbow in this and
then<00:01:47.700> we're<00:01:47.820> going<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:47.969> cut<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.950> once<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.100> hold

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
then we're going to cut it once we hold

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.490 
then we're going to cut it once we hold
the<00:01:50.460> tube<00:01:50.670> firmly<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.270> place<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:52.289> really

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
the tube firmly in place and it's really

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.170 
the tube firmly in place and it's really
important<00:01:53.039> not<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.250> crush<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.700> tube<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.060> hold

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
important not to crush the tube and hold

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.060 
important not to crush the tube and hold
it<00:01:54.329> too<00:01:54.509> tightly<00:01:54.810> we're<00:01:55.530> going<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.799> cut<00:01:55.950> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
it too tightly we're going to cut the

that you put the glue inside the tube

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.440 
that you put the glue inside the tube
rather<00:02:18.770> than<00:02:18.980> on<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.250> elbow<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:20.090> once<00:02:20.270> you've
