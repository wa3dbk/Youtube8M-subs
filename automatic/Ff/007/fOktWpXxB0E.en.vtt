00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
you can sort of put up with it but if I

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:24.739 
you can sort of put up with it but if I
can<00:01:23.700> get<00:01:23.789> out<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.060> foot<00:01:24.240> injury<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.539> feel

me the Davis Cup obviously hurt losing
to<00:01:38.290> Switzerland<00:01:38.740> and<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:39.250> way<00:01:39.400> that<00:01:39.550> we<00:01:39.670> lost

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
to Switzerland and the way that we lost

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.150 
to Switzerland and the way that we lost
them<00:01:40.150> coming<00:01:40.480> awfully<00:01:41.050> close<00:01:41.380> and<00:01:41.650> I<00:01:41.890> felt

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
them coming awfully close and I felt

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.850 
them coming awfully close and I felt
like<00:01:42.310> it<00:01:42.520> was<00:01:42.640> a<00:01:42.720> fantastic<00:01:43.720> team<00:01:44.140> atmosphere

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
like it was a fantastic team atmosphere

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.070 
like it was a fantastic team atmosphere
and<00:01:45.370> environment<00:01:45.520> in<00:01:46.030> that<00:01:46.180> tie<00:01:46.360> as<00:01:46.630> well<00:01:46.840> so

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
and environment in that tie as well so

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.930 
and environment in that tie as well so
that<00:01:47.110> was<00:01:47.380> more<00:01:47.920> disappointing<00:01:48.550> not<00:01:48.640> to<00:01:48.700> get

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
that was more disappointing not to get

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.580 
that was more disappointing not to get
that<00:01:49.060> win<00:01:49.240> against<00:01:49.510> those<00:01:49.660> guys<00:01:49.720> I<00:01:49.960> felt<00:01:50.380> put

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
that win against those guys I felt put

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.010 
that win against those guys I felt put
in<00:01:50.680> a<00:01:50.770> lot<00:01:50.890> of<00:01:50.950> hard<00:01:51.160> work<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.540> I'd<00:01:52.630> love<00:01:52.840> to
