00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.990
 hello to everyone and for the water 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.000
 drago and we end up for the wave 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.640
 for servers 3 which is themed 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.500
 medieval and which you pony this under 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.500
 this gigantic canvas 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:38.300
 that's exactly on this block so there 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.830
 you can not go out 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.440
 you see your envelope paillard 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:48.379
 migdal impulses except here so there a 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:49.910
 special release I filmed it at night 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.210
 in minecraft for you to see 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:57.739
 the lighting anyway so that's 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.050
 go out there we follow the road and there you 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.030
 have a first house that is laid out 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.610
 entirely by the way I do a big 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.009
 shot at Frederic 80 what is laid out 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.340
 this house that you surely already have 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.729
 seen 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:16.820
 if you watch the series on on the 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:20.740
 series b 2-2 the followed adventure and on the 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.789
 video of the medieval elvish style so 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.560
 so here you have a first reason 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:25.790
 who can serve either the rules or that's it 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.280
 rare shop 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.080
 a second reason that I decorated months 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.750
 but here we are again in the same style 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.280
 to make choices for something 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:40.520
 like that you see there are granaries 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.060
 are not spared in the houses I 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.700
 leave it to do what you want 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.399
 then here we have a last house that 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.350
 is a bit special since his 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.470
 house that overlooks the river you 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.460
 we see that the river is closed well 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.890
 I know it's a house that overlooks 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.810
 River 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.479
 so here and you have a small counter 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.000
 our favorite and there you have a 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.319
 ladder to climb to the first floor where 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.840
 there is a spider 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:15.130
 it's not normal it's short I 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:19.860
 would add some lighting and that 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:22.269
 side there you have an inn 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:27.580
 we saw here with the boxes for the 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:33.150
 horses here the normal eating place 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:35.530
 it's an inn that's here and e 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.150
 if sir she joined by here you 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.160
 have the stairs going up to the rooms 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.590
 people who are not spared given 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:46.530
 that it is it's a server it's you 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.530
 who spared it when you want it 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:55.000
 it's a little good there 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.799
 then you have here the walls that 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.079
 are detailed everything done by hand there 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.000
 there is no copy paste I am 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:06.230
 bothered to do all that yes 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.350
 so here you have a global vision 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.150
 here are the houses we are strong a little 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.520
 well I then know the rumors of 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.100
 spectators is simple enough for the game 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.100
 not wanted to do it either in the web 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.090
 and then so there you have the exit that 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.709
 goes through a kind of portal of a 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.690
 mistake I found it funny to do that 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.940
 like this and here you have an exit so 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.410
 here is the asse I did as if it was 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.260
 to know experts 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.520
 rp but if you want a sarpei and 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.739
 factions you just have to break the 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:42.320
 dalits and at that moment we can not 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:45.260
 to return is normal here so I you 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:49.670
 puts an aspect of the city of the small 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:54.410
 quiet spoiler and then I'll go 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.880
 leave on this aspect on this view I 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.640
 do a little elite to show you 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.080
 with basic pack textures so re 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.370
 ba I am with the pack textures of 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.850
 base and you see that it makes when 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.650
 even rather well I find 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.380
 it's not the same spirit but it comes 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.420
 very good woman in my eyes it's okay 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.380
 well because you see we find 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.060
 still the spirit of medieval 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.519
 no matter the package texture I find 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.300
 that's pretty cool personally and even 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.410
 from the outside gets done that makes good 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.560
 with the basic hard disk pack you 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.440
 see allies for fear that makes it 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.370
 really good so I wanted that's 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:38.900
 on this view here I have in 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.729
 panning so and so so I'm going 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.580
 leave you 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:45.710
 if you liked the map the link is 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.820

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.760
 download and put it on your 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.620
 waiter I appreciate committing credits 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.690
 to say that it's me who did 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.390
 because I spent several 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.630
 hours on it and I would be glad that 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:03.200
 you were described here 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.460
