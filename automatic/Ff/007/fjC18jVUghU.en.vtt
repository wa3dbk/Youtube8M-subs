00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
not being played it's a requirement that

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.760 
not being played it's a requirement that
the<00:00:54.570> facility<00:00:54.960> could<00:00:55.079> also<00:00:55.260> be<00:00:55.469> used<00:00:55.680> for

so<00:01:00.930> really<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> building<00:01:01.410> has<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.890> be<00:01:01.949> able<00:01:02.160> to

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
so really the building has to be able to

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.329 
so really the building has to be able to
sort<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.699> operate<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.899> huge<00:01:04.470> range<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:05.070> modes

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339

this complex design was made all the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
more challenging for the project team

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.910 
more challenging for the project team
having<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.479> work<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.810> close<00:01:22.020> proximity<00:01:22.229> to

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
can actually be a really good thing in

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.609 
can actually be a really good thing in
design<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:29.850> help<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.090> make<00:01:30.270> decisions

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.249 
sometimes when you've got a blank canvas
it<00:01:32.909> can<00:01:33.060> be<00:01:33.180> extremely<00:01:33.450> challenging<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.079> make

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
it can be extremely challenging to make

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.830 
it can be extremely challenging to make
that<00:01:34.439> first<00:01:34.650> decision<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.570> you're<00:01:36.570> having

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
that first decision so you're having

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.270 
that first decision so you're having
those<00:01:36.930> constraints<00:01:37.530> has<00:01:37.650> actually<00:01:37.950> helped<00:01:38.189> us

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
those constraints has actually helped us

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.760 
those constraints has actually helped us
narrow<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.850> focus<00:01:39.180> our<00:01:39.329> attention<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.590> not

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
narrow and focus our attention and not

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.140 
narrow and focus our attention and not
only<00:01:40.890> we're<00:01:41.159> building<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.549> right<00:01:41.670> next<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.030> Rod

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150

days<00:01:51.240> when<00:01:51.420> people<00:01:51.450> used<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.840> build<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.259> ships

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
days when people used to build the ships

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.590 
days when people used to build the ships
inside<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.979> bottle<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> bit<00:01:54.180> like<00:01:54.360> that

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
inside a bottle it is a bit like that

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
and it's designers we have to think

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.639 
and it's designers we have to think

to<00:02:29.450> use<00:02:29.690> copper<00:02:29.990> penny<00:02:30.200> was<00:02:30.380> based<00:02:30.590> on<00:02:30.770> this

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
to use copper penny was based on this

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.620 
to use copper penny was based on this
idea<00:02:31.100> when<00:02:31.880> you<00:02:31.970> looked<00:02:32.180> at<00:02:32.270> all<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.510> other

buildings along the river

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.580 
buildings along the river
you<00:02:34.160> saw<00:02:34.370> sandstone<00:02:35.030> and<00:02:35.390> zinc<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:35.930> copper

and<00:02:37.190> all<00:02:37.430> these<00:02:37.610> materials<00:02:38.180> which<00:02:38.810> were<00:02:38.900> about

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
and all these materials which were about

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.410 
and all these materials which were about
long-term<00:02:40.220> history<00:02:40.760> they<00:02:40.970> are<00:02:41.030> about<00:02:41.210> things

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
long-term history they are about things

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.720 
long-term history they are about things
that<00:02:41.660> lasted<00:02:42.170> for<00:02:42.320> a<00:02:42.380> long<00:02:42.530> time<00:02:42.770> so<00:02:43.640> we

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
that lasted for a long time so we

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.040 
that lasted for a long time so we
thought<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.030> mobile<00:02:44.300> quad<00:02:44.480> arena<00:02:44.750> should<00:02:44.840> be

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
thought the mobile quad arena should be

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.240 
thought the mobile quad arena should be
something<00:02:45.380> more<00:02:45.410> than<00:02:45.650> just<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:45.950> sort<00:02:46.190> of

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
something more than just a sort of

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.940 
something more than just a sort of
utilitarian<00:02:46.690> sports<00:02:47.690> building<00:02:48.170> it<00:02:48.470> should<00:02:48.830> be

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
utilitarian sports building it should be

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.980 
utilitarian sports building it should be
a<00:02:48.980> major<00:02:49.280> piece<00:02:49.700> of<00:02:49.730> Melbourne<00:02:50.390> architecture

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
a major piece of Melbourne architecture

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.220 
a major piece of Melbourne architecture
it's<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:51.770> very<00:02:51.980> radical<00:02:52.270> decision<00:02:53.270> I<00:02:53.450> think<00:02:53.870> to

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
it's a very radical decision I think to

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.310 
it's a very radical decision I think to
do<00:02:54.410> this<00:02:54.560> but<00:02:54.920> really<00:02:55.400> exciting<00:02:56.030> and<00:02:56.240> the<00:02:57.110> new

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
do this but really exciting and the new

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.340 
do this but really exciting and the new
roof<00:02:57.860> that's<00:02:58.130> going<00:02:58.340> over<00:02:58.460> Margaret<00:02:58.970> Court

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.780 
has picked up some of the Melbourne
tradition<00:03:02.420> of<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:03.080> metal<00:03:03.440> roofs<00:03:03.740> rather<00:03:04.490> than

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
tradition of the metal roofs rather than

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.790 
tradition of the metal roofs rather than

it's<00:03:09.140> probably<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.620> first<00:03:10.150> step<00:03:11.150> that<00:03:11.480> will

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
it's probably the first step that will

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.670 
it's probably the first step that will
change<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:13.100> nature<00:03:13.310> of<00:03:13.520> the<00:03:13.670> precinct

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
change the nature of the precinct

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.470 
change the nature of the precinct
