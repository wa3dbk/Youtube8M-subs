00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
the movement in the game about the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.279 
the movement in the game about the
acceleration<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.449> stamina<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.050> you

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
acceleration and the stamina that you

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.279 
acceleration and the stamina that you
play<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.529> character<00:00:25.769> has<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.840> with<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.990> latest

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
update I'm really happy to say that this

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.610 
update I'm really happy to say that this
has<00:00:31.289> improved<00:00:31.769> significantly<00:00:33.079> so<00:00:34.079> when<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
has improved significantly so when the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.040 
has improved significantly so when the
beta<00:00:34.860> was<00:00:35.160> released<00:00:35.239> your<00:00:36.239> character<00:00:36.719> felt

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
beta was released your character felt

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.979 
beta was released your character felt
very<00:00:37.260> slow<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:38.010> felt<00:00:38.370> like<00:00:38.460> if<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.210> jumped<00:00:39.719> as

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
very slow it felt like if you jumped as

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.510 
very slow it felt like if you jumped as
soon<00:00:40.230> as<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.410> land<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.070> were<00:00:41.190> going<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.399> be

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
soon as you land it you were going to be

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.389 
soon as you land it you were going to be
slowed<00:00:41.820> down<00:00:41.850> like<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.390> jump<00:00:42.840> penalty<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:44.100> now

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
slowed down like a jump penalty but now

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.729 
slowed down like a jump penalty but now
they've<00:00:44.610> made<00:00:44.879> changes<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.840> acceleration

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
they've made changes to the acceleration

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.319 
they've made changes to the acceleration
the<00:00:46.890> friction<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.610> stamina<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.120> your

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
the friction and the stamina of your

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.560 
the friction and the stamina of your
character<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.520> nice<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.210> really

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
character so it's nice you can really

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.959 
character so it's nice you can really
jump<00:00:51.840> around<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.260> bit<00:00:52.410> more<00:00:52.590> now<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.760> feel

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
jump around a bit more now and you feel

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.700 
jump around a bit more now and you feel
like<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.390> can<00:00:54.570> escape<00:00:54.809> somewhere<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.559> can

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
like you can escape somewhere you can

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.619 
like you can escape somewhere you can
get<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:55.949> trouble<00:00:56.370> it's<00:00:56.969> never<00:00:57.270> going<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.570> be

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
get in trouble it's never going to be

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.290 
get in trouble it's never going to be
like<00:00:57.930> bunny<00:00:58.379> hopping<00:00:58.620> levels<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.489> csgo<00:00:59.850> or

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
like bunny hopping levels in csgo or

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.790 
like bunny hopping levels in csgo or
dunk<00:01:00.539> they're<00:01:00.840> ever<00:01:01.020> going<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.289> change<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.680> to

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
dunk they're ever going to change it to

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.280 
dunk they're ever going to change it to
that<00:01:01.980> extent<00:01:02.399> but<00:01:03.090> at<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.420> same<00:01:03.629> time<00:01:03.899> it's

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
that extent but at the same time it's

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.320 
that extent but at the same time it's
feeling<00:01:04.890> good<00:01:05.070> now<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.489> think<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.299> needs

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
feeling good now I think it needs

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.740 
feeling good now I think it needs
tweaking<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.470> tiny<00:01:07.920> bit<00:01:08.250> more<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.790> maybe<00:01:09.450> they

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
tweaking a tiny bit more and maybe they

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.840 
tweaking a tiny bit more and maybe they
need<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.960> look<00:01:10.260> at<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.799> range<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.369> movement

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
need to look at the range of movement

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.280 
need to look at the range of movement
that<00:01:11.939> your<00:01:12.090> character<00:01:12.510> has<00:01:12.540> when<00:01:13.049> you're<00:01:13.170> in

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
that your character has when you're in

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.170 
that your character has when you're in
the<00:01:13.409> air<00:01:13.530> like<00:01:13.799> when<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.250> jump<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.700> i<00:01:14.820> think<00:01:14.850> if

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
the air like when you jump in i think if

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.820 
the air like when you jump in i think if
you<00:01:15.630> can<00:01:15.810> give<00:01:15.990> your<00:01:16.110> character<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.530> bit<00:01:16.710> more

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
you can give your character a bit more

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.550 
you can give your character a bit more
control<00:01:17.310> then<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.930> would<00:01:18.960> be<00:01:19.200> pretty<00:01:19.439> much

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
control then that would be pretty much

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.340 
control then that would be pretty much
bang<00:01:20.009> on<00:01:20.250> also<00:01:21.060> something<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.900> definitely

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
bang on also something that definitely

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.710 
bang on also something that definitely
needs<00:01:22.680> looking<00:01:23.340> into<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.150> speed<00:01:24.509> at<00:01:24.689> which

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
needs looking into is the speed at which

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.929 
needs looking into is the speed at which
you<00:01:24.840> crouch<00:01:25.290> up<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.040> down<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.220> also<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
you crouch up and down and also the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.340 
you crouch up and down and also the
speed<00:01:27.180> at<00:01:27.299> which<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.540> move<00:01:27.810> when<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.110> crouch

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
speed at which you move when you crouch

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.649 
speed at which you move when you crouch
as<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.100> see<00:01:29.340> at<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.670> moment<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.329> very

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
as you can see at the moment it's very

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.560 
as you can see at the moment it's very
slow<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.320> crouch<00:01:31.799> up<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.220> down<00:01:32.570> especially

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
slow to crouch up and down especially

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.819 
slow to crouch up and down especially
when<00:01:33.720> you're<00:01:33.840> moving<00:01:34.020> around<00:01:34.439> when<00:01:34.710> you're

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
when you're moving around when you're

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.260 
when you're moving around when you're
crouching<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.520> i<00:01:35.549> think<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.970> needs

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
crouching so i think that that needs

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.510 
crouching so i think that that needs
speed<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.960> apart<00:01:37.530> from<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.740> movement<00:01:38.430> in

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
speed in a apart from that movement in

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.980 
speed in a apart from that movement in
the<00:01:38.610> game<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.970> feeling<00:01:39.299> pretty<00:01:39.450> nice<00:01:39.689> at<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
the game is feeling pretty nice at the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.889 
the game is feeling pretty nice at the
moment<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:41.310> latest<00:01:41.670> patch<00:01:41.850> also<00:01:42.390> brought<00:01:42.659> in

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
moment the latest patch also brought in

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.499 
moment the latest patch also brought in
some<00:01:43.170> interesting<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:44.100> very<00:01:44.520> good<00:01:44.850> changes

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
some interesting and very good changes

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.080 
some interesting and very good changes
to<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.780> recoil<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> weapons<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.759> here<00:01:47.970> you

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
to the recoil of the weapons so here you

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.719 
to the recoil of the weapons so here you
can<00:01:48.119> see<00:01:48.420> with<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> AK<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.439> m4<00:01:49.950> it's<00:01:50.460> much

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
can see with the AK and the m4 it's much

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.780 
can see with the AK and the m4 it's much
easier<00:01:50.850> now<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.450> control<00:01:52.140> your<00:01:52.290> recoil<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.610> it

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
easier now to control your recoil so it

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.550 
easier now to control your recoil so it
looks<00:01:54.000> like<00:01:54.090> they've<00:01:54.479> changed<00:01:55.079> the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
looks like they've changed the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.490 
looks like they've changed the
randomness<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.960> bullet<00:01:58.290> spread

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
randomness of the the bullet spread

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.170 
randomness of the the bullet spread
basically<00:01:59.159> when<00:01:59.430> you're<00:01:59.579> going<00:01:59.729> like<00:01:59.850> fully

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
basically when you're going like fully

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.389 
basically when you're going like fully
automatic<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.110> just<00:02:01.829> based<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.250> my

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
automatic and just based on my

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.679 
automatic and just based on my
experience<00:02:02.939> from<00:02:03.119> playing<00:02:03.329> counter-strike

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
experience from playing counter-strike

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.959 
experience from playing counter-strike
it's<00:02:04.409> quite<00:02:04.649> easy<00:02:04.710> now<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.280> control<00:02:05.820> the

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
it's quite easy now to control the

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.809 
it's quite easy now to control the
recall<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.600> AK<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.200> m4<00:02:07.560> as<00:02:07.799> every<00:02:08.520> CS

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
recall of the AK and the m4 as every CS

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.760 
recall of the AK and the m4 as every CS
player<00:02:09.060> knows<00:02:09.330> it's<00:02:09.690> really<00:02:10.020> important<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.560> be

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
player knows it's really important to be

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.020 
player knows it's really important to be
able<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:11.099> control<00:02:11.400> your<00:02:11.670> recall

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
able to control your recall

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.390 
able to control your recall
to<00:02:13.690> do<00:02:13.870> that<00:02:14.050> effectively<00:02:14.319> you<00:02:14.860> need<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:15.190> know

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
to do that effectively you need to know

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.010 
to do that effectively you need to know
what<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.760> guns<00:02:16.000> going<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.420> do<00:02:16.569> when<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:16.900> go

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
what the guns going to do when you go

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.110 
what the guns going to do when you go
fully<00:02:17.290> automatic<00:02:17.350> and<00:02:18.100> that<00:02:18.730> comes<00:02:18.970> from

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
fully automatic and that comes from

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.760 
fully automatic and that comes from
playing<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.510> game<00:02:19.690> from<00:02:19.930> experience<00:02:20.620> and

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
playing the game from experience and

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.710 
playing the game from experience and
just<00:02:21.640> knowing<00:02:21.850> where<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.270> bullets<00:02:22.569> are<00:02:22.690> going

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
just knowing where the bullets are going

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.630 
just knowing where the bullets are going
to<00:02:22.900> go<00:02:22.990> it's<00:02:23.290> just<00:02:23.560> instinct<00:02:24.069> sometimes<00:02:24.490> you

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
to go it's just instinct sometimes you

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.830 
to go it's just instinct sometimes you
can<00:02:24.730> just<00:02:24.760> feel<00:02:25.150> where<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.420> bullets<00:02:25.750> are

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
can just feel where the bullets are

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.380 
can just feel where the bullets are
going<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.080> go<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:27.160> latest<00:02:27.370> patch<00:02:27.730> has<00:02:28.030> really

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
going to go the latest patch has really

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.110 
going to go the latest patch has really
improved<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:29.319> think<00:02:29.620> also<00:02:30.100> with<00:02:30.580> tap<00:02:30.850> soon

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
improved that I think also with tap soon

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.020 
improved that I think also with tap soon
with<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.390> AK<00:02:31.600> and<00:02:32.170> bursting<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:33.400> feels<00:02:33.700> way

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
with the AK and bursting that feels way

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.180 
with the AK and bursting that feels way
better<00:02:34.060> now<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:35.080> first<00:02:35.319> two<00:02:35.560> bullets<00:02:35.980> will

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
better now the first two bullets will

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.130 
better now the first two bullets will
pretty<00:02:36.400> much<00:02:36.489> go<00:02:36.910> bang<00:02:37.600> on<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.930> middle<00:02:38.080> of

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
pretty much go bang on the middle of

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.809 
pretty much go bang on the middle of
your<00:02:38.290> crosshair<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:38.890> third<00:02:39.160> bullet<00:02:39.400> i<00:02:39.580> think

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
your crosshair the third bullet i think

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.930 
your crosshair the third bullet i think
is<00:02:39.970> still<00:02:40.209> a<00:02:40.239> bit<00:02:40.510> too<00:02:40.720> high<00:02:41.050> but<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:42.190> burst

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
is still a bit too high but the burst

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.600 
is still a bit too high but the burst
shooting<00:02:43.209> feels<00:02:43.630> really<00:02:43.989> nice<00:02:44.200> now<00:02:44.530> also<00:02:45.100> taps

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
shooting feels really nice now also taps

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.670 
shooting feels really nice now also taps
you<00:02:45.880> in<00:02:46.030> as<00:02:46.150> well<00:02:46.300> with<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.540> AK<00:02:46.660> which<00:02:47.200> a<00:02:47.440> lot

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
you in as well with the AK which a lot

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.830 
you in as well with the AK which a lot
of<00:02:47.709> players<00:02:47.980> like<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.430> use<00:02:48.700> that<00:02:49.360> feels<00:02:49.630> like<00:02:49.810> a

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
of players like to use that feels like a

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.770 
of players like to use that feels like a
viable<00:02:50.290> option<00:02:50.380> now<00:02:50.769> whereas<00:02:51.300> in<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.540> betta

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
viable option now whereas in the betta

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.350 
viable option now whereas in the betta
before<00:02:53.380> tap<00:02:54.100> shoe<00:02:54.310> in<00:02:54.519> just<00:02:54.730> felt<00:02:54.910> like<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.239> was

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
before tap shoe in just felt like it was

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.690 
before tap shoe in just felt like it was
too<00:02:55.780> random<00:02:56.320> it's<00:02:56.530> just<00:02:56.739> all<00:02:56.890> over<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.670> place

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
too random it's just all over the place

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.620 
too random it's just all over the place
but<00:02:58.600> now<00:02:58.780> it's<00:02:59.319> coming<00:02:59.560> on<00:02:59.709> nicely<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:01.330> next

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
auto snipers back in the game and they

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.280 
auto snipers back in the game and they
feel<00:05:26.430> pretty<00:05:26.850> strong<00:05:27.240> at<00:05:27.390> the<00:05:27.480> moment<00:05:27.510> there's

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
feel pretty strong at the moment there's

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.630

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
pistols as well but I haven't really had

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.890 
pistols as well but I haven't really had
time<00:05:31.770> to<00:05:31.830> use<00:05:32.190> those<00:05:32.400> yet<00:05:32.730> in<00:05:32.970> casual<00:05:33.720> mode

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
time to use those yet in casual mode

they've also added the x27 taser so this

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.410 
they've also added the x27 taser so this
is<00:05:37.590> a<00:05:37.680> new<00:05:38.040> weapon<00:05:38.430> to<00:05:38.550> counter-strike<00:05:38.910> it's<00:05:39.330> a

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
thousand dollars and I'm sure that this

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.260 
thousand dollars and I'm sure that this
is<00:05:46.950> going<00:05:47.160> to<00:05:47.250> be<00:05:47.430> a<00:05:47.460> new<00:05:47.700> sword<00:05:48.030> for

is going to be a new sword for

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.530 
is going to be a new sword for
humiliation<00:05:48.810> in<00:05:49.170> the<00:05:49.260> casual<00:05:49.650> mode<00:05:49.860> games

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
humiliation in the casual mode games

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.660 
humiliation in the casual mode games
also<00:05:51.540> nice<00:05:52.170> little<00:05:52.470> touch<00:05:52.710> the<00:05:52.980> body's<00:05:53.250> twitch

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
also nice little touch the body's twitch

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.750 
also nice little touch the body's twitch
once<00:05:54.000> they've<00:05:54.150> been<00:05:54.300> electrocuted<00:05:55.280> so<00:05:56.280> that's

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
once they've been electrocuted so that's

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.850 
once they've been electrocuted so that's
going<00:05:56.940> to<00:05:57.000> be<00:05:57.090> the<00:05:57.300> source<00:05:57.570> of<00:05:57.720> many<00:05:57.990> laughs<00:05:58.530> I

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
going to be the source of many laughs I

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.540 
going to be the source of many laughs I
presume<00:06:00.110> finally<00:06:01.110> they've<00:06:01.290> also<00:06:01.560> tweaked<00:06:02.160> the

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
presume finally they've also tweaked the

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.000 
presume finally they've also tweaked the
damage<00:06:03.210> that<00:06:03.240> grenades<00:06:03.870> do<00:06:04.230> to<00:06:04.500> players<00:06:04.740> who

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
damage that grenades do to players who

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.500 
damage that grenades do to players who
are<00:06:05.130> wearing<00:06:05.430> Kevlar<00:06:05.850> are<00:06:06.060> not<00:06:06.270> wearing

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
are wearing Kevlar are not wearing

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.660 
are wearing Kevlar are not wearing
Kevlar<00:06:07.110> so<00:06:07.650> this<00:06:07.800> is<00:06:07.830> based<00:06:08.130> on<00:06:08.340> the<00:06:08.460> feedback

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
Kevlar so this is based on the feedback

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.400 
Kevlar so this is based on the feedback
that<00:06:08.940> the<00:06:09.180> developers<00:06:09.720> were<00:06:09.840> given<00:06:10.170> on<00:06:10.290> the

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
that the developers were given on the

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.290 
that the developers were given on the
pro<00:06:10.590> forum<00:06:11.130> the<00:06:11.520> players<00:06:11.790> thought<00:06:12.030> that<00:06:12.180> it

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
pro forum the players thought that it

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.300 
pro forum the players thought that it
was<00:06:12.390> far<00:06:12.630> too<00:06:12.660> easy<00:06:13.140> to<00:06:13.650> do<00:06:13.770> over<00:06:14.220> a<00:06:14.250> hundred

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
was far too easy to do over a hundred

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.640 
was far too easy to do over a hundred
damage<00:06:15.090> to<00:06:15.300> a<00:06:15.330> player<00:06:15.690> who<00:06:15.900> wasn't<00:06:16.260> wearing

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
damage to a player who wasn't wearing

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.190 
damage to a player who wasn't wearing
Kevlar<00:06:17.130> so<00:06:17.760> there<00:06:18.210> was<00:06:18.330> a<00:06:18.360> lot<00:06:18.480> of<00:06:18.600> one-hit

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
Kevlar so there was a lot of one-hit

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.520 
Kevlar so there was a lot of one-hit
kill<00:06:19.470> grenades<00:06:19.860> coming<00:06:20.250> up<00:06:20.370> in<00:06:20.520> game<00:06:20.760> and

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
kill grenades coming up in game and

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.990 
kill grenades coming up in game and
personally<00:06:22.530> and<00:06:22.800> I<00:06:23.340> think<00:06:23.520> a<00:06:23.580> lot<00:06:23.610> of<00:06:23.730> other

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
personally and I think a lot of other

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.790 
personally and I think a lot of other
players<00:06:24.210> share<00:06:24.480> this<00:06:24.660> opinion<00:06:24.930> as<00:06:25.230> well<00:06:25.530> I

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
players share this opinion as well I

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.950 
players share this opinion as well I
don't<00:06:26.430> think<00:06:26.730> one<00:06:27.030> grenade<00:06:27.450> should<00:06:27.750> be<00:06:27.870> able

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
don't think one grenade should be able

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.720 
don't think one grenade should be able
to<00:06:28.200> kill<00:06:28.380> you<00:06:28.590> and<00:06:28.770> counter<00:06:29.040> strike<00:06:29.280> I<00:06:29.520> just

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.730 
to kill you and counter strike I just

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.760 
to kill you and counter strike I just
don't<00:06:30.000> think<00:06:30.240> it<00:06:30.360> has<00:06:30.510> a<00:06:30.540> place<00:06:30.870> so<00:06:31.260> after<00:06:31.650> the

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
don't think it has a place so after the

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.430 
don't think it has a place so after the
update<00:06:31.920> it<00:06:32.700> is<00:06:32.970> possible<00:06:33.540> to<00:06:33.600> die<00:06:33.870> from<00:06:33.900> one

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
update it is possible to die from one

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.740 
update it is possible to die from one
grenade<00:06:34.890> but<00:06:35.610> it's<00:06:35.910> very

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
grenade but it's very

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.840 
grenade but it's very
likely<00:06:37.290> unless<00:06:37.530> you're<00:06:37.860> literally<00:06:38.370> right

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:38.850 
likely unless you're literally right

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.610 
likely unless you're literally right
next<00:06:39.150> to<00:06:39.390> it<00:06:39.420> if<00:06:39.720> you<00:06:39.780> don't<00:06:40.020> die<00:06:40.290> from<00:06:40.320> me

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
next to it if you don't die from me

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.870 
next to it if you don't die from me
you're<00:06:40.770> probably<00:06:40.950> going<00:06:41.190> to<00:06:41.280> end<00:06:41.310> up<00:06:41.520> on<00:06:41.640> about

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 
you're probably going to end up on about

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.540 
you're probably going to end up on about
1<00:06:42.120> to<00:06:42.330> 10<00:06:42.540> HP<00:06:42.750> I<00:06:43.260> think<00:06:44.040> that's<00:06:44.190> pretty<00:06:44.460> much

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
1 to 10 HP I think that's pretty much

1 to 10 HP I think that's pretty much
everything<00:06:44.760> covered<00:06:45.390> in<00:06:45.540> the<00:06:45.630> video<00:06:45.900> guys<00:06:46.140> I
