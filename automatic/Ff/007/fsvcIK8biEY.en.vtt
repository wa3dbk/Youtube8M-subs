 at least that during the winter to live the 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.970
 city 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.440
 although the length of the beautiful days there is 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.130
 can be the most boring campaign 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:26.050

 covering two lengths suddenly 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.630
 dragging modulations that ended 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.420
 almost in whispers when they get 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.000
 speak is to herself sometimes joyous 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.700
 opening snows eyelids 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.380
 admitted claude look drowned in night the 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:47.470
 thought wandering in the evening we get 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.320
 returns in charge taken one by one the 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.690
 sentences she had said striving to 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.160
 remind them in complete the meaning so 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.570
 to make the portion of existence 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.490
 that she had lived in the tone that he did not 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:02.560
 do not know her ever one and then 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.480
 to have him years to think differently than he 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.630
 had not seen it the first time or so 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.530
 who had just left her just now 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.190
 then he wondered what she 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:15.830
 would become if she would marry is 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:20.380
 acquired alas the father 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:22.580
 redhead was well laughed at her so beautiful 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.500
 but the figure of the ponds always goes 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.970
 to stand in front of his eyes is something 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.910
 monotone thing like snoring 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.860
 a spinning top to give to his ears 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:36.020
 if you get married yet is if you 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.370
 to marry at night he did not sleep at when 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.740
 I was serial he was thirsty 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.040
 he got up to go and drink at his pot 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.650
 water and open the window 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:50.020
 the sky was covered with canvases a wind 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:53.500
 hot switch to dogs barking links 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.930
 she turned her head towards the berthod 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.610
 we feel that after all we risked 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.970
 nothing charles those promised to do the 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.110
 asks when the opportunity to do so is 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.640
 every time she offers herself he is afraid of 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.970
 not find the proper words the 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.470

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.360
 that she had too many spirits for the 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.270
 business culture cursed from the sky since one 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.700
 it never saw a millionaire far from 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.020
 to have made the fortune the good man he 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.880

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.200
 pleased Russian businessmen in 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.810
 However the actual culture with 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:36.110
 the internal government of the farm the 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.580
 mail - case nobody he does 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.590
 would not willingly hold his hands off 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.210
 dancers his pockets and spared him for the 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.730
 expense for all who watched
