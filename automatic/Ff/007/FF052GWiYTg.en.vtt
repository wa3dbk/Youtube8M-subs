00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.880
 we work both up and down 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.950
 is also my cardio 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.320
 climatic conditions make it 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.460
 had to adapt we were able to benefit thanks 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.980
 again a little bit our facilities 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.599
 from the party a little more dojo so 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.520
 good for sure that normally it's more 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.080
 conducive to combat sports but 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.610
 casually the compass this room there 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.880
 there is still a small atmosphere 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.880
 releases 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.079
 the value of the players in front and a 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:48.480
 section a match 7 at 2,504 it's a 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.070
 eighth final so it's not for 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.170
 we do not always see it disappear 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.969
 we can do this kind of matches so we 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.730
 is a little excited but the gones and so 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.320
 it does not matter if it's going on we'll be 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.320
 ready a fight 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.659
 we discover yes maybe the city of 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.330
 canes in another aspect compared 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.159
 in the cinema we are not in need of 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.490
 movie actually none of them is not 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.740
 actors we are just people who are 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.880
 passionate about it by football ago 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.770
 little equipped to beat by 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.930
 exaggerated this year so Montpellier 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.780
 in fact part of it they will not take us 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.220
 for for fun they will do 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.119
 a serious match and who I think the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.560
 best possible team 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.330
 the Coupe de France it can be a dream 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.649
 it is not for dreamers is 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.420
 just made for people who want 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.440
 to make a dream come true and to give oneself 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.440
 ways to make that dream come true 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.740
 we are we are determined to realize the 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.939
 same feat as against Saint-Etienne on 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.200
 really do not want to stop there 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.119
 even though our priority is the 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.210
 championship we are all mobilized for 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.820
 do the same type of match with this 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.970
 commitment this level this determination 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.259
 and if we put all the ingredients I 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.860
 do not see why we could not 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.440
 redo the same thing 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.170
 I am a young player and I go out of 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.880
 training center and that's it playing 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.950
 against teams like that of igas and 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.470
 it's really something beautiful and 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.980
 it's my first year there in cup of 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.140
 France so 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.140
 so no it's super silver 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.959
 the
