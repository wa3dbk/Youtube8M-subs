00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
okay so you're using the backside of a

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.290 
okay so you're using the backside of a
fillet<00:00:34.860> knife<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.340> those<00:00:35.520> scales<00:00:35.820> are<00:00:36.030> coming

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
fillet knife and those scales are coming

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.080 
fillet knife and those scales are coming
off<00:00:36.420> pretty<00:00:36.750> easy<00:00:37.200> actually<00:00:37.850> so<00:00:38.850> you're<00:00:38.969> going

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
off pretty easy actually so you're going

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.690 
off pretty easy actually so you're going
to<00:00:39.120> do<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.360> same<00:00:39.570> thing<00:00:39.780> on<00:00:39.870> both<00:00:40.050> sides<00:00:40.700> and

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
to do the same thing on both sides and

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.310 
to do the same thing on both sides and
that's<00:00:41.910> because<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.480> skin<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.870> going<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.079> stay

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
that's because the skin is going to stay

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.840 
that's because the skin is going to stay
intact<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.219> actually<00:00:44.550> going<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.760> be

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
intact and is actually going to be

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.779 
intact and is actually going to be
taught<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.450> yeah<00:00:46.379> there's<00:00:47.039> two<00:00:47.280> reasons<00:00:47.489> why

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
taught so yeah there's two reasons why

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.889 
taught so yeah there's two reasons why
you<00:00:47.910> want<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.420> scales<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:49.020> be<00:00:49.140> off<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.620> one

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
you want the scales to be off of it one

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.850 
you want the scales to be off of it one
when<00:00:51.899> you're<00:00:52.020> trying<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.289> cut<00:00:52.530> through<00:00:52.739> the

skin

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.900 
skin
you<00:00:54.629> don't<00:00:54.809> dull<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.260> blade<00:00:55.530> oh<00:00:55.770> yeah<00:00:56.730> it's

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
you don't dull the blade oh yeah it's

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.389 
you don't dull the blade oh yeah it's
easier<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.239> cut<00:00:57.449> with<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.690> scales<00:00:57.930> off<00:00:58.399> second

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
easier to cut with the scales off second

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.060 
easier to cut with the scales off second
reason<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.809> eat<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.140> skin<00:01:01.379> if<00:01:01.890> you

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
reason you can eat the skin if you

us about the vertebrae Vincenzo okay

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.470 
us about the vertebrae Vincenzo okay
this<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.400> bluefish<00:03:50.880> like<00:03:51.000> we've<00:03:51.150> previously

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
this is a bluefish like we've previously

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.310 
this is a bluefish like we've previously
filleted<00:03:52.410> now<00:03:53.160> if<00:03:53.280> you<00:03:53.400> look<00:03:53.549> closely<00:03:54.320> the

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
filleted now if you look closely the

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.150 
filleted now if you look closely the
vertebrae<00:03:55.860> are<00:03:56.130> held<00:03:56.370> together<00:03:56.489> by<00:03:56.790> a<00:03:58.160> spacing

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
vertebrae are held together by a spacing

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.720 
vertebrae are held together by a spacing
here<00:03:59.549> and<00:03:59.760> if<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:01.049> you<00:04:01.500> really<00:04:02.310> got<00:04:02.459> to<00:04:02.579> try

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
here and if you you really got to try

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.490 
here and if you you really got to try
and<00:04:02.850> cut<00:04:03.120> through<00:04:03.390> that<00:04:03.480> spacing<00:04:04.049> otherwise

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
and cut through that spacing otherwise

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.650 
and cut through that spacing otherwise
if<00:04:04.769> you<00:04:04.890> try<00:04:05.130> and<00:04:05.190> cut<00:04:05.400> through<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.760> solid

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
if you try and cut through the solid

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.990 
if you try and cut through the solid
part<00:04:07.049> here<00:04:07.380> right<00:04:07.799> then<00:04:08.670> you're<00:04:08.820> going<00:04:08.910> to

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
part here right then you're going to

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.370 
part here right then you're going to
have<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.150> really<00:04:09.390> tough<00:04:09.660> time<00:04:09.900> getting<00:04:10.110> through

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
have a really tough time getting through
