let's<00:00:53.039> launch<00:00:53.340> voice-o-matic<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.360> do<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
let's launch voice-o-matic to do the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.490 
let's launch voice-o-matic to do the
automatic<00:00:54.860> lip-syncing<00:00:56.899> the<00:00:57.899> first<00:00:58.170> thing<00:00:58.379> we

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
automatic lip-syncing the first thing we

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.349 
automatic lip-syncing the first thing we
are<00:00:58.620> going<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.890> do<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.370> load<00:00:59.760> up<00:00:59.789> an<00:01:00.000> audio<00:01:00.270> file

different phonemes recognized by

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.740 
different phonemes recognized by
voice-o-matic<00:01:22.670> when<00:01:23.670> we<00:01:23.790> switch<00:01:24.060> from<00:01:24.330> one<00:01:24.570> of

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
voice-o-matic when we switch from one of

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.050 
voice-o-matic when we switch from one of
the<00:01:24.840> predefined<00:01:25.409> sets<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.950> another<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.880> can

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
the predefined sets to another we can

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.530 
the predefined sets to another we can
see<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.420> already<00:01:27.570> assigned<00:01:28.140> mouth<00:01:28.439> positions

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
see the already assigned mouth positions

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.539 
see the already assigned mouth positions
here<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.780> Vice<00:01:30.990> Eames<00:01:31.290> we<00:01:31.860> see<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> visual

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
here in the Vice Eames we see the visual

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.179 
here in the Vice Eames we see the visual
representation<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.540> phoneme<00:01:34.049> set<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
representation of the phoneme set in the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.480 
representation of the phoneme set in the
group<00:01:35.400> F<00:01:35.610> V<00:01:36.150> we<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:36.900> see<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.290> F<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.799> V<00:01:38.250> are

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
group F V we can see that F and V are

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.130 
group F V we can see that F and V are
already<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.180> use<00:01:41.360> we<00:01:42.360> can<00:01:42.479> easily<00:01:42.899> change

keyframes<00:03:23.239> can<00:03:23.870> easily<00:03:24.260> be<00:03:24.440> tweaked<00:03:24.769> since

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
keyframes can easily be tweaked since

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.699 
keyframes can easily be tweaked since
they<00:03:25.400> are<00:03:25.519> just<00:03:25.820> standard<00:03:26.180> keyframes<00:03:26.690> so<00:03:27.590> if

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
they are just standard keyframes so if

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.949 
they are just standard keyframes so if
you<00:03:27.890> wish<00:03:28.100> to<00:03:28.340> adjust<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.850> lip-sync<00:03:29.299> you<00:03:29.780> can

you wish to adjust the lip-sync you can

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.440 
you wish to adjust the lip-sync you can
easily<00:03:30.200> do<00:03:30.590> so<00:03:30.890> by<00:03:31.190> going<00:03:31.220> in<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:31.790> animation

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
easily do so by going in the animation
