00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.690
 quite special and it's a small advance 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.370
 of one thing that I will bring later 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.290
 in the channel in a 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.210
 for the following videos or things like that 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.330
 not simple of a special about them or

 not at the moment you should think what you leave 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.390
 I missed it just in case 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.670
 and I'm telling you it's related to 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.839
 this and here we have it 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.480
 There are four envelopes of gel gold soul

 As you can see here we have two with one 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.760
 two and one luxury 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.790
 the truth is that this collection never 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.860
 come to April and it's one thing that 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:01:00.370
 It bothers you enough you can catch legends 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.470
 in the letters you are of brilliant energy 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.750
 a brilliant novel of cartoons that 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.900
 They were pretty cool 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.990
 and let's see what those letters are like 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.580
 I have never opened on these so no 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.610
 I know exactly how is the typical 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.430
 tricky but I think if I'm not wrong that 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.659
 is exactly the same as the last 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:26.110
 generation and camps and black so stupid 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.330
 what comes to the code you know yes no 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.000
 change the system 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.160
 as you can see change of ship if it goes to 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.460
 support a little more luck I hope 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.460

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.030
 leave how can condition be 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.670

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.000
 a fisherman as first infrequent 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.280
 look in your skin discard four 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.770
 energies teachings of bali put them in the 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.690
 wow hand 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.460
 a supposed recovery of energy 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.610
 supporter forgiveness without having to 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.430
 rule out the next new theory of 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.210
 teacher or lower your command in your deck 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.930
 then take six cards is a mix 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:29.579
 he comes for dinner but stealing one more 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:32.310
 and a little 3.0 will not look good gives me 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.780
 seven first cards of your deck I choose 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.209
 a supporter's letter that you find 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.540
 teach him the same and put it in your hand 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.969
 bernstein again in your deck 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.159
 and let's see how cool the babies are 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:46.470
 this position seems the first time is 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:49.080
 a center 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.650
 How cool the truth is that it is beautiful 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.140
 reverse that this letter has and how 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.700
 we have an average plasticine 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.820

 quite amazing old word the 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.510
 truth and let's see what it holds 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:16.189
 I hope that at least some energy comes out 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.870
 of these cartoons I think they came out 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.120
 as commons who do not know much either 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.349

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:52.470
 as mudslides we have the facebook clip 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:55.230
 holographic shelters with acceleration 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:57.780

 They sell the little emotional basically 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.670
 two super explosion a sale is made to 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.740
 damage to itself and does not apply the 

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:17.009
 actually in this damage yes because if not 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:20.400

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:22.820
 and give him plasticine with balloons fast 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.530
 and speed 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.530
 will not be affected by weakness 

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:28.760
