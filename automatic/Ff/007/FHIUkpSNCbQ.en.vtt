00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 And then people are my name, I'm from 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.109
 porto alegre and I 'm here to give you a 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.440
 quick statement on the system of 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:14.400
 burn of 48 hours from the start of the second 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.139
 I met Vinícius's website and after 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.449
 follow his first directions 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.939
 I started doing the exercise series 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.310
 high intensity short period of 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.670
 time that the 48-hour system in the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.519
 indicates for us to have a loss 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.790
 fat in a short time so I 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.469
 knew since those eight weeks 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.570
 experiments that vinícius is talking to 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.100
 we should check what would be 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.350
 the first results, right? 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.420
 so even vinícius guiding us 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.239
 three times a week is the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.610
 48-hour firing exercises that 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.469
 would total from 30 to 45 minutes per 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.120
 week of exercise not per day per 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.000
 week 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.649
 how I wanted quick results 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.899
 apparent and I decided to 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.219
 intensified in my training that I did 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.129
 I started to do the exercises. 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.600
 daily then every day of 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.080
 Monday to Monday of the last eight 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.430
 I made a series of 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.460
 four minutes advanced intermediate 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.860
 open to youtube and it was late in the afternoon 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.560
 11 minutes for beginners who 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.970
 alternating exercises but giving a 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.979
 tired cool then in the end these 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.520
 two months that happened I lost six 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.829
 pounds of pure fat as I had come 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.780
 since the beginning of the year making 60 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.729
 minutes to invite every day but 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.020
 gym plus diet I also saw 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.270
 losing a little weight also had 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.439
 sent by vinícius a neighbor of 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.780
 some exercises I had done 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.000
 So I'll leave the link here in this 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.340
 I cant go here for you, just click there. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.470
 that you will be able to visualize a little 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.409
 of my daily workouts that I came 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.780
 doing in the last eight weeks has been 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.000
 which gave me this end result of 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.219
 Great year that left very satisfied 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.430
 with the burning system of 48 to mans 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.729
 without realizing the race with just ends 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.550
 losing enough lean mass too 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:11.250
 then the 48-hour firing system 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.410
 he's good because you just lose 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.320
 fat and best of all 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.940
 in a short space of time what five ten 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.650
 minutes on each day 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.530
 need not stay 60 minutes on top of the 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.370
 treadmill with only five 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.040
 little 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.590
 I managed to lose a lot of fat in the 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.020
 my body this became apparent 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.180
 after these two months of training 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.190
 intensity of the 48-hour system 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.100
 I do not intend to stop the contrary I 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.380
 being able to replace at that time 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.170
 too much that lay on the treadmill for 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.090
 series of 4 5 10 12 exercises 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.040
 minutes and that they will do the 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.750
 body is burning the fat for 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.400
 up to 48 hours 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.080
 so I wanted to say this took a 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.790
 vote of confidence conveniences 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.830
 He studied for this, he knows what he 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.380
 has made it set up this system 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.060
 really works and I'm sure 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.490
 who gave a vote of confidence to him 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.300
 will surprise a lot at the end of these 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.160
 two months will be added to the 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.130
 burning 48 hours a diet is legal 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.200
 I'm sure you're going to 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.270
 surprising with the results then it was 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.270
 Thank you, beginning and until the next
