00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.670
 but not without us a nonsense 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.139
 but patrick neelmeyer should with such a nem 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.300
 steel colossus take off immediately 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.340
 already clear that him so close boeing 737 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.699
 clearly more heads are surveyed 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.420
 must as in car-moment everything is still 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.490
 very clear and also very used 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.850
 what then happened afterwards 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.039
 I think I will be rather unfamiliar because 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.669
 I already have a small plane 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.540
 but flying can be such a huge thing 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.200
 I think that will be a whole 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.200
 other story 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.030
 Hello 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.570
 that looks like the right airport 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.650
 herewith departure board and clock and everything 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.449
 he is perfect in every way 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.860
 I have a boarding pass here 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.229
 as usual but I think so 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.890
 sit elsewhere today you are sitting today 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:02.729
 This is what the two call it 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.589
 make here 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.540
 this includes the tomato juice at 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.990
 check in but also a detailed 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.320
 briefing before the flight cards weather the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.340
 exact flight route over 20,000 destinations 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.220
 you have the offer 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.479
 We fly short distances to Munich like that 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.479
 high never now travel slowly 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.590
 transmitter in addition to the thing that right 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.700
 is really like in the real ones 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:47.560
 plane here and dramatically more 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:49.360
 switch and buttons station modeselector 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.040
 the pressure balance for the cabins 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.350
 Automatik that synonymous with me there 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.750
 is already on author jörg weinmann has 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.690
 all built by myself 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.730
 six months, the development time 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.550
 about four years ago 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:07.890
 the whole cockpit every switch every 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:10.899
 display brand self-made hard to believe 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.640
 only the steering column and the seats are 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.640
 original aircraft parts 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.230
 I'm giving gas 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.060
 So I know the airport Stuttgart 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.390
 yes but from this perspective looks 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.390
 then a little bit 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.400
 Invested in your project have the 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.960
 By the way, make a middle one 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.960
 six-figure sum 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.430
 everything under control captain meyer my ladies 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.720
 and men 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.370
 Greetings from the cockpit, yes 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.320
 usually whenever there is someone in front 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.460
 the real idea has that is 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.890
 very brave what they do there 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.650
 They got on a plane that 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.060
 I want to be flown by me 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.890
 this post already say goodbye free 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.210
 No, that's really great 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.520
 I hope you do not have it at the start 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.890
 shaken too much if that with 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.240
 the landing works so well it can be 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.520
 that you have two landings for the price of 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.750
 I 'll get one, but then I'll be myself 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.000
 I'm still looking forward to seeing you too 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.880
 a pleasant flight life jackets 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.200
 they do not need any 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.930
 if I'm still floating well up here 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.730
 the over the clouds in the 230 degrees 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.730
 backdrop from the calculator 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.650
 and the simulator can do more for you 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.160
 For example, sometimes very bad alarm 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.160
 beat 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.500
 now comes the emergency 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.100
 nice to fly on we take care of it 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.670
 every button works too 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:11.740
 supposed to fly unimportant 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:15.170
 all money, all lit incredibly 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:19.250
 By the way, one hour here in the simulator 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.680
 The bernhäuser company city costs 159 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.870
 Euro 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.870
 the sweat stains that there's nothing
