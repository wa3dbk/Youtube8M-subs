00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:08.069
 I've always been in love with cars and 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.139
 speed but 93/94 people but there is 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.300
 a magazine and on the cover of one of the 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.639
 magazines were going to have I looked at 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.510
 That car so I want to work. 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.580
 with that car and the frame ran behind 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.779
 first knocked on the door of the manufacturer 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.050
 to listen to one 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.910
 then 15 the next step was to come 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.039
 the United States after getting the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.539
 work visa the company that 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.189
 bring him back 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.559
 I called the chrysler here. 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.649
 look I'm available with these themes 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.989
 with this product is has vacancy 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.910
 my manager at the time you could 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.129
 take it was better to order chicken 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.590
 half an hour ago in our engineer 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.320
 interior called for the return and what 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.270
 You do today, Mark is the set-up of the car. 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.590
 I hit everyone's chance by hanging up 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.600
 way that the car aimed at is the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.489
 latest version of viper 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.280
 it was she who took the sport out of the ashes 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.470
 in 2010 condemns economic crisis 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.460
 The American model left the scene. 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.430
 some and came up with the same seductive design 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.860
 the ceiling beside the sides trimmed 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.590
 to accommodate large air outlets and a 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.659
 front long historical features 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.190
 created with the collaboration of a 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.320
 competitor 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.780
 the snake d that was the shell and was 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.690
 inspiration that the ground itself gave its 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.940
 Pitpes on the viper by then if you look 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.850
 in the American market only had the corvette 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.440
 only gm had a public car available 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.399
 which was considered a sports car 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.800
 wife replenished her blood from the first 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.020
 generation of 1992 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.009
 the viper has front engine and traction 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.830
 rear 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:52.140
 the maximum speed started at 290 per 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:55.680
 hour arrived and 325 in the fourth generation 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.210
 one here a v10 and do not see 8 landmark at the time 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.460
 We needed the power level. 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.979
 which is worth 800 and a lot of investment 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.200
 power level 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.200
 years the v10 and it was not a little easier 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.370
 today is only three and a half seconds 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.570
 to boot and reached 100 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.220
 kilometers per hour 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:21.350
 mercedes sls and lexus lfa make 0 to 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.350
 100 in three seconds and 5 to 6 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.910
 The new viper has 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.800
 stability and traction that if 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.800
 I'm disconnected from you. 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.640
 It's a lot of group, huh? 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.010
 It's taking the beast of course I came here for this. 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:51.870
 it was something that we perceive and exchange 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.870
 manual tata automatic 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.130
 1 640 horsepower 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.100
 thousand kilos thanks to the use of 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.740
 carbon fiber and aluminum in 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.830
 body and weight distribution is 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:15.330
 very close to the ideal 49% in the front 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:19.130
 and 51% at the rear 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.130
 good for now 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:30.930
 the boy looks like he's going to take off on this 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.670
 time and reached 160 per hour when 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.000
 street in that bag on the last lap 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:39.000
 I reached 215 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.370
 30 but the question is not speed 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.920
 end the issue is speeding up connected 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.300
 very fast at that speed, right? 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.400
 so that's the feeling it gives you that the 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.230
 car will take off initially pick up handle 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.040
 a lot of people are unaware too 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.530
 the car a little easier to drive 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.900
 but he did not lose anything by going pro 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.049
 continues to be the viper that 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:10.120
 always went and will bite if you do not know 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:11.110
 what it will do no harm goes to a 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.129
 karmann guide 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.129
 never one day I know
