00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
really tough to build if you mess up

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.330 
really tough to build if you mess up
that<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.469> but<00:00:50.070> if<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.610> don't<00:00:50.730> mess<00:00:50.969> up<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.690> I
