it's<00:01:56.009> right<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> mica<00:01:56.640> helped<00:01:57.000> with<00:01:57.119> that

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
it's right and the mica helped with that

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.020 
it's right and the mica helped with that
a<00:01:57.299> lot<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.869> it's<00:01:58.680> very<00:01:58.950> aggressive<00:01:59.520> particle

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
a lot it it's very aggressive particle

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.209 
a lot it it's very aggressive particle
gets<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.329> ball<00:02:00.479> started<00:02:00.840> up<00:02:00.990> early<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.979> when

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
gets the ball started up early so when

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.010 
gets the ball started up early so when
we<00:02:02.340> went<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.670> 920<00:02:03.210> T<00:02:03.360> we<00:02:03.540> wanted<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.840> create

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
we went to the 920 T we wanted to create

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.270 
we went to the 920 T we wanted to create
a<00:02:04.170> reaction<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.740> was<00:02:04.920> right<00:02:05.100> in

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
a reaction that was right in

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.460 
a reaction that was right in
between<00:02:05.549> those<00:02:05.790> two<00:02:06.000> balls<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.229> first

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
between those two balls so the first

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.749 
between those two balls so the first
thing<00:02:07.560> we<00:02:07.770> do<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:07.920> took<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.340> Mike<00:02:08.520> out<00:02:08.700> of

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
thing we do is took that Mike out of

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.160 
thing we do is took that Mike out of
there<00:02:09.000> we<00:02:09.060> didn't<00:02:09.209> want<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.450> heavy<00:02:09.720> part<00:02:10.080> of

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
there we didn't want that heavy part of

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.800 
there we didn't want that heavy part of
the<00:02:10.289> vet<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.590> ball<00:02:10.740> looking<00:02:11.130> early<00:02:11.550> and

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
the vet in the ball looking early and

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.840 
the vet in the ball looking early and
then<00:02:12.810> we<00:02:12.959> decided<00:02:13.350> well<00:02:14.160> instead<00:02:14.490> of<00:02:14.550> coming

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
then we decided well instead of coming

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.580 
then we decided well instead of coming
up<00:02:14.910> with<00:02:14.970> new<00:02:15.240> materials<00:02:15.930> since<00:02:16.230> we<00:02:16.350> know<00:02:16.470> we

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
up with new materials since we know we

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.290 
up with new materials since we know we
want<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:16.950> reaction<00:02:17.400> that's<00:02:17.520> close<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.030> in

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
want a reaction that's close to in

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.900 
want a reaction that's close to in
between<00:02:18.600> these<00:02:18.750> two<00:02:18.930> balls<00:02:19.170> we<00:02:20.010> said<00:02:20.220> why

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
between these two balls we said why

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.370 
between these two balls we said why
don't<00:02:20.970> we<00:02:21.090> just<00:02:21.209> mix<00:02:21.420> them<00:02:21.569> so<00:02:22.020> we<00:02:22.170> came<00:02:22.350> up

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
don't we just mix them so we came up

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.260 
don't we just mix them so we came up
with<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:22.739> new<00:02:22.920> innovative<00:02:23.310> pouring<00:02:23.819> system

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
with this new innovative pouring system

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.680 
with this new innovative pouring system
and<00:02:24.890> if<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.069> look<00:02:26.220> at<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:26.430> animation<00:02:26.850> you'll

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
and if you look at this animation you'll

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.510 
and if you look at this animation you'll
see<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:28.020> in<00:02:28.200> our<00:02:28.290> current<00:02:28.739> pouring<00:02:29.069> system

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
see that in our current pouring system

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.120 
see that in our current pouring system
we<00:02:29.970> have<00:02:30.090> two<00:02:30.270> tanks<00:02:30.660> we<00:02:30.840> have<00:02:31.020> an<00:02:31.170> ISO<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:31.770> a

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
we have two tanks we have an ISO and a

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.309 
we have two tanks we have an ISO and a
polyol<00:02:32.580> they<00:02:33.090> mix<00:02:33.300> through<00:02:33.480> one<00:02:33.630> mixer<00:02:33.989> for<00:02:34.230> in

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
polyol they mix through one mixer for in

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.070 
polyol they mix through one mixer for in
the<00:02:34.410> ball<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.890> we<00:02:35.010> make<00:02:35.160> an<00:02:35.280> uprising<00:02:35.850> in<00:02:36.120> this

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
the ball and we make an uprising in this

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.720 
the ball and we make an uprising in this
next<00:02:37.320> video<00:02:37.620> we<00:02:37.769> see<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.070> new<00:02:38.220> innovative

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
next video we see the new innovative

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.940 
next video we see the new innovative
intermix<00:02:39.660> technology<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:40.530> we<00:02:40.590> used<00:02:40.769> on<00:02:40.890> the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
intermix technology that we used on the

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.500 
intermix technology that we used on the
920<00:02:41.610> t<00:02:41.850> we<00:02:42.780> have<00:02:42.900> four<00:02:43.230> tanks<00:02:43.620> now<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.160> on<00:02:45.000> one

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
920 t we have four tanks now and on one

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.650 
920 t we have four tanks now and on one
side<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.080> gen<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:47.100> HP<00:02:47.400> gen2<00:02:47.670> mixes<00:02:48.330> on<00:02:48.570> the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
side the gen to the HP gen2 mixes on the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.590 
side the gen to the HP gen2 mixes on the
other<00:02:48.780> side<00:02:49.050> of<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.260> HP<00:02:49.650> gen3<00:02:49.920> mixes<00:02:50.640> they<00:02:51.330> mix

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
other side of the HP gen3 mixes they mix

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.580 
other side of the HP gen3 mixes they mix
together<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.230> we<00:02:52.650> get<00:02:52.800> a<00:02:52.830> 920<00:02:53.459> t<00:02:55.250> nice<00:02:56.269> um<00:02:57.590> so

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
together and we get a 920 t nice um so

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.710 
together and we get a 920 t nice um so
what<00:02:58.860> it<00:02:58.980> sounds<00:02:59.250> like<00:02:59.280> is<00:02:59.580> that<00:02:59.610> this<00:03:00.120> ball<00:03:00.420> is

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
what it sounds like is that this ball is

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.809 
what it sounds like is that this ball is
going<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.410> clear<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.010> front<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.340> little<00:03:02.370> better

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
going to clear the front a little better

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.059 
going to clear the front a little better
than<00:03:03.330> this<00:03:03.540> one<00:03:03.810> but<00:03:03.959> not<00:03:04.140> be<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:04.470> skip<00:03:04.709> look<00:03:04.890> is

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
than this one but not be so skip look is

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.040 
than this one but not be so skip look is
this<00:03:05.250> that's<00:03:05.550> right<00:03:05.760> perfect<00:03:06.540> for<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.840> for

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
this that's right perfect for the for

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.540 
this that's right perfect for the for
the<00:03:07.080> lead<00:03:07.380> conditions<00:03:07.890> we<00:03:08.040> should<00:03:08.220> be<00:03:08.310> able<00:03:08.430> to

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
the lead conditions we should be able to

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.120 
the lead conditions we should be able to
use<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:08.880> for<00:03:09.060> all<00:03:09.120> three<00:03:09.390> games<00:03:09.630> so<00:03:10.170> what<00:03:11.010> we're

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
use it for all three games so what we're

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.319 
use it for all three games so what we're
going<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.340> do<00:03:11.459> is<00:03:11.730> we're<00:03:11.850> going<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.000> take<00:03:12.150> this

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
going to do is we're going to take this

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.819 
going to do is we're going to take this
out<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.750> lanes<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.260> go<00:03:13.620> see<00:03:13.799> a

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
out to the lanes and go see a

00:03:13.829 --> 00:04:13.850 
out to the lanes and go see a
performance

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.500 

alright<00:04:14.860> you<00:04:15.070> just<00:04:15.250> seen<00:04:15.460> the<00:04:15.580> 930<00:04:16.000> T<00:04:16.239> in<00:04:16.480> the

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
alright you just seen the 930 T in the

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.949 
alright you just seen the 930 T in the
920<00:04:17.140> t<00:04:17.320> go<00:04:17.709> down<00:04:17.890> a<00:04:17.920> lane<00:04:18.100> the<00:04:18.880> first<00:04:19.750> thing<00:04:19.900> I

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
920 t go down a lane the first thing I

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.600 
920 t go down a lane the first thing I
want<00:04:20.140> to<00:04:20.170> talk<00:04:20.290> about<00:04:20.350> is<00:04:21.010> for<00:04:21.400> the<00:04:21.459> league

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
want to talk about is for the league

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.070 
want to talk about is for the league
board<00:04:21.820> you're<00:04:22.210> going<00:04:22.330> to<00:04:22.390> notice<00:04:22.600> that<00:04:22.960> the

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
board you're going to notice that the

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.250 
board you're going to notice that the
930<00:04:23.590> T<00:04:23.860> is<00:04:24.100> earlier<00:04:24.760> more<00:04:25.030> mid<00:04:25.240> lane<00:04:25.450> which<00:04:26.080> is

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
930 T is earlier more mid lane which is

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.780 
930 T is earlier more mid lane which is
one<00:04:26.410> of<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.560> reasons<00:04:26.890> why<00:04:27.010> you<00:04:27.070> can't<00:04:27.310> stay

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
one of the reasons why you can't stay

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.970 
one of the reasons why you can't stay
with<00:04:27.820> as<00:04:28.180> long<00:04:28.450> and<00:04:28.630> league<00:04:28.870> because<00:04:29.650> a<00:04:29.710> lot<00:04:29.950> of

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
with as long and league because a lot of
