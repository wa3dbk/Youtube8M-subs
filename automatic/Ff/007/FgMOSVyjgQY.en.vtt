so<00:00:13.860> Frances<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.460> both<00:00:14.700> classical<00:00:15.269> Arctic's

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:15.720 
so Frances and I both classical Arctic's

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.320 
so Frances and I both classical Arctic's
and<00:00:16.039> when<00:00:17.039> we<00:00:17.190> tell<00:00:17.430> people<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:17.970> they<00:00:18.180> often

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
and when we tell people that they often

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.140 
and when we tell people that they often
ask<00:00:18.630> us<00:00:18.900> quite<00:00:19.230> familiar<00:00:20.039> questions<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:21.000> we've

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
ask us quite familiar questions so we've

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.420 
ask us quite familiar questions so we've
called<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.539> talk<00:00:21.810> six<00:00:22.590> frequently<00:00:23.220> asked

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
called this talk six frequently asked

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.240 
called this talk six frequently asked
questions<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.350> I'm<00:00:25.350> going<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.740> try<00:00:25.949> not<00:00:26.010> to

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
questions and I'm going to try not to

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.529 
questions and I'm going to try not to
three<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.520> them<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.820> then<00:00:26.970> Frances<00:00:27.390> will

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
three of them and then Frances will

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.900 
three of them and then Frances will
answer<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.990> others<00:00:28.490> so<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.580> first<00:00:29.789> question

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
answer the others so the first question

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.730 
answer the others so the first question
very<00:00:30.210> simply<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.720> what<00:00:30.930> is<00:00:31.109> classical

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
very simply is what is classical

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.580 
very simply is what is classical
architecture<00:00:32.309> well<00:00:33.120> it's<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.200> kind<00:00:34.440> of

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
architecture well it's a kind of

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.560 
architecture well it's a kind of
architecture<00:00:35.130> which<00:00:35.370> started<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.270> ancient

architecture which started in ancient

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.950 
architecture which started in ancient
Greece<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.350> Rome<00:00:37.880> which<00:00:38.880> has<00:00:39.090> its<00:00:39.270> own<00:00:39.420> set<00:00:39.930> of

Greece and Rome which has its own set of

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.410 
Greece and Rome which has its own set of
rules<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.649> those<00:00:41.250> rules<00:00:41.579> are<00:00:42.059> based<00:00:42.239> around

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
rules and those rules are based around

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.560 
rules and those rules are based around
SiC<00:00:42.899> five<00:00:43.559> different<00:00:43.860> kinds<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.460> column<00:00:45.059> which

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
SiC five different kinds of column which

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.530 
SiC five different kinds of column which
are<00:00:45.690> called<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.989> five<00:00:46.140> orders<00:00:47.149> for<00:00:48.149> about<00:00:48.300> two

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
are called the five orders for about two

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.650 
are called the five orders for about two
thousand<00:00:48.960> years<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:50.610> five<00:00:51.000> orders<00:00:51.390> were<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
thousand years the five orders were the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.110 
thousand years the five orders were the
basis<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.050> all<00:00:52.260> architecture<00:00:52.950> but<00:00:53.370> about<00:00:53.610> 50

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
basis of all architecture but about 50

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.990 
basis of all architecture but about 50
years<00:00:54.239> ago<00:00:54.390> they<00:00:54.899> stopped<00:00:55.230> being<00:00:55.440> taught<00:00:56.000> and

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
years ago they stopped being taught and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.580 
years ago they stopped being taught and
most<00:00:57.300> architects<00:00:57.719> now<00:00:57.870> don't<00:00:58.199> know<00:00:58.379> much

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
most architects now don't know much

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.010 
most architects now don't know much
about<00:00:58.620> them<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.940> would<00:01:00.300> dismiss<00:01:00.660> them<00:01:00.899> as

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
about them and would dismiss them as

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.219 
about them and would dismiss them as
being<00:01:01.260> irrelevant<00:01:02.510> this<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> picture<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.019> me

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
being irrelevant this is a picture of me

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.559 
being irrelevant this is a picture of me
measuring<00:01:04.889> and<00:01:05.129> drawing<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.759> classical

00:01:06.559 --> 00:01:06.569 
measuring and drawing a classical

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:10.039 
measuring and drawing a classical
building<00:01:06.929> and<00:01:07.859> it's<00:01:08.039> my<00:01:08.279> belief<00:01:08.819> that<00:01:09.049> because

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
building and it's my belief that because

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.809 
building and it's my belief that because
it's<00:01:10.319> not<00:01:10.469> taught<00:01:10.679> anymore<00:01:11.009> the<00:01:11.429> only<00:01:11.490> way<00:01:11.759> you

00:01:11.809 --> 00:01:11.819 
it's not taught anymore the only way you

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:14.989 
it's not taught anymore the only way you
can<00:01:12.060> really<00:01:12.270> find<00:01:13.109> out<00:01:13.229> about<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:14.310> grammar

00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:14.999 
can really find out about the grammar

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:17.599 
can really find out about the grammar
and<00:01:15.240> language<00:01:15.779> of<00:01:15.959> buildings<00:01:16.349> is<00:01:17.340> by

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:17.609 
and language of buildings is by

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:20.149 
and language of buildings is by
measuring<00:01:18.029> and<00:01:18.359> drawing<00:01:18.630> them<00:01:18.950> yourself<00:01:19.950> and

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
measuring and drawing them yourself and

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.969 
measuring and drawing them yourself and
that's<00:01:20.969> what<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.479> do<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.259> also<00:01:22.560> what<00:01:22.740> we're

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
that's what I do and also what we're

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.580 
that's what I do and also what we're
doing<00:01:23.159> outside<00:01:23.670> today<00:01:24.229> so<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.289> next<00:01:25.439> question

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
doing outside today so the next question

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.349 
doing outside today so the next question
is<00:01:25.889> why<00:01:26.279> is<00:01:26.340> classical<00:01:26.880> architecture

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
is why is classical architecture

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:31.399 
is why is classical architecture
relevant<00:01:27.899> now<00:01:30.139> architecture<00:01:31.139> has<00:01:31.259> always

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
relevant now architecture has always

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.129 
relevant now architecture has always
been<00:01:31.709> dictated<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:33.270> influenced<00:01:33.689> by<00:01:33.749> fashion

00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:34.139 
been dictated and influenced by fashion

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:37.489 
been dictated and influenced by fashion
and<00:01:34.560> taste<00:01:34.939> but<00:01:35.939> recently<00:01:36.359> fashions<00:01:37.289> and

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:37.499 
and taste but recently fashions and

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:38.870 
and taste but recently fashions and
tastes<00:01:37.859> have<00:01:37.950> been<00:01:38.159> moving<00:01:38.549> much<00:01:38.849> more

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
tastes have been moving much more

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.019 
tastes have been moving much more
quickly<00:01:39.649> the<00:01:40.649> fashion<00:01:40.979> at<00:01:41.039> the<00:01:41.099> moment<00:01:41.459> is<00:01:41.669> for

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:42.029 
quickly the fashion at the moment is for

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:46.609 
quickly the fashion at the moment is for
funny<00:01:42.899> shaped<00:01:43.229> buildings<00:01:43.590> made<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.859> glass

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.690 

and<00:01:48.320> they're<00:01:49.320> being<00:01:49.500> built<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:50.009> cities<00:01:50.430> all

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
and they're being built in cities all

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.749 
and they're being built in cities all
around<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.149> world<00:01:51.350> with<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.649> result<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.610> a

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
around the world with the result that a

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.490 
around the world with the result that a
lot<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.090> cities<00:01:54.450> are<00:01:54.479> now<00:01:54.869> beginning<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.320> look

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
lot of cities are now beginning to look

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.370 
lot of cities are now beginning to look
rather<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.070> same<00:01:56.420> but<00:01:57.420> things<00:01:58.140> are<00:01:58.350> changing

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
rather the same but things are changing

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.270 
rather the same but things are changing
a<00:01:58.860> little<00:01:58.950> bit

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
a little bit

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.819 
a little bit
for<00:01:59.759> one<00:01:59.909> thing<00:01:59.939> glass<00:02:00.390> buildings<00:02:00.930> are<00:02:01.350> not

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
for one thing glass buildings are not

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.240 
for one thing glass buildings are not
very<00:02:02.039> sustainable<00:02:02.780> they<00:02:03.890> involve<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:05.039> lot<00:02:05.220> of

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
very sustainable they involve a lot of

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.359 
very sustainable they involve a lot of
energy<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.390> cost<00:02:06.659> in<00:02:07.020> their<00:02:07.470> construction

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
energy and cost in their construction

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.639 
energy and cost in their construction
and<00:02:08.519> maintenance<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.420> use<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.989> they<00:02:10.470> don't

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
and maintenance and use and they don't

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.540 
and maintenance and use and they don't
last<00:02:10.890> very<00:02:11.039> long<00:02:12.590> for<00:02:13.590> another<00:02:13.769> thing<00:02:14.010> people

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
last very long for another thing people

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.370 
last very long for another thing people
are<00:02:14.730> concerned<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.450> cities<00:02:15.870> are<00:02:16.080> beginning

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
are concerned that cities are beginning

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.890 
are concerned that cities are beginning
to<00:02:16.500> lose<00:02:16.680> their<00:02:17.099> individual<00:02:17.940> identities<00:02:18.660> and

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
to lose their individual identities and

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.590 
to lose their individual identities and
so<00:02:19.739> for<00:02:19.950> that<00:02:20.040> reason<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.670> think<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:21.120> lot<00:02:21.480> of

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
so for that reason I think a lot of

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.900 
so for that reason I think a lot of
people<00:02:21.870> are<00:02:21.989> now<00:02:22.170> starting<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.340> look<00:02:23.580> at<00:02:23.730> local

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
people are now starting to look at local

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.120 
people are now starting to look at local
traditions<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.900> ways<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.380> building

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
traditions and ways of building

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.039 
traditions and ways of building
buildings<00:02:26.700> which<00:02:26.910> are<00:02:27.060> going<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.480> last<00:02:27.840> longer

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
buildings which are going to last longer

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.199 
buildings which are going to last longer
and<00:02:28.650> we<00:02:29.130> think<00:02:29.370> that's<00:02:29.459> why<00:02:29.790> kaskell

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
and we think that's why kaskell

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.870 
and we think that's why kaskell
architecture<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:30.989> relevant<00:02:31.500> now<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.980> as<00:02:32.700> an

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
architecture is relevant now and as an

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.300 
architecture is relevant now and as an
illustration<00:02:33.269> this<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:34.069> photograph<00:02:35.069> of<00:02:35.190> a

illustration this is a photograph of a

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.520 
illustration this is a photograph of a
building<00:02:35.640> which<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.970> designed<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:37.110> was<00:02:37.319> built

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
building which I designed and was built

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.920 
building which I designed and was built
recently<00:02:37.980> in<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.060> middle<00:02:39.269> of<00:02:39.330> London<00:02:39.510> it's

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
recently in the middle of London it's

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.710 
recently in the middle of London it's
built<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.410> natural<00:02:41.190> stone<00:02:41.310> it<00:02:41.790> has<00:02:42.030> sculpture

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
built of natural stone it has sculpture

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.320 
built of natural stone it has sculpture
on<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:42.989> it<00:02:43.470> uses<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:44.069> classical<00:02:44.459> language<00:02:44.819> but

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
on it it uses the classical language but

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.860 
on it it uses the classical language but
it's<00:02:45.450> for<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.690> modern<00:02:46.019> art<00:02:46.470> gallery<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:48.450> very

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
it's for a modern art gallery and a very

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.130 
it's for a modern art gallery and a very
modern<00:02:49.200> purpose<00:02:50.420> so<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.540> last<00:02:51.690> question<00:02:51.840> is

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
modern purpose so the last question is

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.720 
modern purpose so the last question is
would<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.470> ever<00:02:52.680> design<00:02:53.070> a<00:02:53.100> classical

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
would you ever design a classical

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.750 
would you ever design a classical
airport<00:02:56.930> actually<00:02:57.930> while<00:02:58.109> ago<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:59.250> magazine

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
airport actually while ago a magazine

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.270 
airport actually while ago a magazine
asked<00:03:00.239> me<00:03:00.359> to<00:03:00.600> redesign<00:03:00.900> Heathrow<00:03:01.829> Terminal

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
asked me to redesign Heathrow Terminal

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.090 
asked me to redesign Heathrow Terminal
five<00:03:02.489> as<00:03:02.970> if<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.269> was<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.420> classical<00:03:04.100> building

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
five as if it was a classical building

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.130 
five as if it was a classical building
and<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:06.030> think<00:03:06.269> that<00:03:06.390> they<00:03:06.540> were<00:03:06.600> asking<00:03:07.019> it<00:03:07.109> as

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
and I think that they were asking it as

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.789 
and I think that they were asking it as
a<00:03:07.260> slightly<00:03:07.560> tongue-in-cheek<00:03:07.920> question<00:03:09.799> but

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
a slightly tongue-in-cheek question but

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.710 
a slightly tongue-in-cheek question but
actually<00:03:11.459> when<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:11.850> think<00:03:12.030> about<00:03:12.090> it<00:03:12.420> it's

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
actually when you think about it it's

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.809 
actually when you think about it it's
maybe<00:03:13.019> not<00:03:13.320> that<00:03:13.470> ridiculous<00:03:13.890> after<00:03:14.250> all<00:03:14.609> if

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
maybe not that ridiculous after all if

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.789 
maybe not that ridiculous after all if
you<00:03:14.910> think<00:03:14.940> of<00:03:15.299> a<00:03:15.480> building<00:03:16.350> like<00:03:16.500> Grand

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
you think of a building like Grand

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.990 
you think of a building like Grand
Central<00:03:16.859> Station<00:03:17.190> in<00:03:17.790> New<00:03:18.239> York<00:03:18.480> it's<00:03:19.410> a

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
Central Station in New York it's a

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.309 
Central Station in New York it's a
wonderful<00:03:21.000> building<00:03:21.180> designed<00:03:21.720> as<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.900> grand

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
wonderful building designed as a grand

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.770 
wonderful building designed as a grand
classical<00:03:23.069> space<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.609> when<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.540> arrive

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
classical space and when you arrive

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.410 
classical space and when you arrive
there<00:03:24.810> you<00:03:25.109> have<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.260> tremendous<00:03:25.829> sense<00:03:26.069> of<00:03:26.420> the

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
there you have a tremendous sense of the

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.030 
there you have a tremendous sense of the
place<00:03:27.569> that<00:03:27.930> you're<00:03:28.079> arriving<00:03:28.380> in<00:03:28.769> and

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
place that you're arriving in and

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
place that you're arriving in and
arguably<00:03:29.819> modern<00:03:30.720> airports<00:03:31.139> don't<00:03:31.319> do<00:03:31.620> that

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
arguably modern airports don't do that

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.830 
arguably modern airports don't do that
and<00:03:33.350> I<00:03:34.370> think<00:03:35.370> that<00:03:35.519> it's<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.970> power<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.720> be

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
and I think that it's the power to be

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.420 
and I think that it's the power to be
uplifting<00:03:37.560> which<00:03:37.829> is<00:03:38.010> one<00:03:38.130> of<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.280> most

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
uplifting which is one of the most

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.309 
uplifting which is one of the most
exciting<00:03:38.819> things<00:03:39.269> about<00:03:39.750> classical

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
exciting things about classical

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:47.569 
exciting things about classical

questions is classical architecture

questions is classical architecture
appropriate<00:03:50.310> for<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.489> modern<00:03:50.790> city<00:03:51.709> well<00:03:52.709> I

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
appropriate for a modern city well I

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.740 
appropriate for a modern city well I
believe<00:03:53.190> it<00:03:53.430> is<00:03:53.609> I<00:03:53.639> mean<00:03:53.940> particularly<00:03:54.209> cities

you're<00:04:37.000> just<00:04:37.060> copying<00:04:37.630> and<00:04:39.060> I<00:04:40.060> don't<00:04:40.570> really

see a problem with some things being

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.390 
see a problem with some things being
good<00:04:44.949> if<00:04:45.100> they're<00:04:45.280> easy<00:04:45.550> that's<00:04:46.270> that's<00:04:46.900> great

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
good if they're easy that's that's great

but<00:04:48.400> I<00:04:48.430> think<00:04:48.639> that<00:04:50.460> one<00:04:51.460> of<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.760> problems

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
but I think that one of the problems

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.659 
but I think that one of the problems
with<00:04:52.860> architecture<00:04:53.860> is<00:04:53.979> it's<00:04:54.160> very<00:04:54.370> closely

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
with architecture is it's very closely

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.270 
with architecture is it's very closely
aligned<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.570> painting<00:04:56.560> and<00:04:56.710> sculpture

you make your name but I think that

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.150 
you make your name but I think that

which both me and George think is an

which both me and George think is an

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
incredibly important skill and I hope

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.340 
incredibly important skill and I hope
that<00:06:33.670> we<00:06:33.820> can<00:06:34.150> transfer<00:06:34.750> some<00:06:35.140> of<00:06:35.170> that
