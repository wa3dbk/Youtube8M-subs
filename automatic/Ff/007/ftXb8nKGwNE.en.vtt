the<00:00:27.449> beginning<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:29.069> I<00:00:29.339> remember<00:00:29.849> when<00:00:30.029> they

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
the beginning so I remember when they

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.460 
the beginning so I remember when they
asked<00:00:30.419> you<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.569> do<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.749> they<00:00:30.989> didn't<00:00:31.169> have<00:00:31.289> like

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
that much material for me to work with

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.390 
that much material for me to work with
so<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.690> got<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.380> have<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.650> complete<00:00:35.160> freedom

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400

and<00:00:35.760> then<00:00:35.940> when<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.150> first<00:00:36.420> saw<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.680> images<00:00:37.680> I

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
and then when I first saw the images I

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.590 
and then when I first saw the images I
was<00:00:38.580> thrown<00:00:38.820> away<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.060> thought<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.480> was

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
was thrown away I thought it was

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.600 
was thrown away I thought it was
wonderful<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:40.350> was<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:40.890> beautifully<00:00:41.370> made

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
wonderful I was so beautifully made

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.640 
wonderful I was so beautifully made
there's<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.510> much<00:00:42.540> death<00:00:42.900> to<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.200> all<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.350> I

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
there's so much death to it all and I

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.240 
there's so much death to it all and I
really<00:00:43.950> felt<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.370> could<00:00:44.700> work<00:00:45.540> with<00:00:45.870> that

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
really felt that I could work with that

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.830 
really felt that I could work with that
for<00:00:47.250> me<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.610> music<00:00:47.970> was<00:00:48.120> there<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.510> create

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
for me the music was there to create

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.560 
for me the music was there to create
that<00:00:48.960> sense<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.380> intimacy<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:50.310> nostalgia<00:00:51.120> when

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
that sense of intimacy of nostalgia when

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.420 
that sense of intimacy of nostalgia when
we're<00:00:51.720> exploring<00:00:52.170> but<00:00:52.680> also<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:53.070> sense<00:00:53.310> of

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
we're exploring but also that sense of

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.450 
we're exploring but also that sense of
energy<00:00:53.990> that<00:00:54.990> we<00:00:55.200> have<00:00:55.320> when<00:00:55.740> we're<00:00:55.920> doing

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
energy that we have when we're doing

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.090 
energy that we have when we're doing
fights<00:00:56.910> or<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.810> breast<00:00:58.110> fights<00:00:58.350> at<00:00:58.740> first<00:00:59.010> it

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
fights or in breast fights at first it

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
fights or in breast fights at first it
was<00:00:59.190> supposed<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.490> be<00:00:59.550> something<00:00:59.790> really

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
was supposed to be something really

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.120 
was supposed to be something really
small<00:01:00.329> just<00:01:00.600> like<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.960> piano<00:01:01.380> and<00:01:01.560> guitar<00:01:01.680> and

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
small just like a piano and guitar and

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.710 
small just like a piano and guitar and
maybe<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.370> cello<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.210> was<00:01:03.329> kind<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.630> a

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
maybe a cello and it was kind of a

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.539 
maybe a cello and it was kind of a
challenge<00:01:04.140> because<00:01:04.290> whenever<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.189> get<00:01:05.339> into

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
challenge because whenever you get into

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.860 
challenge because whenever you get into
a<00:01:05.579> boss<00:01:05.759> fight<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:06.119> gets<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.450> much<00:01:06.630> more

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
a boss fight it gets so much more

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.890 
a boss fight it gets so much more
intense<00:01:07.580> and<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:09.420> actually<00:01:09.540> had<00:01:09.780> to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
intense and we actually had to

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.390 
intense and we actually had to
commission<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> whole<00:01:10.530> Orchestra<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:11.190> do<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
commission a whole Orchestra to do the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.090 
commission a whole Orchestra to do the
boss<00:01:11.550> spice

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100

three<00:01:16.850> epic<00:01:17.390> big<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:18.470> operatic

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
three epic big and operatic

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.180 
three epic big and operatic
I<00:01:20.880> remember<00:01:21.720> seeing<00:01:22.110> for<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.620> first<00:01:22.680> time<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
I remember seeing for the first time the

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.710 
I remember seeing for the first time the
music<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.760> images<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.120> I<00:01:24.270> kind<00:01:24.480> of<00:01:24.540> tear

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
music on the images and I kind of tear

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.660 
music on the images and I kind of tear
it<00:01:24.810> up<00:01:24.870> a<00:01:24.990> little<00:01:25.110> bit<00:01:25.320> because<00:01:25.470> it's<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.520> so

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
it up a little bit because it's just so

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.790 
it up a little bit because it's just so
wonderful<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.570> see<00:01:28.020> something<00:01:28.380> come<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.650> life

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
wonderful to see something come to life

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:36.690 
wonderful to see something come to life
like<00:01:29.040> that

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
I wanted to sound to be really organic

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.010 
I wanted to sound to be really organic
