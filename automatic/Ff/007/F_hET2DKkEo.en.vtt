00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.109 
hey guys bakla pictures here and this is
a<00:00:23.640> redstone<00:00:24.000> tutorial<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:25.550> all<00:00:26.550> rest<00:00:26.820> and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
a redstone tutorial on all rest and

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.560 
a redstone tutorial on all rest and
latches<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.900> think<00:00:28.640> yes<00:00:29.640> how<00:00:30.029> do<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.179> make<00:00:30.390> these

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
latches I think yes how do I make these

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.520 
latches I think yes how do I make these
again<00:00:30.929> um<00:00:31.399> alright<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.759> know<00:00:32.880> it's

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
again um alright so I know it's

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.110 
again um alright so I know it's
something<00:00:34.530> like<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:37.040> think<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.340> think<00:00:39.030> it's

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
something like this think I think it's

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.560 
something like this think I think it's
like<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.480> let's<00:00:39.960> see<00:00:40.170> here<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:41.540> then<00:00:42.540> I

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
like this let's see here and then I

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.319 
like this let's see here and then I
think<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:42.960> like<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:44.420> oops<00:00:47.149> things<00:00:48.149> like

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
think it's like this oops things like

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:55.869 
think it's like this oops things like
this<00:00:48.600> afterwards<00:00:50.750> yeah<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.320> think

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.080 

like<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.350> don't<00:00:58.350> know<00:00:58.440> um<00:00:59.100> no<00:00:59.609> that's

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
like that I don't know um no that's

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.570 
like that I don't know um no that's
obviously<00:01:00.449> not<00:01:00.539> right<00:01:00.750> just<00:01:01.370> um<00:01:04.189> see<00:01:05.189> here<00:01:05.460> Oh

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
obviously not right just um see here Oh

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.430 
obviously not right just um see here Oh
like<00:01:06.360> that

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
like that

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.510 
like that
yes<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.960> like<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.170> yes<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:13.190> switch<00:01:14.190> here

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
yes and like that yes and switch here

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.190 
yes and like that yes and switch here
and<00:01:15.260> switch<00:01:16.260> here<00:01:16.620> i<00:01:16.650> think<00:01:16.980> i<00:01:17.250> think<00:01:17.930> i'm<00:01:18.930> not

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
and switch here i think i think i'm not

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.030 
and switch here i think i think i'm not
exactly<00:01:19.440> sure<00:01:21.500> let's<00:01:22.500> see<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:22.830> whether<00:01:22.980> they

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
exactly sure let's see here whether they

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.730 
exactly sure let's see here whether they
switches<00:01:23.370> you<00:01:23.690> I've<00:01:24.690> never<00:01:24.900> actually<00:01:25.170> used<00:01:25.530> an

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
switches you I've never actually used an

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.670 
switches you I've never actually used an
RS<00:01:26.270> RS<00:01:27.270> Nanda<00:01:27.750> latch<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:29.720> mean<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.200> knew<00:01:31.560> how

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
RS RS Nanda latch so I mean I I knew how

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.320 
RS RS Nanda latch so I mean I I knew how
to<00:01:31.740> make<00:01:31.920> them<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.220> just<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.520> never<00:01:32.580> bothered

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
to make them I just I never bothered

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.090 
to make them I just I never bothered
learning<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:34.020> never<00:01:34.260> bothered<00:01:34.650> using<00:01:34.920> them<00:01:35.040> in

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
learning I never bothered using them in

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.970 
learning I never bothered using them in
anything<00:01:35.450> all<00:01:36.450> right<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:36.870> I<00:01:37.260> guess<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.800> these

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
anything all right so I guess with these

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.540 
anything all right so I guess with these
they<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:39.830> the<00:01:40.830> switch<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.220> how<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.400> be

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
they have to the switch is how to be

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.200 
they have to the switch is how to be
opposite<00:01:42.120> for<00:01:42.360> them<00:01:42.480> to<00:01:42.630> have<00:01:42.720> opposite<00:01:43.290> power

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
opposite for them to have opposite power

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.360 
opposite for them to have opposite power
both<00:01:45.210> up<00:01:45.540> means<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.470> both<00:01:46.590> power<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.160> one

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
both up means that both power this one

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.390 
both up means that both power this one
down<00:01:47.550> means<00:01:47.850> Howard<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.810> one<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:50.070> this

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
down means Howard and that one this this

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.730 
down means Howard and that one this this
one<00:01:50.580> down<00:01:50.760> and<00:01:51.150> this<00:01:51.750> one<00:01:51.990> up<00:01:52.140> means<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.560> one

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
one down and this one up means this one

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.420 
one down and this one up means this one
powered<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.640> one<00:01:53.880> up<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.950> this<00:01:55.950> one<00:01:56.160> down

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
powered this one up and this one down

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.750 
powered this one up and this one down
means<00:01:56.760> this<00:01:56.910> one<00:01:57.090> powered<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:58.580> don't<00:01:59.580> have<00:01:59.700> a

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
means this one powered so don't have a

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:08.570 
means this one powered so don't have a
donor<00:02:00.740> course<00:02:02.960> so<00:02:03.960> C<00:02:04.260> open<00:02:04.530> close<00:02:05.870> and<00:02:07.429> I<00:02:08.429> guess

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
donor course so C open close and I guess

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.030 
donor course so C open close and I guess
I'll<00:02:08.729> just<00:02:08.760> take<00:02:09.570> the<00:02:09.720> door<00:02:09.869> then

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:27.330 

and<00:02:14.040> put<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.850> door<00:02:15.030> here

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.530 

so<00:02:28.340> yeah<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:28.700> should<00:02:28.970> get<00:02:29.060> you<00:02:29.270> this<00:02:31.540> between

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
so yeah you should get you this between

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.680 
so yeah you should get you this between
the<00:02:32.630> two<00:02:32.720> circuits<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.880> there<00:02:34.880> were<00:02:34.970> one<00:02:35.330> type

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
the two circuits and there were one type

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.830 
the two circuits and there were one type
of<00:02:36.280> redstone<00:02:37.280> repeaters<00:02:37.760> there<00:02:38.390> was<00:02:38.510> one<00:02:38.690> type

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
of redstone repeaters there was one type

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.080 
of redstone repeaters there was one type
of<00:02:39.130> pulsar<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:40.160> forgot<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.550> show<00:02:40.730> you<00:02:40.760> it

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
of pulsar I forgot to show you it

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.460 
of pulsar I forgot to show you it
actually<00:02:41.330> didn't<00:02:41.750> forget<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:41.960> show<00:02:42.170> you<00:02:42.230> it

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
actually didn't forget to show you it

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.250 
actually didn't forget to show you it
actually<00:02:42.980> knew<00:02:43.510> but<00:02:44.510> it's<00:02:44.720> not<00:02:44.840> hard<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.110> make

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
actually knew but it's not hard to make

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.150 
actually knew but it's not hard to make
so<00:02:45.350> I'm<00:02:45.410> just<00:02:45.500> going<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:45.680> go<00:02:45.770> ahead<00:02:45.830> and<00:02:45.920> show

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
so I'm just going to go ahead and show

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.040 
so I'm just going to go ahead and show
you<00:02:46.190> guys<00:02:46.310> right<00:02:46.670> now<00:02:46.960> give<00:02:47.960> me<00:02:48.050> some<00:02:48.200> stuff<00:02:50.800> I

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
you guys right now give me some stuff I

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.160 
you guys right now give me some stuff I
was<00:02:54.050> testing<00:02:54.470> out<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.650> piston<00:02:55.070> mod<00:02:55.250> with<00:02:55.460> this

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
was testing out the piston mod with this

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.200 
was testing out the piston mod with this
um

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:07.420 

if<00:02:59.870> I<00:03:00.080> repeaters<00:03:01.000> my<00:03:02.000> incinerator<00:03:04.120> yeah<00:03:06.430> works

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
if I repeaters my incinerator yeah works

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.570 
if I repeaters my incinerator yeah works
perfectly<00:03:11.200> yeah<00:03:12.200> like<00:03:12.560> half<00:03:12.800> of<00:03:12.830> my<00:03:13.040> dogs<00:03:13.220> just

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
perfectly yeah like half of my dogs just

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.490 
perfectly yeah like half of my dogs just
like<00:03:13.640> died<00:03:13.940> one<00:03:14.360> day<00:03:14.390> nicely<00:03:15.200> sure<00:03:15.380> what

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
like died one day nicely sure what

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.220 
like died one day nicely sure what
happened<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.800> him<00:03:15.890> so<00:03:16.280> you<00:03:16.340> know<00:03:16.900> one<00:03:17.900> day<00:03:18.050> they

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
happened to him so you know one day they

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.750 
happened to him so you know one day they
all<00:03:18.320> DRAM<00:03:18.590> Lee<00:03:18.740> appeared<00:03:19.040> and<00:03:19.280> then<00:03:19.550> one<00:03:19.640> day

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
all DRAM Lee appeared and then one day

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.410 
all DRAM Lee appeared and then one day
they're<00:03:19.910> all<00:03:20.060> gone<00:03:21.370> see<00:03:22.370> how<00:03:22.520> I<00:03:22.550> make<00:03:22.850> this<00:03:23.060> um

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
they're all gone see how I make this um

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.630 
they're all gone see how I make this um
I<00:03:24.050> think<00:03:24.170> it's<00:03:24.560> a<00:03:24.890> block<00:03:25.250> here<00:03:25.310> and<00:03:27.280> torch<00:03:28.280> here

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
I think it's a block here and torch here

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.340 
I think it's a block here and torch here
I<00:03:28.700> think<00:03:30.100> with<00:03:31.100> this<00:03:31.370> facing<00:03:31.670> this<00:03:31.850> way<00:03:31.910> on<00:03:32.870> the

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
I think with this facing this way on the

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.350 
I think with this facing this way on the
third<00:03:33.560> latch<00:03:33.770> and<00:03:35.140> up<00:03:36.140> like<00:03:36.350> this<00:03:37.360> yeah

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
third latch and up like this yeah

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.890 
third latch and up like this yeah
they're<00:03:38.810> yup<00:03:39.020> and<00:03:39.670> that<00:03:40.670> is<00:03:40.820> a

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
they're yup and that is a

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.200 
they're yup and that is a
four-and-a-half<00:03:41.900> clock<00:03:42.350> on<00:03:43.040> a<00:03:43.100> 4<00:03:43.490> 5th<00:03:43.760> clock<00:03:44.060> I

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
four-and-a-half clock on a 4 5th clock I

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:50.500 
four-and-a-half clock on a 4 5th clock I
think<00:03:46.540> and<00:03:48.580> you<00:03:49.580> need<00:03:49.790> to<00:03:49.940> stay<00:03:50.120> on<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.300> fourth

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
think and you need to stay on the fourth

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.080 
think and you need to stay on the fourth
one<00:03:51.220> so<00:03:52.220> I<00:03:52.280> guess<00:03:52.400> that's<00:03:52.610> where<00:03:52.730> they<00:03:52.790> get<00:03:52.880> for

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
one so I guess that's where they get for

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.570 
one so I guess that's where they get for
fists<00:03:53.360> from<00:03:53.450> I<00:03:53.920> don't<00:03:54.920> know<00:03:55.040> I<00:03:55.190> don't<00:03:55.310> know<00:03:55.430> why

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
fists from I don't know I don't know why

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.830 
fists from I don't know I don't know why
it's<00:03:55.730> called<00:03:55.880> that<00:03:56.000> but<00:03:56.300> it's<00:03:56.510> called<00:03:56.690> like<00:03:56.810> a

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
it's called that but it's called like a

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.940 
it's called that but it's called like a
Ford<00:03:57.170> dash<00:03:57.860> five<00:03:58.190> o'clock<00:03:59.560> can<00:04:00.560> you<00:04:00.650> change

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
Ford dash five o'clock can you change

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.900 
Ford dash five o'clock can you change
the<00:04:01.190> speed

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
okay you can but it'll die out so yeah

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.160 
okay you can but it'll die out so yeah
keep<00:04:07.870> it<00:04:07.960> on<00:04:08.050> that<00:04:08.200> I<00:04:08.230> guess<00:04:08.490> all<00:04:09.490> right<00:04:09.580> um<00:04:10.170> yep

flip-flop and then some weird gate that

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.710 
flip-flop and then some weird gate that
I<00:04:37.960> feel<00:04:38.170> it's<00:04:38.350> called<00:04:38.590> and<00:04:38.860> I<00:04:39.190> never<00:04:39.400> use<00:04:39.720> all
