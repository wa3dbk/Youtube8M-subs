00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:02:07.720 

you

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.370 

okay<00:02:08.030> for<00:02:08.240> some<00:02:08.390> reason<00:02:08.660> that<00:02:08.780> camera<00:02:09.140> shut

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
okay for some reason that camera shut

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.880 
okay for some reason that camera shut
off<00:02:09.620> so<00:02:10.160> I<00:02:10.190> didn't<00:02:10.400> get<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.580> whole<00:02:10.730> thing<00:02:11.890> but

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
off so I didn't get the whole thing but

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.840 
off so I didn't get the whole thing but
I<00:02:13.280> think<00:02:13.640> I'm<00:02:13.910> about<00:02:14.030> done<00:02:14.360> with<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.570> yard

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
I think I'm about done with the yard

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.210 
I think I'm about done with the yard
let's<00:02:16.850> say<00:02:17.240> you<00:02:17.870> think<00:02:18.560> it's<00:02:18.680> battery<00:02:18.980> power

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
let's say you think it's battery power

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:28.000 
let's say you think it's battery power
we<00:02:19.400> have<00:02:19.430> left<00:02:22.660> this<00:02:23.660> is<00:02:23.840> 3<00:02:24.110> quarters<00:02:26.230> so<00:02:27.230> based

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
we have left this is 3 quarters so based

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.810 
we have left this is 3 quarters so based
on<00:02:28.160> that<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.400> think<00:02:28.520> it<00:02:28.760> apply<00:02:29.030> do<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.710> acre<00:02:30.710> of

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
on that I think it apply do a acre of

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.640 
on that I think it apply do a acre of
trimming<00:02:31.820> I'm<00:02:32.720> not<00:02:32.900> doing<00:02:33.170> trimming<00:02:33.410> I'm

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
trimming I'm not doing trimming I'm

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:53.400 
trimming I'm not doing trimming I'm
actually<00:02:33.890> knowing<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.400> whole<00:02:34.520> yard<00:02:34.760> with<00:02:35.000> it

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.020 

if<00:02:54.410> they<00:02:54.620> had<00:02:54.770> to<00:02:54.860> spin<00:02:55.190> up<00:02:55.220> before<00:02:55.760> you<00:02:55.850> use<00:02:56.000> it

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
if they had to spin up before you use it

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.420 
if they had to spin up before you use it
it's<00:02:56.450> not<00:02:56.660> nice<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:56.930> like<00:02:57.320> it<00:02:57.440> electric<00:02:57.860> or

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
it's not nice to like it electric or

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.780 
it's not nice to like it electric or
even<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.730> gas<00:02:59.320> first<00:03:00.320> timer<00:03:02.470> but<00:03:03.640> looking<00:03:04.640> for

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
even a gas first timer but looking for

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:17.080 
even a gas first timer but looking for
my<00:03:04.940> needs<00:03:05.150> I<00:03:05.330> think<00:03:05.360> it'll<00:03:05.660> be<00:03:05.690> fine<00:03:16.030> should<00:03:17.030> I

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.710 

okay<00:03:32.620> i<00:03:32.650> think<00:03:32.860> about<00:03:33.370> that<00:03:34.330> was<00:03:34.480> probably

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720

because I was on vacation for a while

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.630 
because I was on vacation for a while
and<00:03:58.960> the<00:03:59.050> grass<00:03:59.230> got<00:03:59.500> two<00:03:59.740> tall<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.280> Fiskars

does<00:04:00.850> a<00:04:00.880> great<00:04:01.150> job<00:04:01.290> but<00:04:02.290> with<00:04:02.440> tall<00:04:02.650> grass<00:04:02.680> it

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
does a great job but with tall grass it

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.770 
does a great job but with tall grass it
just<00:04:03.520> pushes<00:04:03.730> it<00:04:04.000> over<00:04:04.120> it's<00:04:04.390> not<00:04:04.480> like<00:04:04.600> a

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
just pushes it over it's not like a

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
just pushes it over it's not like a
standard<00:04:05.230> lawnmower<00:04:06.870> so<00:04:07.870> for<00:04:08.080> me<00:04:08.230> at<00:04:08.650> this

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
standard lawnmower so for me at this

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.370 
standard lawnmower so for me at this
time<00:04:09.100> it<00:04:10.000> works<00:04:10.240> and<00:04:10.450> works<00:04:10.570> well<00:04:10.810> enough<00:04:10.870> I

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
time it works and works well enough I

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.410 
time it works and works well enough I
think<00:04:11.680> it'll<00:04:11.770> be<00:04:12.130> great<00:04:12.520> for<00:04:12.790> my<00:04:12.820> little<00:04:13.090> yard

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
think it'll be great for my little yard

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.810 
think it'll be great for my little yard
