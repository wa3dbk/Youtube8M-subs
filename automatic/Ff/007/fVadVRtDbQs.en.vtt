00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
the hood around the lens already so

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.080 
the hood around the lens already so
let's<00:01:41.850> have<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.119> look<00:01:43.490> okay<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.790> quite<00:01:45.030> a

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
let's have a look okay so it's quite a

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.660 
let's have a look okay so it's quite a
long<00:01:45.479> flowered<00:01:46.409> lens<00:01:46.649> but<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.130> would<00:01:47.220> expect

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
long flowered lens but you would expect

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.780 
long flowered lens but you would expect
that<00:01:47.759> kind<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.270> shape<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.869> size<00:01:49.290> or<00:01:49.790> something

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
that kind of shape and size or something

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.219 
that kind of shape and size or something
with<00:01:51.000> such<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> range<00:01:51.600> 70<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.200> 300<00:01:54.020> now<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.049> think

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
with such a range 70 to 300 now I think

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.020 
with such a range 70 to 300 now I think
even<00:01:55.590> my<00:01:55.740> box<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.130> going<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.310> blow<00:01:56.520> away<00:01:56.610> here

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
even my box is going to blow away here

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.520 
even my box is going to blow away here
it's<00:01:57.180> not<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.659> nicest<00:01:57.810> day<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.259> be<00:01:58.439> out

the<00:02:06.479> first<00:02:06.750> time<00:02:06.960> I'm<00:02:07.170> actually<00:02:07.380> feeling<00:02:07.890> it

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
the first time I'm actually feeling it

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.500 
the first time I'm actually feeling it
and<00:02:09.330> I'll<00:02:09.870> be<00:02:10.020> honest<00:02:10.320> it's<00:02:10.530> um<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:11.330> will<00:02:12.330> get

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
and I'll be honest it's um I will get

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.840 
and I'll be honest it's um I will get
that<00:02:12.660> after<00:02:12.810> filming<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:14.010> be<00:02:14.100> honest<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.550> um

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
that after filming to be honest it's um

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.150 
that after filming to be honest it's um
it's<00:02:15.660> heavier<00:02:15.990> than<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.290> expected<00:02:16.320> it<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.040> be

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
it's heavier than I expected it to be

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.870 
it's heavier than I expected it to be
not<00:02:18.000> in<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.240> bad<00:02:18.420> way<00:02:18.980> I've<00:02:19.980> used<00:02:20.040> some

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
not in a bad way I've used some

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.240 
not in a bad way I've used some
third-party<00:02:21.300> lenses<00:02:22.050> before<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.680> felt<00:02:23.010> a

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
third-party lenses before that felt a

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.550 
third-party lenses before that felt a
little<00:02:23.490> bit<00:02:23.610> flimsy<00:02:24.120> but<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:24.990> one<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.230> guess

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
little bit flimsy but this one I guess

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.340 
little bit flimsy but this one I guess
it's<00:02:25.770> because<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.600> ultrasonic<00:02:27.600> drive<00:02:27.960> and

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
it's because of the ultrasonic drive and

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.740 
it's because of the ultrasonic drive and
the<00:02:29.040> vibration<00:02:29.640> control<00:02:30.090> that's<00:02:30.300> got<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.510> fair

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
the vibration control that's got a fair

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.820 
the vibration control that's got a fair
bit<00:02:30.900> packed<00:02:31.170> in<00:02:31.380> there<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:32.730> feels<00:02:33.000> quite

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
bit packed in there and it feels quite

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.640 
bit packed in there and it feels quite
well-balanced<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:34.950> be<00:02:35.040> honest<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:36.500> it<00:02:37.500> is

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
well-balanced to be honest that it is

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.530 
well-balanced to be honest that it is
heavy<00:02:37.950> on<00:02:38.070> this<00:02:38.430> end<00:02:38.700> that's<00:02:38.970> where<00:02:39.210> all<00:02:39.300> the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
heavy on this end that's where all the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.740 
heavy on this end that's where all the
mechanics<00:02:40.230> are<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.470> guess<00:02:41.000> when<00:02:42.000> zoomed<00:02:42.480> out

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
mechanics are I guess when zoomed out

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.620 
mechanics are I guess when zoomed out
it's<00:02:43.110> it's<00:02:44.040> beautifully<00:02:44.670> balanced<00:02:45.180> actually

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
it's it's beautifully balanced actually

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.900 
it's it's beautifully balanced actually
and<00:02:48.200> yeah<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.380> zoom<00:02:49.650> is<00:02:49.920> quite<00:02:50.220> it's<00:02:50.550> very

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
and yeah the zoom is quite it's very

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.910 
and yeah the zoom is quite it's very
sturdy<00:02:51.210> it's<00:02:51.630> quite<00:02:52.050> smooth<00:02:54.530> okay<00:02:55.530> on<00:02:55.770> the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
sturdy it's quite smooth okay on the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.620 
sturdy it's quite smooth okay on the
side<00:02:56.130> here<00:02:56.490> I'll<00:02:56.700> pop<00:02:56.910> up<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:57.150> shot

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
side here I'll pop up a shot

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.110 
side here I'll pop up a shot
you've<00:02:58.110> got<00:02:58.350> vibration<00:02:58.920> control<00:02:59.040> on/off<00:02:59.760> and

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
you've got vibration control on/off and

I'll pop this on to my d700 take off

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.570 
I'll pop this on to my d700 take off
this<00:03:39.110> dinky<00:03:40.110> little<00:03:40.290> 50<00:03:40.830> which<00:03:40.980> is<00:03:41.190> going<00:03:41.430> to

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
this dinky little 50 which is going to

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.610 
this dinky little 50 which is going to
be<00:03:41.700> swamped<00:03:42.390> sitting<00:03:42.750> next<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:43.080> this<00:03:43.260> fella

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.100 

okay<00:03:48.830> that<00:03:49.130> said<00:03:49.460> attached<00:03:50.330> it<00:03:50.630> doesn't<00:03:50.960> feel

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
okay that said attached it doesn't feel

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.510 
okay that said attached it doesn't feel
very<00:03:51.710> heavy<00:03:53.920> this<00:03:54.920> feels<00:03:55.250> quite

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
very heavy this feels quite

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.580 
very heavy this feels quite
well-balanced<00:03:56.270> in<00:03:56.510> this<00:03:56.660> configuration<00:03:57.020> I

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
well-balanced in this configuration I

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.140 
well-balanced in this configuration I
think<00:03:57.830> if<00:03:57.980> I<00:03:58.130> had<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.700> grip<00:03:59.030> on<00:03:59.210> it<00:03:59.750> may<00:04:00.260> feel

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
think if I had the grip on it may feel

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.780 
think if I had the grip on it may feel
even<00:04:02.150> a<00:04:02.210> little<00:04:02.240> bit<00:04:03.520> light

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
even a little bit light

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.210 
even a little bit light
you<00:04:05.060> know<00:04:05.210> comparatively<00:04:05.990> to<00:04:06.170> the<00:04:06.260> body<00:04:06.500> so

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
you know comparatively to the body so

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.730 
you know comparatively to the body so
let's<00:04:07.250> just<00:04:07.640> have<00:04:07.760> a<00:04:07.820> little<00:04:08.090> shot<00:04:08.390> this<00:04:09.380> is<00:04:09.590> at

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
let's just have a little shot this is at

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.580 
let's just have a little shot this is at
70<00:04:10.190> mil<00:04:10.430> shooting<00:04:10.880> back<00:04:11.120> at<00:04:11.450> you<00:04:11.480> let's<00:04:12.140> put<00:04:12.470> it

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
70 mil shooting back at you let's put it

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:19.399 
70 mil shooting back at you let's put it
into<00:04:12.910> autofocus

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:19.409 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:29.530 

okay<00:04:20.409> let's<00:04:20.799> brighten<00:04:21.129> that<00:04:21.340> up<00:04:21.400> a<00:04:21.669> wee<00:04:21.849> bit

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:39.229 

okay<00:04:30.540> and<00:04:30.780> then<00:04:31.520> Zuma<00:04:32.520> Dean<00:04:32.700> this<00:04:33.060> is<00:04:33.300> at<00:04:33.570> 135

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:39.239 

00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:44.100 

200<00:04:40.259> and<00:04:42.239> then<00:04:43.239> let's<00:04:43.449> go<00:04:43.599> all<00:04:43.629> the<00:04:43.749> way<00:04:43.869> into

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
200 and then let's go all the way into

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:52.670 
200 and then let's go all the way into
300

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.180 

I'm<00:04:53.250> going<00:04:53.490> to<00:04:53.580> say<00:04:53.789> it's<00:04:54.030> um<00:04:54.800> it's<00:04:55.800> putting

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
I'm going to say it's um it's putting

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.670 
I'm going to say it's um it's putting
the<00:04:56.310> background<00:04:56.789> beautifully<00:04:57.509> out<00:04:57.690> of<00:04:57.870> focus

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.050 

even<00:05:01.680> there<00:05:02.010> at<00:05:02.160> 5.6<00:05:03.620> and<00:05:04.620> you<00:05:05.370> can<00:05:05.580> really

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
even there at 5.6 and you can really

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.290 
even there at 5.6 and you can really
notice<00:05:06.270> the<00:05:07.550> well<00:05:10.340> the<00:05:11.340> vibration<00:05:12.090> control

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
notice the well the vibration control

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.250 
notice the well the vibration control
works<00:05:13.080> I<00:05:14.510> don't<00:05:15.510> know<00:05:15.570> it's<00:05:15.810> a<00:05:15.870> different

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
works I don't know it's a different

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.690 
works I don't know it's a different
system<00:05:16.440> there's<00:05:16.830> something<00:05:17.160> that<00:05:17.190> I've<00:05:17.430> used

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
system there's something that I've used

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.920 
system there's something that I've used
before<00:05:18.110> once<00:05:19.110> you<00:05:19.380> are<00:05:19.560> a<00:05:20.150> half<00:05:21.150> press<00:05:21.600> and

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
before once you are a half press and

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.530 
before once you are a half press and
lock<00:05:22.110> the<00:05:22.290> shot<00:05:22.620> you<00:05:23.520> see<00:05:23.760> your<00:05:24.060> handshake

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
lock the shot you see your handshake

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.000 
lock the shot you see your handshake
actually<00:05:25.170> just<00:05:26.040> freeze

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
actually just freeze

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.790 
actually just freeze
it's<00:05:29.010> hard<00:05:29.220> to<00:05:29.310> explain<00:05:30.090> so<00:05:30.480> just<00:05:31.350> holding<00:05:31.740> it

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
it's hard to explain so just holding it

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.460 
it's hard to explain so just holding it
without<00:05:32.010> being<00:05:32.430> focused<00:05:33.060> it's<00:05:33.870> jumping

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
without being focused it's jumping

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.740 
without being focused it's jumping
around<00:05:34.560> then<00:05:35.010> you<00:05:35.130> hear<00:05:35.400> a<00:05:35.430> little<00:05:35.580> it<00:05:35.850> in<00:05:36.240> the

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
around then you hear a little it in the

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.960

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
at 3:00 now what is this so this is at

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.440 

all<00:06:23.490> right<00:06:23.580> so<00:06:23.790> it's<00:06:23.940> not<00:06:24.090> a<00:06:24.120> direct

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
all right so it's not a direct

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.870 
comparative lens because nakhon do
actually<00:06:27.330> make<00:06:27.510> a<00:06:27.540> 70<00:06:28.020> to<00:06:28.170> 300<00:06:28.800> as<00:06:28.980> well<00:06:29.220> but

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
actually make a 70 to 300 as well but

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.560 
actually make a 70 to 300 as well but
comparing<00:06:30.450> it<00:06:30.570> to<00:06:30.600> the<00:06:30.870> 70<00:06:31.260> to<00:06:31.380> 200<00:06:31.820> 2.8<00:06:32.820> you

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:33.570 
comparing it to the 70 to 200 2.8 you

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.380 
comparing it to the 70 to 200 2.8 you
can<00:06:33.720> see<00:06:33.960> the<00:06:34.170> difference<00:06:34.590> in<00:06:34.770> size<00:06:34.980> the<00:06:35.490> 70<00:06:36.270> to

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.390 
can see the difference in size the 70 to

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.200 
can see the difference in size the 70 to
200<00:06:36.600> s<00:06:37.110> quite<00:06:37.410> a<00:06:37.440> bit<00:06:37.710> bigger<00:06:37.890> once<00:06:38.790> you<00:06:38.970> lose

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
200 s quite a bit bigger once you lose

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.680 
200 s quite a bit bigger once you lose
the<00:06:39.240> hoods<00:06:40.730> the<00:06:41.730> difference<00:06:42.150> will<00:06:42.360> be<00:06:42.390> much

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690 
the hoods the difference will be much

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.680 
the hoods the difference will be much
more<00:06:42.960> pronounced<00:06:43.910> so<00:06:44.910> that's<00:06:45.150> the<00:06:45.300> difference

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
more pronounced so that's the difference

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.590 
more pronounced so that's the difference
in<00:06:45.900> size<00:06:46.140> between<00:06:46.470> them<00:06:46.950> and<00:06:47.270> fully<00:06:48.270> extended

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:50.600 
in size between them and fully extended

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.720 
in size between them and fully extended
they<00:06:51.600> do<00:06:51.660> come<00:06:52.260> out<00:06:52.290> to<00:06:52.470> nearly<00:06:53.370> the<00:06:53.550> same

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:53.730 
they do come out to nearly the same

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.170 
they do come out to nearly the same
length<00:06:54.150> the<00:06:54.840> 70<00:06:55.590> to<00:06:55.710> 200<00:06:55.920> still<00:06:56.670> a<00:06:56.700> bit<00:06:56.910> longer

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
length the 70 to 200 still a bit longer

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.890 
length the 70 to 200 still a bit longer
okay<00:06:58.170> so<00:06:58.230> the<00:06:58.890> I<00:06:59.280> don't<00:07:00.210> think<00:07:00.330> it<00:07:00.390> really<00:07:00.720> is<00:07:00.870> a

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:00.900 
okay so the I don't think it really is a

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.840 
okay so the I don't think it really is a
fair<00:07:01.230> comparison<00:07:01.620> to<00:07:02.100> compare<00:07:02.490> these<00:07:02.670> two

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.850 
fair comparison to compare these two

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.180 
fair comparison to compare these two
lenses<00:07:03.240> this<00:07:03.390> is<00:07:03.600> over<00:07:03.900> $2000<00:07:04.770> and<00:07:04.950> this<00:07:05.040> is

lenses this is over $2000 and this is
well<00:07:05.400> under<00:07:05.760> one<00:07:06.830> but<00:07:07.830> for<00:07:08.280> that<00:07:08.430> price

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:08.730 
well under one but for that price

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.250 
well under one but for that price
without<00:07:09.060> having<00:07:09.360> seen<00:07:09.570> the<00:07:09.630> image<00:07:10.020> quality
