00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.600
 You are one of our most precious instruments 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.100
 For a long time you directed your fleet with honor and distinction 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 But your inability to protect halo ... 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 ...... it has been a serious mistake. 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.400
 Soon the Great Journey will begin. 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.100
 but when it starts ... 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.600
 ... you will be left behind 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.200
 Gentlemen, we are happy to have you back 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.200
 The navy lost one of its best men. 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.200
 Rupture in space with our combat group. 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.700
 Master Chief, defend this station. 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.200
 Cortana What am I seeing exactly? 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.200
 That ... is another Halo 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.300
 So this is what my father discovered. 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.300
 The Weighing Prophet plans to activate Halo. 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.800
 Are you sure? 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.700
 Prepare yourselves marines! 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600
 Well, shoot. 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.300
 Your prophet has promised you freedom. 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.800
 But in this ring you will not find salvation. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.800
 The prophets have betrayed us. 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.800
 Impocible 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.495
 Do not 

00:01:37.495 --> 00:01:40.300
 If you take the Covenant fleet to earth ... 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.800
 .. will not have any chance. 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.800
 You have to stop it. 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.900
 I need a weapon. 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.600
 The game that defined a generation. 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.600
 And I revolutionize the online multijugadordor. 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.400
 Come back on your 10 (tenth) anniversary. 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.400
 All platforms are ready for remote activation. 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.900
 From here? 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.400
 Lady, without resolution of destiny ... 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.000
 We will not lose that ship. 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.900
