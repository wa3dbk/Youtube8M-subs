about<00:00:36.500> a<00:00:37.500> little<00:00:37.800> bit<00:00:37.950> was<00:00:38.250> basically<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.960> what

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
about a little bit was basically is what

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.720 
about a little bit was basically is what
I<00:00:39.989> plan<00:00:40.230> on<00:00:40.290> doing<00:00:40.350> for<00:00:40.530> ghosts<00:00:41.100> as<00:00:41.370> far<00:00:41.700> as

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
I plan on doing for ghosts as far as

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.970 
I plan on doing for ghosts as far as
spawn<00:00:42.030> trapping<00:00:42.270> goes<00:00:42.680> because<00:00:43.680> I'm<00:00:43.860> not

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
spawn trapping goes because I'm not

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.970 
spawn trapping goes because I'm not
really<00:00:44.129> sure<00:00:44.489> exactly<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.270> know<00:00:45.360> how<00:00:45.510> much

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
really sure exactly you know how much

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.160 
really sure exactly you know how much
it's<00:00:46.980> gonna<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.190> available<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.789> me<00:00:47.910> but<00:00:48.149> if<00:00:48.930> it

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
it's gonna be available to me but if it

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.569 
it's gonna be available to me but if it
is<00:00:49.260> I'm<00:00:49.410> gonna<00:00:49.500> do<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.890> that's<00:00:49.980> for<00:00:50.190> one<00:00:50.370> but

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
is I'm gonna do it that's for one but

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.189 
is I'm gonna do it that's for one but
quickly<00:00:51.059> I'll<00:00:51.149> just<00:00:51.300> break<00:00:51.510> down<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
quickly I'll just break down the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.229 
quickly I'll just break down the
gameplay<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> little<00:00:52.860> bit<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.190> think<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.090> final

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
gameplay a little bit I think the final

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.660 
gameplay a little bit I think the final
score<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.739> 116<00:00:55.739> -<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.010> 10<00:00:56.219> or<00:00:56.340> something<00:00:56.579> I

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
score is 116 - like 10 or something I

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.369 
score is 116 - like 10 or something I
don't<00:00:56.850> know<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.149> think<00:00:57.840> about<00:00:57.989> one<00:00:58.109> or<00:00:58.230> two

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
don't know but think about one or two

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.810 
don't know but think about one or two
trapping<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.039> do<00:00:59.160> end<00:00:59.309> up<00:00:59.370> dropping<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> lot

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
trapping is you do end up dropping a lot

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.459 
trapping is you do end up dropping a lot
of<00:00:59.969> deaths<00:01:00.149> because<00:01:01.079> there's<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> lot<00:01:01.440> of

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
of deaths because there's a lot of

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.260 
of deaths because there's a lot of
bullshit<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.039> game<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:03.030> end<00:01:03.180> up

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
bullshit in this game so you end up

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.539 
bullshit in this game so you end up
dying<00:01:03.390> from<00:01:03.539> stupid<00:01:03.989> things<00:01:04.549> painkiller

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
dying from stupid things painkiller

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.000 
dying from stupid things painkiller
makes<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.909> real<00:01:06.060> bitch<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.240> try<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.630> trap<00:01:07.010> but

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
makes it a real bitch to try to trap but

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.219 
makes it a real bitch to try to trap but
you<00:01:08.490> know<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.670> works<00:01:08.729> out<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.540> think<00:01:09.990> as<00:01:10.049> far<00:01:10.110> as

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
you know it works out I think as far as

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.990 
you know it works out I think as far as
the<00:01:10.350> guns<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.619> stuff<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.890> I'm<00:01:10.979> using<00:01:11.130> m16

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
the guns and stuff that I'm using m16

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.640 
the guns and stuff that I'm using m16
and<00:01:12.180> then<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.330> end<00:01:12.510> up<00:01:12.570> using<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.840> Rafa<00:01:13.020> cos<00:01:13.380> I

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
and then I end up using the Rafa cos I

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.359 
and then I end up using the Rafa cos I
think<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.310> other<00:01:14.430> round<00:01:14.700> I'm<00:01:15.540> using<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.810> RPD

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
think the other round I'm using the RPD

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.950 
think the other round I'm using the RPD
so<00:01:17.369> change<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.119> up<00:01:18.210> quite<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> bit<00:01:18.689> throughout

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
so change it up quite a bit throughout

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.890 
so change it up quite a bit throughout
the<00:01:19.140> whole<00:01:19.259> gameplay<00:01:20.570> you<00:01:21.570> guys<00:01:21.689> are<00:01:21.810> gonna

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
the whole gameplay you guys are gonna

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.810 
the whole gameplay you guys are gonna
mainly<00:01:22.259> see<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.680> around<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.220> defense<00:01:23.580> round

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
mainly see this around the defense round

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.670 
mainly see this around the defense round
and<00:01:24.060> you're<00:01:24.990> gonna<00:01:25.080> see<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> little<00:01:25.380> bit<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.619> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
and you're gonna see a little bit of the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.020 
and you're gonna see a little bit of the
offense<00:01:26.009> around<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.430> office<00:01:26.700> around<00:01:26.850> is

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
offense around but the office around is

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.580 
offense around but the office around is
not<00:01:27.210> nearly<00:01:27.509> as<00:01:27.750> good<00:01:27.810> as<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.110> defense<00:01:28.409> around

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
not nearly as good as the defense around

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.880 
not nearly as good as the defense around
and<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.369> think<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.729> first<00:01:29.909> round<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.570> then<00:01:30.890> no

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
and I think this first round and then no

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.090 
and I think this first round and then no
I<00:01:32.159> think<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.970> last<00:01:33.210> round<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.930> game<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.409> end

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
I think the last round of the game I end

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.499 
I think the last round of the game I end
up<00:01:35.159> dropping<00:01:35.310> like<00:01:35.460> 60<00:01:35.909> kills<00:01:36.119> or<00:01:36.270> something

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
up dropping like 60 kills or something

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.569 
up dropping like 60 kills or something
in<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.659> last<00:01:36.840> round<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:38.040> was<00:01:38.130> pretty<00:01:38.369> crazy

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
in the last round so I was pretty crazy

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.270 
in the last round so I was pretty crazy
around<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.950> definitely<00:01:40.950> that's<00:01:41.070> probably

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
around and definitely that's probably

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.590

best<00:01:41.430> part<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.729> gameplay<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.420> kind

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
best part of the gameplay so I just kind

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.090 
best part of the gameplay so I just kind
of<00:01:42.630> shortened<00:01:42.990> up<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.229> first<00:01:43.439> two<00:01:43.590> rounds<00:01:43.950> and

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
of shortened up the first two rounds and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.620 
of shortened up the first two rounds and
then<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.700> guys<00:01:44.820> can<00:01:44.970> watch<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.119> last<00:01:45.390> round

much<00:02:56.820> rather<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:57.180> know<00:02:57.420> get<00:02:57.660> shot<00:02:57.900> around<00:02:58.110> a

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
much rather you know get shot around a

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.070 
much rather you know get shot around a

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
corner then I would you know get killed

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.570 
corner then I would you know get killed

by a stealth bomber by a kid who's like
10<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:02.940> 40<00:03:03.210> you<00:03:03.300> know<00:03:03.390> what<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.510> mean<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:03.870> that's

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
10 and 40 you know what I mean so that's

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.640 
10 and 40 you know what I mean so that's
my<00:03:04.830> opinion<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.370> but<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:05.940> know<00:03:06.060> whatever

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
my opinion of it but you know whatever

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.780 
my opinion of it but you know whatever
so<00:03:07.650> that's<00:03:07.770> the<00:03:07.950> reason<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.280> really<00:03:08.460> like<00:03:08.550> to

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
kind of like capture the flag

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.110

most<00:04:27.600> I'm<00:04:28.200> pretty<00:04:28.440> sure<00:04:28.560> blitz<00:04:28.940> from<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.030> way

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
most I'm pretty sure blitz from the way

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.400 
most I'm pretty sure blitz from the way
that<00:04:30.300> it's<00:04:30.420> set<00:04:30.540> up<00:04:30.600> would<00:04:30.870> probably<00:04:31.170> have<00:04:31.320> to

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
that it's set up would probably have to

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.930 
that it's set up would probably have to
have<00:04:31.530> fixed<00:04:32.340> bonds<00:04:32.850> so<00:04:33.600> maybe<00:04:33.870> that<00:04:34.410> game-mode

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
have fixed bonds so maybe that game-mode

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
have fixed bonds so maybe that game-mode
but<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.030> thing<00:04:36.180> about<00:04:36.210> Warner<00:04:36.510> for<00:04:36.660> three<00:04:36.840> is

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
but the thing about Warner for three is

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.270 
but the thing about Warner for three is
a<00:04:37.020> lot<00:04:37.200> of<00:04:37.320> our<00:04:37.410> traps<00:04:37.680> that<00:04:37.800> we<00:04:37.860> did<00:04:38.040> were<00:04:38.130> done

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
a lot of our traps that we did were done

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.310 
a lot of our traps that we did were done
in<00:04:38.400> domination<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.120> mission<00:04:39.450> Dom<00:04:39.600> trap<00:04:39.930> the

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
in domination the mission Dom trap the

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.140 
in domination the mission Dom trap the
terminal<00:04:40.770> Dom<00:04:40.980> trap

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
terminal Dom trap

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.970 
terminal Dom trap
you<00:04:42.450> know<00:04:42.540> interchange<00:04:43.020> kind<00:04:43.320> of<00:04:43.470> but<00:04:43.800> it

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
you know interchange kind of but it

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.060 
you know interchange kind of but it
wasn't<00:04:44.220> like<00:04:44.310> 100%<00:04:44.670> like<00:04:44.970> trap<00:04:45.680> but<00:04:46.680> mission

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
wasn't like 100% like trap but mission

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.860 
wasn't like 100% like trap but mission
in<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:47.460> terminal<00:04:47.970> were<00:04:48.060> very<00:04:48.270> good<00:04:48.480> traps<00:04:48.720> and

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
in and terminal were very good traps and

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.490 
in and terminal were very good traps and
those<00:04:48.960> are<00:04:49.080> both<00:04:49.200> under<00:04:49.470> nomination<00:04:50.010> so

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
those are both under nomination so

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.840 
those are both under nomination so
because<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.590> thing<00:04:52.740> about<00:04:52.770> Infinity<00:04:53.700> Ward

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
because the thing about Infinity Ward

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.400 
because the thing about Infinity Ward
domination<00:04:54.330> sponsors<00:04:54.780> they're<00:04:54.930> very<00:04:55.110> strong

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
domination sponsors they're very strong

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.530 
domination sponsors they're very strong
you<00:04:56.190> know<00:04:56.310> you<00:04:56.370> can<00:04:56.640> get<00:04:56.760> up<00:04:56.820> in<00:04:57.030> there<00:04:57.240> small

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
you know you can get up in there small

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.470 
you know you can get up in there small
and<00:04:57.690> and<00:04:57.810> it<00:04:57.960> won't<00:04:58.110> flip<00:04:58.610> or<00:04:59.610> it'll<00:05:00.060> rarely

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
and and it won't flip or it'll rarely

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.940 
and and it won't flip or it'll rarely
flip<00:05:00.720> like<00:05:00.840> it'll<00:05:01.080> be<00:05:01.110> a<00:05:01.170> slight<00:05:01.410> flip<00:05:01.620> even<00:05:01.860> if

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
flip like it'll be a slight flip even if

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.550 
flip like it'll be a slight flip even if
it<00:05:02.040> does<00:05:02.160> flip<00:05:02.370> so<00:05:03.330> if<00:05:03.600> we<00:05:03.750> find<00:05:03.930> a<00:05:04.050> small<00:05:04.320> map

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
it does flip so if we find a small map

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.640 
it does flip so if we find a small map
and<00:05:05.450> we<00:05:06.450> can<00:05:06.570> get<00:05:06.720> up<00:05:06.840> in<00:05:06.960> there<00:05:07.110> and<00:05:07.140> trap<00:05:07.470> them

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
and we can get up in there and trap them

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.340 
and we can get up in there and trap them
on<00:05:07.740> Dom<00:05:07.950> that'll<00:05:08.280> be<00:05:08.370> cool<00:05:08.610> and<00:05:09.140> I'll<00:05:10.140> probably

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
on Dom that'll be cool and I'll probably

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.550 
on Dom that'll be cool and I'll probably
find<00:05:10.650> a<00:05:10.710> Dom<00:05:10.890> trap<00:05:11.160> to<00:05:11.970> do<00:05:12.150> and<00:05:12.540> you<00:05:12.750> know<00:05:12.840> until

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
find a Dom trap to do and you know until

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.780 
find a Dom trap to do and you know until
they<00:05:13.680> patch<00:05:13.890> it<00:05:14.070> or<00:05:14.160> whatever<00:05:14.280> you<00:05:14.460> know<00:05:14.670> they

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
they patch it or whatever you know they

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.210 
they patch it or whatever you know they
passed<00:05:14.970> mission<00:05:15.560> but<00:05:16.560> they<00:05:16.710> never<00:05:16.920> ended<00:05:17.130> up

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
passed mission but they never ended up

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.620 
passed mission but they never ended up
patchy<00:05:17.400> terminal<00:05:17.880> so<00:05:18.060> you<00:05:18.120> know<00:05:18.390> I'm<00:05:18.510> not

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
patchy terminal so you know I'm not

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.150 
patchy terminal so you know I'm not
really<00:05:18.750> sure<00:05:19.020> what<00:05:19.200> their<00:05:19.350> policy<00:05:19.770> is<00:05:19.800> on

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
really sure what their policy is on

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.060 
really sure what their policy is on
patching<00:05:21.000> stuff<00:05:21.680> you<00:05:22.680> know<00:05:22.800> we'll<00:05:22.920> have<00:05:22.950> to

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
patching stuff you know we'll have to

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.990 
patching stuff you know we'll have to
see<00:05:23.190> but<00:05:23.840> as<00:05:24.840> far<00:05:25.170> as<00:05:25.320> uh<00:05:25.350> you<00:05:25.830> know<00:05:26.340> the

don't I don't know I don't know if
demolition<00:05:30.270> is<00:05:30.330> gonna<00:05:30.480> be<00:05:30.600> in<00:05:30.690> there<00:05:30.840> I<00:05:31.590> don't

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
demolition is gonna be in there I don't

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.350 
demolition is gonna be in there I don't
know<00:05:32.130> why<00:05:32.250> they<00:05:32.370> would<00:05:32.490> take<00:05:32.610> it<00:05:32.730> out<00:05:32.820> because

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
know why they would take it out because

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.480 
know why they would take it out because
you<00:05:33.660> know<00:05:33.690> it's<00:05:33.870> been<00:05:34.020> in<00:05:34.140> the<00:05:34.230> last<00:05:34.410> you<00:05:35.370> know

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
you know it's been in the last you know

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.100 
you know it's been in the last you know
four<00:05:35.790> Call<00:05:36.060> of<00:05:36.090> Duty's<00:05:36.420> maybe<00:05:36.660> I<00:05:36.780> don't<00:05:37.050> know

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
four Call of Duty's maybe I don't know

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.770 
four Call of Duty's maybe I don't know
will<00:05:37.260> it<00:05:37.290> see<00:05:37.530> one<00:05:38.370> over<00:05:38.520> for<00:05:38.700> two<00:05:38.850> black<00:05:39.300> ops<00:05:39.540> 1

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
will it see one over for two black ops 1

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.530 
will it see one over for two black ops 1
one<00:05:40.590> for<00:05:40.620> three<00:05:41.040> black<00:05:41.550> ops<00:05:41.730> 2<00:05:41.940> so<00:05:42.180> yeah<00:05:42.420> it's

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
one for three black ops 2 so yeah it's

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.600 
one for three black ops 2 so yeah it's
been<00:05:42.660> in<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:42.810> last<00:05:42.930> four<00:05:43.200> I<00:05:43.410> don't<00:05:44.220> see<00:05:44.430> why

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
been in the last four I don't see why

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.420 
been in the last four I don't see why
they<00:05:44.790> would<00:05:44.910> take<00:05:45.060> it<00:05:45.180> out<00:05:45.320> but<00:05:46.320> they<00:05:47.190> might

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
they would take it out but they might

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.630 
they would take it out but they might
have<00:05:48.020> we<00:05:49.020> haven't<00:05:49.260> got<00:05:49.350> a<00:05:49.380> 100%<00:05:50.010> confirmed

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
have we haven't got a 100% confirmed

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.210 
have we haven't got a 100% confirmed
like<00:05:50.940> game<00:05:51.150> modes<00:05:51.390> and<00:05:51.540> everything<00:05:51.900> so

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
like game modes and everything so

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.830 
like game modes and everything so
whenever<00:05:53.220> that<00:05:53.340> comes<00:05:53.580> out<00:05:53.790> I<00:05:54.060> guess<00:05:54.630> that's

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
whenever that comes out I guess that's

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.270 
whenever that comes out I guess that's
not<00:05:54.900> gonna<00:05:55.080> come<00:05:55.260> out<00:05:55.350> until<00:05:55.470> the<00:05:55.800> day<00:05:55.980> of

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
not gonna come out until the day of

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.570 
not gonna come out until the day of
release<00:05:56.540> so<00:05:57.590> we'll<00:05:58.590> find<00:05:58.770> out<00:05:59.010> we'll<00:05:59.280> all<00:05:59.310> find

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
release so we'll find out we'll all find

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.890 
release so we'll find out we'll all find
out<00:05:59.700> together<00:05:59.850> you<00:06:00.210> know<00:06:00.330> what's<00:06:00.570> what's

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
out together you know what's what's

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.420 
out together you know what's what's
gonna<00:06:00.990> be<00:06:01.140> going<00:06:01.230> on<00:06:01.470> in<00:06:01.590> this<00:06:01.650> game<00:06:01.860> but<00:06:02.190> you

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
gonna be going on in this game but you

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.100 
gonna be going on in this game but you
know<00:06:03.030> after<00:06:03.330> the<00:06:03.420> game<00:06:03.450> comes<00:06:03.750> out<00:06:03.870> I'll

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
know after the game comes out I'll

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.530 
know after the game comes out I'll
probably<00:06:04.290> update<00:06:04.620> you<00:06:04.740> again<00:06:05.240> with<00:06:06.240> what<00:06:06.450> I'm

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
probably update you again with what I'm

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.880 
probably update you again with what I'm
thinking<00:06:06.930> about<00:06:07.020> trapping<00:06:07.500> in<00:06:07.590> that<00:06:07.710> game

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
thinking about trapping in that game

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.410 
thinking about trapping in that game
because<00:06:08.070> you<00:06:08.610> know<00:06:08.700> as<00:06:08.910> of<00:06:09.060> right<00:06:09.150> now<00:06:09.210> it's

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:09.420 
because you know as of right now it's

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.840 
because you know as of right now it's
all<00:06:09.540> just<00:06:09.750> speculation<00:06:10.080> and<00:06:10.770> what<00:06:11.340> I<00:06:11.370> think<00:06:11.670> is

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
all just speculation and what I think is

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.340 
all just speculation and what I think is
gonna<00:06:11.970> happen<00:06:12.150> when<00:06:12.360> I<00:06:12.450> I<00:06:12.510> don't<00:06:12.960> really<00:06:13.170> know

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
gonna happen when I I don't really know

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.470 
gonna happen when I I don't really know
anything<00:06:13.560> so<00:06:13.920> I<00:06:14.160> don't<00:06:14.760> know<00:06:14.940> that's<00:06:15.180> just<00:06:15.390> my

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:15.480 
anything so I don't know that's just my

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.980 
anything so I don't know that's just my
opinion

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
opinion

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.260 
opinion
and<00:06:16.170> that's<00:06:16.320> my<00:06:16.740> plans<00:06:17.100> I<00:06:17.430> guess<00:06:17.460> so<00:06:17.790> far<00:06:18.060> on
