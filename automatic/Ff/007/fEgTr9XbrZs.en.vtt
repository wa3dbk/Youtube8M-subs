00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.279
 in our second workshop we will 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.740
 see how to quickly transform a 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.320
 picture in winter photos for that we go 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.320
 open our reference photo we are going 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.070
 take which one here that we 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.859
 looks good and we will use the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.060
 famous filter photomasks 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.070
 so what is it that the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.949
 photomasks it's just all 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.289
 a set of masks that will be able 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.390
 add to your photo with which 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.600
 we will be able to play on the different 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.579
 parameters to be able to create different 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:39.780
 effects on a photo so we click on 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.610
 filter photomasks and here we have 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.670
 simply a window quite 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.340
 summary so we see mask the opacity 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.950
 and the color the mode we can add 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.600
 blur we can stretch the mask on 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.789
 the whole of our picture or the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.590
 to do under a phenomenon of repetition and 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.239
 then I can reverse the selection 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.469
 is here create a rotation of my mask 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.329
 to be able to create a winter landscape on 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.519
 so go here click on the small folder 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.070
 yellow and we will add already in a 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.650
 first time a mist effect so we 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.240
 go after mist is here haze 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.130
 and did open then how are we going 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.500
 perform well already our mass that 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.140
 is not correctly set 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.880
 put it at 90 degrees so that they 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.240
 can take the entirety of our 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.210
 photo in landscape mode 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.150
 the color we see the white let 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.979
 the opacity we will put it to 70 not to 100 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.079
 since otherwise it will be completely 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.880
 foggy so let's do a sneak peek 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.259
 live here you see we see the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.680
 mist that begin to appear on 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.680
 our photo 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.390
 at the color level 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.320
 we will leave the color mode we can 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.390
 put grayscale and glossy blur 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.950
 kids ja yes that really makes us a 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.550
 blurry as if we had rain on 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.170
 the eyes of the grounds will not hurt 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:06.180
 patterns and we'll leave in color mode 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.770
 we can add some blur if we are 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.950
 duotone so there it goes simply 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:16.230
 take the white effects of our mist 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:19.620
 and Yves go the overexposed so there is 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.120
 will stretch the mask we go the 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.280
 leave it like that if it makes you repeat 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.110
 see we have a whole other form of blur 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.600
 on the other hand we will do it until 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.850
 stretch and we'll do ok so here we have 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.019
 well our blur that was our mist 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.180
 which has been applied to our photo 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.110
 now we will add flakes 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.690
 for that we will always filter 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.730
 photomasks and we will look after the 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.010
 fashion flakes so gerard manset in the 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.730
 mp 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.410
 this is so blur kong he is here and there 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.510
 after this here our flakes have 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.769
 did open and there you saw if we 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.650
 made a direct overview of the flake we have here 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.230
 the effects that appears on our photo 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.230
 so for that at the flake level 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.840
 will take on a white color we shall 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.970
 leave that opacity at 100 for 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.060
 we see a better presence of 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.530
 our flakes and we're going to have the 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.400
 mask is not stretching pass if we have them 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.840
 because of the abuse 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.880
 the flakes are huge we will do 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.549
 repeat the mask what will give us 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.310
 a lot more flakes in our 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.920
 scene and have done ok now for 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.170
 simulate an effect of 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.870
 frost and well we will always click 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:35.470
 on filter photomasks and we will take 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:42.770
 Flame is where they are 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:44.420
 your ta ta ta ta flame and have opened 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.980
 so why am I taking flames 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:51.100
 remove if you saw that makes us a 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:53.360
 as if we had rubbed the window 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.569
 so we put it to you as you want 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.269
 we 'll put it like that we'll take in 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:02.390
 opacity white color to 100 we are going 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.130
 leave like this and we will stretch 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.810
 the mace notion makes it go 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.650
 do very very pretty name that we do 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.080
 stretched the mask and there you saw we have 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:17.120
 just finished the photomontage 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.799
 of our picture so with here so the 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.000
 brunette who is added to the picture with 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:25.460
 hawks and mask of the flame style 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.590
 to simulate simply the fact 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.160
 for example, to remove the mist on 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.260
 a window 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.870
 you just have to save 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.229
 your job 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:40.910
 take the good in jpeg we will put 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:43.789
 landscape snow and you save 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.910
 we put at 100% we keep everything as we know 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:49.669
 ok and we did and now your job is 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.880
 finished so we give ourselves an appointment 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:56.110
 for our third workshop devoted to 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.110
 photofiltre immediately
