00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
so here you have a computer hooked up to

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.139 
so here you have a computer hooked up to
the<00:00:56.699> door<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.500> if<00:00:58.500> you're<00:00:58.739> asking<00:00:59.039> what<00:00:59.670> what

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
the door and if you're asking what what

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.720 
the door and if you're asking what what
this<00:01:00.329> material<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> refined<00:01:01.859> iron<00:01:02.309> and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
this material is is a refined iron and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.479 
this material is is a refined iron and
there's<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.149> refined<00:01:03.539> iron<00:01:03.840> door<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.799> if<00:01:05.129> i<00:01:05.430> turn

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
there's a refined iron door so if i turn

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.410 
there's a refined iron door so if i turn
off<00:01:06.170> creative<00:01:07.170> mode<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:08.280> really<00:01:08.580> hard<00:01:08.909> to

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
off creative mode it's really hard to

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.940 
off creative mode it's really hard to
break<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.049> okay<00:01:10.860> takes<00:01:11.310> forever<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.790> break<00:01:12.150> it

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
break it okay takes forever to break it

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:22.039 
break it okay takes forever to break it
so<00:01:14.420> this<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:18.080> this<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.880> program<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.750> if

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
so this is the this is the program so if

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.980 
so this is the this is the program so if
i<00:01:22.200> write<00:01:22.409> my<00:01:22.590> name<00:01:22.650> my<00:01:23.610> username<00:01:23.909> it's<00:01:24.840> going

door is so of the computer so let's go

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.330 
door is so of the computer so let's go
into<00:02:50.480> notepad<00:02:50.720> plus<00:02:51.170> plus<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:51.590> show<00:02:52.070> you<00:02:52.130> the

into notepad plus plus and show you the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.940 
into notepad plus plus and show you the
code<00:02:52.550> alright<00:02:53.330> guys<00:02:53.480> so<00:02:53.750> we're<00:02:54.290> in<00:02:54.320> notepad

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
code alright guys so we're in notepad

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.790 
code alright guys so we're in notepad
plus<00:02:55.130> plus<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.700> this<00:02:56.360> is<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:56.900> command<00:02:57.590> this

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
plus plus and this is the command this

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.500 
plus plus and this is the command this
is<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.420> code<00:02:59.420> is<00:03:00.580> one<00:03:01.580> way<00:03:01.820> of<00:03:01.850> doing<00:03:02.090> it<00:03:02.270> again

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
is the code is one way of doing it again

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.350 
is the code is one way of doing it again
so<00:03:02.810> there<00:03:03.140> is<00:03:03.290> other<00:03:03.560> ways<00:03:03.830> to<00:03:04.040> doing<00:03:04.280> it<00:03:04.430> this

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
so there is other ways to doing it this

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.410 
so there is other ways to doing it this
is<00:03:05.480> not<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.870> best<00:03:06.020> way<00:03:06.170> but<00:03:06.709> hey<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.370> works<00:03:07.580> so

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
is not the best way but hey it works so

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.460 
is not the best way but hey it works so
why<00:03:08.570> not<00:03:08.770> so<00:03:09.770> you<00:03:10.430> start<00:03:10.760> by<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:12.290> right

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
why not so you start by the right

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.190 
why not so you start by the right
command<00:03:12.860> and<00:03:13.130> you<00:03:13.640> put<00:03:13.850> a<00:03:13.880> username<00:03:14.420> so<00:03:14.900> this

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
command and you put a username so this

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.560 
command and you put a username so this
is<00:03:15.320> going<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.530> put<00:03:16.340> at<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:16.640> start<00:03:16.940> username

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
is going to put at the start username

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.140 
is going to put at the start username
with<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.080> two<00:03:18.230> dots<00:03:18.410> here<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:18.970> it's<00:03:19.970> going<00:03:20.090> to

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
with the two dots here and it's going to

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:37.669 
correct password you will just print and

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:40.189 
correct password you will just print and
password<00:06:38.669> does<00:06:38.820> not<00:06:38.970> match<00:06:39.270> shutting<00:06:40.050> down

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 
password does not match shutting down

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:42.710 
password does not match shutting down
and<00:06:40.949> then<00:06:41.070> after<00:06:41.400> three<00:06:41.580> seconds<00:06:42.030> or<00:06:42.300> whatever

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 
and then after three seconds or whatever

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.040 
and then after three seconds or whatever
you<00:06:43.050> want<00:06:43.290> one<00:06:44.220> second<00:06:44.729> or<00:06:45.000> doesn't<00:06:45.810> really

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
you want one second or doesn't really

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.270 
you want one second or doesn't really
matter<00:06:47.090> you<00:06:48.090> can<00:06:48.810> change<00:06:49.080> this<00:06:49.290> after<00:06:50.130> one

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 
matter you can change this after one

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.560 
matter you can change this after one
second<00:06:50.610> it<00:06:50.699> will<00:06:50.790> shut<00:06:51.060> down<00:06:51.120> the<00:06:51.479> whole

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:51.570 
second it will shut down the whole

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.659 
second it will shut down the whole
computer<00:06:52.100> so<00:06:53.210> that's<00:06:54.210> pretty<00:06:54.630> much<00:06:54.750> it<00:06:54.900> um

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:55.669 
computer so that's pretty much it um

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:58.790 
computer so that's pretty much it um
like<00:06:56.669> I<00:06:56.820> said<00:06:56.850> it<00:06:57.150> is<00:06:57.180> like<00:06:58.050> i<00:06:58.169> like<00:06:58.560> i<00:06:58.590> said

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 
like I said it is like i like i said

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.260 
like I said it is like i like i said
it's<00:06:58.949> pretty<00:06:59.220> simple<00:06:59.550> code<00:07:01.550> you<00:07:02.550> don't<00:07:03.060> have

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.270 
it's pretty simple code you don't have

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.650 
it's pretty simple code you don't have
to<00:07:03.449> use<00:07:03.660> exactly<00:07:04.229> the<00:07:04.470> same<00:07:04.680> way<00:07:04.950> i<00:07:04.979> did<00:07:05.130> it<00:07:05.400> and

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:05.660 
to use exactly the same way i did it and

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.379 
to use exactly the same way i did it and
this<00:07:06.660> is<00:07:06.810> not<00:07:06.990> the<00:07:07.169> best<00:07:07.320> way<00:07:07.440> of<00:07:07.560> doing<00:07:07.710> it<00:07:08.070> but

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:08.389 
this is not the best way of doing it but

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:11.510 
this is not the best way of doing it but
it<00:07:09.389> does<00:07:09.600> work<00:07:09.630> and<00:07:10.200> it's<00:07:10.350> pretty<00:07:10.770> simple<00:07:11.160> I

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 
it does work and it's pretty simple I

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.230 
it does work and it's pretty simple I
mean<00:07:11.820> pretty<00:07:12.150> straightforward<00:07:12.900> and

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 
mean pretty straightforward and

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.150 
mean pretty straightforward and
hopefully<00:07:15.240> you<00:07:15.479> guys<00:07:15.780> like<00:07:16.020> it<00:07:16.200> so<00:07:16.950> guys
