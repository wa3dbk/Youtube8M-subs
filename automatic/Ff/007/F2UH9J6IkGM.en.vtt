the<00:02:01.020> design<00:02:01.620> what<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.430> got<00:02:02.580> you<00:02:02.730> got<00:02:02.820> this

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
the design what you got you got this

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.370 
the design what you got you got this
kind<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.210> platter<00:02:03.480> just<00:02:03.750> floating<00:02:04.110> down<00:02:04.229> at

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
kind of platter just floating down at

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.620 
kind of platter just floating down at
the<00:02:04.500> bottom<00:02:04.650> i<00:02:05.010> might<00:02:06.000> fail<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.360> level

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
the bottom i might fail this level

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.479 
the bottom i might fail this level
anyways<00:02:06.900> and<00:02:07.050> you<00:02:07.380> have<00:02:07.560> stuff<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:07.920> randomly

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
anyways and you have stuff that randomly

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.160 
anyways and you have stuff that randomly
pops<00:02:08.849> up<00:02:09.090> out<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.269> nowhere<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.720> just<00:02:09.899> kind<00:02:10.140> of

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
pops up out of nowhere and just kind of

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.410 
pops up out of nowhere and just kind of
falls<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.649> ground<00:02:10.760> that<00:02:11.760> will<00:02:11.849> include<00:02:12.150> a

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
falls to the ground that will include a

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.210 
falls to the ground that will include a
bunch<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.900> objects<00:02:13.440> so<00:02:13.739> many<00:02:13.950> different<00:02:14.159> kinds

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
bunch of objects so many different kinds

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.309 
bunch of objects so many different kinds
of<00:02:14.400> allah<00:02:14.519> deck<00:02:14.760> objects<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.690> kind<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.140> just

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
of allah deck objects that kind of just

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.960 
of allah deck objects that kind of just
float<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.650> ground<00:02:16.709> for<00:02:17.129> you<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.489> whole

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
float to the ground for you and whole

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.100 
float to the ground for you and whole
goal<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.269> that<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.420> have<00:02:18.569> to<00:02:18.629> pick<00:02:18.840> them<00:02:18.989> up

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
goal is that you have to pick them up

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.740 
goal is that you have to pick them up
using<00:02:19.290> your<00:02:19.500> finger<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.040> stack<00:02:20.909> them<00:02:21.060> now<00:02:21.659> it

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
using your finger and stack them now it

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.940 
using your finger and stack them now it
doesn't<00:02:21.989> really<00:02:22.080> matter<00:02:22.260> where<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.709> stack

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
doesn't really matter where you stack

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.020 
doesn't really matter where you stack
them<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.310> only<00:02:23.519> thing<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.790> really<00:02:23.940> matters

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
them the only thing that really matters

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.509 
them the only thing that really matters
is<00:02:24.569> that<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.140> keep<00:02:25.349> them<00:02:25.560> balanced<00:02:26.370> though<00:02:26.489> i

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
is that you keep them balanced though i

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.130 
is that you keep them balanced though i
can<00:02:26.819> actually<00:02:27.150> like<00:02:27.269> you<00:02:27.390> know<00:02:27.510> take<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.080> and

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
can actually like you know take it and

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.110 
can actually like you know take it and
see<00:02:28.290> how<00:02:28.319> my<00:02:28.560> house

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
see how my house

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.399 
see how my house
it's<00:02:29.209> like<00:02:29.299> not<00:02:29.480> really<00:02:29.599> aligned<00:02:30.049> with<00:02:30.290> that

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
it's like not really aligned with that

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.020 
it's like not really aligned with that
bottle<00:02:30.590> of<00:02:30.769> i<00:02:31.129> don't<00:02:31.610> know<00:02:31.670> i'm<00:02:31.730> going<00:02:31.819> to<00:02:31.879> say

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
bottle of i don't know i'm going to say

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.880 
bottle of i don't know i'm going to say
soy<00:02:32.239> sauce<00:02:32.540> because<00:02:32.810> I'm<00:02:32.930> Asian<00:02:33.080> doesn't<00:02:33.860> it

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
soy sauce because I'm Asian doesn't it

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.410 
soy sauce because I'm Asian doesn't it
look<00:02:33.950> like<00:02:34.129> soy<00:02:34.280> sauce<00:02:34.519> to<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:34.760> that<00:02:35.299> looks

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
look like soy sauce to you that looks

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.089 
look like soy sauce to you that looks
like<00:02:35.540> soy<00:02:35.690> sauce<00:02:35.900> that's<00:02:36.140> pure<00:02:36.620> soy<00:02:36.830> sauce

anyways<00:02:37.670> Tommy's<00:02:38.330> you<00:02:38.450> use<00:02:38.810> your

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
anyways Tommy's you use your

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.839 
anyways Tommy's you use your
accelerometers<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:39.620> tilt<00:02:39.830> your<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:40.489> balance

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
accelerometers to tilt your to balance

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.610 
accelerometers to tilt your to balance
your<00:02:41.030> little<00:02:41.330> plate<00:02:41.540> tray<00:02:41.840> there<00:02:42.049> and<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:42.500> can

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
your little plate tray there and you can

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.869 
your little plate tray there and you can
actually<00:02:42.739> place<00:02:43.129> the<00:02:43.159> items<00:02:43.580> anywhere

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
actually place the items anywhere

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.030 
actually place the items anywhere
they'll<00:02:44.060> kind<00:02:44.269> of<00:02:44.450> um<00:02:44.599> what's<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.590> kulluk<00:02:45.920> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
they'll kind of um what's the kulluk the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.979 
they'll kind of um what's the kulluk the
kind<00:02:46.220> of<00:02:46.250> latch<00:02:46.430> onto<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:47.000> previous<00:02:47.390> item

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
kind of latch onto the previous item

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.110 
kind of latch onto the previous item
below<00:02:48.379> anyways<00:02:48.950> as<00:02:49.190> long<00:02:49.640> as<00:02:49.760> you're<00:02:49.849> near

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
below anyways as long as you're near

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.000 
below anyways as long as you're near
that<00:02:50.329> item<00:02:50.629> and<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.409> only<00:02:51.530> thing<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:51.860> really

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
that item and the only thing you really

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.190 
that item and the only thing you really
want<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.489> worry<00:02:52.670> about<00:02:52.819> is<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.599> balancing<00:02:54.049> and

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
want to worry about is the balancing and

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.809 
want to worry about is the balancing and
so<00:02:54.950> here<00:02:55.129> we<00:02:55.220> go<00:02:55.250> I'm<00:02:55.459> just<00:02:55.610> kind<00:02:55.790> of

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
so here we go I'm just kind of

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.490 
so here we go I'm just kind of
seasonally<00:02:56.269> you<00:02:56.480> use<00:02:56.659> accelerometer<00:02:57.260> balance

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
seasonally you use accelerometer balance

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.170 
seasonally you use accelerometer balance
the<00:02:57.920> strangelet<00:02:58.459> left<00:02:58.640> there<00:02:58.790> are<00:02:59.030> no

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
the strangelet left there are no

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.539 
the strangelet left there are no
external<00:02:59.540> longer<00:02:59.930> controls<00:03:00.349> so<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:00.980> know<00:03:01.370> if

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
external longer controls so you know if

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.250 
external longer controls so you know if
you<00:03:01.670> want<00:03:01.849> a<00:03:01.910> little<00:03:02.060> more<00:03:02.180> sensitivity<00:03:02.959> I

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
you want a little more sensitivity I

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.839 
you want a little more sensitivity I
don't<00:03:04.190> think<00:03:04.250> there's<00:03:04.459> a<00:03:04.519> way<00:03:04.609> you<00:03:04.640> can

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
don't think there's a way you can

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.849 
don't think there's a way you can
actually<00:03:05.090> turn<00:03:05.239> that<00:03:05.390> up<00:03:05.650> here's<00:03:06.650> a<00:03:06.709> pause

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
actually turn that up here's a pause

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.380 
actually turn that up here's a pause
menu<00:03:07.010> no<00:03:07.250> there's<00:03:07.459> no<00:03:07.579> options<00:03:07.970> menu<00:03:08.150> either

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
menu no there's no options menu either

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.289 
menu no there's no options menu either
or<00:03:08.930> anything<00:03:09.260> like<00:03:09.290> that<00:03:09.440> now<00:03:10.099> once<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:10.579> start

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
or anything like that now once you start

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.819 
or anything like that now once you start
balancing<00:03:11.660> them<00:03:11.930> up<00:03:12.049> the<00:03:12.200> screen<00:03:12.440> will<00:03:12.650> zoom

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
balancing them up the screen will zoom

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.619 
balancing them up the screen will zoom
out<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.129> our<00:03:13.400> styles<00:03:13.819> and<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.209> background<00:03:14.569> is

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
out and our styles and the background is

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.030 
out and our styles and the background is
really<00:03:14.810> great<00:03:14.959> there<00:03:15.560> are<00:03:15.680> a<00:03:15.709> couple<00:03:15.829> things

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
really great there are a couple things

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.770 
really great there are a couple things
that<00:03:16.220> pop<00:03:16.370> up<00:03:16.519> one<00:03:16.700> of<00:03:16.819> those<00:03:16.940> white<00:03:17.390> stars

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
that pop up one of those white stars

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.899 
that pop up one of those white stars
that<00:03:18.769> was<00:03:18.920> just<00:03:19.069> pop<00:03:19.190> up<00:03:19.340> randomly<00:03:19.640> you<00:03:19.730> can

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:19.909 
that was just pop up randomly you can

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.000 
that was just pop up randomly you can
get<00:03:20.060> those<00:03:20.269> and<00:03:20.599> then<00:03:20.870> another<00:03:21.140> are<00:03:21.470> these

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
get those and then another are these

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.740 
get those and then another are these
those<00:03:22.459> circular<00:03:22.849> things<00:03:23.239> that<00:03:23.480> you<00:03:23.569> kind<00:03:23.659> of

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750
