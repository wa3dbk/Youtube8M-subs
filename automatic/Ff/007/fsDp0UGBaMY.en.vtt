when<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.200> came<00:01:37.380> out<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.740> 35<00:01:38.369> half<00:01:38.610> K<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:38.970> him

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
when it came out on a 35 half K for him

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.969 
when it came out on a 35 half K for him
