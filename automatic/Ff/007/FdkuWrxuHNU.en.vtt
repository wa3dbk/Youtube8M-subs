00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.700
 hello my name is juan and welcome 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.590
 again with the mind today 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.510
 I have a subject that is something means that 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.610
 valuable to many men but they are 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.259
 the bags of men is very important 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.209
 because lately in fashion 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.100
 the designers have transgressed this 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.140
 issue of accesses and are for 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.000
 men and for women and they offer us a 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.800
 variety of bags for men that are 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.510
 adapted to our needs 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.060
 we are going to present male fashion fat u 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.619
 33 trends of handbags and they will be used 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.660
 for this season number one the 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.640
 charter back is a bag with handles 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.920
 elongated we can use both in the 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.750
 shoulder that as in the hand and its reform 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.540
 rectangular allows us how to load 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.940
 many things like notebooks documents 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.470
 the laptop and this in turn are also 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.600
 Minimalist designs makes us that can 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.390
 fit in any type of look number 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.760
 two class the touch is a hybrid 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.440
 between a kind of portfolio without handles 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.120
 of a female portfolio thanks to its 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.100
 small thickness what we can load in 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.070
 they are like the cell phone some 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.350
 documents the tablet and any kind of 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.090
 cards our portfolio even 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.460
 then this is going to help us too 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.780
 to have too much style number 3 the 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.450
 famous tag 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.729
 or the backpack the backpack is obviously a 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.369
 model as sporty but it's too much 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.409
 an already very urban proposal which 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.060
 lately we have seen it in materials 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.830
 very recent like the cne or petro and the 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.420
 skin one of the most quoted models 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.159
 for this season is the zipper that 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.050
 It has bags on the sides but these 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.970
 are some of the trends of the 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.190
 Today's bag of mine is like this 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.200
 mine is kind of the table a pac 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.119
 touch that has too many bags 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.030
 also has like this combination like 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.520
 of faux fur with denim and 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:42.619
 too comfortable the truth here I carry my 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.990
 tablet my wallet my cell phone my laptop and 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.179
