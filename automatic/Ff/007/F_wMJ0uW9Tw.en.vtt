does it say you can turn those phones

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.920 
does it say you can turn those phones
off<00:04:47.139> now<00:04:47.380> guys<00:04:47.669> does<00:04:48.669> it<00:04:48.820> say<00:04:49.000> 56<00:04:49.570> mile<00:04:49.750> an

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
off now guys does it say 56 mile an

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.420 
off now guys does it say 56 mile an
hour's<00:04:50.200> at<00:04:50.380> a<00:04:51.070> stream<00:04:52.620> it<00:04:53.620> doesn't<00:04:54.070> say<00:04:54.250> the

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
hour's at a stream it doesn't say the

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.159 
hour's at a stream it doesn't say the
accuracy<00:04:55.060> plays<00:04:55.270> a<00:04:55.300> big<00:04:55.570> key<00:04:55.780> because<00:04:56.139> that

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
accuracy plays a big key because that

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.200 
accuracy plays a big key because that
turns<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:57.010> wheel<00:04:57.190> and<00:04:57.430> keeps<00:04:57.639> it<00:04:57.850> spinning

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
turns the wheel and keeps it spinning

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.570 
turns the wheel and keeps it spinning
and<00:04:58.570> increases<00:04:59.470> that<00:04:59.620> state<00:04:59.919> you're<00:05:00.550> going

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
and increases that state you're going

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.420 
and increases that state you're going
because<00:05:01.060> if<00:05:01.419> you<00:05:01.540> if<00:05:01.870> you<00:05:02.110> move<00:05:02.860> your<00:05:03.070> stream

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
because if you if you move your stream

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.280 
because if you if you move your stream
even<00:05:03.790> the<00:05:03.880> slightest<00:05:04.330> bit<00:05:04.389> the<00:05:04.690> wheel<00:05:04.870> stops

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
even the slightest bit the wheel stops

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.990 
even the slightest bit the wheel stops
and<00:05:05.560> I<00:05:05.620> think<00:05:05.770> that's<00:05:05.919> what<00:05:06.070> Tom's<00:05:06.310> problem

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
and I think that's what Tom's problem

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.190 
and I think that's what Tom's problem
hmm

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
hmm

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.659 
hmm
