first thing we need to do is go ahead
and<00:00:29.760> work<00:00:29.880> with<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.119> exhaust<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.050> can

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
and work with the exhaust so we can

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.569 
and work with the exhaust so we can
lower<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.560> get<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.920> one<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.070> our<00:00:32.189> access

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
lower it to get to one of our access

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.040 
lower it to get to one of our access
points<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.059> all<00:00:33.420> we<00:00:33.540> have<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.690> do<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:33.840> remove

the two rubber hangers they're closest
to<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.000> tailpipe<00:00:36.290> we're<00:00:37.290> just<00:00:37.410> gonna<00:00:37.500> use<00:00:37.620> a

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
to the tailpipe we're just gonna use a

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.360 
to the tailpipe we're just gonna use a
pry<00:00:38.129> bar<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.579> just<00:00:38.790> pry<00:00:39.030> them<00:00:39.149> off<00:00:40.250> well<00:00:41.250> let's

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
pry bar and just pry them off well let's

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.700 
pry bar and just pry them off well let's
go<00:00:41.460> into<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.700> lower<00:00:41.969> hour<00:00:42.210> away<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.809> then
