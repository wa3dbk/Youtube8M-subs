 Because of it I have not seen in kudzu months Mt real-time began to see in real time, such from Agito 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:31.899
 There's a bit of a lack of information about the puller, though 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.979
 This Ne Toraji's line that there is no cherry-san and beat g Now which way in from Remember me earlier

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.210
 There was 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.710

 First Tri Chaser 2000 pedestal 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.470
 It is a clear array 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:52.420
 The voice pedestal above this 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:55.640
 It feels like a matte that won't turn away 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.720
 Do you know because there is a back I know 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.310

 Is it a normal version not a try chaser? Is it a beat chaser? 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:17.900

 Coloring that Tri Chaser is Silver and Beat Chaser is Black 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:38.880
