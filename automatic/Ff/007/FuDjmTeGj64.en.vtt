cape<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.850> sold<00:02:03.149> by<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.600> big-ass<00:02:04.530> muscular

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430

dude<00:02:05.579> with<00:02:05.820> nipples<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.750> actually<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.469> don't

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
dude with nipples that actually I don't

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.050 
dude with nipples that actually I don't
think<00:02:07.799> rusev<00:02:07.890> characters<00:02:08.399> have<00:02:08.520> nipples<00:02:08.849> okay

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
think rusev characters have nipples okay

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.430 
think rusev characters have nipples okay
so<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.479> take<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.780> back<00:02:09.840> he<00:02:10.140> doesn't<00:02:10.379> have

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
so I take that back he doesn't have

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.339 
so I take that back he doesn't have
nipples<00:02:10.770> but<00:02:11.400> he's<00:02:11.550> big<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.180> muscular<00:02:12.390> anyway

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
nipples but he's big and muscular anyway

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.030 
nipples but he's big and muscular anyway
so<00:02:13.410> did

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
so did

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.069 
so did
my<00:02:14.430> first<00:02:14.640> impression<00:02:15.030> on<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.629> it's<00:02:15.840> um

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
my first impression on is that it's um

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.429 
my first impression on is that it's um
it's<00:02:16.879> MEA<00:02:17.879> of<00:02:18.120> cable<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.659> guess<00:02:18.989> we'll<00:02:19.140> see<00:02:19.409> if

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
it's MEA of cable I guess we'll see if

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.289 
it's MEA of cable I guess we'll see if
it<00:02:19.650> becomes<00:02:19.859> more<00:02:20.189> f<00:02:20.400> capable<00:02:20.909> as<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.150> get

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
it becomes more f capable as you get

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:22.670 
it becomes more f capable as you get
further<00:02:21.450> into<00:02:21.689> the<00:02:21.870> skill<00:02:22.140> they're<00:02:22.590> all

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
further into the skill they're all

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.319 
further into the skill they're all
obviously<00:02:23.459> be<00:02:23.549> people<00:02:23.849> who<00:02:23.939> make<00:02:24.120> guides

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
obviously be people who make guides

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.089 
obviously be people who make guides
myself<00:02:24.870> included<00:02:25.290> once<00:02:25.469> I<00:02:25.590> actually<00:02:25.769> learned

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
myself included once I actually learned

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.780 
myself included once I actually learned
to<00:02:26.340> play<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.519> skill<00:02:26.849> and<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:28.159> basically<00:02:29.159> you

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
to play the skill and to basically you

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.599 
to play the skill and to basically you
know<00:02:29.879> access<00:02:30.299> all<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.689> features<00:02:30.870> and

know access all of the features and

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.940 
know access all of the features and

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
utilize the things that are considered I

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.920 
utilize the things that are considered I
guess<00:02:35.129> perks<00:02:35.459> from<00:02:35.819> from<00:02:36.209> gaining<00:02:36.450> levels<00:02:36.750> and

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
guess perks from from gaining levels and

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.839 
guess perks from from gaining levels and
stuff<00:02:36.989> with<00:02:37.379> divination<00:02:37.769> at<00:02:38.189> the<00:02:38.280> moment<00:02:38.640> like

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
stuff with divination at the moment like

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.089 
stuff with divination at the moment like
I<00:02:38.939> said<00:02:39.180> it's<00:02:39.900> just<00:02:40.260> come<00:02:40.409> out<00:02:40.560> literally<00:02:40.889> I

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
I said it's just come out literally I

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.170 
I said it's just come out literally I
have<00:02:41.430> no<00:02:41.609> idea<00:02:41.639> about<00:02:42.590> too<00:02:43.590> much<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.939> skill

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
have no idea about too much of the skill

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.610 
have no idea about too much of the skill
in<00:02:45.329> general<00:02:45.689> but<00:02:45.870> what<00:02:46.079> I<00:02:46.109> will<00:02:46.230> say<00:02:46.349> is<00:02:46.560> that

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
in general but what I will say is that

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.899 
in general but what I will say is that
apparently<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.829> the<00:02:50.099> experience<00:02:50.760> rates

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
apparently the the experience rates

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.069 
apparently the the experience rates
aren't<00:02:51.120> going<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:51.329> be<00:02:51.389> very<00:02:51.510> fast<00:02:51.840> quite

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
aren't going to be very fast quite

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.530 
aren't going to be very fast quite
