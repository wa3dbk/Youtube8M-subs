00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.539 
around on them and Terra would actually
think<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.140> Deathstroke<00:01:52.680> has<00:01:52.710> betrayed<00:01:53.280> her

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
think that Deathstroke has betrayed her

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.490 
think that Deathstroke has betrayed her
so<00:01:54.000> rather<00:01:54.180> than<00:01:54.360> talking<00:01:54.750> things<00:01:55.170> out<00:01:55.380> and

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
so rather than talking things out and

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.350 
so rather than talking things out and
trying<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.799> work<00:01:56.070> together<00:01:56.369> with<00:01:56.880> Deathstroke

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
trying to work together with Deathstroke

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.289 
trying to work together with Deathstroke
so<00:01:57.930> they<00:01:58.079> can<00:01:58.290> turn<00:01:58.860> things<00:01:59.189> back<00:01:59.369> around<00:02:00.000> and

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
so they can turn things back around and

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.020 
so they can turn things back around and
save<00:02:00.600> their<00:02:00.899> plan<00:02:01.200> she<00:02:02.159> brings<00:02:02.520> down<00:02:02.759> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
save their plan she brings down the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.200 
save their plan she brings down the
entire<00:02:03.570> hive<00:02:03.960> building<00:02:04.649> on<00:02:04.799> herself<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.969> then

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
entire hive building on herself and then

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.449 
entire hive building on herself and then
attempts<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.810> kill<00:02:07.049> everyone<00:02:07.560> inside<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.340> it

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.620 
which is really really surprising
considering<00:05:27.479> you<00:05:27.840> know<00:05:27.990> it<00:05:28.800> was<00:05:28.949> a<00:05:29.130> demon

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
considering you know it was a demon

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.760 
considering you know it was a demon
personally<00:05:30.630> I<00:05:30.660> do<00:05:30.840> feel<00:05:31.139> like<00:05:31.169> he's<00:05:31.470> a<00:05:31.500> strong

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
personally I do feel like he's a strong

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.620 
personally I do feel like he's a strong
enough<00:05:31.950> character<00:05:32.430> to<00:05:32.580> have<00:05:32.789> his<00:05:33.030> own<00:05:33.270> series

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
enough character to have his own series

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.650 
enough character to have his own series
simply<00:05:34.320> titled<00:05:34.740> kid<00:05:35.010> devil<00:05:35.370> or<00:05:35.580> Red<00:05:35.850> Devil<00:05:36.240> but

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
simply titled kid devil or Red Devil but

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.629 
simply titled kid devil or Red Devil but
if<00:05:36.750> he<00:05:36.840> has<00:05:37.050> to<00:05:37.229> go<00:05:37.350> on<00:05:37.380> the<00:05:37.650> Titans<00:05:38.070> once<00:05:38.310> again

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
if he has to go on the Titans once again

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.150 
if he has to go on the Titans once again
he<00:05:39.150> would<00:05:39.330> definitely<00:05:39.690> fit<00:05:40.350> in<00:05:40.590> with<00:05:40.800> the<00:05:40.950> team

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
he would definitely fit in with the team

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.770 
he would definitely fit in with the team
especially<00:05:41.669> once<00:05:42.300> again<00:05:42.570> because

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
especially once again because

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.779 
especially once again because
everything's<00:05:43.260> so<00:05:43.349> serious<00:05:44.039> in<00:05:44.160> the<00:05:44.250> Titans<00:05:44.639> at

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
everything's so serious in the Titans at

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:47.659 
everything's so serious in the Titans at
the<00:05:44.880> moment<00:05:45.210> and<00:05:45.330> it<00:05:45.780> could<00:05:46.110> just<00:05:46.440> be<00:05:46.650> a<00:05:46.950> bit<00:05:47.520> of

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
the moment and it could just be a bit of

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.820 
the moment and it could just be a bit of
fun<00:05:47.960> occasionally<00:05:48.960> and<00:05:49.169> he'll<00:05:49.560> be<00:05:49.710> the

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
fun occasionally and he'll be the

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.560 
fun occasionally and he'll be the
perfect<00:05:50.310> character<00:05:50.639> to<00:05:50.880> kind<00:05:51.090> of<00:05:51.150> remind<00:05:51.389> the

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
perfect character to kind of remind the

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.930 
perfect character to kind of remind the
