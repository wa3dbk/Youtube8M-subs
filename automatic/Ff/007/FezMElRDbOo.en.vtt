stacks up on the size chart also the
other<00:01:06.030> thing<00:01:06.119> I'll<00:01:06.360> call<00:01:06.540> out<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.229> while

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
other thing I'll call out is that while

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.859 
other thing I'll call out is that while
the<00:01:07.590> pre<00:01:07.860> curve<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.729> little<00:01:09.240> bit<00:01:09.390> aggressive

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
the pre curve is a little bit aggressive

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.960 
the pre curve is a little bit aggressive
what<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.290> will<00:01:10.530> say<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> width<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
what I will say is that the width of the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.490 
what I will say is that the width of the
fingers<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.450> bulkier<00:01:12.990> than<00:01:13.049> i<00:01:13.229> was<00:01:13.380> expecting

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
fingers is bulkier than i was expecting

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.810 
fingers is bulkier than i was expecting
so<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> little<00:01:14.250> bit<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.490> width<00:01:14.580> if<00:01:14.729> you

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
so it's a little bit of width if you

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.609 
so it's a little bit of width if you
have<00:01:14.939> thicker<00:01:15.360> fingers<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.290> could<00:01:16.500> be<00:01:16.590> a

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
have thicker fingers this could be a

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.740 
have thicker fingers this could be a
great<00:01:16.799> option<00:01:17.130> for<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.640> now<00:01:18.030> moving<00:01:18.570> back

TV our youtube channel again the cuff is
going<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.130> be<00:01:26.189> pretty<00:01:26.340> basic<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.939> tpr<00:01:27.360> is

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
going to be pretty basic this tpr is

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.060 
going to be pretty basic this tpr is
pretty<00:01:27.659> low<00:01:27.840> profile<00:01:28.229> i<00:01:28.439> could<00:01:28.770> see<00:01:28.920> them

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
pretty low profile i could see them

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.350 
pretty low profile i could see them
adding<00:01:29.340> some<00:01:29.520> protection<00:01:30.000> here<00:01:30.150> moving

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
adding some protection here moving

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.850 
adding some protection here moving
forward<00:01:30.840> moving<00:01:31.110> up<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> back<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
forward moving up to the back of the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.429 
forward moving up to the back of the
hand<00:01:32.070> good<00:01:32.549> panel<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:33.150> dense<00:01:33.810> foam<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.320> then

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
hand good panel of dense foam and then

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.719 
hand good panel of dense foam and then
we<00:01:34.560> do<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.890> hardshell<00:01:35.250> knuckle<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
we do have a hardshell knuckle and the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.370 
we do have a hardshell knuckle and the
way<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.939> knuckle<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.360> shaped<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.780> going<00:01:37.290> to

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
way the knuckle is shaped is going to

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.840 
way the knuckle is shaped is going to
allow<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.770> get<00:01:37.890> these<00:01:38.040> raised<00:01:38.400> ridges

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
allow you to get these raised ridges

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.700 
allow you to get these raised ridges
that<00:01:39.150> really<00:01:39.570> give<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.840> less<00:01:40.170> surface<00:01:40.500> area

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
that really give you less surface area

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.980 
that really give you less surface area
so<00:01:41.310> when<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.520> are<00:01:41.549> sliding<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.329> them<00:01:42.450> it'll<00:01:42.810> be

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
so when you are sliding on them it'll be

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.899 
so when you are sliding on them it'll be
less<00:01:43.470> resistance<00:01:44.340> with<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.549> ground<00:01:44.759> you'll

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
less resistance with the ground you'll

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.520 
less resistance with the ground you'll
just<00:01:45.060> skip<00:01:45.299> right<00:01:45.329> over<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.840> moving<00:01:46.350> into<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
just skip right over it moving into the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.679 
just skip right over it moving into the
fingers<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.520> elasticated<00:01:48.000> panels<00:01:48.450> for<00:01:48.570> your

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
fingers to elasticated panels for your

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.179 
fingers to elasticated panels for your
hook<00:01:48.840> fingers<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.619> start<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.920> get<00:01:50.009> these

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
hook fingers and you start to get these

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.980 
hook fingers and you start to get these
raised<00:01:50.520> areas<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.030> dense<00:01:51.210> foam<00:01:51.450> as<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.840> move

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
raised areas of dense foam as you move

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.450 
raised areas of dense foam as you move
away<00:01:52.140> from<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.530> hand<00:01:52.770> toward<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.070> lateral

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
away from the hand toward the lateral

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.219 
away from the hand toward the lateral
side<00:01:53.490> or<00:01:53.939> towards<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.450> lateral<00:01:54.840> side<00:01:54.899> which

side or towards the lateral side which

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.080 
side or towards the lateral side which
will<00:01:55.350> be<00:01:55.470> most<00:01:55.950> prone<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.399> low<00:01:56.549> side<00:01:56.790> crash

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
will be most prone and a low side crash

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.630 
will be most prone and a low side crash
to<00:01:57.299> impact<00:01:57.719> moving<00:01:58.409> into<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.619> thumb<00:01:58.829> nice<00:01:59.430> big

again<00:02:03.479> back<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.930> palm<00:02:04.110> we<00:02:04.259> talked<00:02:04.500> about

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
again back in the palm we talked about

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.260 
again back in the palm we talked about
this<00:02:04.770> lower<00:02:04.979> area<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.549> would<00:02:05.880> have<00:02:05.969> liked<00:02:06.149> to

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
this lower area I would have liked to

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.670 
this lower area I would have liked to
have<00:02:06.299> seen<00:02:06.479> them<00:02:06.630> done<00:02:06.840> an<00:02:06.990> area<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.320> leather

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
have seen them done an area of leather

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.040 
have seen them done an area of leather
here<00:02:08.039> for<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.090> reinforcements<00:02:09.690> across<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
here for the reinforcements across the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.750 
here for the reinforcements across the
control<00:02:10.289> area<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.160> crook<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.550> hand

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
control area and the crook of the hand

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.130 
control area and the crook of the hand
but<00:02:12.120> again<00:02:12.420> maybe<00:02:12.569> it'll<00:02:12.780> make<00:02:12.900> those

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
but again maybe it'll make those

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.390 
but again maybe it'll make those
