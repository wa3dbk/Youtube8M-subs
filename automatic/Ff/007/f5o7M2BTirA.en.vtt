 high and very low 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.270
 when the concessionaire offers a 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.520
 very high market value for the vehicle 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.440

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.190
 with the car you used to make you pay a 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.440

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.980
