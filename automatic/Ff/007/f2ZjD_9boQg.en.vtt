was<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.110> primary<00:01:52.500> concern<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.220> we're

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
was a primary concern and we're

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.569 
was a primary concern and we're
selecting<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:53.909> particular<00:01:54.240> camera<00:01:54.750> body

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
selecting this particular camera body

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.060 
selecting this particular camera body
you<00:01:56.579> can<00:01:56.729> also<00:01:57.090> pre<00:01:57.780> mount<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.200> baseplate<00:01:58.439> onto

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
you can also pre mount a baseplate onto

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.190 
you can also pre mount a baseplate onto
a<00:01:59.100> wall<00:01:59.369> here<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.270> see<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.540> base<00:02:00.689> plate<00:02:00.990> and

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
a wall here you see the base plate and

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.859 
a wall here you see the base plate and
then<00:02:01.890> screw<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.490> camera<00:02:02.729> onto<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.630> base

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
then screw the camera onto that base

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:04.429 
then screw the camera onto that base
plate

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
plate

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.010 
plate
so<00:02:05.369> you'd<00:02:05.700> mount<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.119> base<00:02:06.420> plate<00:02:06.659> onto<00:02:06.960> a

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
so you'd mount the base plate onto a

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.339 
so you'd mount the base plate onto a
wall<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:08.690> then<00:02:09.690> using<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.170> cable

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
wall like that and then using the cable

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.530 
wall like that and then using the cable
managed<00:02:10.679> bracket<00:02:11.129> feed<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.940> cables<00:02:12.360> through

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
managed bracket feed the cables through

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.880 
managed bracket feed the cables through
the<00:02:12.569> base<00:02:12.840> plate

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
the base plate

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.950 
the base plate
and<00:02:13.980> securely<00:02:14.460> mount<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:14.970> camera<00:02:15.420> onto<00:02:15.630> the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
foam sealing pads you can see in the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.949 
foam sealing pads you can see in the
shot<00:02:26.819> as<00:02:27.150> well<00:02:29.209> now<00:02:30.209> one<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.570> things<00:02:30.810> which

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
shot as well now one of the things which

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.230 
shot as well now one of the things which
we<00:02:31.140> always<00:02:31.380> come<00:02:31.740> across<00:02:31.860> is<00:02:32.640> difficult

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
we always come across is difficult

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.330 
we always come across is difficult
access<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.870> certain<00:02:34.080> screws<00:02:34.560> on<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:34.980> mounting

access to certain screws on the mounting
plates<00:02:35.610> here<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.450> can<00:02:36.600> see<00:02:36.780> these<00:02:36.990> three

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
plates here you can see these three

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.900 
plates here you can see these three
screws<00:02:37.530> are<00:02:37.709> easily<00:02:37.920> accessible<00:02:38.490> but<00:02:38.790> the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
screws are easily accessible but the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.020 
screws are easily accessible but the
fourth<00:02:39.180> screw<00:02:39.540> is<00:02:39.720> really<00:02:39.989> hard<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.350> get<00:02:40.470> at

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
fourth screw is really hard to get at

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.820 
fourth screw is really hard to get at

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
with this camera body style you simply

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.500 
with this camera body style you simply
swing<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.190> cam<00:02:44.400> around<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:45.090> you've<00:02:45.330> got<00:02:45.480> a

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
swing the cam around and you've got a

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.140 
swing the cam around and you've got a
nice<00:02:45.720> easy<00:02:45.959> access<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.800> fitting<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:48.030> also

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
nice easy access to that fitting it also

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.970 
nice easy access to that fitting it also
makes<00:02:48.540> using<00:02:48.720> power<00:02:49.080> tools<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.560> fit<00:02:49.860> the

makes using power tools to fit the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.870 
makes using power tools to fit the
camera<00:02:50.310> much<00:02:50.760> much<00:02:51.000> easier<00:02:52.310> once<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.580> cameras

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
camera much much easier once the cameras

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.820 
camera much much easier once the cameras
been<00:02:54.000> mounted<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.840> lock<00:02:55.050> it<00:02:55.200> in<00:02:55.350> position<00:02:55.739> on

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
been mounted you lock it in position on

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.740 
been mounted you lock it in position on
the<00:02:55.950> mount<00:02:56.160> using<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:56.910> locking<00:02:57.209> ring<00:02:57.239> as<00:02:57.630> you

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
the mount using the locking ring as you

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.680 
the mount using the locking ring as you
can<00:02:57.900> see<00:02:58.080> now<00:02:58.670> for<00:02:59.670> final<00:03:00.030> adjustment<00:03:00.480> it

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
can see now for final adjustment it

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.810 
can see now for final adjustment it
helps<00:03:01.140> sometimes<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.739> use<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.220> whole<00:03:02.459> camera

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
helps sometimes to use the whole camera

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.960 
helps sometimes to use the whole camera
to<00:03:03.300> get<00:03:03.420> good<00:03:03.630> leverage<00:03:04.610> so<00:03:05.610> that's<00:03:05.820> our

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
to get good leverage so that's our

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.509 
to get good leverage so that's our
