and let's elaborate on that it's calm
it's<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.330> movement<00:01:09.540> system<00:01:10.020> where<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.590> player

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
it's a movement system where the player

can<00:01:11.340> kind<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:11.939> get<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.840> get<00:01:13.020> into<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
can kind of get it get into the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.020 
can kind of get it get into the
different<00:01:13.680> spots<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> map<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.670> do<00:01:14.820> things

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
different spots on the map and do things

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.179 
different spots on the map and do things
very<00:01:15.090> easily<00:01:15.390> but<00:01:15.659> well<00:01:16.110> what<00:01:16.470> movement<00:01:17.040> has

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
very easily but well what movement has

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.770 
very easily but well what movement has
been<00:01:17.310> weird<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.850> shooters<00:01:18.150> for<00:01:18.330> years<00:01:18.570> we've

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
been weird in shooters for years we've

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.149 
been weird in shooters for years we've
had<00:01:18.900> these<00:01:18.990> shooters<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.320> look<00:01:19.619> beautiful

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
had these shooters that look beautiful

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.830 
had these shooters that look beautiful
but<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.880> movements<00:01:21.270> really<00:01:21.360> witnessed<00:01:21.720> like

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
but the movements really witnessed like

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.359 
but the movements really witnessed like
you're<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> refrigerator<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.830> roller<00:01:23.040> skates

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
you're a refrigerator on a roller skates

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.390 
you're a refrigerator on a roller skates
you<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.210> know<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.200> no<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.680> am<00:01:25.979> I'm

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
you like you know it's like no I am I'm

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.880 
you like you know it's like no I am I'm
a<00:01:26.460> fairly<00:01:26.820> pumped<00:01:27.299> man<00:01:27.479> right<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:28.740> it's

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
a fairly pumped man right but it's

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.560 
a fairly pumped man right but it's
ludicrous<00:01:29.310> then<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.759> game<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.000> can't<00:01:30.390> get

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
ludicrous then in a game I can't get

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.450 
ludicrous then in a game I can't get
over<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.810> wall<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.380> that's<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.770> high<00:01:31.979> you

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
over a wall of that that's that high you

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.980 
over a wall of that that's that high you
for<00:01:32.700> economy<00:01:33.090> i<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.299> get<00:01:33.390> other<00:01:33.479> over<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.900> all

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
for economy i can get other over of all

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.870 
for economy i can get other over of all
that<00:01:34.170> high<00:01:34.350> that's<00:01:34.590> not<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> problem<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.700> why

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
that high that's not a problem so why

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.850 
that high that's not a problem so why
can't<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.270> do<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.659> game<00:01:36.930> well<00:01:37.320> because

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
can't you do that in game well because

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.170 
can't you do that in game well because
it<00:01:38.040> takes<00:01:38.189> quite<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.430> lot<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.670> technology<00:01:39.090> and

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
it takes quite a lot of technology and

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.819 
it takes quite a lot of technology and
know<00:01:39.299> how<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.509> do<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.320> whole<00:01:40.560> point<00:01:40.740> of

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
know how to do it so the whole point of

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.319 
know how to do it so the whole point of
the<00:01:40.950> smart<00:01:41.250> system<00:01:41.579> returns<00:01:41.729> for<00:01:42.060> smooth

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
the smart system returns for smooth

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.330 
the smart system returns for smooth
movements<00:01:42.869> across<00:01:43.020> random<00:01:43.500> terrain<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
movements across random terrain the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.380 
movements across random terrain the
whole<00:01:44.490> point<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.210> take<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
whole point of that is just to take the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.420 
whole point of that is just to take the
kind<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.750> effort<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> button<00:01:46.740> pushing

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
kind of effort and the button pushing

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.819 
kind of effort and the button pushing
out<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:48.810> not<00:01:48.960> an<00:01:49.079> autopilot<00:01:49.530> you

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
out of it you it's not an autopilot you

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:50.870 
out of it you it's not an autopilot you
don't<00:01:49.979> need<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.189> use<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.520> if<00:01:50.610> you're<00:01:50.700> all<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
don't need to use it if you're all the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.219 
don't need to use it if you're all the
time<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.210> with<00:01:51.329> jump<00:01:51.570> using<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.899> jump<00:01:52.110> button

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
time it with jump using the jump button

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.590 
time it with jump using the jump button
which<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.530> on<00:01:52.740> x<00:01:52.920> that's<00:01:53.280> absolutely<00:01:53.549> fine<00:01:53.970> but

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
which is on x that's absolutely fine but

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.850 
which is on x that's absolutely fine but
it<00:01:54.659> does<00:01:54.810> mean<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.020> if<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.320> just<00:01:55.380> think<00:01:55.530> i

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
it does mean is if you just think i

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.440 
it does mean is if you just think i
should<00:01:56.189> be<00:01:56.280> able<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.520> get<00:01:56.670> over<00:01:56.700> there<00:01:57.030> you

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
should be able to get over there you

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.030 
should be able to get over there you
hold<00:01:57.689> down<00:01:57.810> Sprint's<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.409> move<00:01:58.590> forwards<00:01:58.920> and

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
hold down Sprint's you move forwards and

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.560 
hold down Sprint's you move forwards and
you<00:01:59.219> will<00:01:59.340> make<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.700> time<00:02:00.000> you'll<00:02:00.240> made<00:02:00.420> that

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
you will make that time you'll made that

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.870 
you will make that time you'll made that
jump<00:02:00.810> you'll<00:02:00.960> make<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.290> bank<00:02:01.500> if<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.610> do

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
jump you'll make that bank if you do

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.310 
jump you'll make that bank if you do
that<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.119> crouch<00:02:03.299> you'll<00:02:03.540> slide<00:02:03.840> into<00:02:04.079> someone

looks down at the controller you've kind
of<00:02:16.140> failed<00:02:16.410> as<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.620> designer<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.220> what<00:02:17.550> we're

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
of failed as a designer and what we're

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.920 
of failed as a designer and what we're
seeing<00:02:17.850> is<00:02:18.030> people<00:02:18.090> going<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.420> go<00:02:18.510> how<00:02:18.780> does

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
you can even while you're doing this you

you can even while you're doing this you
know<00:02:24.210> you<00:02:24.330> just<00:02:24.450> think<00:02:24.660> oh<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.750> can<00:02:24.960> make<00:02:25.080> that

know you just think oh I can make that
joke<00:02:25.350> you<00:02:25.380> run<00:02:25.680> up<00:02:25.800> there<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.250> can<00:02:26.400> even<00:02:26.490> fire

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
joke you run up there you can even fire

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.310 
joke you run up there you can even fire
while<00:02:27.150> you're<00:02:27.300> making<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.720> jump<00:02:28.020> I<00:02:28.170> mean

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
while you're making that jump I mean

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.930 
while you're making that jump I mean
you've<00:02:28.530> taken<00:02:28.710> one<00:02:28.980> hand<00:02:29.190> off<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.370> weapon<00:02:29.820> so

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
you've taken one hand off the weapon so

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.520 
you've taken one hand off the weapon so
you're<00:02:30.060> not<00:02:30.120> going<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.360> be<00:02:30.420> as<00:02:30.510> accurate<00:02:30.630> but

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
you're not going to be as accurate but

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.020 
you're not going to be as accurate but
it's<00:02:31.650> all<00:02:31.770> about<00:02:31.950> freeing<00:02:32.310> players<00:02:32.700> up<00:02:32.880> to

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
it's all about freeing players up to

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
own routes through the map so it's not
