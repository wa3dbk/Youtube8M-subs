00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
know if this is always the trend but

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.300 
know if this is always the trend but
it's<00:01:24.780> been<00:01:24.930> my<00:01:25.080> experience<00:01:25.110> with<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.799> AHL

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
that when a team gets in trouble the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.289 
that when a team gets in trouble the
fight<00:01:28.110> start<00:01:28.470> immediately<00:01:29.400> will<00:01:29.939> act<00:01:30.150> in

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
fight start immediately will act in

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.539

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
taking on Gabriel Dumont does nothing no

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.010 
taking on Gabriel Dumont does nothing no
