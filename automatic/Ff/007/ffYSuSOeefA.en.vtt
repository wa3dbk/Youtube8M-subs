this gameplay I did it knife only so and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.090 
this gameplay I did it knife only so and
what<00:00:54.269> I<00:00:54.300> mean<00:00:54.480> by<00:00:54.540> that<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.440> didn't<00:00:56.070> use

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
what I mean by that is that I didn't use

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.250 
what I mean by that is that I didn't use
my<00:00:56.280> guns<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.030> didn't<00:00:57.210> get<00:00:57.300> any<00:00:57.450> gun<00:00:57.690> kills<00:00:58.020> all<00:00:58.230> I

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
my guns I didn't get any gun kills all I

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.990 
my guns I didn't get any gun kills all I
did<00:00:58.469> was<00:00:58.590> run<00:00:58.770> around<00:00:58.860> and<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.280> some<00:00:59.520> people<00:00:59.820> and

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
did was run around and I some people and

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.340 
did was run around and I some people and
I<00:01:00.270> think<00:01:00.450> that's<00:01:00.629> what<00:01:00.809> really<00:01:00.960> makes<00:01:01.200> this

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
I think that's what really makes this

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.650 
I think that's what really makes this
gameplay<00:01:01.590> fun<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.489> watch<00:01:02.610> it<00:01:02.850> because<00:01:03.120> there's

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
gameplay fun to watch it because there's

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.639 
gameplay fun to watch it because there's
nothing<00:01:03.780> better<00:01:04.080> than<00:01:04.170> running<00:01:04.500> around

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
nothing better than running around

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:06.050 
nothing better than running around
pretending<00:01:05.160> to<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.399> only<00:01:05.610> use<00:01:05.700> me<00:01:05.850> playing

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
stabbing some people because I think

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.499 
stabbing some people because I think

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
play again and I think it'd be um I

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.620 
play again and I think it'd be um I
think<00:04:24.770> it'd<00:04:25.040> be<00:04:25.160> quite<00:04:25.520> annoying<00:04:26.030> to<00:04:26.270> try<00:04:26.479> and

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
think it'd be quite annoying to try and

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.930 
think it'd be quite annoying to try and
go<00:04:26.750> for<00:04:26.990> this<00:04:27.080> gameplay<00:04:27.410> again<00:04:27.919> I<00:04:28.160> could<00:04:28.820> see

go for this gameplay again I could see

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.790 
go for this gameplay again I could see
myself<00:04:29.120> getting<00:04:29.479> quite<00:04:29.900> angry<00:04:30.350> and<00:04:30.590> agitated

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
myself getting quite angry and agitated

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.830 
myself getting quite angry and agitated
that<00:04:31.310> I<00:04:31.669> wouldn't<00:04:31.970> be<00:04:32.060> able<00:04:32.120> to<00:04:32.270> do<00:04:32.450> it<00:04:32.600> because

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
that I wouldn't be able to do it because

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.810 
that I wouldn't be able to do it because
these<00:04:32.990> guys<00:04:33.169> are<00:04:33.410> pretty<00:04:33.620> bad<00:04:33.710> players<00:04:34.190> and<00:04:34.550> it
