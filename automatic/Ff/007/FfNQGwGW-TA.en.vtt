00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:11.620
 we are in the hands of a new galaxy s5 the first thing 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.180
 strikingly, the main difference is 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.919
 new chance to interview more 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.060
 super amoled resolution remains the same 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:24.430
 full hd 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:26.560
 but on the eye the screen is very nice juicy and 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.420
 saturated but actually from 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:34.030
 previous galaxy s4 distinguish it 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:36.339
 quite difficult in quality here 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:41.829
 immediately see the updated interface more 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:43.539
 flat application icons as hell style 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.090
 allows you to measure the pulse 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.180
 for this on the back of the smartphone 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.149
 there is a special sensor 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.130
 Now we will try how it works 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.080
 start 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.560
 I will have a very big pulse now 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:03.060
 feel it no want to create 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.150
 try to get out 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.290
 and again 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.200
 pulse to us the instruction is applied 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.560
 finger 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.560
 corners 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.280
 were 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.880
 songs 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.440
 and wait a long time written written don't move and don't 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.040
 talk but I'm already on the handle with 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.040
 instruction 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.909
 we actually tried this one 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.570
 function will have to again 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.770
 mix close 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.770
 let the operator talk 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.360
 i shake 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.360
 fidelity tandem with landing 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.900
 she but the last time he showed me 113 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:07.060
 beats per second so don't even know 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:09.220
 what to say what else about the stuffing 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.170
 the smartphone is known not much is known that 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.819
 there is a quad processor which 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.060
 operates at a frequency of 2 and a half 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.130
 gigahertz most likely this snapdragon 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.430
 but no matter how officially this is 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.849
 statement another novelty is the camera 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.739
 the camera is now 16 megapixels and most importantly 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.790
 especially in that she is super fast 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.100
 hybrid autofocus 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.069
 that is, there is a defective benefit 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.569
 points and well here now she is enough 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.630
 quickly focuses when when we and 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:41.680
 started the first time it worked wrong 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.440
 quickly here and the usual contrast photos 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:51.720
 samsung promises that it all works for 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.720
 0 3 cents in 0.3 seconds 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.880
 you can basically this is face work 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.370
 fast enough you can shoot everything 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.459
 look and they turn out enough 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.459
 clear 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.350
 almost everything that i totally took out so 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.370
 what 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.170
 and sufficiently detailed camera 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.540
 works 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.930
 Yes, it seems that here in the button 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.900
 home embedded fingerprint scanner 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.319
 although at the presentation when we were shown 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.810
 video finger was drawn here not here 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.690
 so how does it work understand until 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.450
 no end possible 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.030
 the rest is touchwiz and let's still 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.620
 I'll tell you about the back cover 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.470
 The back cover is apparently the same 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.390
 the most soft touch and such special 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.820
 plastic will serve which we saw in 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.760
 galaxy laptop 3 and in some tablets 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.100
 new galaxy only here already around the edges 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.570
 not 20 lines which many scolded but 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.940
 appeared pretty enough 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:56.520
 perforation and this color is called 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.720
 electric blue in general looks spectacular 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:03.040
 miserable perhaps that does not continue on 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.140
 front panel it is black glossy and i 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:11.350
 I don't know if it will work out now or not 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:13.210
 basically fast enough enough 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.989
 prints are quickly collected on it 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.480
 our fingers 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.820
 here 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:27.960
 but I do not know how to see 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.960
 what else does a fingerprint scanner mean 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.860
 heart rate monitor smartphone also works with 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:42.480
 all new media and including 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:46.200
 r2 in r2 not a and up and galaxy gear fit 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.200
 be led from 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.800
 and that's all that is known at home sold 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.260
 samsung galaxy s5 in hand smartphone lies 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.950
 excellent off button near blue 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.230
 from the side right under your finger set foot on 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.820
 locks can be accessed quickly 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.700
 chamber among runs on anyway 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.450
 slow enough about the same outcome 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.450
 work faster 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.540
 mine we see you can read the news about 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.540
 olympiad 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.560
 traitors to the smartphone 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.650
 easy and convenient need to forget to tell you 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.650
 the most important case is now protected by 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.419
 ip67 standard we check we often 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.060
 we can't believe it so we will believe 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.910
 on the word although in our Zhigarev here 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.910
 the fairy tale goes to visibility 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.910
 signaling 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:43.110
 this is samsung galaxy s5 w3bsit3-dns.com
