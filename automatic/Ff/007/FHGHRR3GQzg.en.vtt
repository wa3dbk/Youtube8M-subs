00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.219
 I'm chrysler 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.570
 as you have read from the title boys I 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.129
 I'm a new commentator on this 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.800
 magnificent clan and of this magnificent 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.399
 channel before you introduce me how 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.730
 person 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.570
 my hobbies because there was the trait in the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.629
 clan 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.579
 I wanted to implement the game today 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.239
 guys on the channel we bring you a record 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.159
 world 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.019
 it is precisely the first 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:56.280
 comes to the world of empty class on vct 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.379
 why he didn't know what class means 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.769
 empty boys that means to start one 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.449
 started with a class the classics for 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.460
 create you with the echo the weapons is everything 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.340
 totally empty or with a knife from 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.340
 battle and without any specialty either 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.079
 nothing and just the first enemy with 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.689
 knife collects the weapon and continue 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.220
 your street that until when 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.960
 adds the thirty who for the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.270
 dna 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.899
 the boys gameplay has been realized 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.939
 on istinct and then a map that to me 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.409
 personally don't really like guys from 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.440
 let me write in the comments both at 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.240
 you like this kind of 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.880
 map but better an enthusiasm than 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.640
 much even if there are prizes and gifts 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.270
 great spots for snipers and how can 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.580
 be that vaffa center so a 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.130
 last thing before introducing me to me 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.400
 as a person wanted to marry rush italy 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.530
 boys 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.280
 as he told me to do freaks but how 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.130
 I wanted to do the boys too 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.900
 the rush italy are precisely one 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.220
 Italian section of an American clan if 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.710
 I don't think I wouldn't shoot one 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.680
 bullshit but it's okay not to eat themes 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.110
 in the comments the guys for the note 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.000
 they created the channel was a channel of 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.370
 700 members started from scratch 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.670
 so let's help kids grow up 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.910
 new and let him reach precisely in 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.650
 700 members and even more because they are 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.590
 deserve to really bring gameplay 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.630
 nice and then sign up you will find 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.880

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.150

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.150
 from the clan 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.620
 personally for my own reasons and I have not 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.450
 made for sure for members like 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.200
 many have insinuated that the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.970
 rais 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.739
 thousand subscribers more than us and therefore me 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.260
 I just wanted fame because sincerely 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.220
 guys to me to have fame on youtube 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.849
 I can't care where it is 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.340
 basically to explain briefly 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.069
 which was in the choices I had 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.900
 let go of the wing because I was tired 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.810
 kami head guys are creating 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.780
 really a mental stress and 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.019
 I already had problems in my house 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.459
 I couldn't stand it anymore 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:29.190
 sometimes I was also really very much 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.220
 nervous and we risk quarreling and or 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.349
 create unnecessary discussions file leaders 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.150
 as the simple society more in a 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.010
 afternoon with freaks I had made 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.829
 a useless discussion on one thing 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.360
 really stupid guys and I am 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.519
 I noticed too because I am anyway 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.030
 the honest person when i'm wrong 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.739
 something 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.540
 I notice it and I say it and I do 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.890
 my choice as it had been had been 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.550
 to go out and get me a channel of my own 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.770
 where I carried 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.080
 gameplay on all video games such as 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.990
 they could be outlast that mine opens 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.270
 not a fantastic game and I will enjoy a 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.120
 casino to play and play with you 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.280
 after live cam I will also bring videos 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.610
 in real life he says funny where 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.220
 I'm going to do social experiments and from 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.590
 people for example in the center of brescia a 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.290
 ask him what we guys are going to do south 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.910
 two laughs together and then sign up 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.500
 to my channel which I think flick only 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.180

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.740

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.590
