00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.709 
think that I'll enable it so we can
actually<00:02:54.560> buy<00:02:55.560> new<00:02:55.890> parts<00:02:56.129> or<00:02:56.640> additions<00:02:57.450> they

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.570 
and I think it's just down by the gate
the<00:03:17.660> main<00:03:17.840> gates<00:03:18.110> down<00:03:18.710> on<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.100> lower
