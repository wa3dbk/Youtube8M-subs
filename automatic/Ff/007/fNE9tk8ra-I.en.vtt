small videos regarding this little truck

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.890 
small videos regarding this little truck
it<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.980> again<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.870> Scania<00:00:10.460> six<00:00:11.460> by<00:00:11.910> four<00:00:11.969> so

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
it is a again a Scania six by four so

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.210 
it is a again a Scania six by four so
four<00:00:13.110> wheel<00:00:13.290> drive<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:15.440> let<00:00:16.440> me<00:00:16.560> first<00:00:16.740> starts

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
four wheel drive and let me first starts

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.269 
four wheel drive and let me first starts
by<00:00:17.730> showing<00:00:18.420> how<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.380> works<00:00:21.710> here<00:00:22.710> then<00:00:23.039> you

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
by showing how it works here then you

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.189 
by showing how it works here then you
can<00:00:23.400> see<00:00:24.050> so<00:00:25.050> it's<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:26.060> simple<00:00:27.060> truck<00:00:27.480> that

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
can see so it's a simple truck that

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.250 
can see so it's a simple truck that
simply<00:00:28.680> goes<00:00:29.039> back<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.369> forth<00:00:29.400> but<00:00:29.910> we<00:00:30.260> give

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
simply goes back and forth but we give

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.090 
simply goes back and forth but we give
it<00:00:31.380> worse<00:00:31.560> like<00:00:33.770> this

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
it worse like this

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.360 
it worse like this
the<00:00:35.610> Tarim<00:00:39.110> back<00:00:40.110> up<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.739> straight<00:00:41.250> back

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
the Tarim back up to the straight back

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.850 
the Tarim back up to the straight back
again<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:42.629> can<00:00:42.809> see<00:00:43.070> this<00:00:44.070> fence<00:00:44.520> it's<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.860> so

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
again you can see this fence it's on so

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.710 
again you can see this fence it's on so
it's<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.520> very<00:00:47.820> easy<00:00:47.879> system

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.170 

simply<00:00:53.470> works<00:00:53.710> by<00:00:54.310> having<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:54.820> trailer

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
simply works by having the trailer

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:03.049 
simply works by having the trailer
disengaged<00:00:55.690> so<00:00:57.930> again<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:01.120> always<00:01:01.300> free<00:01:01.650> so

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
disengaged so again it's always free so

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.030 
disengaged so again it's always free so
in<00:01:04.059> this<00:01:04.210> first<00:01:04.870> video<00:01:05.110> I'm<00:01:05.470> going<00:01:05.680> to<00:01:05.800> talk

going to present their trailer under the

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.290 
going to present their trailer under the

third video will be about the helicopter
hands<00:01:16.540> up<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.910> this<00:01:18.910> video<00:01:19.620> the<00:01:20.620> truck<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:23.110> is

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
hands up so this video the truck this is

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.490 
hands up so this video the truck this is
a<00:01:23.710> Scania<00:01:24.160> a<00:01:24.430> series<00:01:24.790> just<00:01:25.390> like<00:01:25.479> which<00:01:26.320> you

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
a Scania a series just like which you

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.340 
a Scania a series just like which you
are<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.830> truck<00:01:27.100> presentations<00:01:28.090> but<00:01:28.960> this<00:01:29.140> one

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
are the truck presentations but this one

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.030 
are the truck presentations but this one
is<00:01:29.590> a<00:01:30.510> I've<00:01:31.510> had<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.840> focus<00:01:32.170> on<00:01:32.350> making<00:01:32.590> it<00:01:32.860> as

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
is a I've had to focus on making it as

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.790 
is a I've had to focus on making it as
durable<00:01:33.700> as<00:01:33.760> possible<00:01:34.450> so<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:35.830> Front's<00:01:36.250> is<00:01:36.910> a

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
durable as possible so the Front's is a

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.249 
durable as possible so the Front's is a
bit<00:01:38.800> stronger<00:01:39.250> than<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.430> other<00:01:39.640> trucks<00:01:39.970> so<00:01:40.300> it

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
bit stronger than the other trucks so it

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.170 
bit stronger than the other trucks so it
can<00:01:41.470> take<00:01:41.650> some<00:01:42.720> some<00:01:43.720> abuse<00:01:44.110> and<00:01:45.180> details

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
can take some some abuse and details

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.560 
can take some some abuse and details
like<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:47.100> mirrors<00:01:48.100> on<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.400> sides<00:01:48.670> pretty

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
like the mirrors on the sides pretty

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.910 
like the mirrors on the sides pretty
sturdy<00:01:49.840> you<00:01:49.990> can<00:01:50.140> actually<00:01:50.259> use<00:01:50.590> them<00:01:50.710> to<00:01:50.890> open

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
sturdy you can actually use them to open

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.600 
sturdy you can actually use them to open
the<00:01:51.280> doors<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.720> that<00:01:52.750> you<00:01:53.020> have<00:01:53.170> your<00:01:53.610> normal

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
the doors so that you have your normal

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.350 
the doors so that you have your normal
interior<00:01:55.210> in<00:01:55.270> sight<00:01:56.400> and<00:01:57.400> you<00:01:57.820> can<00:01:57.970> see<00:01:58.120> there

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
interior in sight and you can see there

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.420 
interior in sight and you can see there
are<00:01:58.450> interviewing<00:01:59.020> is<00:01:59.170> not<00:01:59.470> tilted<00:02:00.010> like<00:02:00.220> the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
are interviewing is not tilted like the

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.110 
are interviewing is not tilted like the
other<00:02:00.580> trucks<00:02:00.970> because<00:02:01.620> not<00:02:02.620> tilting<00:02:02.980> it

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
other trucks because not tilting it

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.850 
other trucks because not tilting it
makes<00:02:04.120> it<00:02:04.240> more<00:02:04.560> durable<00:02:05.560> again<00:02:06.250> so<00:02:07.530> he<00:02:08.530> on<00:02:08.619> top

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
makes it more durable again so he on top

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.190 
makes it more durable again so he on top
you<00:02:08.979> have<00:02:09.010> some<00:02:09.429> parts<00:02:09.700> of<00:02:09.729> its<00:02:09.880> are<00:02:10.200> very

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.199 
you have some parts of its are very
douche<00:02:11.530> compared<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.550> rest<00:02:12.700> of<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:13.030> truck

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
we have some simple connections making

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.830 
we have some simple connections making
this<00:02:16.019> didn't<00:02:17.019> pass<00:02:17.170> here<00:02:18.060> stay<00:02:19.060> on<00:02:19.180> top<00:02:19.420> but

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
toys and in the back we have a battery

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.800 
toys and in the back we have a battery
box<00:02:29.769> which<00:02:30.010> is<00:02:30.160> really<00:02:30.640> easy<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:31.299> replace

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
box which is really easy to replace

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.000 
box which is really easy to replace
because<00:02:32.799> you<00:02:33.160> can<00:02:33.310> just<00:02:34.560> tip<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:35.650> off<00:02:35.799> like

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
because you can just tip it off like

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.780 
because you can just tip it off like
this<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:37.830> change<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.950> batteries<00:02:39.100> so<00:02:41.790> it's

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
this and change the batteries so it's

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.570 
this and change the batteries so it's
drilled<00:02:43.120> by<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.600> L<00:02:43.840> motor<00:02:44.080> right<00:02:44.650> here<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:45.400> as

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
drilled by and L motor right here and as

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.190 
drilled by and L motor right here and as
you<00:02:45.670> can<00:02:45.760> see<00:02:45.820> you<00:02:46.000> have<00:02:46.090> plenty<00:02:46.540> of<00:02:46.750> space<00:02:46.989> so

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
you can see you have plenty of space so

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.840 
you can see you have plenty of space so
that<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.380> can<00:02:47.620> use<00:02:47.769> an<00:02:47.950> excel<00:02:48.310> note<00:02:48.459> instead

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
that you can use an excel note instead

the<00:02:49.780> excel<00:02:50.080> motion<00:02:50.350> would<00:02:50.440> give<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:50.739> more

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
the excel motion would give you more

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.990 
the excel motion would give you more

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
wear the batteries out so in the back I

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.199

this is this trailer this needs to be in
a<00:03:28.950> certain<00:03:29.130> position<00:03:29.370> first<00:03:29.880> like<00:03:30.360> this<00:03:30.860> but

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
a certain position first like this but

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.740 
a certain position first like this but
I'll<00:03:32.430> get<00:03:32.640> back<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:33.060> trailer<00:03:33.300> in<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.540> next

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
I'll get back to the trailer in the next

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.190 
I'll get back to the trailer in the next
video<00:03:34.050> in<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.069> back<00:03:35.220> we<00:03:35.370> have<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.760> bumper<00:03:36.720> here

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
video in the back we have a bumper here

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.949 
video in the back we have a bumper here
let's<00:03:37.830> make<00:03:38.070> sure<00:03:38.130> that<00:03:38.489> it<00:03:39.480> takes<00:03:39.690> a<00:03:39.810> little

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
let's make sure that it takes a little

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.229 
let's make sure that it takes a little
bit<00:03:40.080> longer<00:03:40.500> for<00:03:40.860> these<00:03:41.310> parts<00:03:41.700> here<00:03:41.880> to<00:03:42.030> fall

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
bit longer for these parts here to fall

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:50.770 
bit longer for these parts here to fall
off<00:03:42.800> so<00:03:44.269> yes

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.960 

trick<00:03:51.780> for<00:03:51.930> has<00:03:52.080> two<00:03:52.290> hands<00:03:52.650> so<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:56.700> steering

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
trick for has two hands so the steering

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.590 
trick for has two hands so the steering
is<00:03:57.300> again<00:03:57.780> with<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:58.400> servo<00:03:59.400> motor<00:03:59.519> and<00:04:00.120> with

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
is again with a servo motor and with

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.060 
is again with a servo motor and with
Ackermann<00:04:01.110> steering<00:04:01.140> geometry<00:04:03.560> so<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:04.950> can

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
Ackermann steering geometry so you can

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.140 
Ackermann steering geometry so you can
see<00:04:05.190> here<00:04:05.400> turns<00:04:06.209> like<00:04:06.420> this<00:04:06.600> and<00:04:07.880> the<00:04:08.880> reason

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
see here turns like this and the reason

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.729 
see here turns like this and the reason
I'm<00:04:09.239> using<00:04:09.269> this<00:04:09.780> system<00:04:10.019> is<00:04:10.350> not<00:04:10.709> only

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
I'm using this system is not only

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.710 
I'm using this system is not only
because<00:04:11.220> it's<00:04:11.400> more<00:04:11.640> accurate<00:04:12.000> but<00:04:12.540> also

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
because it's more accurate but also

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.860 
because it's more accurate but also
because<00:04:13.110> it's<00:04:13.350> quite<00:04:13.709> easy<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:14.220> build<00:04:14.880> it

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
because it's quite easy to build it

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.349 
because it's quite easy to build it
requires<00:04:16.290> no<00:04:16.560> gears<00:04:16.950> it's<00:04:17.190> just<00:04:17.519> some<00:04:17.850> lift

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
requires no gears it's just some lift

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:24.860 
requires no gears it's just some lift
arms<00:04:18.630> pulling<00:04:19.910> hence<00:04:22.550> then<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:24.450> can<00:04:24.570> see<00:04:24.690> the

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
arms pulling hence then you can see the

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.830 
arms pulling hence then you can see the
color<00:04:25.080> scheme<00:04:25.350> is<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:26.250> same<00:04:26.850> as<00:04:27.300> with<00:04:27.810> the

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
color scheme is the same as with the

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.380 
color scheme is the same as with the
classic<00:04:28.380> legged<00:04:28.770> model<00:04:28.950> team<00:04:29.250> six<00:04:29.550> five<00:04:30.030> five

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
classic legged model team six five five

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.540 
classic legged model team six five five
nine<00:04:30.419> zero<00:04:31.880> so<00:04:33.500> this<00:04:34.500> is<00:04:34.560> also<00:04:34.890> the<00:04:35.040> design

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
nine zero so this is also the design

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.390 
nine zero so this is also the design
that's<00:04:35.880> and<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:37.080> colors<00:04:37.470> that<00:04:37.800> I'm<00:04:37.979> using<00:04:38.010> for

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
that's and the colors that I'm using for

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.219 
that's and the colors that I'm using for
the<00:04:38.820> building<00:04:39.120> instructions<00:04:39.690> for<00:04:39.840> this<00:04:39.960> truck

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
the building instructions for this truck

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.020 
the building instructions for this truck
it's<00:04:40.500> up<00:04:40.830> on<00:04:40.919> my<00:04:40.979> website<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.640> you<00:04:41.729> can<00:04:41.850> see

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
description and I even used this part

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.800 
description and I even used this part
here<00:04:47.520> from<00:04:47.760> the<00:04:47.940> original<00:04:48.450> truck<00:04:49.940> so<00:04:50.940> as<00:04:51.660> you

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
here from the original truck so as you

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.980 
here from the original truck so as you
can<00:04:51.900> see<00:04:52.110> it's<00:04:52.669> looks<00:04:53.669> just<00:04:53.940> like<00:04:54.180> a<00:04:54.510> normal

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
can see it's looks just like a normal

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.150 
can see it's looks just like a normal
Scania<00:04:55.830> as<00:04:56.460> yours<00:04:57.140> again<00:04:58.140> I've<00:04:58.289> been<00:04:58.320> cheating

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
Scania as yours again I've been cheating

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.360 
Scania as yours again I've been cheating
using<00:04:59.520> these<00:04:59.760> parts<00:05:00.360> which<00:05:00.570> are<00:05:01.190> getting<00:05:02.190> out

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
using these parts which are getting out

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.550 
using these parts which are getting out
on<00:05:02.520> the<00:05:02.640> market<00:05:02.970> now<00:05:03.150> but<00:05:03.390> I<00:05:03.660> cut<00:05:04.200> some<00:05:04.350> parts

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
on the market now but I cut some parts

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.110 
on the market now but I cut some parts
in<00:05:04.770> order<00:05:04.890> to<00:05:05.100> make<00:05:05.280> them<00:05:06.200> but<00:05:07.760> they<00:05:08.760> have<00:05:08.940> been

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
in order to make them but they have been

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.770 
in order to make them but they have been
released<00:05:09.419> now<00:05:09.720> in<00:05:10.190> some<00:05:11.190> colors<00:05:11.520> I've<00:05:12.479> seen

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
released now in some colors I've seen

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.630 
released now in some colors I've seen
the<00:05:13.050> black<00:05:13.200> one<00:05:13.530> quickly<00:05:13.830> so<00:05:14.160> I'm<00:05:14.220> sure<00:05:14.550> it

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
the black one quickly so I'm sure it

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.480 
the black one quickly so I'm sure it
will<00:05:14.820> be<00:05:15.270> out<00:05:15.390> in<00:05:15.419> their<00:05:16.099> sets
