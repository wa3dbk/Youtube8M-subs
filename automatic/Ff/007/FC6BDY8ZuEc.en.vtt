00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:06.719 
right now we're actually using a

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:09.109 
right now we're actually using a
Microsoft<00:01:07.229> mapping<00:01:08.159> program<00:01:08.700> here<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:08.999> can

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
Microsoft mapping program here you can

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.510 
Microsoft mapping program here you can
see<00:01:09.359> I<00:01:10.109> can<00:01:10.319> actually<00:01:10.560> use<00:01:10.799> my<00:01:10.950> two<00:01:11.009> fingers<00:01:11.399> to

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
see I can actually use my two fingers to

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.789 
see I can actually use my two fingers to
zoom<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:12.149> and<00:01:12.479> check<00:01:13.020> out<00:01:13.139> all<00:01:13.200> sorts<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.740> stuff

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
zoom in and check out all sorts of stuff

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.800 
zoom in and check out all sorts of stuff
and<00:01:14.189> they've<00:01:14.369> got<00:01:14.520> other<00:01:14.639> applications<00:01:15.359> that

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
and they've got other applications that

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.480 
and they've got other applications that
allow<00:01:15.899> you<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.170> do<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.409> as<00:01:16.740> well<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.460> can

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
allow you to do that as well so you can

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.709 
allow you to do that as well so you can
use<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.939> mouse<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.270> does<00:01:18.389> come<00:01:18.569> with<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
use the mouse it does come with the

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:20.209 
use the mouse it does come with the
wireless<00:01:18.959> keyboard<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.439> mouse<00:01:19.560> combination
