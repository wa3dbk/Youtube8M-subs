but we can all in the room be suddenly

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.200 
but we can all in the room be suddenly

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
be thinking about the same thing and and

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.539 
be thinking about the same thing and and
having<00:01:31.820> that<00:01:31.939> kind<00:01:32.149> of<00:01:32.210> shared<00:01:33.399> belief<00:01:34.399> in

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
having that kind of shared belief in

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.160 
having that kind of shared belief in
something<00:01:34.759> is<00:01:34.999> kind<00:01:35.359> of<00:01:35.450> essential<00:01:35.960> for

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
something is kind of essential for

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.410 
something is kind of essential for
comedy<00:01:36.499> some<00:01:37.460> of<00:01:37.549> the<00:01:37.609> areas<00:01:37.880> it<00:01:37.999> gets<00:01:38.179> into

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
comedy some of the areas it gets into

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.480 
comedy some of the areas it gets into
our<00:01:38.450> and<00:01:38.810> I<00:01:38.899> think<00:01:39.109> Digital<00:01:39.859> Spy<00:01:40.070> is<00:01:40.100> a<00:01:40.249> good

our and I think Digital Spy is a good

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.389 
our and I think Digital Spy is a good

six months ago and it's over ten years
ago<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:51.940> I<00:03:52.900> have<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.410> distance<00:03:53.739> on<00:03:53.890> it<00:03:54.040> that

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
ago and I have the distance on it that

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.410 
ago and I have the distance on it that
you<00:03:54.430> would<00:03:54.580> expect<00:03:54.880> of<00:03:55.090> something<00:03:55.330> that

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
you would expect of something that

happened 10 years ago in your own life
but<00:03:57.670> I<00:03:57.730> guess<00:03:58.000> there's<00:03:58.180> always<00:03:58.299> someone<00:03:58.660> who

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
but I guess there's always someone who

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.380 
but I guess there's always someone who
read<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.110> book<00:03:59.310> three<00:04:00.310> months<00:04:00.549> ago<00:04:00.760> and<00:04:01.030> for

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
read the book three months ago and for

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.570 
read the book three months ago and for
them<00:04:01.540> it<00:04:01.720> feels<00:04:01.989> very<00:04:02.140> current<00:04:02.739> so<00:04:03.280> I<00:04:03.310> get

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
them it feels very current so I get

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.550 
them it feels very current so I get
people<00:04:03.760> being<00:04:04.060> very<00:04:04.150> surprised<00:04:04.720> when<00:04:05.080> I<00:04:05.140> don't

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560
