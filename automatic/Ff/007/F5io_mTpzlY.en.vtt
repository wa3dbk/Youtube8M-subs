projects coming up next year I have a
past<00:00:44.430> history<00:00:44.520> as<00:00:44.820> an<00:00:44.940> at<00:00:45.059> natural<00:00:45.870> national

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
level bodybuilder and so I thought this

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.619 
level bodybuilder and so I thought this
might<00:00:49.830> be<00:00:49.890> able<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.430> relate<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.210> few<00:00:51.480> people

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
might be able to relate to a few people

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.560 
might be able to relate to a few people
expect<00:00:52.530> especially<00:00:52.739> athletes<00:00:53.570> professional

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
expect especially athletes professional

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.570 
expect especially athletes professional

finally recovery phase with your
standard<00:01:11.370> training<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.540> my<00:01:12.690> case<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:13.590> can

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
standard training so in my case you can

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.180 
standard training so in my case you can
see<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.420> healthy<00:01:15.420> bicep<00:01:15.900> or<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.680> fairly<00:01:17.040> healthy

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
see a healthy bicep or a fairly healthy

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.420 
see a healthy bicep or a fairly healthy
one<00:01:17.490> anyway<00:01:17.760> should<00:01:18.240> look<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.510> bit<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:18.780> that

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
one anyway should look a bit like that

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.820 
one anyway should look a bit like that
after<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.460> rupture<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.420> bicep<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.440> distal

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
after you rupture a bicep and a distal

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.399 
after you rupture a bicep and a distal
rupture<00:01:23.190> which<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.490> around<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.060> elbow<00:01:24.510> you'll

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
rupture which is around the elbow you'll

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.349 
rupture which is around the elbow you'll
end<00:01:25.560> up<00:01:25.710> with<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.039> bicep<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.759> looks<00:01:27.090> something

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
end up with a bicep that looks something

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:30.020 
end up with a bicep that looks something
like<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.899> and<00:01:28.189> if<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.460> see<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.759> there

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
like that and if you can see it there

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.109 
like that and if you can see it there
this<00:01:31.020> bicep<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.770> now<00:01:31.950> shortened<00:01:32.490> by<00:01:32.670> about<00:01:32.939> 2

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
this bicep is now shortened by about 2

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.249 
this bicep is now shortened by about 2
or<00:01:33.149> 3<00:01:33.299> inches<00:01:33.810> from<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.619> elbow<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.340> should<00:01:35.640> be

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
or 3 inches from the elbow it should be

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.719 
or 3 inches from the elbow it should be
more<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.619> one<00:01:37.829> which<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> much

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
more like this one which is a much

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.319 
more like this one which is a much
tighter<00:01:39.140> or<00:01:40.140> closer<00:01:40.770> fit<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.490> elbow<00:01:42.179> joint

tighter or closer fit to the elbow joint
in<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.140> case<00:01:43.409> there's<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.310> lot<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.549> bruising

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
in this case there's a lot of bruising

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.209 
in this case there's a lot of bruising
around<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.270> forearm<00:01:45.780> because<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.890> where<00:01:47.070> the

bicep is pulled back into a nice tight
little<00:01:58.259> ball<00:01:58.499> there<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.770> it's<00:01:59.369> rather

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
little ball there and it's rather

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.679 
little ball there and it's rather
useless<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.420> terms<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:01.130> strength<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.689> lifting

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.550 
bicep what I'm told that impedes is my
my<00:02:11.250> lifting<00:02:11.730> power<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.300> if<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.540> try<00:02:12.600> and<00:02:12.840> pull<00:02:13.230> a

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
my lifting power so if I try and pull a

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.850 
my lifting power so if I try and pull a
heavy<00:02:13.950> weight<00:02:14.220> up<00:02:14.550> toward<00:02:15.060> me<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.440> larger

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
heavy weight up toward me the the larger

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.350 
heavy weight up toward me the the larger
force<00:02:17.069> of<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.280> bicep<00:02:17.670> will<00:02:17.790> engage<00:02:18.120> and

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
force of the bicep will engage and

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.870 
force of the bicep will engage and
that'll<00:02:18.540> be<00:02:18.630> very<00:02:18.840> difficult<00:02:19.670> until<00:02:20.670> the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
that'll be very difficult until the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.670 
that'll be very difficult until the
outer<00:02:21.030> head<00:02:21.330> strengthens<00:02:22.170> more<00:02:22.380> but<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.620> will

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
outer head strengthens more but it will

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.230 
outer head strengthens more but it will
never<00:02:22.950> strengthen<00:02:23.580> as<00:02:23.640> much<00:02:23.850> as<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.120> inner

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
never strengthen as much as the inner

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.990 
never strengthen as much as the inner
head<00:02:25.010> then<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.130> other<00:02:26.280> thing<00:02:26.550> is<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:26.880> that

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
head then the other thing is is that

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.610 
head then the other thing is is that
when<00:02:27.120> you're<00:02:27.210> trying<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.510> do<00:02:27.780> movements<00:02:28.440> where

when you're trying to do movements where

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.619 
when you're trying to do movements where
you're<00:02:28.980> trying<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.519> screw<00:02:30.000> in<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.239> screw<00:02:30.269> driver

you're trying to screw in a screw driver

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.000 
you're trying to screw in a screw driver
let's<00:02:31.019> say<00:02:31.230> or<00:02:32.159> any<00:02:32.340> movement

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
let's say or any movement

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.250 
let's say or any movement
is<00:02:33.069> a<00:02:33.129> twisting<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:34.299> arms<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.080> this

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
is a twisting of the the arms and this

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.729 
is a twisting of the the arms and this
that<00:02:36.129> inner<00:02:36.610> bicep<00:02:37.150> head<00:02:37.360> engages<00:02:37.959> and<00:02:38.170> where

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
that inner bicep head engages and where

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.429 
that inner bicep head engages and where
mine<00:02:38.950> is<00:02:39.280> now<00:02:39.849> ruptured<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.599> becomes<00:02:41.349> a<00:02:41.409> very

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439 
mine is now ruptured that becomes a very

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.740 
mine is now ruptured that becomes a very
difficult<00:02:41.829> movement<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.430> perform<00:02:42.849> and<00:02:43.659> you

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
difficult movement to perform and you

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.059 
difficult movement to perform and you
know<00:02:43.870> there's<00:02:44.049> some<00:02:44.170> market<00:02:44.620> difference

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
know there's some market difference

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.679 
know there's some market difference
apparently<00:02:45.730> in<00:02:45.849> your<00:02:46.000> power<00:02:46.209> when<00:02:46.510> you're

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:46.689 
apparently in your power when you're

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.229 
apparently in your power when you're
doing<00:02:46.959> that<00:02:47.110> kind<00:02:47.290> of<00:02:47.319> a<00:02:47.439> turning<00:02:47.860> movement<00:02:48.239> so

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
doing that kind of a turning movement so

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.569 
doing that kind of a turning movement so
when<00:02:50.019> it<00:02:50.110> comes<00:02:50.319> to<00:02:50.440> people<00:02:50.709> in<00:02:50.799> their<00:02:50.920> 60s<00:02:51.400> and

when it comes to people in their 60s and
70s<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:52.090> lot<00:02:52.150> of<00:02:52.360> times<00:02:52.540> they<00:02:52.690> say<00:02:52.900> don't<00:02:53.170> bother

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
70s a lot of times they say don't bother

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.910 
70s a lot of times they say don't bother
with<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.799> surgery<00:02:54.280> as<00:02:54.459> long<00:02:54.790> as<00:02:54.940> they<00:02:55.060> can<00:02:55.920> get

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
with the surgery as long as they can get

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.710 
with the surgery as long as they can get
basic<00:02:57.370> daily<00:02:57.549> functions<00:02:58.150> out<00:02:58.360> of<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:58.599> you<00:02:58.690> can

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
basic daily functions out of it you can

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.089 
basic daily functions out of it you can
still<00:02:59.049> you<00:02:59.260> know<00:02:59.290> pick<00:02:59.560> up<00:02:59.680> your<00:02:59.799> cup<00:02:59.950> of

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
still you know pick up your cup of

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.589 
still you know pick up your cup of
coffee<00:03:00.310> you<00:03:00.549> drive<00:03:00.760> your<00:03:00.909> car<00:03:00.970> things<00:03:01.450> like

coffee you drive your car things like

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.759 
coffee you drive your car things like
that<00:03:01.750> is<00:03:01.870> fine<00:03:02.140> but<00:03:03.040> if<00:03:03.310> you<00:03:03.459> have<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:04.120> lot<00:03:04.450> of

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
that is fine but if you have a lot of

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.229 
that is fine but if you have a lot of
intense<00:03:05.769> activity<00:03:06.040> especially<00:03:06.640> power

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
intense activity especially power

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.300 
intense activity especially power
powerful<00:03:07.810> activity<00:03:08.230> where<00:03:08.650> you're<00:03:08.859> you're

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
powerful activity where you're you're

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.460 
powerful activity where you're you're
doing<00:03:09.549> the<00:03:09.670> athletic<00:03:10.060> event<00:03:10.420> or<00:03:10.840> you're

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
doing the athletic event or you're

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.649 
doing the athletic event or you're
needing<00:03:12.370> 100<00:03:12.849> percent<00:03:13.120> of<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.239> strength<00:03:13.450> in

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
needing 100 percent of the strength in

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.440 
needing 100 percent of the strength in
that<00:03:13.780> arm<00:03:13.959> then<00:03:14.549> your<00:03:15.549> only<00:03:15.790> option<00:03:16.120> really<00:03:16.239> is

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
that arm then your only option really is

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.379 
that arm then your only option really is
to<00:03:16.569> get<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:17.230> bicep<00:03:17.590> reattached

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
to get the the bicep reattached

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.129 
to get the the bicep reattached
surgically<00:03:19.389> which<00:03:19.629> is<00:03:19.780> what<00:03:19.900> I'm<00:03:19.989> going<00:03:20.109> to

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
surgically which is what I'm going to

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.420 
surgically which is what I'm going to
have<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.349> do<00:03:20.470> tomorrow<00:03:20.889> I'm<00:03:21.040> going<00:03:21.129> to<00:03:21.190> have<00:03:21.250> to

have to do tomorrow I'm going to have to

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.160 
have to do tomorrow I'm going to have to
go<00:03:21.579> in<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.060> they're<00:03:22.569> going<00:03:22.659> to<00:03:22.750> go<00:03:22.840> through<00:03:23.109> a

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
go in and they're going to go through a

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.500 
go in and they're going to go through a
process<00:03:23.379> of<00:03:23.859> opening<00:03:24.459> up<00:03:24.639> grabbing<00:03:25.269> the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
process of opening up grabbing the

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.270 
process of opening up grabbing the
tendon<00:03:25.870> pulling<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.319> back<00:03:26.470> down<00:03:26.739> drilling

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
tendon pulling it back down drilling

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.849 
tendon pulling it back down drilling
holes<00:03:27.519> in<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.790> bone<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:28.470> Reese<00:03:29.470> teaching

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
holes in the bone and Reese teaching

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.890 
holes in the bone and Reese teaching
that<00:03:30.010> tenon<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.819> the<00:03:31.000> bone<00:03:31.180> and<00:03:31.389> that<00:03:31.480> has<00:03:31.720> to

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
that tenon to the bone and that has to

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.629 
that tenon to the bone and that has to
happen<00:03:32.079> within<00:03:32.379> three<00:03:32.769> weeks<00:03:32.920> of<00:03:33.159> the<00:03:33.250> injury

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
happen within three weeks of the injury

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.759 
happen within three weeks of the injury
so<00:03:34.180> luckily<00:03:34.480> for<00:03:34.810> me<00:03:34.870> they're<00:03:35.290> getting<00:03:35.530> me<00:03:35.620> in

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
so luckily for me they're getting me in

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.770 
so luckily for me they're getting me in
there<00:03:36.010> about<00:03:36.639> two<00:03:36.819> and<00:03:36.849> a<00:03:36.970> half<00:03:37.150> weeks<00:03:37.449> from

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
there about two and a half weeks from

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.800 
there about two and a half weeks from
the<00:03:38.079> actual<00:03:38.739> injury<00:03:39.010> itself<00:03:39.340> so<00:03:40.329> it<00:03:40.419> will<00:03:40.510> fuse

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
the actual injury itself so it will fuse

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.330 
the actual injury itself so it will fuse
properly<00:03:41.290> and<00:03:41.410> all<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.530> nerve<00:03:41.769> endings<00:03:42.160> will

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
properly and all the nerve endings will

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.699 
properly and all the nerve endings will
bind<00:03:43.030> in<00:03:43.239> there<00:03:43.419> as<00:03:43.569> they<00:03:43.930> should<00:03:43.989> so<00:03:44.290> I<00:03:44.530> can

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
bind in there as they should so I can

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.979 
bind in there as they should so I can
get<00:03:44.889> as<00:03:45.040> close<00:03:45.310> to<00:03:45.489> 100%<00:03:45.940> function<00:03:46.599> back<00:03:46.780> in

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
get as close to 100% function back in

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.460 
get as close to 100% function back in
that<00:03:47.109> arm<00:03:47.290> again<00:03:47.739> when<00:03:47.889> it's<00:03:48.010> all<00:03:48.190> complete

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.780 

there's<00:03:51.740> three<00:03:51.980> things<00:03:52.010> that<00:03:52.340> I<00:03:52.490> can<00:03:52.640> see

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
there's three things that I can see

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.310 
there's three things that I can see
there's<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.120> effect<00:03:53.390> of<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:53.570> surgery<00:03:53.960> itself

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
there's the effect of the surgery itself

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.710 
there's the effect of the surgery itself
how<00:03:54.680> you<00:03:54.740> actually<00:03:55.570> accelerate<00:03:56.570> the<00:03:56.690> healing

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
how you actually accelerate the healing

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.540 
how you actually accelerate the healing
process<00:03:57.650> because<00:03:57.980> I'm<00:03:58.070> going<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:58.280> be<00:03:58.370> in<00:03:58.490> a

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
process because I'm going to be in a

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.960 
process because I'm going to be in a
cast

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
cast

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.120 
cast
apparently<00:03:59.480> so<00:03:59.960> I'm<00:04:00.110> told<00:04:00.350> for<00:04:00.650> what<00:04:00.770> six<00:04:00.980> to

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
apparently so I'm told for what six to

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.410 
apparently so I'm told for what six to
eight<00:04:01.250> weeks<00:04:01.550> won't<00:04:01.790> be<00:04:01.910> able<00:04:02.000> to<00:04:02.120> move<00:04:02.240> that

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
eight weeks won't be able to move that

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.320 
eight weeks won't be able to move that
elbow<00:04:02.720> at<00:04:02.840> all<00:04:02.960> while<00:04:03.800> that<00:04:04.070> tendon<00:04:04.550> refuses

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
elbow at all while that tendon refuses

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.230 
elbow at all while that tendon refuses

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
to the bone and tendon refusing is much

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.750 
to the bone and tendon refusing is much
different<00:04:08.630> from<00:04:08.660> muscle<00:04:09.230> healing<00:04:09.620> it's<00:04:09.830> it's

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
different from muscle healing it's it's

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.240 
different from muscle healing it's it's
not<00:04:10.970> quite<00:04:11.030> as<00:04:11.420> forgiving<00:04:11.930> as<00:04:12.050> muscle<00:04:12.470> is<00:04:12.620> so

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
not quite as forgiving as muscle is so

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.400 
not quite as forgiving as muscle is so

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
that the tendon can help more rapidly

can do to help that process along

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.550 
can do to help that process along
somewhat<00:04:32.000> the<00:04:32.270> psychological<00:04:33.080> element<00:04:33.440> of

somewhat the psychological element of
