00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.590
 Hello 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:17.480
 Today is the other day I make two pine 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:21.080
 But I was let me introduce coaster and Sumahokesu 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:27.240
 Comment that we want to knit by size difference 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:32.790
 Since I received quite a lot towards the comments and blog who comments on videos 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:36.720
 I think that I want to explain it or explain it for a moment 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:41.220
 First, it is here coaster this 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.160
 Since Irassha' is anyone who wants to see a bigger mat 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.920
 this 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.920
 I would like to explain the woman's law 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:53.360
 Where to make a pine weave coaster 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:58.820
 The number of hit chains at span first 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.820
 We are woven in 19 people bet that if say whether the idea in the wind 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.880
 This 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:12.530
 Multiple of 6 +1 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:15.830
 It started thinking and knitting at 19 in 818 6318 + 1 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.880
 a 6's Bath Plus 1 so Loxy 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.780
 It is good with 204 + 1-25 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.470
 For example, 6 schools 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.470
 Contact 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:34.860
 It is rock 6 bridge 18 You may have 49 people make in 6818 + city 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.120
 Extreme story 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.360
 6 by 100 at 600 + 1 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.320
 May I make it with 601 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.320
 Anyway here 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.270
 In numbers that fit 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.930
 After Saddle House 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:58.320
 Order from the making eyes 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:01.590
 You can extend or shrink the cat to the length you want, so the length of the work you want to make 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:06.720
 Please try to fit together and press 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:09.750
 Of course, it is I the rise of for this to make th 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.380
 1 piece of crochet 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:17.020
 It is good to weave 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:21.050
 It is a little caution that you will not forget to knit a fine knit 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:24.020
 If you do not add the rising chain 1 here 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.830
 The number of women is going crazy 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.270
 A little bit the last bag won't fit again 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.340
 But 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.340
 Please try to attention only to 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:42.430
 And then it's my next smartie This is a bit like my cell phone doesn't fit 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.870
 Because some people said that 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:53.330
 Maybe I think there are many who want to increase a little 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:54.310
 I think this is the first time I finished making knitting 11 times 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:01.970
 Have 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:07.330
 If you want to make it a little bigger , try changing this formula from 11th to 14th 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:09.569
 If you say more , 17 eyes with + three girls 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:17.350
 Following 20 eyes 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:20.500
 The numbers next was raised went plus London 3 to 11 doing this with the feeling that 23 people 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:24.450
 I already wrote it 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.450
 The first crochet 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.940
 I will increase this number 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.940
 When 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:38.670
 As we grow a little bit by little 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:41.920
 The I 14 th pattern is Chinami 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:46.500
 I'm just a little Anne 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:53.000
 It feels like the first of this oval 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.000
 The same thing as the 14th draft 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:01.250
 Unexpectedly, it only changed a little, but it looks like this 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.250
 It became slightly longer 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.760
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.760
 If you increase by 3 people 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:19.810
 Because it gets longer 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.810
 I think that I want you to try making this table a little 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:28.700
 Mailer 14 If you didn't enter at all until you just increased the little girl a little 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.870
 It may not be 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.600
 17 eyes or 20 people 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.520
 flower 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:42.970
 Well if Could go to increase more and more in this law 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.970
 This can be used as a large bag 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:50.880
 Please try to make you or the various size change by applying it is the law 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.420
 It is feeling 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:03.200
 8 still good 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:04.980
 There are some parts that can not be answered like questions, so little by little 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.930
 It is applicable 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.330
 Because we will explain 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.920
 When you can wait 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.540
 I'm happy 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.120
 after 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.770
 That's right now 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:24.169
 It is an aside, but the wire last year 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:25.440
 It is a wire that I bought and slept so I want to make a hanger because it is like this A miniature version 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.590
 It is cancer 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.790
 I thought I would like to also practice 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.150
 after 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:37.350
 The second half of the oval 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:40.010
 I want to do it soon 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.010
 It will be true 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:48.260
 It is Well 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:53.800
 Hat size difference in size of that hat with hat 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:55.040
 The adult version of Toka Mitten 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.990

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.000
 The place of Nimatsu knitting 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.169
 It was this 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.289
