00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.500
 if I'm not extremely happy but 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.470
 I did my job because I did not 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.220
 extremely when you 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:15.800
 for the simple fact that on the contrary 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.240
 it comes for something else and I did not expect 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.040
 come to this situation there was much talk 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.070
 in the week and if they have to play if not 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.180
 have to play anything really just 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.280
 Now I am learning everything that 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.740
 it has been spoken but in my head 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.270
 he also played the idea of ​​playing no 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.430
 play from 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.380
 face the situation is as a man and 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.280
 get on the court because I even 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.890
 they hired and gave me the opportunity 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.300
 of playing and feeding my family in a 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.739
 You thought you did not play 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.170
 you know the amount of thought that 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.670
 I had in the week from that to play 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.660
 until 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:53.409
 7 million in a situation like this is not 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.879
 there is a second thought here here 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.870
 party all the time thinking that 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.090
 it can happen that it can not happen 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.720
 it gave all this is someone imagine me 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.720
 in you not a single one imagines 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.130
 but you had to finish at least one 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.130
 work worthy of 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.720
 and I did my job it 's really that 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.930
 because I turned around and did not even look 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.040
 the end of matías I felt that it was going to be 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.040
 very special to me 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.440
 limit the joys I 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.980
 so much to face a situation 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.160
 different 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:40.510
 anyone likes that he does not like me 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.510
 remember many things 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.439
 in the balance of the 120 minutes of 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.659
 game think that the just to be taken 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.009
 victory to penalties 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.009
 and in that match 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.130
 the virtual party excursions 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.720
 we had four situations for 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.460
 convert 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.040
 they arrived then that was pressure 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.680
 for them 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.910
 that happens in us we find mandela 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.910
 was the team that maybe out there 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.900
 really today there was 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.900
 we match 5% of furniture no 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.620
 that is not a small thing 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.870
 but 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.130
 they really knew where they were standing and 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.540
 where it was 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:40.190
 today is the was the largest state 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:43.430
 race not today maybe it was the feeling 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.140
 of fulfilled work 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.670
 of the arrival of youth there was much talk 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.300
 of you 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:54.970
 throughout this year alone very much in the 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:57.070
 judge my person professionalism 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.260
 and I feel like he gets chest by pound 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.760
 defended through the ovation of the 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.470
 people also left to vote 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.130
 I said it there on the court for me a 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.470
 blessing because 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.940
 the big jump for example firm 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.940
 surely record
