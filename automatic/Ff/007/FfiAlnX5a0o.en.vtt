00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.300
 hello today a very special guitar because it is about 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.630
 there ltd it's short eclipse at 337 and m for christa markwalder history 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.180
 but there because it was a series 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.180
 limited here is a limited edition of 200 copies 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.800
 so guitars that have been developed 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.660
 will parry the black box 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.810
 been helped percent and so that's the black box that decided to do 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.420
 something a little out of the ordinary and percent of what she looks forward to 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.560
 really very exceptional these cases relationship between quality price 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.850
 enough a Batavian is to say that the whole finish was terrific 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.380
 m at the same time to play and she's really super comfortable you'll see that 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.159
 she sounds very good 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.809
 all for a price which is quite cursed 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.800
 so what do we have a bit so here we have a guitar 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.670
 mahogany with 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.479
 which is a little unusual percent and an eclipse so a screwed neck 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.600
 here and there we see that we have a job and for the junction the body 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.020
 men's sleeve to facilitate both the focus and the comfort 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.880
 for 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.170
 little of the left hand why because it's a guitar 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.770
 with microphones active end with 24 boxes with a handle sum all it is that 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.130
 the liver even if the Roma is fine enough and therefore necessarily that says 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.710
 my choice touches 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.730
 relatively complaint 24 boxes and pickups active and diligent fast I would not 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.140
 besides game of metalheads guard game 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.270
 and so to be moved why 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.320
 that we made sure that the left hand can come up high so as not to 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.390
 curb the ardor of our friends I am happy elected 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.060
 So here we are, with all this, we have a hardware completely gilded 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.090
 with volumes and a tone is shared by the two microphones so this 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.780
 meaning 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.160
 to the man of the microphones respect the same as one finds on the actor kamel 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.319
 than cage 25th 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.950
 e the sound of the pickups that works very well from the pickups active so to 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.019
 the back we do not have time compartments note for the pile 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.729
 me 

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:28.200
 fresh renewal 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.200
 you will notice here and we have 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.749
 behind the acronym and therefore to reinforce for this point so the risk 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:38.649
 not to break your head 

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:41.529
 and then we also have mechanical is special 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:44.099
 and for not being around the beautiful and proud 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.019
 here we go then listen a little what it gives and you will see that we 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.749
 is not disappointed 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:52.749
 so we start with the clear micrograms 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:19.139
 here I purposely let the note last for you to see a little 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:19.649
 the 

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:22.719
 the resonance that lives publishers is pretty amazing 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.279
 especially at this price level 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:27.359
 she then goes on the 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.359
 intermediate pollution 

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:38.009
 I finally 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.359
 and now we go on the big and more 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.769
 the 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.699
 at the same time, all his qualities will be found in close 

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:29.749
 cowen 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:36.169
 one year before 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.230
 the decline 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.919
 volume 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.580
 apple 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.580
 mons 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.180
 a 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:52.300
 see that we swim 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.300
 in the volume that percent and very progressive 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.979
 and this on both microphones 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.979
 good we do a few that are now 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.300
 she 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.550
 He counts 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.620
 while mm 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.610
 no 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.530
 here and now we move on to something holding him more 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.530
 the committee 

00:07:30.369 --> 00:07:33.729
 with this sword this summer the black box not just wanted to do 

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:35.710
 a marketing move 

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:40.699
 it's also an excellent guitar for the price what a coach did 

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:44.319
 amazing and very pleasant to play she sounds great 

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:47.409
 she is pretty well equipped and even so good 

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:52.009
 we would have liked some ngos and may the mics the hope that are there are already 

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:52.270
 the 

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.110
 not bad at all and for the price really 

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.189
 for that nothing to say she is really 

00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:58.370
 excellent 

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.229
 so here is the opportunity to acquire an eclipse that is quite the exceptional 

00:08:02.229 --> 00:08:03.749
 without having to spend too much 

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:05.179
 and on that point, I salute you
