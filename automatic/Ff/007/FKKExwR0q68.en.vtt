00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.289
 hi all amazed case I hope that 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.619
 you're fine anyway I'm fine 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.119
 nickel 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.800
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.699
 new episode of activities what the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.320
 fuck of the week 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.359
 and for you to present them I will be in 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.949
 hate company so to his how do you 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.170
 I'm going very soon 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.580
 well it's going nickel more week 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.750
 last we could not leave episodes 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.250
 so we really tried to put you 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.870
 activities what the fuck in this 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.230
 episode you tell us what you in 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.790
 think 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.719
 and so we go we go right away 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.719
 start this ranking 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.670
 and so we start right away 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.500
 ranking in fifth position 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.450
 we start slowly so with a 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.920
 car race by the beach 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.450
 you will see there are still two 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.520
 three little jumps what the fuck like 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.560
 this one so at these parties you take 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.030
 a max of speed to try to miss 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.340
 laugh in phase so these barriers 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.600
 I did not take enough speed here 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.460
 it's gone you roll here normally 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.960
 you will be able to bypass the 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.610
 barriers right here 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.220
 there is a mega little sun on 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.630
 arrives on the beach and then we go 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.040
 get to another place you go 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.210
 see the same what the fuck here you 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.180
 you have to take a little speed 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.860
 and succeed in landing so on this on this 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.810
 container if you take too much speed 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.400
 you will go over the barrier 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.900
 blue if you do not pick up enough 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.460
 will fall into the water so what was 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.140
 still pretty boring and then has it 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.700
 the same you take a maximum of speed 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.350
 to take two points just here 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.060
 so I want that she was still 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.710
 pretty good I wanted to introduce it to you 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.160
 and then we'll go right to the 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.160
 fourth place 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.830
 and we immediately think of the fourth 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.110
 place that is a really wa crumbling 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.330
 seal and that happens in the house 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.600
 of franklin so that already that poses a 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.520
 thrill plot pardon is so there all 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.270
 the world and rockets you launch the spear 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.450
 grenades 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.220
 short it explodes from everywhere even a 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.990
 moment I leave the door and there I see 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.100
 a rocket launcher just past 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.690
 it was really funny because 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.130
 that your post at five o'clock after me 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.869
 I loved the well which there are quite 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.060
 interior decor that has been added 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.470
 so the guarantors for full middle ago 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.720
 a lot of cash a lot of barriers 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.040
 it's not just the house at the 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.459
 house in franklin what was it when 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.140
 even change we will say I did not want to 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.310
 company dedications the coup to jeremic 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.380
 could not comment and saw 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.730
 that they bugged with his software so puts 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.930
 it was he who created this clash and 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:39.080
 frankly I read it really is 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:40.459
 well done and so we end up at the 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.880
 third place so in the middle of 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.620
 ranking 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.880
 this time we end up in two 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.630
 wheels so I took the 8 cents to 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.190
 material 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.239
 here, as you can see, we have 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.130
 small rents that make us go down 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.989
 near the canals here you're going to have to 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.830
 ride on these little 30 feet here for 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.110
 go from one end to the other 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.269
 like the flat channel I missed 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.250
 so we will start again and therefore no 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.959
 frankly this race was good and 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.360
 is well made it was created by Jeremy 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.620
 whose little dedication to him looked at 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.880
 like this we will start again so you 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.530
 roll on the ranks like me in the 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.489
 same video to fetch the 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.910
 little crossing point that there is 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.769
 the other side 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.810
 and if little difficult place do 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.160
 blunder it must land well and take 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.840
 the stairs that's here to go from 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.950
 the other side regret is the whole 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.060
 accelerated time otherwise you do a 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.410
 backwards and you will fall into 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.510
 water and so it will be well all 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.519
 restart the device then you 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.320
 drive around here we're going to have a mega sow 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.280
 who adjusted to the banks do not have 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.320
 frankly I thought she was 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.820
 really not bad I'm going to enjoy it 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.080
 to remind you that I put a 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.700
 little system in place for you 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.320
 you can also note the activities 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.570
 so I'll put you 5 comments 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.269
 in the comments so activity a 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.980
 activities from up to activity 5 and you 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.510
 put your note so you put them 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.250
 a little blue thumb like that I 'll see 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.230
 if your ranking goes with our 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.760
 ranking to see if we have a few 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.650
 even empty and so we go right away 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.829
 passed at the top of this ranking at the two 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.829
 square 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.910
 so we're just going to the second 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:07.430
 up happening is happening is so bike 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.300
 in this race there are several replacements 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.550
 that follow one another 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.070
 to each other and so there we take two 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.690
 successive ramps that follow one another and 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.640
 will do us and interests right behind 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.829
 containers even at a time we're going 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.780
 pass on a cargo ship that is just 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.830
 here we have to climb the stairs with the 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:30.350
 motorcycle is so saint-calais successful with 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:31.790
 with 1800 abati always so there we 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.290
 passes on the container could land 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.060
 on other containers you have to take 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.740
 take the little barrier but his 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.790
 body does not hurt I'm the one on the 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.100
 noise and so landed in a kind 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.500
 of bio soft it is necessary to take the stairs 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.240
 could land on the other side that 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.530
 it's hot that looks like 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.630
 that but frankly we have to manage the 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.430
 little joystick 1 otherwise you turn around 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.120
 in 2 2 no but frankly it's a 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.120
 good little race 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.129
 and so we find ourselves in 1st place 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:07.809
 his activities what the fuck of the 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:09.759
 week is this one you'll see 

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:11.469
 she's really what the fuck so there 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:13.089
 directly you chained you pity one 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:14.319
 small course in teeth 

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:15.729
 containers like that be very careful 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:17.319
 at the doors otherwise you will break the 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.089
 mouth and you will have to start all over again 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:20.469
 from the beginning and you will see 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:22.959
 then we'll even land in the 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:24.219
 in the building of the fcb so frankly 

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:26.559
 it's really excellent a good 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:27.819
 race what the fuck up there you arrive 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:29.080
 on a small platform pay attention 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:30.399
 I fell 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.830
 good it's good to brake directly to 

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:34.449
 the exit of the containers here the same 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.490
 so you're interested in the platform 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:39.129
 to chain in containers for 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.569
 land in the building in the fbi 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:42.039
 and then you'll see we're going to have 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:44.889
 a fall who is really what the fuck 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.729
 here you go to the bottom of the building no 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.919
 at the bottom of the building 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.509
 you turn right and you will see 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.339
 we're going to have a mega fall right here 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:52.659
 look there we cross the ceiling and we 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:54.999
 will fall into a kind of black hole 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.619
 look to land then on the 

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:57.939
 route so except that these tests 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:59.699
 he is to agree to port and this 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:01.899
 little bug in a race 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.069
 and here we come to the end of this 

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:04.539
 episode anyway I really hope 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:05.979
 that these five activities will have you more 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:07.779
 do not hesitate to drop a little thumb 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:09.309
 purpose if that's the case and to subscribe if 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:10.659
 it's not already done me I've all 

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:12.419
 wanted was it on these pictures tell you 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:15.419
 all good game and you everyone 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.419
 I 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.910
 no 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.910
 this
