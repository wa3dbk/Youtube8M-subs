here's why doing calf raises for
vertical<00:00:45.910> jump<00:00:46.120> is<00:00:46.270> like<00:00:46.390> training<00:00:46.690> your

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
vertical jump is like training your

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.810 
vertical jump is like training your
wrists<00:00:47.170> to<00:00:47.230> get<00:00:47.379> better<00:00:47.530> at<00:00:47.800> pushing<00:00:48.399> someone

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
wrists to get better at pushing someone

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.760 
wrists to get better at pushing someone
it's<00:00:49.149> like<00:00:49.270> telling<00:00:49.629> linemen<00:00:50.110> to<00:00:50.469> be<00:00:50.559> able<00:00:50.649> to

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
it's like telling linemen to be able to

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.229 
it's like telling linemen to be able to
drive<00:00:51.010> someone<00:00:51.340> over<00:00:51.579> faster<00:00:51.969> you<00:00:52.059> need<00:00:52.149> to

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
drive someone over faster you need to

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.610 
drive someone over faster you need to
get<00:00:52.359> stronger<00:00:52.660> rips<00:00:53.020> this<00:00:53.829> movement<00:00:54.340> is<00:00:55.620> so

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
get stronger rips this movement is so

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.889 
get stronger rips this movement is so
secondary<00:00:57.309> to<00:00:57.789> the<00:00:57.879> power<00:00:58.149> that's<00:00:58.480> developed

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
secondary to the power that's developed

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.259 
secondary to the power that's developed
in<00:00:58.960> your<00:00:59.050> glutes<00:00:59.350> hips<00:01:00.010> and<00:01:00.280> thighs<00:01:00.820> when<00:01:01.210> you

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
in your glutes hips and thighs when you

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:04.020 
in your glutes hips and thighs when you
vertical<00:01:01.480> jump<00:01:01.960> that's<00:01:02.469> not<00:01:02.739> even<00:01:02.949> funny<00:01:03.160> now

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
vertical jump that's not even funny now

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.340 
vertical jump that's not even funny now
I'm<00:01:04.090> not<00:01:04.240> saying<00:01:04.420> strong<00:01:04.780> calves<00:01:05.050> aren't

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
I'm not saying strong calves aren't

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.770 
I'm not saying strong calves aren't

important we do sled pushes we do
jumping<00:01:08.320> which<00:01:08.470> strengthens<00:01:08.950> our<00:01:09.040> calves

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
jumping which strengthens our calves

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
movement that lasts a fraction of a

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.180 
movement that lasts a fraction of a
second<00:01:30.910> you<00:01:31.540> need<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:31.750> choose<00:01:32.350> exercises<00:01:32.680> that

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
second you need to choose exercises that

second you need to choose exercises that
are<00:01:33.220> way<00:01:33.460> better<00:01:33.610> for<00:01:33.760> vertical<00:01:34.420> jump<00:01:34.660> now

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
are way better for vertical jump now

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.990 
are way better for vertical jump now

school people do weighted calf raises
and<00:01:45.109> all<00:01:45.200> that<00:01:45.409> to<00:01:45.890> get<00:01:46.039> bigger<00:01:46.310> calves<00:01:46.670> but

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
and all that to get bigger calves but

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.419 
and all that to get bigger calves but
again<00:01:47.570> it's<00:01:48.079> not<00:01:48.350> treating<00:01:48.979> it<00:01:49.069> comes<00:01:49.280> to

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
again it's not treating it comes to

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.520 
again it's not treating it comes to
vertical<00:01:49.789> jump<00:01:50.060> so<00:01:50.299> if<00:01:50.359> someone<00:01:50.659> tells<00:01:50.840> you<00:01:50.990> do

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
vertical jump so if someone tells you do

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.649 
vertical jump so if someone tells you do
calf<00:01:51.770> raises<00:01:52.039> for<00:01:52.280> vertical<00:01:52.520> jump<00:01:52.850> they're

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
calf raises for vertical jump they're

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.870 
calf raises for vertical jump they're
not<00:01:53.990> telling<00:01:54.229> you<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.469> right<00:01:54.649> stuff<00:01:55.039> so<00:01:55.280> cut

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
not telling you the right stuff so cut

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.880 
not telling you the right stuff so cut
it<00:01:55.909> out<00:01:56.119> hopefully<00:01:57.110> you're<00:01:57.200> able<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.439> trust<00:01:57.709> me

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
by this point can buy into the fact that

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.749 
by this point can buy into the fact that
calf<00:02:00.409> raises<00:02:00.709> aren't<00:02:01.039> for<00:02:01.159> vertical<00:02:01.429> jump

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
calf raises aren't for vertical jump
