 be in many hotels in shape 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.500

 I'm finishing an offer for 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:49.840
 that the whole week has another value 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:52.569
 much smaller than everyone for 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.429

 the chicharrÃ³n develops a breath 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.300
 We have skipped it a little bit because 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.480
 but you do not have to carry a 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.160
 a balanced life easy after no 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.490

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.490
 much 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:31.580
