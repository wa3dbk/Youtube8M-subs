umm<00:02:10.890> it'll<00:02:10.950> lock<00:02:11.610> itself<00:02:11.970> when<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.300> click<00:02:12.599> put

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
umm it'll lock itself when you click put

the<00:02:12.810> cover<00:02:13.260> over<00:02:13.470> it<00:02:14.510> so<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.810> think<00:02:16.290> that's

uh the big glare just just look at the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.800 
uh the big glare just just look at the
apple<00:02:46.980> logo<00:02:47.010> don't<00:02:47.850> even<00:02:48.000> look<00:02:48.150> at<00:02:48.300> me

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.750 

powering<00:02:51.810> on<00:02:51.930> for<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.200> first<00:02:52.350> time<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:52.890> we

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
powering on for the first time and we

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.460 
powering on for the first time and we
can't<00:02:53.910> really<00:02:54.150> show<00:02:54.570> you<00:02:54.630> anything<00:02:54.900> in<00:02:55.260> it

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
can't really show you anything in it

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.820 
can't really show you anything in it
just<00:02:55.770> says<00:02:55.890> connect<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.250> itunes<00:02:56.610> but<00:02:56.880> I<00:02:57.830> think

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
just says connect to itunes but I think

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.230 
just says connect to itunes but I think
that's<00:02:58.980> about<00:02:59.100> it<00:02:59.220> showing<00:02:59.700> around<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.000> port

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
that's about it showing around the port

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.650 
that's about it showing around the port
so<00:03:00.390> there's<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.870> power<00:03:01.320> button<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:02.820> volume

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
so there's the power button the volume

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.750 
so there's the power button the volume
switch<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.410> can<00:03:04.650> either<00:03:04.770> toggle<00:03:05.400> the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
switch and that can either toggle the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.200 
switch and that can either toggle the
switch<00:03:06.120> on<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.540> side<00:03:06.690> can<00:03:06.930> toggle<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:08.210> I'll

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
switch on the side can toggle the I'll

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.690 
switch on the side can toggle the I'll
get<00:03:09.420> back<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.660> that<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:10.560> is<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:10.920> 30<00:03:11.520> pin

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
get back to that and that is the 30 pin

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.630 
get back to that and that is the 30 pin
connector<00:03:12.260> so<00:03:13.260> that's<00:03:13.410> which<00:03:13.680> can<00:03:14.010> toggle

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
connector so that's which can toggle

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.430 
connector so that's which can toggle
between<00:03:15.680> mute<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.860> lock<00:03:17.610> rotation<00:03:17.790> and

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
between mute and lock rotation and

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.390 
between mute and lock rotation and
obviously<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:21.590> eyesight<00:03:22.590> I<00:03:22.770> don't<00:03:23.340> know

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
obviously the eyesight I don't know

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.530 
obviously the eyesight I don't know
what's<00:03:23.550> really<00:03:23.670> want<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:23.940> call<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.090> in<00:03:24.300> the

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
what's really want to call it in the

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.870 
what's really want to call it in the
camera<00:03:24.870> hole<00:03:25.110> so<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.100> character<00:03:26.459> shoots<00:03:26.670> HD

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
camera hole so the character shoots HD

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.830 
camera hole so the character shoots HD
not<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:27.870> front<00:03:28.050> one<00:03:28.230> it's<00:03:28.560> not<00:03:28.800> HD<00:03:29.160> but<00:03:29.840> so

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
not the front one it's not HD but so

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.330 
not the front one it's not HD but so
there<00:03:30.990> we<00:03:31.080> go<00:03:31.110> smart<00:03:31.440> cover<00:03:31.620> fits<00:03:31.860> very<00:03:32.190> nice

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
there we go smart cover fits very nice

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.850 
there we go smart cover fits very nice
if<00:03:32.520> it's<00:03:32.700> perfect<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.680> that'll<00:03:34.680> be<00:03:34.740> it<00:03:34.770> for

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
if it's perfect and that'll be it for

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.360 
if it's perfect and that'll be it for
this<00:03:35.010> unboxing<00:03:35.160> see<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:35.700> later<00:03:35.880> bye
