simple<00:04:28.400> test<00:04:28.730> treating<00:04:29.390> the<00:04:29.450> flash<00:04:29.660> five

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
simple test treating the flash five

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.560 
simple test treating the flash five
times<00:04:30.410> at<00:04:30.620> around<00:04:30.770> 10<00:04:31.070> meters<00:04:31.240> so<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.360> flash

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
times at around 10 meters so the flash

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.180 
times at around 10 meters so the flash
name<00:04:32.780> catched<00:04:33.050> well<00:04:33.320> on<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.530> camera<00:04:33.710> but<00:04:34.100> it

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190
