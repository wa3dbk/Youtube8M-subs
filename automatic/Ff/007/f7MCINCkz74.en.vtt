back<00:02:46.530> in<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.709> second<00:02:47.989> so<00:02:48.989> this<00:02:49.349> one<00:02:49.530> is<00:02:49.650> more<00:02:49.680> the

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
back in a second so this one is more the

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.069 
back in a second so this one is more the
standard<00:02:50.189> kind<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.459> race<00:02:50.609> a<00:02:50.879> Smith<00:02:51.239> versus

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
standard kind of race a Smith versus

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.989 
standard kind of race a Smith versus
three<00:02:52.889> other<00:02:53.069> dyes<00:02:55.010> see<00:02:56.010> if<00:02:56.069> we<00:02:56.189> can<00:02:56.340> get<00:02:56.849> away

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:56.999 
three other dyes see if we can get away

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:15.320 
three other dyes see if we can get away
from<00:02:57.060> them<00:02:57.389> good<00:02:57.870> start

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.420 

now<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.930> playgroup<00:03:16.260> version<00:03:16.620> actually<00:03:16.770> was

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
now the playgroup version actually was

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.280 
now the playgroup version actually was
free<00:03:17.820> unfortunately<00:03:18.480> one<00:03:18.690> is<00:03:18.810> in<00:03:18.960> at<00:03:19.200> the

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
free unfortunately one is in at the

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.660 
free unfortunately one is in at the
moment<00:03:19.560> this<00:03:19.620> isn't<00:03:19.770> going<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.010> cost<00:03:20.160> you<00:03:20.430> I

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
moment this isn't going to cost you I

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.000 
moment this isn't going to cost you I
think<00:03:21.300> it's<00:03:21.420> two<00:03:21.630> pounds<00:03:21.990> so<00:03:22.440> that's<00:03:22.560> probably

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
think it's two pounds so that's probably

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.720 
think it's two pounds so that's probably
about<00:03:23.160> two<00:03:23.460> dollars<00:03:23.640> 99<00:03:24.120> without<00:03:24.570> me<00:03:24.690> checking

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
about two dollars 99 without me checking

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.730 
about two dollars 99 without me checking
but<00:03:26.730> it's<00:03:27.630> pretty<00:03:27.810> awesome<00:03:27.930> only<00:03:28.380> Stephenie

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
but it's pretty awesome only Stephenie

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.680 
but it's pretty awesome only Stephenie
