00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:09.429
 means I wanted to show after the first 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.259
 these days of service means 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:14.809
 application as if people do not even cause 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.060
 from these applications look like the first floor 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.940
 mess 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:24.290
 one elevator is not called another elevator 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:26.690
 goes as if like where he wants means 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.500
 what I noticed is some kind of freight elevator 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.300
 pressed the next station try 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.530
 moved at great speed and then 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.780
 pulls on a little practice 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.510
 indicates that this is either or prior to contact 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.370
 disappears but I did not find out 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.890
 it comes across to them like that because the sofa is clear 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.510
 somewhere here in almost every 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.210
 the third node disappears well what I found 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.640
 interesting about almost such 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.160
 problems eliminated while brushing 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.430
 contacts all relin means found such 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.510
 interesting thing means a lot of role 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:06.380
 where the contacts in such a state as if 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.530
 it seems to be visually compressed but when 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.700
 whether the motion is a badge file i'm not 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.400
 sharpen contacts 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.270
 just as if trying to brush up or 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.820
 Roly begins such nonsense and such 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.729
 relay 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:25.400
 it was enough but even found such 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.860
 options where contacts fall out 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.159
 there is and is no longer working purely on the top 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.340
 lath but that means she is here 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.010
 here is an example only two will draw 3 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.760
 It happens first I already have this vacation 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:47.080
 merchants made it shine and already 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.080
 him this effect is gone that is sitting what 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.380
 as you can see how many of these problems are here 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.560
 this same 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.539
 your and here already did mean the most 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:07.310
 interesting is that the top direction relays with 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:09.989
 the same problem was noodle here 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:17.819
 compressed the usual because I had to go 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:21.900
 of the cones will focus still compressingly 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.880
 cleaned and found can some of them 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:29.280
 contacts 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:33.860
 generally were without contact but mostly 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.860
 so I clean find such things as useful 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.950
 while that's all
