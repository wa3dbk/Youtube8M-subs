00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.040
 hello how about how welcome are my 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.230
 name is eduardo and in this opportunity 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.880
 I'm going to teach you how to make a dough for 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.280
 cake this type of dough are called 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.170
 broken masses and the one that I'm going to 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.609
 teaching today is a very basic one that 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.850
 you can use both for 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.380
 sweet and savory versions this 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.080
 recipe that I will give you is a recipe 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.349
 that is called three two one or three 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.570
 parts of flour two parts of lard and 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.279
 a part of sugar in this case the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.020
 let's taste chocolate we're going 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.680
 to the broken dough and we will use 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.480
 bitter cocoa in a bowl what I'm going to 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.899
 have is the flour which I will place 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.510
 pinch of salt we will always place salt 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.940
 to the masses the butter has to be 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.920
 cold and what we are going to do with this 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.649
 Butter is a sandblasting that we are going to 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.590
 start with a cornet to not touch 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.390
 too much butter and that does not soften 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.359
 this same work can be done 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.859
 with a processor because we are 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.660
 doing this because what we want is 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.250
 that the flour is waterproofed is for 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.420
 when we add the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.120
 ingredients that are going to be in this case 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.760
 egg does not absorb too much liquid 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.410
 of the egg then have the texture that 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.000
 you have to have this kind of masses that 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.250
 they are called broken masses because they are 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.560
 more reliable masses that disarm when 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.260
 the one eats well once 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.860
 we have that thick thick saber we're going to 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.619
 place the sugar add the cocoa and 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.990
 we started doing this again 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.720
 sandblasting with the help of hands 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.330
 achieve that our butter has 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.970
 incorporated very well in all these 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.649
 dry ingredients here the percentage of 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.869
 cocoa I'm using what I did 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.399
 it was a very simple calculation remove two 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.649
 tablespoons of flour and replace it with 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.500
 two tablespoons of bitter cocoa when 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.210
 we get this well ordered with all the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.300
 Enchastre that there is in the allowance we are going 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.580
 to then add the egg in this case 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.780
 it's an egg for this proportion and we're going 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.220
 to also put a little bit of 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.100
 vanilla essence that will help 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.770
 to enhance the flavor also of chocolate 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.740
 I start with a spoon first so as not to 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.830
 make it very cumbersome then let's go 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.750
 to move to join the mass well here is not 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.570
 to pass them if we knead what we are going to 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.220
 do is activate the flour gluten 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.110
 and we will have some hard masses 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.560
 when we have it together that does not 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.210
 we see lumps what we are going to do is 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.600
 Take it to the cold because as you can see 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.400
 texture of the dough is very soft 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.290
 space two hours three hours or one 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.120
 or from one day to the next would be ideal 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.370
 and if they want to hurry the cold they will 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.030
 take the freezer well and in an hour the 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.770
 they will have cold 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.680
 very good here we have our mass 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.030
 Broken already with enough rest 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.470
 before starting to stretch it what 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.480
 we're going to do is give you some 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.550
 temperature of tempering it because they are 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.830
 we throw as well as this output of the 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.540
 refrigerator what is going to happen that is going away 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.069
 to break too much then what 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.640
 we are going to do is to work 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:01.250
 little so we will not go warming 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.900
 the mass quickly and we can 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.000
 work cold the secret of the masses 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.700
 broken is to work with the 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.200
 enough cold so that it does not stick 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.209
 to the counter once we have it right 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.940
 tempered we are going to wait a little bit of 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.910
 flour on the counter we will go 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.910
 stretching our dough always remember 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.130
 of moving the dough and that they are not 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.160
 Stick to the counter once the 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.170
 we stretch we are going to cover our 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.880
 tarteletas and what we're going to do what 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.430
 next without any fat or 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.260
 flour does not need it then to the dough 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.000
 Quebrada has enough material 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.700
 grease not to stick in our molds 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.560
 and we are going to do it is to give you the 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.650
 shape of our mold that take well the 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.220
 remember to always stretch it from the 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.840
 thickness 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.550
 even so it is all good 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.010
 distributed the dough in our mold 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.960
 so that they take into account as 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.520
 they go using a mold every time 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.850
 larger the thickness of the dough has 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.650
 that go increasing well in this case as 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.480
 I'm going to make some tarts with about 3 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.490
 millimeters more or less thick it's going to 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.340
 be enough there we can 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.440
 check if the dough has a thickness 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.780
 even around the entire edge and 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.490
 we have our mold lined what 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.160
 let's do is put paper 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:16.580
 aluminum and we will put some weight 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.190
 which can be flour rice and as well as 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.470
 It is with that weight we will take the 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.080
 oven is going to be a moderate oven to a 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.640
 oven almost a little high from 170 to 180 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.870
 degrees approximately 10 minutes 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.580
 very well once those have passed 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.380
 10 minutes of cooking our 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.150
 tartelets in the oven the dough goes to 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.430
 to be pre-cooked is going to be bleached 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.280
 There is the time to withdraw our 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.990
 weights our papers in this way what 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.030
 What we achieve is that the cake maintains its 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.740
 form and that does not deform fall the 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.450
 walls that usually happens 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.930
 with the pies but this is 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.180
 preparation this cross 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.160
 as I'm just going to need totally 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.259
 cooked to put a filling 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.759
 that is already prepared 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.250
 I need to take it back to the oven 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:01.800
 about 5 more minutes to finish 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.539
 to cook the cake well once 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.110
 it is cooked the dough is very detached 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:09.240
 easily from the edges and we already have 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.160
 our cakes we can do all 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.770
 of chocolate and we can put some 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.530
 chocolate cream that you know 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.600
 whether it's a profit a pastry 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.729
 you want and we can make some 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.039
 curls or some chocolate shavings with 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.530
 a p the potato and the chocolate that you 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.750
 have we are going to scratch this 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.910
 way to get some chips that 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.970
 then it will serve as decoration in 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.949
 our pies that we are doing 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.570
 now to this I want to put everything 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:40.169
 because I really like chocolate and 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.840
 another we put a whipped cream and 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:46.259
 then we will place some 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.880
 fruits and in this way we have achieved 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.550
 from a single base a basis of 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.529
 chocolate two types of different cakes 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.889
 well I hope that 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:57.899
 can make these recipes and good and 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:01.459
 that will be to your liking we will return 

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:01.459
 to see you soon thank you very much 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.400
 all right
