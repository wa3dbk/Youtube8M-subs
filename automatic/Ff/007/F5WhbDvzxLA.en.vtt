hello everyone this is Noah Smith and
one<00:00:03.810> of<00:00:03.899> my<00:00:03.990> subscribers<00:00:04.200> asked<00:00:04.950> me<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.569> make<00:00:06.569> a

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
one of my subscribers asked me to make a

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.530 
one of my subscribers asked me to make a
tutorial<00:00:07.440> on<00:00:09.410> how<00:00:10.460> on<00:00:11.460> this<00:00:11.670> I'm<00:00:12.210> pretty<00:00:12.450> much

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
tutorial on how on this I'm pretty much

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.289 
tutorial on how on this I'm pretty much
the<00:00:12.750> spine<00:00:13.110> how<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:13.920> make<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.400> under<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.030> track

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
the spine how I make it under the track

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.670 
the spine how I make it under the track
on<00:00:15.630> my<00:00:16.320> most<00:00:16.560> recent<00:00:16.710> roller<00:00:17.160> coasters<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:18.680> so

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
on my most recent roller coasters and so

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.960 
on my most recent roller coasters and so
it's<00:00:19.920> very<00:00:20.250> simple<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:21.090> start<00:00:21.420> out<00:00:21.600> with<00:00:21.869> oh

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
it's very simple you start out with oh

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.529 
it's very simple you start out with oh
and<00:00:23.970> rods<00:00:24.410> red<00:00:25.410> connectors<00:00:26.539> yellow

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
and rods red connectors yellow

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.679 
and rods red connectors yellow
connectors<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.289> black<00:00:28.890> rods<00:00:29.359> and<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.539> is

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
connectors and black rods and this is

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.620 
connectors and black rods and this is
something<00:00:30.869> else<00:00:31.969> but<00:00:33.860> these<00:00:34.860> are<00:00:35.210> so<00:00:36.210> this

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
something else but these are so this

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.400 
something else but these are so this
this<00:00:37.020> design<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.800> not<00:00:37.980> mine<00:00:38.280> but<00:00:38.960> it's<00:00:39.960> it's

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
this design is not mine but it's it's

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.369 
this design is not mine but it's it's
designed<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.100> mimic<00:00:41.370> or<00:00:41.790> act<00:00:42.360> kind<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.230> act

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
designed to mimic or act kind of act

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.610 
designed to mimic or act kind of act
like<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.610> cross<00:00:44.879> ties<00:00:45.210> or<00:00:45.570> it's<00:00:46.200> these<00:00:46.559> are

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
like the cross ties or it's these are

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.580 
like the cross ties or it's these are
supposedly<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.340> flexi<00:00:47.879> rods<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.390> normal<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.469> a

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
supposedly the flexi rods in normal in a

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.639 
supposedly the flexi rods in normal in a
normal<00:00:50.629> classic<00:00:51.629> connects<00:00:52.230> track<00:00:52.500> with

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
normal classic connects track with

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.689 
normal classic connects track with
tubing<00:00:53.120> so<00:00:54.120> these<00:00:54.239> are<00:00:54.449> these<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.989> flexi<00:00:55.350> rods

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
tubing so these are these the flexi rods

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.529 
tubing so these are these the flexi rods
and<00:00:56.699> they<00:00:57.600> are<00:00:57.750> actually<00:00:57.960> pretty<00:00:58.410> flexible

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
and they are actually pretty flexible

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.889 
and they are actually pretty flexible
because<00:01:00.539> they're<00:01:00.780> micro<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:02.210> these<00:01:03.210> would<00:01:03.750> be

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
because they're micro and these would be

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.450 
because they're micro and these would be
the<00:01:03.930> bottom<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.439> cross<00:01:04.650> tie<00:01:04.949> middle<00:01:06.110> top

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
the bottom of the cross tie middle top

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.730 
the bottom of the cross tie middle top
and<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.640> connects<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.090> track<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.740> I'm

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
and it connects to the track so I'm

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.690 
and it connects to the track so I'm
gonna<00:01:10.920> build<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.549> one<00:01:11.880> track<00:01:12.240> length<00:01:12.540> of

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
gonna build you one track length of

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:24.230 
gonna build you one track length of
micro<00:01:15.890> tubing<00:01:16.890> pretty<00:01:17.250> much<00:01:22.280> so<00:01:23.280> yeah<00:01:23.790> it's

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
micro tubing pretty much so yeah it's

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.679 
micro tubing pretty much so yeah it's
kind<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:24.960> like<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:26.119> and<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.330> keep

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
kind of like this and you just keep

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:42.130 
kind of like this and you just keep
going

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.810 

how<00:01:43.140> do<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.470> keep<00:01:43.649> extending<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.490> without

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
how do you keep extending it without

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.149 
how do you keep extending it without
using<00:01:45.060> those<00:01:45.570> purple<00:01:46.250> connectors<00:01:48.710> well<00:01:49.710> so

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
using those purple connectors well so

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.700 
using those purple connectors well so
basically<00:01:50.820> what<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.149> do<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.200> take<00:01:52.470> these

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
basically what I do is I just take these

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.330 
basically what I do is I just take these
last<00:01:52.920> two<00:01:53.220> right<00:01:53.430> here<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.829> if<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.950> look<00:01:56.159> at

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
last two right here and if you look at

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.889 
last two right here and if you look at
these<00:01:57.590> these<00:01:58.590> crews<00:01:58.979> right<00:01:59.250> here<00:01:59.659> right<00:02:00.659> there

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
these these crews right here right there

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:13.729 
these these crews right here right there
I<00:02:03.170> add<00:02:05.119> orange<00:02:06.119> rods<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:12.390> both<00:02:12.569> of<00:02:12.750> them<00:02:12.900> I'm

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
I add orange rods to both of them I'm

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.140 
I add orange rods to both of them I'm
just<00:02:13.830> adding<00:02:14.160> flexi<00:02:14.640> rods

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
just adding flexi rods

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.120 
just adding flexi rods
I<00:02:15.180> think<00:02:15.569> this<00:02:15.750> same<00:02:16.019> strategy<00:02:16.500> works<00:02:16.920> for

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
I think this same strategy works for

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.670 
I think this same strategy works for
cross<00:02:17.370> ties<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:18.540> can<00:02:18.569> do<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.019> I<00:02:19.200> think<00:02:21.650> now<00:02:22.650> I

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
cross ties you can do it I think now I

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.180 
cross ties you can do it I think now I
have<00:02:23.209> this<00:02:24.269> oops

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.059 

dang<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.310> okay<00:02:29.459> so<00:02:30.450> now<00:02:30.599> I<00:02:30.630> have<00:02:30.930> this<00:02:31.230> these

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
dang it okay so now I have this these

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.300 
dang it okay so now I have this these
flexi<00:02:32.519> rods<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:33.680> basically<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:34.769> just<00:02:35.069> keep

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
flexi rods and basically I just keep

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:49.240 
flexi rods and basically I just keep
adding<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:43.400> keep<00:02:44.400> adding<00:02:44.819> this<00:02:46.100> connected

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:03:06.350 

and<00:02:49.790> now<00:02:50.660> it's<00:02:51.380> like<00:02:53.260> it's<00:02:54.260> like<00:02:54.350> that<00:02:54.440> instead

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.650 

and<00:03:07.320> now<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.470> have<00:03:07.770> this<00:03:07.950> Oh<00:03:08.280> God<00:03:09.120> I'll<00:03:09.420> make<00:03:09.630> it

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
and now I have this Oh God I'll make it

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.050 
and now I have this Oh God I'll make it
a<00:03:09.810> little<00:03:10.230> longer

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
a little longer

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.310 
a little longer
well<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.330> know<00:03:12.420> what<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.540> don't<00:03:12.660> have<00:03:12.960> to<00:03:13.140> but

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
well you know what I don't have to but

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.510 
well you know what I don't have to but
you<00:03:13.350> can<00:03:13.680> just<00:03:13.860> continue<00:03:14.120> add<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:15.960> on<00:03:16.520> right

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
you can just continue add this on right

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.010 
you can just continue add this on right
there<00:03:17.790> for<00:03:18.000> both<00:03:18.090> sides<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:18.660> just<00:03:18.780> keep

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
there for both sides and just keep

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.680 
there for both sides and just keep
building<00:03:19.320> it<00:03:20.130> further<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:21.240> you<00:03:21.330> just<00:03:21.510> keep

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
building it further and you just keep

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.690 
building it further and you just keep
making<00:03:22.170> more<00:03:22.260> track<00:03:22.530> so<00:03:23.160> now<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:23.310> have<00:03:23.550> this

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
making more track so now I have this

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.300 
making more track so now I have this
very<00:03:24.060> very<00:03:24.180> stable<00:03:24.660> kind<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:26.240> firm<00:03:27.240> track

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
very very stable kind of firm track

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.240 
very very stable kind of firm track
unlike<00:03:29.310> normal<00:03:30.060> micro<00:03:30.480> track<00:03:30.690> by<00:03:30.870> itself<00:03:31.250> so

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
unlike normal micro track by itself so

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.690 
unlike normal micro track by itself so
now<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.430> have<00:03:32.640> this<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.320> it<00:03:34.320> can<00:03:34.860> be<00:03:34.950> bent<00:03:35.220> with

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
now I have this and it can be bent with

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.070 
now I have this and it can be bent with
some<00:03:36.000> some<00:03:36.720> maneuvering<00:03:38.150> you<00:03:39.150> know<00:03:39.210> sometimes

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
some some maneuvering you know sometimes

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.370 
some some maneuvering you know sometimes
these<00:03:40.680> little<00:03:40.830> rods<00:03:41.220> snap<00:03:41.990> it's<00:03:42.990> best<00:03:43.260> to

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
these little rods snap it's best to

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.510 
these little rods snap it's best to
build<00:03:43.760> I<00:03:44.760> think<00:03:44.970> it's<00:03:45.480> best<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.870> build<00:03:46.520> the

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
build I think it's best to build the

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.290 
build I think it's best to build the
spine<00:03:48.330> -<00:03:48.930> what<00:03:49.170> -<00:03:49.740> the<00:03:49.860> -<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.459> shape<00:03:50.730> of<00:03:50.940> the

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
spine - what - the - the shape of the

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.490 
spine - what - the - the shape of the
track<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.570> you're<00:03:51.810> gonna<00:03:51.930> make<00:03:52.110> it<00:03:52.260> so<00:03:52.380> like

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
track that you're gonna make it so like

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.320 
track that you're gonna make it so like
if<00:03:52.590> you're<00:03:52.709> gonna<00:03:52.770> make<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:53.010> loop<00:03:53.310> I'd<00:03:53.700> first

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
if you're gonna make a loop I'd first

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.320 
if you're gonna make a loop I'd first
make<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:54.780> loop<00:03:54.959> with<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.440> track<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:56.330> then

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
make the loop with the track and then

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.380 
make the loop with the track and then
I'd<00:03:57.600> have<00:03:58.020> the<00:03:58.320> spine<00:03:58.620> on<00:03:58.850> but<00:03:59.850> anyways<00:04:00.120> yeah

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
I'd have the spine on but anyways yeah

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.030 
I'd have the spine on but anyways yeah
so<00:04:00.890> here<00:04:01.890> it<00:04:01.980> is<00:04:02.540> however<00:04:03.540> sometimes<00:04:04.170> you<00:04:04.680> may

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
so here it is however sometimes you may

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.180 
so here it is however sometimes you may
want<00:04:05.070> even<00:04:05.670> more<00:04:05.850> support<00:04:06.300> and<00:04:07.190> basically

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
want even more support and basically

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.040 
want even more support and basically
what<00:04:08.940> I<00:04:08.970> sometimes<00:04:09.330> do<00:04:10.010> is<00:04:11.010> here<00:04:11.519> there<00:04:12.330> let<00:04:12.600> me

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
what I sometimes do is here there let me

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.620 
what I sometimes do is here there let me
see<00:04:13.940> so<00:04:14.940> see<00:04:15.330> these<00:04:15.570> little<00:04:17.390> you<00:04:18.390> see<00:04:18.510> this

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
see so see these little you see this

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.840 
see so see these little you see this
middle<00:04:18.900> wrong<00:04:19.260> right<00:04:19.530> there<00:04:19.769> you<00:04:20.489> could<00:04:20.609> see

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
middle wrong right there you could see

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.159 
middle wrong right there you could see
all<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.090> way<00:04:21.180> through<00:04:21.209> there<00:04:21.830> so<00:04:22.830> I<00:04:22.860> just<00:04:23.250> I

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
all the way through there so I just I

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.800 
all the way through there so I just I
simply<00:04:25.169> just<00:04:26.090> stick<00:04:27.090> one<00:04:27.300> of<00:04:27.419> these<00:04:27.540> through

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
simply just stick one of these through

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.880 
simply just stick one of these through
I'm<00:04:28.200> just<00:04:28.440> cute<00:04:28.770> extending<00:04:29.640> it<00:04:29.760> down

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.970 

even<00:04:34.820> on<00:04:34.940> bent<00:04:35.180> track<00:04:35.540> or<00:04:36.050> bent<00:04:36.440> on<00:04:36.650> a<00:04:36.710> bent

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
even on bent track or bent on a bent

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.550 
even on bent track or bent on a bent
spine<00:04:37.280> this<00:04:37.910> helps<00:04:38.300> a<00:04:38.390> lot<00:04:38.600> just<00:04:38.870> to<00:04:38.990> fortify

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
spine this helps a lot just to fortify

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.770 
spine this helps a lot just to fortify
it<00:04:40.120> and<00:04:41.120> you<00:04:41.210> can<00:04:41.510> do<00:04:41.660> it<00:04:41.690> to<00:04:41.960> these<00:04:42.250> loan<00:04:43.250> ones

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
it and you can do it to these loan ones

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.970 
it and you can do it to these loan ones
out<00:04:44.780> here<00:04:44.810> that<00:04:45.620> don't<00:04:45.740> have<00:04:45.890> to<00:04:46.250> on<00:04:46.670> them<00:04:46.790> and

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
out here that don't have to on them and

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.100 
out here that don't have to on them and
it<00:04:48.980> fortifies<00:04:49.550> it<00:04:49.970> and<00:04:50.330> then<00:04:50.450> further<00:04:50.720> you<00:04:50.870> can

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
it fortifies it and then further you can

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.080 
it fortifies it and then further you can
even<00:04:51.260> add<00:04:51.530> more<00:04:51.560> stuff<00:04:52.340> on<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.550> side<00:04:52.820> like

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
even add more stuff on the side like

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.530 
even add more stuff on the side like
this

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
this

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.230 
this
and<00:04:53.630> it<00:04:54.410> still<00:04:54.740> bends<00:04:54.950> and<00:04:55.310> it<00:04:55.640> still<00:04:56.000> works

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
and it still bends and it still works

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.610 
and it still bends and it still works
and<00:04:57.250> it<00:04:58.250> I<00:04:58.780> highly<00:04:59.780> recommend<00:05:00.200> it<00:05:00.320> if<00:05:00.470> you're

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
and it I highly recommend it if you're

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.510 
and it I highly recommend it if you're
going<00:05:00.770> to<00:05:00.860> be<00:05:00.950> making<00:05:01.190> a<00:05:02.920> realistic<00:05:03.920> coaster

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
going to be making a realistic coaster

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.980 
going to be making a realistic coaster
