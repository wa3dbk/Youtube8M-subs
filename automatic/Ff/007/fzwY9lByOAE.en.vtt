 submission know him love him 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.119
 can be seen in movies and on television 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.390
 Separately, I want to note that it is this 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.820
 car 1 reached the north pole as 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.099
 you see we already tested it in 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.340
 fully and now we are all about you and 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.550
 tell yes yes you are not mistaken it 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.469
 really the same toyota hi lax 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.300
 this mid-size pickup due to its 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.550
 you just 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.050
 functionality and maintainability 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.730
 earned immense popularity throughout 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.309
 the world his story originates in the distant 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.829
 1968 and since then about 2 million 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.629
 cars not just proved their 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.660
 worldwide owners the right to 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.170
 existence and in life and on the roads and 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.090
 in the harshest climatic conditions 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.300
 the word plant on which was going to 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.619
 hi lax and this is the eighth generation 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.900
 located in south africa 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.360
 so that he can overcome difficulties 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.140
 you can say from birth that you can 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.250
 say about the exterior on the one hand 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.860
 wide hood air intake 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.530
 grille narrow squint headlights 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.500
 give this car masculinity 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.110
 although what can there be design guys 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.600
 this is a pickup truck and it is brutal from the very beginning 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.119
 with all her face, the high lax makes you understand 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.759
 what is ready if not at all 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.250
 much rigid frame construction 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.320
 all-wheel drive system and very 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.750
 impressive off-road package + 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.630
 spacious cargo compartment open 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.479
 the driver has ample opportunities to front and 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.979
 rear bumpers are shaped 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.060
 providing maximum 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.149
 geometric cross 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.079
 front overhang has an angle of 30 degrees 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.020
 back 22 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.000
 you can go anywhere and move out 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.009
 from everywhere 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.590
 high ground clearance super durable 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.960
 suspension and massive wheels allow 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.229
 overcome steep enough slopes and 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.869
 deep wades with great pleasure 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.230
 we watched the suspension easily smoothly 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.739
 eats everything up gently and with great appetite 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.610
 pits and potholes and potholes found on 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.610
 our way 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.250
 hi lax easily rushed forward and was 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.160
 it is clear that he moved out of the asphalt 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.080
 in its native element as befits 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.030
 SUV at Toyota High Lax 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.030
 satisfied all our 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.060
 off-road wishes suspension here 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.640
 It worked in the spring with a bang behind 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.799
 multi-link front clear and 23 with 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.220
 half a centimeter essentially what else 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.830
 need to 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.650
 we specifically tried to pierce the suspension 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.950
 Climbed to such places in which to go 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.720
 there was a terrible hi-lax everywhere 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.180
 certainly brought all thanks also 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.890
 razdatki which is installed here with us 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.200
 it is possible to switch to 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.930
 front-wheel drive on all-wheel drive 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.090
 downshift which by the way here and 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.390
 dragged you out of one very 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.780
 an unpleasant place to find fault not 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.660
 for what 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.970
 by the way on asphalt Toyota hi lax leads 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.950
 yourself as worthy soft on 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.490
 off-road suspension becomes moderately 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.590
 there is no tight roll 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:24.070
 handling also flawlessly steering 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.830
 instantly executes all driver commands 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.000
 by the way the eversion of the steering wheel and turning radius 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.390
 given the considerable size 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.340
 beyond praise of the many 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.530
 road and off-road electronic 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.200
 assistants want to highlight the system 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.480
 connecting the front interwheel 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.920
 the differential that it gives as soon as 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.140
 pickup rides on level 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.060
 asphalt surface system 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.760
 immediately switches all-wheel drive 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.220
 rear-wheel drive mode is positive 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.230
 affects fuel consumption and level 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.760
 cabin noise 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.400
 despite the brutality of the exterior 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.440
 interior hi lax and looks solid 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.239
 This Toyota High Lax is in 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.870
 maximum for this engine 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:08.390
 picking here I certainly thought that 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.430
 since this pickup will all be like that 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.980
 more modest but in fact everything 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.640
 interestingly enough of course that's plastic 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.340
 on the doors on the panel it is a little rude 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.400
 but this is not a business class is still well and in 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.780
 the rest is pretty cool 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.890
 climate control 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.200
 multimedia system with great 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.780
 touch screen onboard computer 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.610
 heated leather interior which 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.650
 by the way has enough 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.380
 impressive package of settings 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.740
 generally being behind the wheel of a toyota hi 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.710
 lax 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.770
 business is pleasant and comfortable no 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.680
 constraint go 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.580
 comfort place enough ergomnika 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.849
 great 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.250
 many different shelves and niches for little things 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:51.599
 rear view camera and not in every 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.960
 car meets 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.650
 and here please test-pilot tihan 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.770
 naumenko 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.979
 music fan presence of usb and output and bluetooth 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.199
 in the car for him to say so 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.389
 hi lax cabin there is all that 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:09.240
 would let you in pickup 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.940
 if for the back 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.099
 car is everything here is much 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:18.120
 modest well firstly as you see i 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:21.870
 I am sitting by myself and already convenience here 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.180
 Of course no, since these are peaks and 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.550
 for it is already glass mixing 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.090
 here don't fall no way 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.410
 fold armrest is not here and 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.960
 note that the angle at which 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:37.830
 there is no back seat far no 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:40.620
 the most convenient and honestly in the far 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.289
 the trip I probably would not dare to go 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.870
 on this car although it probably isn't 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:48.150
 for this let's look in now 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.669
 the trunk is big and how many liters 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.830
 volume, we do not know exactly but seriously 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:55.050
 and at your disposal full 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.410
 cargo body length and width slightly 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:01.050
 more than one and a half meters the height of the boards 45 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:04.440
 centimeters to 800 5 kilograms of pure 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.620
 cargo in the back is not a question trailers maz and 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.880
 up to 2 and a half tons is also not a problem 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.490
 hi lax u handle such a burden 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.550
 quite capable by the way and strength 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:18.870
 under the hood we have a famous diesel 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:20.210
 toyotovsky d4d engine 2 and 5 metro 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.130
 turbocharged 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:26.130
 issuing 144 horsepower 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:29.070
 the figure is certainly small but more than 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.979
 enough no difficulty with 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.980
 dynamics we have not experienced 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:36.740
 the car is very accepting that it is going 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:39.020
 horns turbine picks up from low 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.630
 turns therefore in motion in principle 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.550
 everything is fine of course not a little 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.700
 enough insulation because here in 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.950
 cabin engine noise heard very 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.710
 clearly but this is probably the only one 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:54.350
 minus which we found as for 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.090
 fuel consumption then above 10 liters per 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.910
 a hundred he did not rise with us 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.450
 also normal after meeting with Toyota 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.090
 hi lax 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:04.180
 we can say it's transport 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.440
 vehicle-like vehicle 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:09.080
 patency and suspension frame 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.420
 SUV handling and expense 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.490
 fuel like a passenger car so we 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.350
 as a result, we have a Toyota Hi Lax 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.390
 surprisingly honest car 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.960
 impressive off-road package 

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:23.300
 fine engine weight comfortable 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.640
 gadgets in the cabin and in general in particular 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.710
 comfortable lounge this hi lax will 

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:31.160
 great helper for lovers 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:35.560
 hunting fishing and generally in general lovers 

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.560
 outdoor activities generally impressive
