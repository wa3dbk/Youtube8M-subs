just<00:03:10.400> couldn't<00:03:10.819> figure<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.150> out<00:03:11.470> you<00:03:12.470> pull<00:03:12.799> the

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:12.889 
just couldn't figure it out you pull the

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.080

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.199 

like<00:03:22.800> that<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:23.640> it's<00:03:23.850> going<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.030> close

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
like that and that it's going to close

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.970 
like that and that it's going to close
