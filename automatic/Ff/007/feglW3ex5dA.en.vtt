Hi everyone This is Phone president

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hmmmm(Sorry There was a water drop on the table)

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
(Retake) Hi everyone This is Phone president

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Today we are going to review the Galaxy S5 finger print function and show you hot to make a folder.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Thses were the features that I had hard time using. So I will help those of you who might buy galaxy S5.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Fisrt when I got the phone I followed the instructions and used it like this by swiping downwards.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The recognition success rate was really high.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I mean it just work every time.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
there is no failure.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Swiping is best for two handed operation. But you cannot use your phone with two hand all the time.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:08.000
When you are walking on the streets or have umbrella on your other hand and etc. there are situations where you cannot use the other hand.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Compare to Iphone 5S's finger print recognition.... um.... we don't have the 5S at the moment so we will use iphone 4 and imagine this is the 5S.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
On iphone 5S.... this  home button functions as finger print scanner.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The difference is that Iphone's scanner is touch type that you can unlock the lock screen by just pressing the home button.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:50.000
On the other hand... The Galaxy S5 is swipe type scanner. So in most cases you have to turn on the screen and swipe to unlock.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Currently I didn't save this finger so it's not working ... but....

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:08.000
When you cannot use the other hand it will be so anoying to unlock the phone.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So~ I had a question. "Is it possiple to use one hand on S5's fingerprint scanner?"

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
At first I tried with one hand and the reconition quality was awfully bad.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So here is what I discovered.... Well I wouldn't say discovered since it is such a simple concept...

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I would say it is my know how. -_-;

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Right now as you can see it unlocks like this with a natural motion. very easy to unlock and doesn't fail as much

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Now I will tell you how.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000
On the fingerprint settings you can add three finger print at the Max.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000
When you are adding those three fingers... Make sure to add the same finger three times.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And while doing that hold the phone a little bit higher than you normally would

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:15.000
After that on the second add, hold it like you normally would and last one little bit lower.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:28.000
If you do this the recognition rate with one hand is much higher than using just one angle three times or any other methods I've tried

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
For some of you it might be pretty obvious but it was a big discovery for me.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Now using one hand to unlock works so well.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Even when your hand position changes it works really well.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:59.000
For those of you who was thinking of not buying the phone because of swiping method this might help. Or vice versa.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Anyway If you set up like this it will be easier for you..

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Another thing that I thought it was hard... It was making a folder

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Far as I remember I used to hold on to the background like this and add folder menu was some where around here.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So I thought it may be upgraded to work like the IOS or other inovative launchers. I was wrong.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:49.000
In order to make a folder you have to hold on to the icon and drag to the top left corner(furthest from your hand) to where it says add folder.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Inconvineint as possible.... I don't know how they came up with this.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I've always thought that touch wiz interface(Samsung Phone interface) was really great except for the folder making method.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
They must have down graded user interface while upgrading all the hardware.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
ummmm.....

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:26.000
If there are anything else that you might want to know about the device or anything I find out while using this I will post a new video about it.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Have a Great day and Be well for the rest of your day. Thank you
