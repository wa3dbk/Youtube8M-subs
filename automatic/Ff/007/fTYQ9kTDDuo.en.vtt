00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.769

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.440
 concept 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.760

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.960
 musicals something 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.840

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.059

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.789

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.910
 is done and musicals 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.910

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.810
