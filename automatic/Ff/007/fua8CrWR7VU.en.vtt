00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.110
 hey fighters hello you on wunder channel 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.090
 and you again for Sasha aka Dicks we 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.400
 long ago promised to tell you how 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.500
 buy games together with a friend 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.340
 both male and female relatives 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.890
 female 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.680
 watch the video until the end is interesting 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.550
 So go start with just the basics and their 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.769
 only 4 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.390
 firstly you need a ford here all over 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.410
 it is clear if you are going to buy 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.119
 games for two 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.430
 so as for more of this 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.559
 impossible to do in principle rather how 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.690
 you can buy at least for the whole staircase or 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.820
 the whole village dividing the price tag is true here 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.739
 play the same game with a unique 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.379
 ID can not more than two 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.050
 man so limit ourselves to those 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.300
 two comrades in the second need trust 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.100
 yes yes without him nowhere and these words are not 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.100
 empty because you provide data 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.750
 your account bro and login and password 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.879
 and and with it the opportunity 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.460
 perform actions on your behalf as in 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.039
 psn so in history the same goes for 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.379
 and you your brother gives the data of his 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.799
 account and therefore without trust between 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.350
 you nowhere 3 access to accounts about it 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.150
 I said a little above the nose of the side of trust 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.880
 and now from a practical point of view 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.790
 you will have at least two accounts on ps 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.979
 and your friend well, and the fourth needed 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.900
 activate each of the accounts each 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.299
 friend here about this we'll talk now 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.330
 so first, first you need 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.960
 deactivate your console in your 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.990
 account as the main then we 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.479
 exit psn and create new 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.170
 user create user 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.579
 click exactly to create a new and 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.740
 accept all license terms 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.280

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.570
 click here further enter in general login 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.790
 and password from your buddy's account and 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.340
 click log on the network naturally now 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.950
 we will not do this and I will just 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.770
 I'll show you how it should be. 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.630
 network from your buddy's account and 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.409
 the main screen looks something like 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.499
 So 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.160
 then everything is pretty simple 

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:11.910
 activate 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.660
 on a friend's account your console as 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.459
 the main 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.269
 this is done as follows 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.720
 go to the construction site open playstation 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.790

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:26.250
 account management and beyond 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:30.150
 go to the point of choice to the point 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.530
 activation as the main ps4 system we 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.260
 We press the button to activate and in general 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.799
 expect further action from the console 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.569
 because at this time there is some 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:45.329
 the mechanism happens and the console 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.239
 activated on this account on this in 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.010

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.200
 console activated on friendâ€™s account 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.760
