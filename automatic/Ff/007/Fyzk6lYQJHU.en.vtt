00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.430
 the automation level of 52% frame concentrates 125 of the 130 thefts 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.430
 installed throughout the factory 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:14.329
 robberies perform tasks that require more precision and that are not 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:16.190
 favorable to human labor 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.190
 do not touch the ergonomics 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.090
 in the frame the vehicles are automatically transferred to the 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.009
 building of the painting 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.160
 the painting of the bet wins roth 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.950
 is one of the most modern and environmentally compatible 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.280
 operatively as water-based paints, which significantly reduces the impact of 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.150
 environmental 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.310
 the area has the same technology as the audi factory in ingolstadt germany 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.940
 and has the capacity to paint 25 coritiba before in turn 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.110
 The process begins with cleaning the bodywork and application of verified 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.110
 preparation for the first coat of paint 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.340
 the first layer is deposited in the car through an immersion bath 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.130
 controlled by electric currents 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.200
 such as the body attached to the negative pole and the tank and of sintra 20 students 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.469
 positive type 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:16.789
 attraction of electric currents after itatinga at Christmas 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.240
 the body follows for the application of a tac has respect 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.710
 made by four steals at the junctions of the minutes and in every part of the 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.310
 bodywork 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.820
 the purpose is to prevent water infiltration and to protect against damage caused by 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.600
 stones for example 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.570
 then 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.340
 the body goes through incitement for surface leveling 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.840
 a curious die 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.130
 before moving on to the next step 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.960
 The clean body of Buenos Aires had no litter. 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.659
 that there are no impurities 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.659
 and therefore do not compromise the quality of the body 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.450
 then apply the retail to surface pain 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.450
 with the next color was the vehicle's signal 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.340
 then 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.159
 the car is delivered the historical metallic or pearly part 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.059
 well with others 

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:09.149
 and the varnish 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.270
 wanted to tell 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.249
 which has the purpose of giving brightness 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:15.249
 and to protect the father's car and the ultraviolet 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.709
 it is in this area that the cars have their final configuration and are 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.709
 ready for distribution to dealers 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:28.779
 the process begins with the dismantling of the doors 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:31.819
 are mounted on a parallel line 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.109
 the car then receives the instrument panel which in the case of volkswagen and 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:36.580
 audi 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.849
 presents two new features 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.589
 the panel supplier 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:46.239
 is the only one installed inside the factory and provides a complete set 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.799
 formed by panel 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.429
 servo-brake cooling system air-conditioning this cut 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:56.569
 the only goal was to make the collage of the books 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.489
 another innovation of the plant compared to the other 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.010
 Volkswagen of Brazil 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.429
 is the drive unit assembly 

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:10.439
 which covers the entire lower part of the vehicle. 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.010
 front and back 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.580
 on its rear exhaust heat shield plates 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.299
 steering mechanism fuel tank and alternators 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.299
 form a single assembly for the union with the body 

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:27.599
 in the automobile industry 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.599
 this stage of assembly is called marriage 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:36.269
 the front of the vehicle is also received by the factory and motoboys 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.059
 formed by tactical block 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:41.139
 direction indicators 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.239
 radiators park protection ibarra luck 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:49.939
 then the vehicle goes to the filling station to combine 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.159
 where a single equipment supplies the power steering system 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.120
 cooling 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.120
 and the container for cleaning the windshield 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.309
 the following steps include assembling banknotes and doors 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:09.399
 volkswagen and audi also the first unit of volkswagen from brazil to 

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:13.399
 100% of the cars produced up to the seat in 

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:17.930
 the track circled with 400 meters 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.530
 reproduces the main types of floor that will be faced by 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.770
 consumers 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.680
 such as parallelepipeds 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.499
 troughs and water tanks 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:31.899
 The main objective is this guy noises in general besides evaluating the 

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:35.169
 suspension performance 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.499
 the high-speed track of a thousand and three hundred meters is destined 

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:42.499
 evaluation of wind noise 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.249
 among the criticisms is installed a modern center of analysis 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:51.120
 where technical assessments are carried out to ensure quality 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.569
 it was brown itself
