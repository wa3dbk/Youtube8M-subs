00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.270
 today we are going to prepare some fettuccine 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:27.590
 homemade in a bowl we are going to put the 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:30.500
 eggs the oil the two tablespoons of 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.930
 water and the teaspoon of salt now let's go 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.480
 to beat all the ingredients we are going to 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.180
 incorporate the flour little by little and 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.800
 we make a bun that later we will 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.720
 To knead the bun we are going to knead it 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.480
 approximately for 15 minutes we go 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.730
 to knead without adding flour unless 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.489
 that sticks in our hands or in the 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.520
 table we have to get it to have a 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.320
 homogeneous texture and a uniform color 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.350
 now let's wrap the dough in paper 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.680
 film and let's let it rest 30 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.380
 minutes in the refrigerator once the 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.470
 30 minutes we remove the dough and 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.600
 floured the table we placed the dough 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.300
 we passed some flour on top and 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.030
 we begin to stretch the dough should not 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.860
 Never stick or the stick or the table 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.080
 drawing process we will make 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.930
 always putting flour above and for 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.630
 under the mass we stretch the dough in 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.820
 we go over and turn it over and 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.280
 we flour again over 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.430
 continue to stretch this process we are going to 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.450
 Keep repeating until you stretch the dough 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.650
 approximately to about 2 millimeters of 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.200
 thickness 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.290
 Now let's double the mass from the 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.869
 edges towards the center then we go back to 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.660
 bend the mass towards the center and 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.610
 Last we fold the dough to close it 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.800
 to be able to take it to a table 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.840
 Floury let's cut the dough 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.930
 medium so that you do not get inside the 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.940
 table we undo the last fold and 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.070
 we fold the edges of the dough again 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.740
 again towards the center 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.420
 now let's cut the fetuccini to a 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.470
 measure of about 6 millimeters 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:13.370
 approximately once cut we pass 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.780
 the knife below this shape and 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.520
 we raise to form the fetuccini 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.760
 Now we can choose to cook them in the 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.940
 moment or do the process of aerated or 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.610
 fast drying of the pasta today we're going 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.049
 to cook directly but also 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.390
 let's show how the process is done 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:37.060
 of aerated or dried pasta 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.400
 To dry the pasta we can use for 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.260
 example the back of a chair a 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.270
 chair that has a horizontal rod 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.970
 of wood that is not very wide we will 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.459
 serve put the pasta on the rod 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.490
 in this way and let it dry 30 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.010
 minutes the difference between the mass 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.070
 aerated and not aerated is that the aerated 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.870
 It will be thinner and softer to the touch 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.180
 we can also have the inconvenience 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.400
 that is a little more brittle and the 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.980
 not varied will be a little thicker 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.959
 and meatier now we put to the fire a 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.770
 pot with water once 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.580
 boil we take a splash of oil 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.250
 we put the pasta to boil 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.920
 and we are going to cook it between 3 and 4 minutes 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.530
 once it breaks the boil once 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.050
 we can serve it or if we want it 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.940
 book the drained we went through a 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.490
 cold water and then putting 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.330
 in a bowl with ice water to cut 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.160
 the cooking 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.750
 then we drain it again and the 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.150
 We take to another bowl and add it 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.220
 oil so that it does not stick we take it 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.710
 to the fridge and we can use it to 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.020
 cook at another time in the moment 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.120
 that we want to cook it again only 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.700
 we will have to spend a minute for water 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.890
 boiling now the pasta is ready 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.410
 to eat and we can accompany it with the 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.150
 sauce that we want with this we take for 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.320
 finished the preparation of the 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.320
 homemade fettuccine
