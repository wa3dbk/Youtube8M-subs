still charging and you can see now how

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.290 
still charging and you can see now how

much for now and you can see more than

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.600 
much for now and you can see more than
20%<00:03:28.300> which<00:03:28.600> is<00:03:28.780> which<00:03:29.560> is<00:03:29.590> very<00:03:30.100> good<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:30.400> very

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
20% which is which is very good and very

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.009 
20% which is which is very good and very
fast<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:31.650> we<00:03:32.650> will<00:03:32.830> see<00:03:33.070> what<00:03:33.370> about<00:03:33.730> next<00:03:34.570> 10

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
fast and we will see what about next 10

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.750 
fast and we will see what about next 10
minutes<00:03:35.290> but<00:03:35.620> it<00:03:35.860> really<00:03:36.130> looks<00:03:36.250> like<00:03:36.610> that

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
minutes but it really looks like that

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.130 
minutes but it really looks like that
one<00:03:37.660> minute<00:03:38.050> 1%<00:03:39.390> after<00:03:40.390> it<00:03:40.510> will<00:03:40.660> be<00:03:40.810> 30

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
one minute 1% after it will be 30

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.750 
one minute 1% after it will be 30
minutes<00:03:41.410> then<00:03:42.220> I<00:03:42.459> will<00:03:42.700> make<00:03:43.470> bigger<00:03:44.760> bigger

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
minutes then I will make bigger bigger

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.000 
minutes then I will make bigger bigger
delay<00:03:46.300> and<00:03:46.600> we<00:03:46.989> will<00:03:47.140> see<00:03:47.380> on<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.620> tablet

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
delay and we will see on the tablet

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.330 
delay and we will see on the tablet
after<00:03:48.489> 1<00:03:48.820> hour<00:03:49.049> charging<00:03:50.049> then<00:03:50.530> I<00:03:50.860> will<00:03:51.040> check

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
after 1 hour charging then I will check

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.740 
after 1 hour charging then I will check
it<00:03:51.870> check<00:03:52.870> it<00:03:53.080> and<00:03:53.350> we<00:03:53.430> will<00:03:54.430> see<00:03:54.760> how<00:03:55.510> long

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
it check it and we will see how long

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.220 
it check it and we will see how long
does<00:03:56.049> it<00:03:56.110> take<00:03:56.500> until<00:03:57.040> charge<00:03:57.880> no<00:03:58.269> tablet<00:03:58.660> from

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
does it take until charge no tablet from

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
does it take until charge no tablet from
the<00:03:59.290> zero<00:03:59.680> to<00:04:00.330> 100%<00:04:01.330> so<00:04:02.019> that's<00:04:02.799> all<00:04:02.950> for<00:04:03.220> now

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
the zero to 100% so that's all for now

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.970 
the zero to 100% so that's all for now
and<00:04:03.670> see<00:04:04.330> you<00:04:04.360> later

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.760 

okay<00:04:08.980> we<00:04:09.520> are<00:04:09.550> back<00:04:09.940> after<00:04:10.240> next<00:04:10.870> to<00:04:11.110> meet<00:04:11.320> so

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
okay we are back after next to meet so

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.120 
okay we are back after next to meet so
it's<00:04:12.070> 30<00:04:12.400> minutes<00:04:12.850> or<00:04:13.060> half<00:04:13.930> an<00:04:14.080> hour<00:04:14.260> after

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
it's 30 minutes or half an hour after

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.790 
it's 30 minutes or half an hour after
start<00:04:15.610> charging<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.540> tablet<00:04:16.870> is<00:04:17.020> too

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:17.800 
start charging the tablet is too

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.430 
start charging the tablet is too
charging<00:04:18.400> and<00:04:18.790> you<00:04:19.120> can<00:04:19.360> see<00:04:19.570> that<00:04:19.720> it's

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
charging and you can see that it's

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.990 
charging and you can see that it's
faster<00:04:21.250> and<00:04:21.280> faster<00:04:21.580> now<00:04:23.070> 43%<00:04:24.070> and<00:04:24.370> it's<00:04:24.700> going

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
faster and faster now 43% and it's going

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.130 
faster and faster now 43% and it's going
really<00:04:25.390> fast<00:04:26.050> so<00:04:27.040> then<00:04:27.760> another<00:04:28.510> check<00:04:28.900> will

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
really fast so then another check will

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.060 
really fast so then another check will
be<00:04:29.400> after<00:04:30.400> another<00:04:30.820> half<00:04:31.690> an<00:04:31.870> hour<00:04:32.080> so<00:04:32.680> from

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
be after another half an hour so from

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.450 
be after another half an hour so from
the<00:04:33.280> one<00:04:33.730> complete<00:04:34.590> complete<00:04:35.590> hour<00:04:35.860> from<00:04:36.310> the

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
the one complete complete hour from the

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.970 
the one complete complete hour from the
start<00:04:36.760> of<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.360> charging<00:04:37.870> and<00:04:38.110> we<00:04:38.590> will<00:04:38.770> see

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
start of the charging and we will see

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.210 
start of the charging and we will see
how<00:04:39.220> much<00:04:39.400> percent<00:04:39.970> will<00:04:40.570> be<00:04:40.600> done<00:04:41.200> I<00:04:41.500> think

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
how much percent will be done I think

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.830 
how much percent will be done I think
that<00:04:42.400> it<00:04:42.580> can<00:04:42.760> be<00:04:42.970> about<00:04:44.070> 17%<00:04:45.070> and<00:04:45.670> then<00:04:46.330> I<00:04:46.540> will

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
that it can be about 17% and then I will

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.230 
that it can be about 17% and then I will
check<00:04:47.050> when<00:04:47.290> the<00:04:47.440> tablet<00:04:48.010> will<00:04:48.310> be<00:04:48.460> completely

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
check when the tablet will be completely

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.640 
check when the tablet will be completely
charged<00:04:50.080> so<00:04:50.350> 100%<00:04:51.330> percent<00:04:52.330> but<00:04:53.230> for<00:04:53.500> now

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
charged so 100% percent but for now

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.980 
charged so 100% percent but for now
after<00:04:54.420> half<00:04:55.420> an<00:04:55.630> hour

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
after half an hour

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:05.010 
after half an hour
there<00:04:56.470> is<00:04:56.970> 33%<00:04:57.970> charge<00:05:02.490> hi<00:05:03.490> we<00:05:04.060> are<00:05:04.090> back<00:05:04.240> after

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
there is 33% charge hi we are back after

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.160 
there is 33% charge hi we are back after
1<00:05:05.380> hour<00:05:05.410> charging<00:05:06.280> and<00:05:06.580> we<00:05:07.300> will<00:05:07.420> see<00:05:07.750> what

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
1 hour charging and we will see what

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.340 
1 hour charging and we will see what
about<00:05:08.590> what<00:05:09.550> about<00:05:09.580> battery<00:05:10.240> experience<00:05:11.020> with

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
about what about battery experience with

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.490 
about what about battery experience with
the<00:05:11.650> blood<00:05:11.830> compact<00:05:12.390> so<00:05:13.390> now<00:05:13.870> you<00:05:13.930> can<00:05:14.200> see

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
the blood compact so now you can see

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:21.120 
the blood compact so now you can see
it's<00:05:14.830> not<00:05:16.050> 70%<00:05:17.050> but<00:05:17.350> it's<00:05:18.150> 66%<00:05:19.150> so<00:05:19.870> for<00:05:20.170> now<00:05:20.380> for

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
it's not 70% but it's 66% so for now for

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.770 
it's not 70% but it's 66% so for now for
now<00:05:21.190> I<00:05:21.670> will<00:05:22.480> stop<00:05:23.250> make<00:05:24.250> another<00:05:24.670> part<00:05:25.030> after

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
now I will stop make another part after

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.880 
now I will stop make another part after
some<00:05:26.440> kind<00:05:26.770> -<00:05:27.670> but<00:05:28.330> I<00:05:28.630> will<00:05:28.810> wait<00:05:29.050> until<00:05:29.440> the

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
some kind - but I will wait until the

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:35.850 
some kind - but I will wait until the
battery<00:05:30.310> to<00:05:30.670> charge<00:05:30.700> on<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:31.510> one<00:05:33.960> 100%<00:05:34.960> and

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
battery to charge on the one 100% and

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.990 
battery to charge on the one 100% and
then<00:05:36.280> I<00:05:36.430> will<00:05:36.640> check<00:05:36.910> how<00:05:37.450> long<00:05:37.750> does<00:05:38.170> it<00:05:38.230> take

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
then I will check how long does it take

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.830 
then I will check how long does it take
with<00:05:40.000> this<00:05:40.240> quick<00:05:41.050> charge<00:05:41.620> from<00:05:42.220> Sony<00:05:42.520> company

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
with this quick charge from Sony company

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.600 
with this quick charge from Sony company
which<00:05:43.840> support<00:05:44.620> welcome<00:05:45.310> quick<00:05:45.670> charge<00:05:46.500> 2.0

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
which support welcome quick charge 2.0

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.380 
which support welcome quick charge 2.0
so<00:05:48.610> after<00:05:49.150> 1<00:05:49.300> hour<00:05:49.590> 66<00:05:50.590> on<00:05:50.920> maybe<00:05:51.340> you<00:05:51.490> can<00:05:51.640> you

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
so after 1 hour 66 on maybe you can you

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.300 
so after 1 hour 66 on maybe you can you
can<00:05:52.600> see<00:05:53.880> 67%<00:05:54.880> and<00:05:55.270> I<00:05:55.540> think<00:05:56.320> that<00:05:56.620> half<00:05:57.100> an

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
can see 67% and I think that half an

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:04.700 
can see 67% and I think that half an
hour<00:05:57.520> and<00:05:57.850> it<00:05:58.030> will<00:05:58.240> be<00:05:58.450> charged<00:05:59.260> on<00:05:59.440> the<00:06:00.660> 100%

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.040 

okay<00:06:05.710> so<00:06:06.189> we<00:06:06.550> are<00:06:06.580> back<00:06:06.759> in<00:06:07.389> the<00:06:07.569> finish<00:06:07.899> of

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:09.969 
this video you can see that there is

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:14.070 
this video you can see that there is
still<00:06:10.240> no<00:06:11.249> 100%<00:06:12.249> but<00:06:12.849> it<00:06:13.089> is<00:06:13.240> for<00:06:13.629> now<00:06:13.809> very

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
still no 100% but it is for now very

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.369 
still no 100% but it is for now very
tinny<00:06:14.439> on<00:06:14.830> to<00:06:15.069> the<00:06:15.339> sony<00:06:15.969> xperia<00:06:16.089> z3<00:06:16.929> compact

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:17.379 
tinny on to the sony xperia z3 compact

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:22.079 
tinny on to the sony xperia z3 compact
tablet<00:06:18.189> compact<00:06:18.399> will<00:06:19.209> be<00:06:19.419> 100<00:06:20.229> charge<00:06:21.039> so<00:06:21.639> you

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:22.089 
tablet compact will be 100 charge so you

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:26.790 
tablet compact will be 100 charge so you
can<00:06:22.300> see<00:06:22.509> that<00:06:22.659> take<00:06:23.139> about<00:06:23.550> 2<00:06:24.580> encorte<00:06:25.800> hour

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
can see that take about 2 encorte hour

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.239 
can see that take about 2 encorte hour
but<00:06:27.550> what<00:06:27.729> is<00:06:27.849> important<00:06:28.419> the<00:06:28.959> last<00:06:29.199> 10%<00:06:29.649> is

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:30.249 
but what is important the last 10% is

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:34.369 
but what is important the last 10% is
very<00:06:30.699> slow<00:06:31.089> because<00:06:31.779> the<00:06:32.499> tablet<00:06:32.919> was<00:06:33.129> on<00:06:33.369> 90%

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:34.379 
very slow because the tablet was on 90%

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:38.489 
very slow because the tablet was on 90%
in<00:06:35.379> about<00:06:35.800> half<00:06:36.249> an<00:06:36.459> hour<00:06:36.639> in<00:06:37.059> about<00:06:37.499> 90

00:06:38.489 --> 00:06:38.499 
in about half an hour in about 90

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:41.249 
in about half an hour in about 90
minutes<00:06:38.529> so<00:06:39.430> that's<00:06:39.699> the<00:06:40.089> most<00:06:40.629> important

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:41.259 
minutes so that's the most important

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:45.570 
minutes so that's the most important
number<00:06:41.830> for<00:06:41.860> me<00:06:42.249> because<00:06:43.240> not<00:06:43.509> every<00:06:43.839> time<00:06:44.580> we

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
number for me because not every time we

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.570 
number for me because not every time we
are<00:06:45.759> charging<00:06:46.149> to<00:06:46.899> 100<00:06:47.469> percent<00:06:48.009> 90<00:06:48.550> percent

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580 
are charging to 100 percent 90 percent

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.920 
are charging to 100 percent 90 percent
is<00:06:49.300> enough<00:06:50.219> for<00:06:51.219> me<00:06:51.520> and<00:06:51.759> I<00:06:52.419> think<00:06:52.479> that<00:06:52.809> it

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:52.930 
is enough for me and I think that it

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.829 
is enough for me and I think that it
will<00:06:53.080> be<00:06:53.319> enough<00:06:53.770> for<00:06:53.800> you<00:06:54.249> it's<00:06:54.759> it's<00:06:55.360> normal

00:06:55.829 --> 00:06:55.839 
will be enough for you it's it's normal

00:06:55.839 --> 00:07:01.949 
will be enough for you it's it's normal
its<00:06:56.050> typical<00:06:56.379> and<00:06:57.659> the<00:06:58.659> rest<00:06:59.319> %<00:07:00.069> to<00:07:00.610> 100<00:07:01.389> is

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:01.959 
its typical and the rest % to 100 is

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:05.459 
its typical and the rest % to 100 is
very<00:07:02.259> slow<00:07:02.619> but<00:07:02.949> as<00:07:03.939> I<00:07:04.089> said<00:07:04.149> it's<00:07:04.929> not<00:07:05.080> no

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:05.469 
very slow but as I said it's not no

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:08.459 
very slow but as I said it's not no
problem<00:07:05.679> for<00:07:06.069> me<00:07:06.309> and<00:07:06.519> Sony<00:07:07.240> quick<00:07:07.599> charger<00:07:08.110> is
