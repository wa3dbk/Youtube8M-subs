00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.949
 hello to all of you adopted and this is the first 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.810
 Part of the mini guides on the battlefield 4 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:21.359
 if your plane is subspecific and you need 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.359
 rush you can crash into 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.519
 tree after which your plane of course 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.330
 stops and you can safely 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.430
 repair as much as you like and of course 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.680
 same if you manage to soar you 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.129
 can fly and bend the whole server 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.350
 Further on the map, the alien signal can be 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.600
 gain significant advantage in 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.789
 the start of the round is the fastest 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.149
 climbing into a sniper position on 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.350
 of this tower and so after you 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.750
 climbed up 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.270
 you can stay here or 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.270
 continue your way straight to the center 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.000
 maps from this position you will see 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.539
 almost the entire map except 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.549
 you can't shoot through a plate 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:08.189
 if suddenly you got cold on the cards 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.400
 operations are locked up you can well 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.380
 warm up in this passage 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.770
 not only do you warm up 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.900
 a couple of enemies but be careful if 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.030
 you play hardcore fry not 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.460
 only enemies but also your allies 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.710
 as you know on this map very much 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.979
 doors that can be closed 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.560
 we don't need you to run all the time 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.159
 look for the weekend all you need 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.710
 make it find red 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.280
 flashing switches just shoot 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.189
 according to him 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.069
 the doors magically opens and you 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.530
 can run further 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.659
 90 percent of players run straight 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.060
 through the turnstile here giving the most 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.929
 separation position is noted on his 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.020
 minimap 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:57.049
 so that this does not happen to you only 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.890
 need to jump to jump between these 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.439
 turnstile 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.450
 also on the operation map in the ban can 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:07.479
 get on any of the 2 balconies you 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.829
 climbing there you get 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.120
 awesome advantages over yours 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:17.060
 enemies for example in oblique flight mode 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.510
 extermination as the bomb appears 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.840
 right in the center of the map where you own 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.260
 are another bonus is 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.379
 what led here is not shooting through it 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.290
 gives you extra protection also 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:36.140
 possible to climb up to the balcony below 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.690
 carp plant has two roofs on which 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.060
 often sit sniper and they all close 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.389
 a hatch so get to them 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.549
 almost impossible but there is a simple 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:47.000
 way to open it all you need 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.569
 to make 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.889
 jump on the railing and in the jump press 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.810
 action button hatch opens and all 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:58.669
 what you have to do is climb 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.709
 cut the cherished tokens 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:04.639
 do not forget to subscribe to the channel 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:08.090
 put your thumbs up and shoot down 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:11.180
 small helicopter and down hope my 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.669
 guide you at least something helped further 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.329
 everything will be much more interesting fun and 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:16.329
 by disease
