00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.920
 or the readers and readers of hair and 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.740
 herbs today I want to talk to you 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.279
 of this mask of the Jewish brand 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:22.120
 Brazil in its variety of passion fruit and 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:24.730
 copaiba that is for mixed hair 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.790
 well I tell you about this mask is 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.300
 vegan does not contain silicones does not contain 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:34.450
 parallel and it's also corny free so 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:39.340
 it's a super good point for people 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:42.370
 who like to use products that 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.220
 Do not be in animals before leaving 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.160
 talked about the speech shampoo and the 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.830
 gossip nador that is let's say the 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.170
 partner of this mask I will leave 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.850
 the links in the information box but 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.540
 good at the time those products I 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.880
 they liked a lot 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.930
 super good and now that I have the 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.290
 opportunity to tell you about this 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.930
 mask I have nothing but praise for 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.970
 I tell you that to be for hair 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.540
 mixed 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.650
 does not leave hair heavy but leaves it 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.340
 as super light 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.860
 super moisturized very soft indeed i 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.590
 I use line today I had to do the 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.230
 deep cleaning wash and then 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.450
 apply this mask for some 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.690
 minutes here says that you should leave 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.720
 act about 15 minutes 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.960
 well I let her act much longer 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.180
 and I like to use it with heat I notice that their 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.120
 benefits are much better 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.430
 applying it with heat that without it I have 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.229
 used as a conditioner also with 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.510
 good results but I think the 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.700
 maximum potential of this mask is 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.490
 get when using it with either a 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.830
 thermal cap or warm towel 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.119
 you can put your head though the 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.050
 system they want it to work for 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.300
 provide heat 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.410
 good within its components are 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.300
 mentioned maracuyÃ¡ copa and also 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.740
 Rosemary oil 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.460
 I'll explain a little 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:17.050
 properties of each of them 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:19.030
 and rosemary oil is antioxidant 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.980
 which will help keep the fiber 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.819
 capillary 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:27.340
 at 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:31.390
 passion fruit helps regulate obesity 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.819
 and good the fruit of glass is apt like a 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.260
 astringent is also why this 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.330
 Mask is recommended for 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.090
 people who may have leather 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.700
 Oily scalp and very dry ends 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.099
 I have normal scalp but 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.750
 if I have the tips dry and good as 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.550
 they have already learned through the 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.680
 same blog post 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:55.260
 them colored in my dye tips 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.490
 those of a color between purple and fuchsia and 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.410
 although good is so different 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.380
 because my hair was lying in layers 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.090
 believe me that being red 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.420
 obviously I also did almost this 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.720
 Mask can be completely 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.630
 really the hair is super soft 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.860
 and I hope you can appreciate more or less 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.750
 how is the texture that delivers but the 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.390
 product that I have very very 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.940
 happy I recommend them totally 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.610
 and you can find this product 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.700
 at the yumbo supermarket I know he has 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.140
 an approximate value of 5 thousand pesos more or 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.040
 minus that is like the average value of 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.040
 the products would be brazil 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.069
