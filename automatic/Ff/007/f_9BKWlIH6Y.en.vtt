00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
covers most importantly of all I think

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.069 
covers most importantly of all I think
for<00:00:55.820> me<00:00:55.970> anyway<00:00:56.390> for<00:00:56.540> a<00:00:56.570> player<00:00:56.750> like<00:00:56.870> myself

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
for me anyway for a player like myself

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.380 
for me anyway for a player like myself
is<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:58.040> amount<00:00:58.250> of<00:00:58.309> control<00:00:58.790> you<00:00:58.940> can<00:00:59.120> get

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
is the amount of control you can get

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.180 
is the amount of control you can get
over<00:00:59.750> the<00:00:59.840> instrument<00:01:00.230> fret<00:01:00.920> thing<00:01:01.070> I've

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
over the instrument fret thing I've

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
included a very coil control which takes

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.770 
included a very coil control which takes
a<00:01:04.070> full<00:01:04.190> humbucker<00:01:04.610> as<00:01:04.880> we<00:01:05.270> all<00:01:05.360> know<00:01:05.479> a<00:01:05.509> love
