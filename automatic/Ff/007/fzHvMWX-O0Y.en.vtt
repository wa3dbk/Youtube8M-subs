00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.300
 hi Guys 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:42.500
 and these good approaches but none 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.170
 conditions to the fodder resp 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.600
 Water will be available to every case 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.280
 score points and we should always look out for 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.410
 all possibilities 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.410
 the hurdles in iran speak a lot of fun 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.300
 First of all, to say campus in 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.570
 labyrinthine the group the labyrinth 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.040
 Fischer has a special breathing organ 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.200
 whichever possible atmospheric 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.750
 to absorb air 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.000
 that means they have to go to the 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.830
 water surface and swim there with 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.570
 the over the mouth, so to speak 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.100
 to absorb atmospheric air 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.630
 it may sound a bit like that 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.580
 strange but if the fish is not 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.540
 He can access the water surface 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.540
 actually suffocate 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.580
 that is why logically one 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.860
 oxygen supply in the water is not 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.200
 necessary and also providers mostly 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.659
 superfluous drop a straw one 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.909
 flow is good for the fight 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.640
 Not at all, because we're talking about nature 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.680
 are not used to a strong 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.180
 flow to swim also the train 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.930
 mold with those very very big ones 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.520
 fins never hold out on the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.049
 all the time against a strong one 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.330
 flow because I like that 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.259
 fins recommend that to the fish 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.259
 make swimming difficult 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.969
 typical interviews male tie 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.750
 Revier and want these excited me 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.390
 downturn 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.569
 if you got a huge one for now 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.610
 a hard with huge fins in 50 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.989
 or 100 liters of experience is there as well 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.200
 another flow through the filter 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:20.440
 that is yes and he wants that then 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.660
 swim down the whole territory and come 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.310
 not because his because his 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.340
 bottle him they just do not stop 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.260
 he has enough power for him 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.260
 despair because that's too much at once 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.760
 for me he can not be in the field 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.500
 he has to face permanently 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.910
 a current is swimming the experience 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.620
 is then much too big, above all 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.870
 if then other fish are there 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.030
 we actually have in his paper 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.459
 Want it is a gall for the fight 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.360
 So more or less a qual 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.220
 and he will probably become too 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.739
 and really doubt it 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.569
 That's why I would say with over 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.379
 120 liters aquarium and hold yours 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.379
 fight alone 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.209
 There are many different ones 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.640
 breeding forms yes that affects the fins 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.890
 drive as well as the colors 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.090
 you should at the bottle-shaped front 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.760
 watch everything 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.480
 So for Kampusch with short fins 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.340
 is that in any case that the 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.500
 Definitely more joyful than 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.090
 publisher with long fins as well 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.909
 hold this butterfly 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.970
 dumbo here who has just very 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:31.879
 long very long bottles in total 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.390
 and the stars next to already swim 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:37.549
 and suppose he wants to do it daily now 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.450
 a 50 liter clear where a current 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:43.250
 can take by that would be yes one 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.349
 could almost be deadly for going 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.590
 That's why we hold such a fight 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:51.489
 rather to 10 to 20 liters without any 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.489
 water movement 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.190
 that here this would be from the fin 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.420
 shape a bread divide by the color 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.410
 nothing special 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.510
 For each of these you can see this 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.440
 is a poster poster has called up 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.240
 because he has such short bottles so one 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.570
 nature, the nature and format it once 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:23.860
 short fins and me so gray gray 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:26.170
 reddish not to one of my 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:31.120
 skin or fish can feed so 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:33.970
 with integrated or cards because though 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.930
 the non-combatants are still squeezing them 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.980
 For this reason, it has substances with and 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.390
 She wants that in the long run 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.820
 do not pick it up 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.139
 there are special ones 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.070
 that can 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.360
 the nose away 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:55.180
 that can 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:58.180
 Of course, you also need everything 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.180
 black 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.850
 become 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.610
 not because of me 

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:10.850
 if not much then 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.240
 minister last week 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:20.740
 Worsens the water quality 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:20.740
 besides, to promise the whole thing 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.290
 the first time not nice and 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:30.610
 second , make this too 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:35.950
 in the fish silver and one 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:37.870
 varied diet to month 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.420
 Almost to the socialization so completely 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.060
 in principle, that applies to campus munich 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.680
 you have to have them alone or before 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.330
 all battles male in aquaria 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.460
 to throw scrolls worst thing you can do 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.810
 can do because this fighting girl 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.500
 especially the weaker none 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.060
 has a possibility to escape 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.810
 yes then everyone will fight on life 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:00.000
 and death therefore leads fight girls 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:09.180
 never stick together 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:11.210
 a group of 15 actually especially 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.990
 fish male with other species of fish 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.740
 Companies may find it hot 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.900
 controversial 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.050
 I would rather guess then 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.930
 came from home from alone in 20 liters 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.890
 aquarium and that it can be there then 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.890
 actually not much wrong 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.130
 Naturally
