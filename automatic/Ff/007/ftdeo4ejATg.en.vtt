00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:09.389
 so here I just applied so 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.889
 the two mixture there on my hair so 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.380
 on both parts I will finish the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.529
 second part so well before j 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.699
 applies and therefore monodoses also everywhere 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.480
 on my hair so now I'm going 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.650
 apply the film and I will leave 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.029
 ask all night 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.410
 so it smells very very strong there is my 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.710
 bathroom that is impregnated with 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.189
 the smell 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.110
 so I advise to open the windows 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.710
 if you are lucky enough to have some 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.420
 your bathroom so I'll you 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.980
 showed how to travel but the film 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:48.800
 is good I think everyone but 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.800
 in the same way I do it like that 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:01.260
 they had decreased this video on 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:04.220
 has a cost head and like from 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:23.130
 chance is the end so it's over 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:26.310
 that's what I see more 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.333
 customs papers they bought 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.463
 in a professional special store 

00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:32.463
 [Music] 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.720
 to undermine natron well all night long 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.600
 here 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.570
 it tells me right now I have some 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.880
 itchy jeans the scalp do not know 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.440
 not what happens the assaults with the 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.550
 what I put there was accentuated 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.030
 I think it's because it's 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:23.480
 effect too but it scrapes me all 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:26.060

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.100
