00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
okay hi everybody we're here at John

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.670 
okay hi everybody we're here at John
Sanders<00:00:02.909> auto<00:00:03.090> repair<00:00:03.419> and<00:00:03.629> today<00:00:04.350> we<00:00:04.500> have<00:00:04.650> a

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
Sanders auto repair and today we have a

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.369 
Sanders auto repair and today we have a
drivability<00:00:05.310> issue<00:00:05.460> with<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:05.970> 2004<00:00:06.779> chevy<00:00:07.140> 12

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.419 
thousand miles on it 4.2 liter engines
and<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.200> we<00:00:13.320> take<00:00:13.440> up<00:00:13.559> for<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.740> test<00:00:13.950> drive<00:00:14.040> and

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
and so we take up for a test drive and

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.760 
and so we take up for a test drive and
we<00:00:14.519> found<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:14.940> had<00:00:15.120> some<00:00:15.389> misfire<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:16.410> wasn't

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
we found it had some misfire it wasn't

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.980 
we found it had some misfire it wasn't
running<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:17.190> good<00:00:17.400> for<00:00:17.699> my<00:00:17.820> 20<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.300> 35<00:00:18.720> miles

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
running that good for my 20 to 35 miles

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.769 
running that good for my 20 to 35 miles
an<00:00:19.109> hour<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:20.160> on<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.369> spark<00:00:20.640> plug<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.180> we're

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
an hour and on the spark plug and we're

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.480 
an hour and on the spark plug and we're
try<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.080> show<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.289> even<00:00:22.920> if<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.100> spark<00:00:23.340> plug

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
try and show you even if the spark plug

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.670 
try and show you even if the spark plug
a<00:00:23.519> little<00:00:23.760> bit<00:00:23.850> there<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:25.199> want<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.590> to

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
a little bit there and I want you to

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.109 
a little bit there and I want you to
look<00:00:25.800> at<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.039> part<00:00:26.279> where<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.640> spark<00:00:26.910> plug

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
look at the part where the spark plug

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.370 
look at the part where the spark plug
meets<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.630> threads<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:29.160> see<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.580> brown

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
meets the threads and you see this brown

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.670 
meets the threads and you see this brown
how<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.560> fits<00:00:31.800> there<00:00:33.140> is<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.350> supposed<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.620> be

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
how it fits there is that supposed to be

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.110 
how it fits there is that supposed to be
like<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.130> that's<00:00:35.399> just<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.760> should<00:00:36.000> be

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
like that that's just that should be

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.810 
like that that's just that should be
just<00:00:36.989> nice<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.500> nice<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:37.860> white<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.520> all<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
just nice and nice and white the all the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.190 
just nice and nice and white the all the
way<00:00:38.940> down<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> tip<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.840> electrode

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
way down to the tip of the electrode

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.819 
way down to the tip of the electrode
there<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:41.000> then<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.809> all<00:00:43.020> black<00:00:43.350> around<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
there and then it's all black around the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.430 
there and then it's all black around the
edges<00:00:44.190> here<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.629> should<00:00:45.629> be<00:00:45.750> more<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.140> tan

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
edges here that should be more of a tan

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.790 
edges here that should be more of a tan
color<00:00:47.180> so<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.329> vehicles<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.780> GM<00:00:49.170> product<00:00:49.649> it

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
color so this vehicles a GM product it

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.560 
color so this vehicles a GM product it
really<00:00:50.039> should<00:00:50.280> have<00:00:50.840> an<00:00:51.840> AC<00:00:52.440> Delco<00:00:53.010> AC<00:00:53.969> Delco

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
really should have an AC Delco AC Delco

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.590 
really should have an AC Delco AC Delco
spark<00:00:55.230> plug<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.610> one<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> things<00:00:57.510> we

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
spark plug in it so one of the things we

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.270 
spark plug in it so one of the things we
check<00:00:57.809> for<00:00:57.840> drivability<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:59.070> feel

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
check for drivability is to feel

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.970 
check for drivability is to feel
pressure<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.570> particular<00:01:00.840> vehicle<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
pressure in this particular vehicle the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.439 
pressure in this particular vehicle the
fill<00:01:02.250> filters<00:01:02.579> underneath<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> cork<00:01:03.270> by<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
fill filters underneath the cork by the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.780 
fill filters underneath the cork by the
tank<00:01:03.780> there's<00:01:04.559> also<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.920> connection<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.519> hookup

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
tank there's also a connection to hookup

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.539 
tank there's also a connection to hookup
to<00:01:05.820> do<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.600> fill<00:01:06.810> pressure

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
to do to fill pressure

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.649 
to do to fill pressure
so<00:01:08.549> we'll<00:01:08.700> hit<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.030> reading<00:01:09.299> on<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.479> page

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
so we'll hit the reading on the page

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.320 
so we'll hit the reading on the page
here<00:01:09.900> when<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.080> turn<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> key<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.330> we're

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
here when I turn the key on and we're

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.830 
here when I turn the key on and we're
supposed<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.570> have<00:01:13.189> 52<00:01:14.189> 57<00:01:14.670> psi<00:01:15.270> with<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.630> key

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
supposed to have 52 57 psi with the key

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.570 
supposed to have 52 57 psi with the key
on<00:01:15.869> engine<00:01:16.259> off

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.890 

so<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:23.790> look<00:01:23.910> at<00:01:24.030> our<00:01:24.150> gauge<00:01:24.360> down<00:01:24.630> here

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
so if we look at our gauge down here

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.840 
so if we look at our gauge down here
come<00:01:25.260> on<00:01:25.320> down<00:01:26.180> we<00:01:27.180> have<00:01:27.420> 54<00:01:28.110> psi<00:01:28.740> with<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.550> key

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
come on down we have 54 psi with the key

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.450 
come on down we have 54 psi with the key
on<00:01:30.030> engine<00:01:30.300> off<00:01:30.590> so<00:01:31.590> we<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:31.920> good<00:01:32.160> field

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
on engine off so we have good field

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.820 
on engine off so we have good field
pressure<00:01:32.760> and<00:01:33.320> then<00:01:34.320> when<00:01:34.440> the<00:01:34.530> engine<00:01:34.770> is

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
pressure and then when the engine is

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.760 
pressure and then when the engine is
running<00:01:34.860> we<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.310> 62<00:01:35.850> psi<00:01:36.510> I<00:01:36.840> can't<00:01:37.530> start<00:01:37.680> it

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
running we have 62 psi I can't start it

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.900 
running we have 62 psi I can't start it
for<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.010> right<00:01:38.130> now<00:01:38.280> because<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.700> have<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
for you right now because I have the

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.600 
for you right now because I have the
spark<00:01:39.150> plug<00:01:39.330> out<00:01:39.480> another<00:01:40.440> test<00:01:40.740> we<00:01:40.860> did<00:01:41.070> you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
spark plug out another test we did you

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.910 
spark plug out another test we did you
come<00:01:41.820> back<00:01:41.910> to<00:01:42.060> me<00:01:42.180> another<00:01:43.050> test<00:01:43.320> we<00:01:43.470> did<00:01:43.650> is

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
come back to me another test we did is

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.070 
come back to me another test we did is
we<00:01:44.460> ran<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.910> with<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.330> engine<00:01:45.450> running<00:01:45.600> and

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
we ran it with the engine running and

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.260 
we ran it with the engine running and
then<00:01:46.770> we<00:01:46.890> released<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.460> fuel<00:01:47.670> pressure<00:01:47.850> here

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
then we released the fuel pressure here

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.170 
then we released the fuel pressure here
to<00:01:48.960> see<00:01:49.140> how<00:01:49.230> much<00:01:49.380> fuel<00:01:49.620> value<00:01:49.920> we<00:01:50.190> have<00:01:50.220> and

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
to see how much fuel value we have and

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.820 
to see how much fuel value we have and
we<00:01:51.300> had<00:01:51.450> plenty<00:01:51.690> of<00:01:51.840> field<00:01:52.140> volume<00:01:52.500> into<00:01:52.710> the

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
we had plenty of field volume into the

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.790 
we had plenty of field volume into the
can<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.370> we<00:01:53.820> had<00:01:53.970> no<00:01:54.150> rpm<00:01:54.690> drop<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.590> we<00:01:55.680> know

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
can and we had no rpm drop so we know

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.040 
can and we had no rpm drop so we know
that<00:01:55.830> was<00:01:56.160> working<00:01:56.460> good

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
that was working good

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.570 
that was working good
youngin<00:01:58.050> up<00:01:58.170> all<00:01:58.410> we<00:01:58.620> had<00:01:58.860> was<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.310> long

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
youngin up all we had was on the long

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.120 
youngin up all we had was on the long
term<00:01:59.850> fuel<00:02:00.180> trim<00:02:00.450> should<00:02:01.290> be<00:02:01.410> zero<00:02:01.740> plus<00:02:02.040> or

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
term fuel trim should be zero plus or

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.730 
term fuel trim should be zero plus or
minus<00:02:02.400> two<00:02:02.580> or<00:02:02.700> three<00:02:02.910> and<00:02:03.690> we<00:02:03.810> have<00:02:03.840> minus

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
minus two or three and we have minus

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.730 
minus two or three and we have minus
nine<00:02:04.980> percent<00:02:05.580> at<00:02:06.030> idle<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:07.170> we<00:02:07.290> have<00:02:07.410> minus

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
nine percent at idle and we have minus

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.300 
nine percent at idle and we have minus
five<00:02:07.979> percent<00:02:08.220> at<00:02:08.910> 2500<00:02:09.720> rpm<00:02:09.920> so<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.010> vehicle

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
five percent at 2500 rpm so the vehicle

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.640 
five percent at 2500 rpm so the vehicle
is<00:02:11.370> going<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.670> little<00:02:11.790> bit<00:02:11.910> rich<00:02:12.500> one<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.590> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
is going a little bit rich one of the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.350 
is going a little bit rich one of the
things<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:13.980> we'll<00:02:14.100> do<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.670> carbon

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
things that we'll do that is carbon

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.980 
things that we'll do that is carbon
buildup

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
buildup

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.200 
buildup
so<00:02:16.710> I<00:02:16.740> don't<00:02:16.950> see<00:02:17.190> any<00:02:17.220> carbon<00:02:17.640> buildup<00:02:17.880> on<00:02:18.030> top

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
so I don't see any carbon buildup on top

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.210 
so I don't see any carbon buildup on top
of<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.450> Pistons<00:02:18.900> when<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.650> took<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.950> spark

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
of the Pistons when I took the spark

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.340 
of the Pistons when I took the spark
plug<00:02:20.400> out<00:02:20.630> that<00:02:21.630> doesn't<00:02:21.900> mean<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.080> back<00:02:22.230> of

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
plug out that doesn't mean the back of

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.630 
plug out that doesn't mean the back of
the<00:02:22.440> intake<00:02:22.740> valve<00:02:22.950> doesn't<00:02:23.130> have<00:02:23.340> carbon

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
the intake valve doesn't have carbon

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.370 
the intake valve doesn't have carbon
buildup<00:02:23.880> though<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:24.870> we're<00:02:24.989> going<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.140> do<00:02:25.230> one

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
buildup though so we're going to do one

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.199 
buildup though so we're going to do one
of<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.560> BG<00:02:25.950> fil<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.340> dub<00:02:26.400> same<00:02:26.670> feelings<00:02:27.060> on

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
of the BG fil and dub same feelings on

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.210 
of the BG fil and dub same feelings on
it<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.600> see<00:02:28.200> if<00:02:28.290> we<00:02:28.380> can<00:02:28.500> bring<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.739> fuel<00:02:29.010> trim

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
it and see if we can bring the fuel trim

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.430 
it and see if we can bring the fuel trim
some<00:02:29.400> more<00:02:29.550> back<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.940> normal<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.930> then<00:02:31.290> we'll

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
some more back to normal and then we'll

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.110 
some more back to normal and then we'll
keep<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.709> posted<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:32.190> I'll<00:02:32.280> follow<00:02:32.459> up<00:02:32.610> how

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
keep you posted and I'll follow up how

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.940 
keep you posted and I'll follow up how
that<00:02:33.150> works<00:02:33.480> out<00:02:33.660> when<00:02:33.780> we're<00:02:33.930> done<00:02:34.080> thank<00:02:34.860> you

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
that works out when we're done thank you

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.730 
that works out when we're done thank you
very<00:02:35.100> much<00:02:35.310> have<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.580> nice<00:02:35.670> day
