00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.480
 we mark a first failure for the bottom and the two sides 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.950
 girls have to be soft so they do not leave marks on the right of the 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:07.750
 people 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.260
 observe that the box is placed so that the fault remains seated 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.920
 the famous patterns for the short sides taking care of centering the root 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.560
 you have to provide a margin at the top 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.580
 later we will cut these cloths by the drawn lines 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.120
 yes I know we spend little talk such because it will be very clean and the ports 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.120
 because the white tail was castrated the tours of the tissue 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.740
 This technique is applied whenever the edge of a cloth will pay attention and without 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.080
 hems as it is in this case 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.080
 then we will see 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.800
 and very important the cut can only be done when the pola is totally 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.800
 dry 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.460
 we separated the first diaper is that covered the bottom and long sides 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.170
 for the moment we leave margins of 4 5 centimeters 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.770
 the cut to the final size will only be done after checking that there is no 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.770
 errors in the pattern 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.590
 remove in this way 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.040
 entering a few centimeters inside 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.310
 we make sure that factor girls also draw the lady yes 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.570
 we cut the left over leaving only half a centimeter to row 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:43.529
 we started the upholstery by the bottom of the box 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:47.969
 the layer of cola has to be uniform and not very culÃ©s 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:58.119
 you have to work with a certain speed to not allow time for the queue to 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:00.629
 dry cell that is absorbed by the wood 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.629
 I think it is essential to place the fabric many fishing tasks 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:19.579
 We present to mess with the line of the pattern coinciding with the fat 

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:28.619
 from this side we adapt it to the wood and mining the photos 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:34.619
 we can do it respecting the palm of the hand with a clean cloth 

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:36.599
 between the election of the queen 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.259
 in the butchers masses for a print you can often work at 

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:41.539
 width throughout 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:44.539
 never on Sunday since the fabric was reported yesterday 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:52.469
 on the side we fix the upholstery with the same technique 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:55.469
 they had improved a report 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:12.589
 we go over and over again for it in arrasate 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:15.239
 the fabric can be lifted my house cholesterol state
