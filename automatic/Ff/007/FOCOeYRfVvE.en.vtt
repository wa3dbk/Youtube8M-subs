00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:09.299
 yes we have the tdp we know the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:13.370
 prophetic can be bought it 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:13.370
 strike started under the train is 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:25.080
 started long before anzio where songs 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.530
 sorry look at what goes to strip pro 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:35.640
 started at 1 quarter to almost yours 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:40.160
 Captain 830 dresses that we would have been 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.160
 promptly to the sammarco 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.350
 come in. entries found are i 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.350
 liquid means in the middle 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:23.909
 I find it unacceptable 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.100
 we didn't come here to get you 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:31.440
 it will not exist we are closed well and indeed 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:34.920
 similar to what we solve this 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.259
 we all solve success I liked and 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.410
 I like the challenge you listened to the metro 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:47.390
 to you she is willing to answer me on 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:51.179
 meter in the dark and without air conditioning 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.380
 because he started ahead if there is one 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:56.700
 he 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.390
 we take for dutifully reliable 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.390
 what comes to us 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.900
 this is what i can tell you that 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.570
 we have arrived 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.489
 you have a do try to do everything e 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.590
 we have a duty to take over 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:31.200
 responsibility I'm not talking to 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:33.450
 who am I speaking in one earring in 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.280
 planet control 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.420
 but then there is no talk of charity there 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.209
 we are 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.370
 I do not need to ask for it 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:46.980
 because if you are a metro user 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:51.709
 this is enough for love if there was one 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.709
