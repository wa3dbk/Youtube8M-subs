00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.750
 hello on youtube is achieved only in a 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.059
 new video tutorial in which they 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.519
 He tended how to make the effect of 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.950
 television without signal in our are 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.410
 Ideas can be made with any type 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.199
 sony vegas but right now I am in 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.820
 They are ideas but 11 but it can be done 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.159
 with 12 with the old man in 9 with 8 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.119
 with the units that we have the first 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:25.429
 what do we have to do we are going followed 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.589
 media generators then let's go to 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.119
 sound color are I are going to choose the 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.429
 white and let's drag to the 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.320
 timeline before we just go 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.989
 to make reality let's leave as is 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.539
 as if the video aspect since 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.769
 we look for noise we drag it to where 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:42.980
 is our video on the timeline 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:46.190
 and here the noise we said stream that 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.489
 we left then I leave there more or 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.109
 less and we can choose how they see enough of 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.059
 these three options marked means 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:55.100
 his from sea that is because I like 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.469
 we go like that but that also gives you a 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.969
 effect pretty well including you 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.579
 we can change the color of the seabed 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.339
 totally white 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.880
 and leave it a bit more difficult and it would be a 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.259
 little more realistic even perfect like that 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.439
 that once we have it as it was if 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.880
 is going to stay is going to be encouraged in this 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.530
 case how it was that men in the 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.020
 option to animate if we want to take it out 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.090
 but hate as in just a fringe 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.000
 still so that's what we 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.340
 we want is to encourage him to not give this 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.840
 great effect one that we have it in 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.700
 hand we will have but no sound 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.500
 to create that or let's go in the 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.630
 description of the video that must be this one 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.399
 in instructed by my sound this month and 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.350
 would the director assured that they are going to 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.360
 say speak to download it in this 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.100
 case only the voice because I already have it and 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.720
 that have downloaded it serve as 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.610
 they drag what would be the biggest 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.260
 profile with sony vegas 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.730
 and one that you have here we put it 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:53.700
 below and how it will be totally 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.800
 perfect this extract with sound and everything 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.470
 included if you want you can cut it 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.290
 to give an effect more cut than by 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.030
 general is done like this so everything is 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.070
