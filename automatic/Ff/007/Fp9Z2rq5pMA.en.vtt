00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 I bathe the health of his music lovers 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.240
 who opposes the axÃ© but in wintzenheim 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.240
 mertian technique that mike cerium 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.969
 2 people it's fatma 4 to 11 pm 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.260
 I hope you are doing much better 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.660
 that today we meet for the 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.580
 review zlatan ibrahimovic regular so I 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.800
 know very well that I did a review 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.000
 the boost already but I found that there is 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.099
 still a difference between the two 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.900
 so I wanted to talk about it and also 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.820
 because some subscribers came to me 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.279
 ask to do a review of this tan 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.410
 there and so I did a survey on 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.390
 twitter and on facebook and so the 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.760
 majority won the majority stride 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.309
 that bah I make a replay of zlatan 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.809
 ibrahimovic who regulates so has level 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.670
 stats in game you see them in this 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.900
 the same moment you see o you also have 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.059
 the team in which he is placed so 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.650
 this is the team obviously there is certainly a 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.790
 clip that you have already seen ie 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.680
 his goals because I really put 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.080
 all at last almost all the goals that 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.489
 I put with so ja also goals 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.040
 that you could see in the video of 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.870
 the satim so the squat builder but there 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.979
 also has quite a few more at the 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.110
 end you will see I added 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:04.629
 others I played sees play last night 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.650
 in the night just to add to the 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.240
 end because knew that if I had 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.520
 that clips that you had already seen 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.190
 it was a bit of fucking mouth so 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.240
 the sda thani bregovic regular what I 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.950
 can already say if I find it better 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.630
 that the boost is true that it's enough 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.909
 strange that I know what I'm saying not this 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.869
 that the boost really has stats 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.229
 far above there are still some 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.609
 very big improvement in game but I 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.530
 found the regular above that is to say 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:28.509
 I have a lot more fun I find 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.119
 that in front of the caches you will win - with 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.700
 I find it more agile I do not know 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.840
 did the boost I found it quite rent 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.749
 that is, I find that 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.340
 defenders were really it was 

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:41.350
 really a problem for him I find 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.850
 that I had true I struggled a lot 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.649
 with the opposing defenders and 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.439
 especially will keep them that was doing 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.799
 a lot of crazy people and there it was 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.689
 calm 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.909
 it calmed down with the regular version 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.499
 so maybe it's in my head 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.960
 maybe it's in my head but 

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:57.460
 I had said in with lionel magazine 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.530
 messi that I found lionel messi at 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.140
 above the zlatan boost I find the 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.210
 zlatan regulated above lionel messi and 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.039
 so there may be a problem in my 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.869
 head where there may be a problem in 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.950
 the game here you are so the matane in 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.569
 himself what can we say about 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.130
 this village of regular athens whose already 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.890
 before you hide them a fury you and then 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.930
 1.95 in finish so in front of the cages 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.459
 it's often a goal when you're in 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.830
 face of the cages you hit childhood you 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.299
 kick flat foot there is very 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.769
 great chance that this is 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.250
 in 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.950
 then on the set pieces 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.140
 so you see the penaltys at the level 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.700
 Penalties at the level of costs France 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.349
 is really clean then that and who with 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.920
 I did not have a free kick illustrated 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:38.080
 but it does not change it's true that zlatan 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.189
 he has the advantage of hitting very very hard 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.470
 to have a very very big power 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.450
 typing and accuracy of hits 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.970
 rather francs rather folk or 80 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.960
 something like that over 80 m and 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.790
 which is why he is 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.550
 and he's very good at hitting the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.110
 free kicks that it is far away where the 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.790
 free kick at the entrance to the surface of 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.080
 free kick in force actually really 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.760
 tan it's really ideal for 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.740
 shoot I find that they stretch very well 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.510
 on the free kicks far wanted 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.130
 hit hard even though his steps 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.420
 dance can be framed it can be bad 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.070
 pushed back by the goalkeeper so that can 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.300
 to make a goal behind me I the 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.460
 really advise to shoot the shots 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.990
 of foot stopped but after I had in 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.450
 my equipment necessarily my choice is 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.850
 door on him but that thann in time 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.110
 normal I find you very much the quality of 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.610
 passes need to talk about it because that's 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.500
 true that I have not 1000 assists 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.300
 of zlatan in this review we had seen 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.800
 the little opening for hull and at the 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.200
 end there is a version for life too 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.930
 but here are the posts of if I have 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.250
 did I did 5 with I do 5 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.210
 assists with his rules in the 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.680
 game she still has a very very 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.300
 beautiful quality of very very beautiful 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.330
 not qualities or he has good vision 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.580
 of the game his good stat in game vision 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.050
 then inevitably it does not help like in real life 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.840
 in fact he is able to deliver 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.790
 voice redacted deposits via so the 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.620
 quality not I talked about it after good 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.600
 agility the 5 stars technical gesture 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.040
 the four and a bad foot good bah that 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.350
 it's the base with only to hold and yes 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.720
 I want to read you his head game he 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.430
 a good head game even if a point the 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.080
 only negative point is his relaxation I 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.210
 find that he does not relax enough 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.040
 after that it's a little trick 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.420
 strange because as much the head game of 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.750
 zlatan ie the precision of my 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.320
 head 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.420
 in truth is at its limits but as much its 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.120
 relax you can not tell the guy who you 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.010
 does facts says he's making back 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.480
 you go up so much that's the 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.980
 relax i do not know i have not too much 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.420
 understood the system knows he would have 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.090
 may have had to drop his note in the lead by 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.650
 against increased his relaxation and so he has 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.910
 a relaxing stat at its limits I 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.730
 so this is the only negative point 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.330
 that I found after that you've seen 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.060
 strength 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.780
 he has more than 93 in force necessarily that 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.990
 help enormously 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.130
 it fails set up and despite these 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.960
 contributions saeki the contribution 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.710
 average and low contributions 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.900
 really strange 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.700
 it does not go down well not come down not 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.380
 wrong what makes you go often 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.380
 find the times in midfield 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.790
 but it's an advantage if you like this 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.870
 that it is because bahia means of 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.520
 from afar 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.720
 for what it is it's true I know 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.520
 very well how much the method does the 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.690
 discounter and then if you can do some 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.260
 scoops tend even further it's 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.050
 very cool 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.490
 and that's what after the speed he has 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.600
 really a correct speed I have 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.220
 do not want me in the hottest me 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.720
 I completely zapped in two meters 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.100
 speed but that and he has a 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.280
 speed corrected thousand hunter cards 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.140
 which increases speed but yeah 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.550
 for level of speed his voice he is 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.340
 still difficult to catch up 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.630
 saric defenders this catches him the 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.250
 jersey generally it can help 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.610
 the thing is that he has a very big 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.930
 is a highlight so that low and 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.400
 it's complicated to move anyway 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.650
 father this morning it's really complicated 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.630
 to move and so it makes an opponent 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.670
 an opponent of choice so there you have 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.500
 the third penalty of this review 3rd 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.220
 4th 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.810
 it was on penalties to stop 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.130
 during a shooting session on goal and there 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.110
 we will finish with the latest clips 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.730
 of this review so here is this morning 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.830
 also a very big awaits you shutters 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.360
 the very big one is waiting for you in 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.320
 volley so that there 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.340
 me what I like but with what you 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.510
 can really hit in any 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.370
 what does it mean to be dangerous? 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.990
 the balloon will hit crazy curves 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.730
 laughter to come down at the last moment in 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.470
 France and he is really very 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.720
 impressive as a player and I take 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.130
 really fun to play with 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.080
 even if I spoke in life ask 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.610
 LentillÃ¨res of times I 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.630
 the impression can make me rebalance 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.570
 the mouth because here it is 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.620
 player who at 89 2 general is a big 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.000
 player he's also in a big 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.050
 team and so here is where you have 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.120
 saw the opening for the victim on 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.740
 had said that they finish in the 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.000
 lavezzi finish is clean and it 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.460
 would have finished that last clip 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.930
 double last clip it's a little one 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.370
 little hook a little time scoop for 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.730
 to put me in the sense but the little 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:25.520
 humiliation tchi tchi sombrero shot 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.930
 on the guardian a rainbow been 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.910
 left foot recovery and it's nice 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.240
 what is it at the end we finish in 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.950
 beauty 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.800
 and we finish with the assessment of this morning 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.849
 so the balance of the tan already 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.379
 before it appears because it's 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:36.759
 true that at leaving all the slow ones 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:37.840
 I am like that I am I am a 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:39.460
 child and so that's the record of 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.169
 ibrahimovic attacks so I put 20 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.729
 out of 20 that's because bah I them 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:45.430
 found he is really very very 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:46.840
 complete it is very very good so in 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.180
 most kicks stopped I 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.979
 have spoken the resumed so the shutters his 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.870
 force his vision his agility 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:53.979
 these ball checks it's long shot 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.509
 because he can really hit 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:57.669
 very far away and takes very big 

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:58.930
 stats in aggression also so on the 

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:00.520
 general ball carrier he goes to him 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.840
 hurt I put the head game of 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.909
 teeth because the advantage is also 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.469
 that he closed of 95 so despite his 

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:07.629
 relaxation and his stats in mind 

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:10.270
 it still helps a kind km that end 

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:12.250
 May 95 in fifa is necessarily good of the 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.360
 head is a little there the trick not very 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.669
 logic in the game but you it's 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.900
 unfortunately only at its positioning 

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:18.520
 always to place me four volumes 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.110
 bad foot its quality not its power 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.240
 punch his 5 stars technical gesture 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:25.120
 and so in the east - I put the trigger 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.889
 and so you see the balance sheet so 23 h 39 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.289
 goals and 5 assists with nathalie 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:31.150
 baye witch it was late 80 hd I hope 

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:33.280
 that this review by zlatan ibrahimovic 

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.629
 regular you liked it I tell you it's 

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.060
 obviously if you liked it for that but 

00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:38.500
 train imposed a small comment and 

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.240
 to your good and if it is not already done 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:43.289
 I would like the next people take 

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.289
 care of you by everyone
