00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.700 
of the robot masters you defeat
the<00:02:23.030> crazy<00:02:23.660> thing<00:02:23.810> in<00:02:24.080> this<00:02:24.200> one<00:02:24.380> is<00:02:24.500> there's

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
the crazy thing in this one is there's

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.050 
the crazy thing in this one is there's
two<00:02:24.860> closed<00:02:25.190> loops<00:02:26.950> meaning<00:02:27.970> you're<00:02:28.970> gonna

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
two closed loops meaning you're gonna

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.140 
two closed loops meaning you're gonna
have<00:02:29.240> to<00:02:29.360> find<00:02:30.610> very<00:02:31.610> like<00:02:33.550> there's<00:02:34.550> a<00:02:34.610> circuit

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
have to find very like there's a circuit

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.840 
have to find very like there's a circuit
of<00:02:35.300> five<00:02:35.690> robot<00:02:36.140> masters<00:02:36.650> up<00:02:36.950> can<00:02:37.520> we<00:02:37.610> do<00:02:37.730> it

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
of five robot masters up can we do it

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.460 
of five robot masters up can we do it
without<00:02:37.940> taking<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.450> hit<00:02:38.630> yes<00:02:39.530> we<00:02:39.680> can<00:02:41.470> so

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
without taking a hit yes we can so

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.110 
without taking a hit yes we can so
there's<00:02:42.800> five<00:02:43.040> robot<00:02:43.430> masters<00:02:43.850> who<00:02:43.940> have

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
there's five robot masters who have

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.760 
there's five robot masters who have
weapons<00:02:44.570> that<00:02:44.690> all<00:02:44.870> work<00:02:45.080> against<00:02:45.470> each<00:02:45.560> other

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
weapons that all work against each other

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.180 
weapons that all work against each other
and<00:02:45.860> then<00:02:46.070> there's<00:02:46.220> three<00:02:46.490> more<00:02:46.670> so<00:02:48.010> get<00:02:49.010> used

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
and then there's three more so get used

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.070 
and then there's three more so get used
to<00:02:49.250> fighting<00:02:49.580> with<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.790> Mega<00:02:50.000> Buster<00:02:50.210> real

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
to fighting with the Mega Buster real

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:58.920 
to fighting with the Mega Buster real
men<00:02:51.260> only<00:02:51.440> use<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:51.920> mogat<00:02:52.190> Buster<00:02:52.490> though

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.420 

I've<00:02:59.930> detailed<00:03:00.170> how<00:03:00.560> I<00:03:00.590> hold<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:01.010> controller

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
I've detailed how I hold the controller

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.610 
I've detailed how I hold the controller
in<00:03:01.640> my<00:03:01.790> mega<00:03:01.970> man<00:03:02.180> x<00:03:02.390> let's<00:03:02.720> plays<00:03:03.050> but<00:03:05.530> one<00:03:06.530> of

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
in my mega man x let's plays but one of

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.160 
in my mega man x let's plays but one of
the<00:03:06.680> consequences<00:03:07.040> of<00:03:07.460> it<00:03:07.730> is<00:03:08.120> it's<00:03:08.750> hard<00:03:09.020> to

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
the consequences of it is it's hard to

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.990 
the consequences of it is it's hard to
shoot<00:03:09.440> super<00:03:09.980> fast<00:03:10.220> while<00:03:10.550> you're<00:03:10.760> jumping

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
shoot super fast while you're jumping

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.600 
shoot super fast while you're jumping
because<00:03:11.390> typically<00:03:12.230> let<00:03:13.010> go<00:03:13.130> of<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.340> jump

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
because typically let go of the jump

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:20.610 
because typically let go of the jump
button<00:03:13.760> I<00:03:14.030> do<00:03:14.440> something<00:03:15.440> to<00:03:15.620> take<00:03:16.280> note<00:03:16.580> of

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.780 

wonder<00:03:21.620> if<00:03:21.680> we<00:03:21.800> can<00:03:21.920> do<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.190> entire<00:03:22.490> state

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
wonder if we can do the entire state

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.180 
wonder if we can do the entire state
without<00:03:23.000> taking<00:03:23.480> hit<00:03:23.750> be<00:03:24.500> careful<00:03:24.920> on<00:03:25.040> these

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
without taking hit be careful on these

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.910 
without taking hit be careful on these
things

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
things

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.559 
things
you<00:03:27.280> move<00:03:27.459> back<00:03:27.670> and<00:03:27.849> forth<00:03:28.090> they<00:03:28.240> can<00:03:28.360> really

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
you move back and forth they can really

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.440 
you move back and forth they can really
screw<00:03:28.840> up<00:03:28.900> a<00:03:29.080> jump<00:03:32.670> you<00:03:33.670> haven't<00:03:33.910> taken<00:03:34.030> a<00:03:34.300> hit

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
screw up a jump you haven't taken a hit

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.360 
screw up a jump you haven't taken a hit
yet<00:03:34.660> in<00:03:34.720> its<00:03:34.959> top<00:03:35.200> man<00:03:35.440> who's<00:03:35.709> a<00:03:36.010> bit<00:03:36.220> of<00:03:36.310> a

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
yet in its top man who's a bit of a

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:47.340 
yet in its top man who's a bit of a
chump<00:03:45.420> trick<00:03:46.420> is<00:03:46.540> not<00:03:46.720> to<00:03:46.780> watch<00:03:47.080> when<00:03:47.290> he

chump trick is not to watch when he
moves<00:03:47.530> just<00:03:47.709> keep<00:03:47.920> your<00:03:48.040> eye<00:03:48.100> on<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.400> middle

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
moves just keep your eye on the middle

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.699 
moves just keep your eye on the middle
makes<00:03:49.239> it<00:03:49.390> easier<00:03:49.690> to<00:03:49.750> avoid<00:03:50.020> his<00:03:50.319> hits<00:03:50.560> if

top<00:04:04.600> man<00:04:04.810> was<00:04:04.989> the<00:04:05.110> first<00:04:05.290> robot<00:04:05.709> master<00:04:06.100> I

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
top man was the first robot master I

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.320 
top man was the first robot master I
ever<00:04:06.400> beat<00:04:06.700> I<00:04:08.610> also<00:04:09.610> maintained<00:04:10.060> I<00:04:10.090> had<00:04:10.299> a

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
really weird glitch one time when I

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.800 
really weird glitch one time when I
