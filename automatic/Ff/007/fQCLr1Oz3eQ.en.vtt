00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
of textures this is a tree textures and

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.820 
of textures this is a tree textures and
you<00:00:18.310> can<00:00:18.520> see<00:00:18.900> inside<00:00:19.900> it<00:00:20.080> it<00:00:20.230> has<00:00:20.470> three

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
you can see inside it it has three

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.940 
you can see inside it it has three
different<00:00:21.100> shades<00:00:21.730> of<00:00:22.349> green<00:00:23.349> flower<00:00:24.250> soft

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
different shades of green flower soft

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.800 
different shades of green flower soft
when<00:00:26.950> you've<00:00:27.130> got<00:00:27.340> them<00:00:27.490> home<00:00:27.759> first<00:00:28.540> thing

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
when you've got them home first thing

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.870 
when you've got them home first thing
that<00:00:28.990> you<00:00:29.140> would<00:00:29.259> do<00:00:29.529> is<00:00:29.920> to<00:00:30.220> open<00:00:30.610> them<00:00:30.730> out

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
that you would do is to open them out

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.729 
that you would do is to open them out
and<00:00:31.300> put<00:00:31.540> them<00:00:31.630> in<00:00:31.779> the<00:00:31.900> larger<00:00:32.079> dishes<00:00:32.619> so

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
and put them in the larger dishes so

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.050 
and put them in the larger dishes so
that<00:00:32.890> you<00:00:33.010> can<00:00:33.190> actually<00:00:33.370> use<00:00:34.180> it<00:00:34.480> to<00:00:34.660> sprinkle

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.060 
that you can actually use it to sprinkle

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.550 
that you can actually use it to sprinkle
you<00:00:37.060> can<00:00:37.239> see<00:00:37.420> that<00:00:37.600> this<00:00:37.750> is<00:00:37.930> the<00:00:38.050> dark<00:00:38.320> green

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:38.560 
you can see that this is the dark green

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.740 
you can see that this is the dark green
flower<00:00:38.890> stuff<00:00:39.190> that<00:00:39.399> we've<00:00:39.579> got<00:00:39.790> here<00:00:40.210> I've

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
flower stuff that we've got here I've

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.150 
flower stuff that we've got here I've
also<00:00:41.470> got<00:00:41.770> a<00:00:41.800> much<00:00:42.070> brighter<00:00:42.780> green<00:00:43.780> in<00:00:44.079> my

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
also got a much brighter green in my

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.099 
also got a much brighter green in my
boil<00:00:45.160> here<00:00:45.579> and<00:00:45.880> this<00:00:46.540> is<00:00:46.719> a<00:00:46.750> slightly

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 
boil here and this is a slightly

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.060 
boil here and this is a slightly
different<00:00:47.920> texture<00:00:48.399> and<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:50.230> is<00:00:50.469> the<00:00:50.800> sage

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
different texture and this is the sage

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.900 
different texture and this is the sage
green<00:00:51.550> ultrafine<00:00:52.449> much<00:00:53.019> finer<00:00:53.519> so<00:00:54.519> what<00:00:54.760> would

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
green ultrafine much finer so what would

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:55.799 
green ultrafine much finer so what would
we<00:00:54.969> do<00:00:55.239> with<00:00:55.449> them

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
we do with them

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.560 
we do with them
well<00:00:56.260> you<00:00:56.350> can<00:00:56.559> use<00:00:56.800> them<00:00:57.070> for<00:00:57.250> any

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
well you can use them for any

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.930 
well you can use them for any
pre-printed<00:00:58.570> or<00:00:59.019> stamped<00:00:59.679> images<00:01:00.280> but<00:01:00.730> maybe

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
pre-printed or stamped images but maybe

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.689 
pre-printed or stamped images but maybe
an<00:01:01.329> image<00:01:01.929> that<00:01:02.320> you<00:01:02.620> yourself<00:01:03.160> have<00:01:03.249> that

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
an image that you yourself have that

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.050 
an image that you yourself have that
you've<00:01:03.910> stamped<00:01:04.269> or<00:01:04.570> painted<00:01:05.550> and<00:01:06.550> you<00:01:06.580> want

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
you've stamped or painted and you want

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.060 
you've stamped or painted and you want
add<00:01:07.210> a<00:01:07.240> little<00:01:07.630> bit<00:01:07.810> realism<00:01:08.350> I've<00:01:08.680> already

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
add a little bit realism I've already

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.040 
add a little bit realism I've already
done<00:01:09.340> some<00:01:09.640> of<00:01:09.760> it<00:01:09.880> just<00:01:09.909> to<00:01:10.210> show<00:01:10.540> you<00:01:10.600> what<00:01:10.930> it

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
done some of it just to show you what it

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.950 
done some of it just to show you what it
was<00:01:11.170> like<00:01:11.340> when<00:01:12.340> it<00:01:12.490> was<00:01:12.640> actually<00:01:13.180> on<00:01:13.360> and

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
was like when it was actually on and

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.120 
was like when it was actually on and
dried<00:01:15.960> importantly<00:01:16.960> you<00:01:17.320> need<00:01:17.500> to<00:01:17.680> use<00:01:17.890> a

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
dried importantly you need to use a

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.749 
dried importantly you need to use a
flower<00:01:18.370> soft<00:01:18.729> glue<00:01:19.030> and<00:01:19.649> this<00:01:20.649> is<00:01:20.829> a<00:01:20.860> very<00:01:21.220> low

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
flower soft glue and this is a very low

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.889 
flower soft glue and this is a very low
water<00:01:22.060> content<00:01:22.420> high<00:01:23.380> tack<00:01:23.860> PVA<00:01:24.490> glue<00:01:24.899> it's

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
water content high tack PVA glue it's

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.719 
water content high tack PVA glue it's
also<00:01:26.229> got<00:01:26.530> a<00:01:26.560> very<00:01:26.770> nice<00:01:27.040> faint

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
also got a very nice faint

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.749 
also got a very nice faint
NORs<00:01:28.000> applicator<00:01:28.780> so<00:01:29.530> if<00:01:29.710> I<00:01:29.829> was<00:01:29.979> doing<00:01:30.009> small

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
NORs applicator so if I was doing small

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.510 
NORs applicator so if I was doing small
area<00:01:31.270> so<00:01:31.540> maybe<00:01:31.780> we'll<00:01:32.110> do<00:01:32.229> this<00:01:32.439> little<00:01:33.219> tree

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
area so maybe we'll do this little tree

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.270 
area so maybe we'll do this little tree
that<00:01:33.549> we've<00:01:33.880> got<00:01:34.090> here<00:01:34.619> what<00:01:35.619> you<00:01:35.740> need<00:01:35.950> to<00:01:36.130> be

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
that we've got here what you need to be

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.730 
that we've got here what you need to be
doing<00:01:36.610> is<00:01:36.880> putting<00:01:37.119> tiny<00:01:37.630> little<00:01:38.079> dabs<00:01:38.530> of

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
doing is putting tiny little dabs of

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.010 
doing is putting tiny little dabs of
glue<00:01:38.799> so<00:01:39.219> I'm<00:01:39.280> just<00:01:39.460> applying<00:01:39.719> very<00:01:40.719> light

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
glue so I'm just applying very light

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.279 
glue so I'm just applying very light
pressure<00:01:41.820> onto<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:43.210> nose<00:01:43.450> onto<00:01:44.079> the<00:01:44.909> glue<00:01:46.289> so

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
pressure onto the nose onto the glue so

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.139 
pressure onto the nose onto the glue so
that<00:01:47.320> I<00:01:47.469> can<00:01:47.770> get<00:01:48.009> tiny<00:01:48.700> little<00:01:49.289> dabs<00:01:50.289> of<00:01:50.530> glue

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
that I can get tiny little dabs of glue

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.560 
that I can get tiny little dabs of glue
from<00:01:52.149> the<00:01:52.240> tip<00:01:53.430> they<00:01:54.430> say<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.030> amount<00:01:55.240> of<00:01:55.360> glue

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
from the tip they say the amount of glue

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.389 
from the tip they say the amount of glue
that<00:01:55.600> we've<00:01:55.869> got<00:01:56.049> on<00:01:56.170> there<00:01:56.409> and<00:01:56.680> then<00:01:57.219> this

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
that we've got on there and then this

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.520 
that we've got on there and then this
isn't<00:01:57.640> because<00:01:57.969> it's<00:01:58.149> such<00:01:58.450> a<00:01:58.479> very<00:01:58.719> fine

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
isn't because it's such a very fine

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.499 
isn't because it's such a very fine
image<00:01:59.979> when<00:02:00.369> I'm<00:02:00.549> going<00:02:00.759> to<00:02:00.880> do<00:02:01.060> is<00:02:01.270> I'm<00:02:01.479> going

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
image when I'm going to do is I'm going

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.690 
image when I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:02:01.719> sprinkle<00:02:02.049> over<00:02:02.259> the<00:02:02.979> sage<00:02:03.310> green

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
to sprinkle over the sage green

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.490 
to sprinkle over the sage green
ultrafine<00:02:04.359> you'd<00:02:04.539> be<00:02:04.630> able<00:02:04.689> to<00:02:04.810> see<00:02:04.990> how<00:02:05.140> fine

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
ultrafine you'd be able to see how fine

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.889 
ultrafine you'd be able to see how fine
that<00:02:05.829> is<00:02:07.170> tap<00:02:08.170> off<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.380> excess<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.780> there<00:02:10.780> we

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
that is tap off the excess and there we

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.380 
that is tap off the excess and there we
have<00:02:11.970> instant<00:02:13.680> foliage<00:02:14.680> on<00:02:14.970> your<00:02:15.970> very<00:02:16.240> small

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
have instant foliage on your very small

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.620 
have instant foliage on your very small
image<00:02:16.960> on<00:02:17.230> your<00:02:17.410> tree

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
image on your tree

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.170 
image on your tree
another<00:02:19.260> thing<00:02:19.500> that<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.770> can<00:02:20.010> do<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:21.030> can

sheet<00:02:47.190> underneath<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.420> it's<00:02:48.540> going<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.750> be

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
sheet underneath so it's going to be

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.800

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
again exactly the same technique so I

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.490 
again exactly the same technique so I
kind<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.740> follow<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.220> up<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:57.840> bear<00:02:58.140> with<00:02:58.410> the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
kind of follow it up the bear with the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.610 
kind of follow it up the bear with the
branches<00:02:59.600> this<00:03:00.600> image<00:03:00.960> doesn't<00:03:01.320> have<00:03:01.470> any

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
branches this image doesn't have any

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.060

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
leaves or flowers on if it did then you

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.060 
leaves or flowers on if it did then you
could<00:03:05.400> go<00:03:06.120> in<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.570> around<00:03:06.900> those<00:03:07.200> because

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
could go in and around those because

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.250 
could go in and around those because
what<00:03:08.250> you're<00:03:08.400> doing<00:03:08.430> is<00:03:08.760> adding<00:03:09.080> texture<00:03:10.080> and

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260

don't do it in too large an area so just

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.570 
don't do it in too large an area so just
that<00:03:20.130> scale<00:03:20.610> and<00:03:20.910> then<00:03:21.810> again<00:03:22.110> literally<00:03:22.740> just

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
that scale and then again literally just

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.520 
that scale and then again literally just
drop<00:03:24.180> that<00:03:24.210> over<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.780> top<00:03:24.990> make<00:03:25.260> sure<00:03:25.410> that

drop that over the top make sure that

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.990 
drop that over the top make sure that
you've<00:03:25.680> got<00:03:25.710> all<00:03:25.890> of<00:03:26.220> that<00:03:26.250> glute<00:03:26.760> area

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.490 

there<00:03:34.920> we<00:03:35.040> have<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.990> again<00:03:36.990> we've<00:03:37.380> achieved

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
there we have it again we've achieved

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.140 
there we have it again we've achieved
lovely<00:03:38.220> dimension<00:03:39.210> and<00:03:40.250> texture<00:03:41.250> once<00:03:41.940> this

is dry probably 30 minutes I would

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.180 
is dry probably 30 minutes I would
probably<00:03:46.350> leave<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:46.650> in<00:03:46.770> there<00:03:46.920> where<00:03:47.040> before

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
to get a nice heavy coverage on to the

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.610 
to get a nice heavy coverage on to the
little<00:05:22.610> miniature<00:05:22.789> pot<00:05:23.270> so<00:05:24.199> tap<00:05:24.409> off<00:05:24.590> the

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
little miniature pot so tap off the

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.800 
little miniature pot so tap off the
excess<00:05:25.189> now<00:05:25.819> you'll<00:05:25.969> be<00:05:26.120> able<00:05:26.240> to<00:05:26.449> see<00:05:26.629> on

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
excess now you'll be able to see on

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.350 
excess now you'll be able to see on
there<00:05:27.159> that<00:05:28.159> you<00:05:28.189> can<00:05:28.460> actually<00:05:28.639> say<00:05:29.120> the

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
there that you can actually say the

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.260 
there that you can actually say the
weight<00:05:29.569> of<00:05:29.810> the<00:05:29.960> glue<00:05:30.199> through<00:05:30.919> they<00:05:31.270> just

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
weight of the glue through they just

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.029 
weight of the glue through they just
leave<00:05:32.449> that<00:05:32.689> because<00:05:33.050> when<00:05:33.229> it<00:05:33.379> dries<00:05:33.650> it's

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
leave that because when it dries it's

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.890 
leave that because when it dries it's
going<00:05:34.129> to<00:05:34.340> dry<00:05:34.520> clear<00:05:34.849> so<00:05:35.060> you<00:05:35.360> can<00:05:35.449> Leaton

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
going to dry clear so you can Leaton

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.959 
going to dry clear so you can Leaton
that<00:05:36.050> up<00:05:36.229> you<00:05:36.409> push<00:05:36.680> it<00:05:36.830> back<00:05:37.009> into<00:05:37.370> the

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:37.969 
that up you push it back into the

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:40.649 
that up you push it back into the
boundaries<00:05:38.419> where<00:05:38.659> you<00:05:38.870> want<00:05:39.080> it<00:05:39.229> to<00:05:39.379> be<00:05:39.560> and

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
boundaries where you want it to be and

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.899 
boundaries where you want it to be and
see<00:05:41.659> the<00:05:42.139> effect<00:05:42.469> of<00:05:42.620> it<00:05:42.770> when<00:05:43.009> it's<00:05:43.190> dry<00:05:43.430> it

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:43.909 
see the effect of it when it's dry it

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:47.469 
see the effect of it when it's dry it
could<00:05:44.569> does<00:05:44.810> give<00:05:45.169> a<00:05:45.409> very<00:05:45.620> very<00:05:46.479> realistic
