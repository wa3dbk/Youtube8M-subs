we tackle cancer pathology is really the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.350 
we tackle cancer pathology is really the
study<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.770> disease<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.579> tissue<00:00:50.910> under

the diagnostic capabilities of the
pathologist<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.489> now<00:01:02.730> we're<00:01:03.180> moving<00:01:03.329> towards

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
pathologist so now we're moving towards

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.800 
pathologist so now we're moving towards
the<00:01:04.140> digital<00:01:04.680> pathology<00:01:04.830> era<00:01:05.630> what<00:01:06.630> we're

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
the digital pathology era what we're

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.200 
the digital pathology era what we're
working<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.500> how<00:01:08.250> are<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:08.490> collaborating

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
working on is how are we collaborating

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.410 
working on is how are we collaborating
on<00:01:09.530> understanding<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.590> workflow<00:01:11.220> changes<00:01:12.060> so

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
on understanding the workflow changes so

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.390 
on understanding the workflow changes so
it<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.869> potentially<00:01:13.340> come<00:01:14.340> up<00:01:14.520> you

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
it can potentially come up you
