00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
displaced or lose anything and so we

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.150 
displaced or lose anything and so we
really<00:00:27.750> focus<00:00:28.170> on<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.380> area<00:00:28.439> first<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.070> all

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
really focus on that area first of all

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.279 
really focus on that area first of all

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289

zone<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.740> anything<00:00:31.949> outside<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.430> will<00:00:32.790> go

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
zone so anything outside that will go

00:00:32.910 --> 00:01:43.540
