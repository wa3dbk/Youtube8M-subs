an outcast sport after the 90s were over
I<00:00:33.590> think<00:00:33.920> in<00:00:34.100> the<00:00:34.489> 2000s<00:00:35.210> when<00:00:35.780> Tony<00:00:35.989> Hawk

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
I think in the 2000s when Tony Hawk

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:38.710 
I think in the 2000s when Tony Hawk
started<00:00:36.590> really<00:00:36.800> getting<00:00:36.890> huge<00:00:37.370> again<00:00:37.720> it

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
sport now there have always been girls

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.860 
sport now there have always been girls
that<00:00:43.309> skate<00:00:43.580> but<00:00:43.970> it's<00:00:44.150> only<00:00:44.300> recently<00:00:44.540> that

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
that skate but it's only recently that

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.660 
that skate but it's only recently that
they've<00:00:45.290> been<00:00:45.470> getting<00:00:45.650> any<00:00:46.040> kind<00:00:46.519> of

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
they've been getting any kind of

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.610 
they've been getting any kind of
coverage<00:00:47.000> and<00:00:47.390> that<00:00:47.420> they're<00:00:48.050> actually<00:00:48.230> like

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
coverage and that they're actually like

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.290 
coverage and that they're actually like
starting<00:00:49.460> to<00:00:49.550> get<00:00:49.640> as<00:00:49.820> good<00:00:49.940> as<00:00:50.149> the<00:00:50.270> guys

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
starting to get as good as the guys

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.100 
starting to get as good as the guys
because<00:00:51.100> girls<00:00:52.100> tend<00:00:52.550> to<00:00:52.670> flock<00:00:52.880> together<00:00:53.110> in

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
because girls tend to flock together in

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.819 
because girls tend to flock together in
any<00:00:54.559> situation<00:00:55.160> and<00:00:55.420> so<00:00:56.420> if<00:00:57.079> you're<00:00:57.530> a<00:00:57.559> female

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
any situation and so if you're a female

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.619 
any situation and so if you're a female
skater<00:00:58.309> you're<00:00:58.820> going<00:00:58.940> to<00:00:59.000> be<00:00:59.120> more<00:00:59.270> likely<00:00:59.480> to

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
skater you're going to be more likely to

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.779

to emulate that right now there are only
a<00:04:09.650> few<00:04:09.739> all<00:04:10.370> girls<00:04:11.239> skate<00:04:11.510> teams<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:12.170> all

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
a few all girls skate teams and all

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.860 
a few all girls skate teams and all
girls<00:04:12.769> skate<00:04:13.010> companies<00:04:13.489> and<00:04:13.790> they're<00:04:14.720> just

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
girls skate companies and they're just

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.460 
girls skate companies and they're just
not<00:04:15.280> as<00:04:16.280> popular<00:04:16.669> as<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.209> guy<00:04:17.359> brands<00:04:18.290> and

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
not as popular as the guy brands and

not as popular as the guy brands and
teams<00:04:18.859> and<00:04:19.130> companies<00:04:19.519> so<00:04:20.510> it'd<00:04:21.169> be<00:04:21.500> nice<00:04:21.680> if

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820
