00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.940 

I'm<00:00:44.630> going<00:00:44.810> to<00:00:44.870> begin<00:00:44.990> by<00:00:45.350> removing<00:00:45.680> the

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
I'm going to begin by removing the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.340 
I'm going to begin by removing the
flywheel<00:00:46.400> from<00:00:46.820> this<00:00:46.940> motor<00:00:47.180> sometimes<00:00:48.140> these

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
flywheel from this motor sometimes these

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.780 
flywheel from this motor sometimes these
are<00:00:48.500> on<00:00:48.620> they're<00:00:48.800> so<00:00:49.010> tight<00:00:49.280> that<00:00:49.310> you<00:00:49.550> can't

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
are on they're so tight that you can't

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.720 
are on they're so tight that you can't
get<00:00:49.970> them<00:00:50.090> off<00:00:50.210> even<00:00:50.780> with<00:00:51.140> an<00:00:51.260> NWSL<00:00:52.040> Northwest

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
get them off even with an NWSL Northwest

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.060 
get them off even with an NWSL Northwest
short<00:00:53.000> line<00:00:53.120> puller<00:00:53.510> and<00:00:53.750> for<00:00:54.740> those<00:00:54.830> tough

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
short line puller and for those tough

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.610 
short line puller and for those tough
cases<00:00:55.550> this<00:00:56.540> is<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:56.720> technique<00:00:57.140> I<00:00:57.230> use<00:00:57.410> this

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
cases this is the technique I use this

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.310 
cases this is the technique I use this
is<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:57.890> V<00:00:58.070> plate<00:00:58.400> from<00:00:59.150> the<00:00:59.660> north<00:00:59.840> west<00:01:00.080> short

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
is the V plate from the north west short

is the V plate from the north west short
line<00:01:00.440> polar<00:01:00.740> if<00:01:01.190> you<00:01:01.340> don't<00:01:01.520> have<00:01:01.700> this<00:01:01.940> you

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
line polar if you don't have this you

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.990 
line polar if you don't have this you
can<00:01:02.960> take<00:01:03.200> a<00:01:03.260> thin<00:01:04.130> piece<00:01:04.339> of<00:01:04.550> sheet<00:01:04.760> steel

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
can take a thin piece of sheet steel

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.400 
can take a thin piece of sheet steel
which<00:01:05.240> you<00:01:05.330> can<00:01:05.480> get<00:01:05.570> from<00:01:05.690> a<00:01:05.780> hardware<00:01:06.050> store

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
which you can get from a hardware store

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.310 
which you can get from a hardware store
and<00:01:06.620> file<00:01:07.250> a<00:01:07.280> notch<00:01:07.640> in<00:01:07.910> it<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:08.810> slip<00:01:09.170> the

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
and file a notch in it and slip the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.750 
and file a notch in it and slip the

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
the motor in this jeweler spice now it's

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.130 
the motor in this jeweler spice now it's
important<00:01:17.060> here<00:01:17.180> you<00:01:17.270> don't<00:01:17.390> want<00:01:17.660> this<00:01:17.869> motor

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
important here you don't want this motor

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.660 
important here you don't want this motor
clamp<00:01:18.590> in<00:01:18.770> here<00:01:18.920> you<00:01:18.979> just<00:01:19.010> want<00:01:19.190> it<00:01:19.369> hanging

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
clamp in here you just want it hanging

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.080 
clamp in here you just want it hanging
by<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.300> flywheel<00:01:24.400> there's<00:01:25.400> a<00:01:25.490> close-up<00:01:25.760> look

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
by the flywheel there's a close-up look

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.750 
by the flywheel there's a close-up look
into<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.080> top<00:01:27.290> of<00:01:27.410> the<00:01:27.470> flywheel<00:01:27.710> now<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:28.369> you

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
into the top of the flywheel now and you

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.090 
into the top of the flywheel now and you
can<00:01:28.880> see<00:01:29.150> in<00:01:29.300> there<00:01:29.510> the<00:01:30.110> shaft<00:01:30.470> that<00:01:30.800> we<00:01:30.950> need

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
can see in there the shaft that we need

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.060 
can see in there the shaft that we need
to<00:01:31.190> drive<00:01:31.460> out<00:01:31.960> in<00:01:32.960> a<00:01:33.140> pair<00:01:33.350> of<00:01:33.380> pliers<00:01:33.590> I<00:01:33.920> have

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
to drive out in a pair of pliers I have

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.880 
to drive out in a pair of pliers I have
a<00:01:34.100> small<00:01:34.490> 18<00:01:35.420> gauge<00:01:35.630> wire<00:01:35.660> brand<00:01:36.380> I'm<00:01:36.619> going<00:01:36.800> to

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
a small 18 gauge wire brand I'm going to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.180 
a small 18 gauge wire brand I'm going to
use<00:01:37.100> this<00:01:37.369> as<00:01:37.610> a<00:01:38.180> punch<00:01:41.440> okay<00:01:42.440> so<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.710> idea<00:01:43.009> is

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
use this as a punch okay so the idea is

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.740 
use this as a punch okay so the idea is
with<00:01:44.000> a<00:01:44.030> pair<00:01:44.270> of<00:01:44.300> pliers

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
with a pair of pliers

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.359 
with a pair of pliers
I'll<00:01:44.990> hold<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.410> bread<00:01:45.650> in<00:01:45.830> place<00:01:46.070> and

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
I'll hold the bread in place and

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.060 
I'll hold the bread in place and
position<00:01:47.030> it<00:01:47.480> so<00:01:48.080> it's<00:01:48.200> right<00:01:48.380> on<00:01:48.620> the<00:01:48.770> shaft

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
position it so it's right on the shaft

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.140 
position it so it's right on the shaft
inside<00:01:49.550> the<00:01:49.700> flywheel<00:01:50.150> and<00:01:51.610> then<00:01:52.610> just<00:01:52.850> gently

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
inside the flywheel and then just gently

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:05.890 
inside the flywheel and then just gently
tap<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:54.410> I<00:01:54.500> drive<00:01:54.770> out<00:01:54.980> the<00:01:55.130> motor

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.449 

and<00:02:06.900> this<00:02:07.259> happens<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.650> me<00:02:07.799> frequently<00:02:08.340> you

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
and this happens to me frequently you

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.979 
and this happens to me frequently you
may<00:02:08.490> have<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.789> use<00:02:08.880> several<00:02:09.179> nails<00:02:09.479> before<00:02:09.929> you

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
may have to use several nails before you

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:22.680 
may have to use several nails before you
can<00:02:10.110> drive<00:02:10.289> out<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.590> shaft

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.119 

with<00:02:23.690> stubborn<00:02:24.080> persistence<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.709> few<00:02:24.950> nails

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
with stubborn persistence a few nails

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:30.490 
with stubborn persistence a few nails
later<00:02:25.750> our<00:02:26.750> motor<00:02:27.170> is<00:02:27.260> free<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:30.200> it's

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
later our motor is free and it's

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.000 
later our motor is free and it's
unharmed<00:02:31.069> which<00:02:31.340> is<00:02:31.519> the<00:02:31.610> important<00:02:31.970> thing
