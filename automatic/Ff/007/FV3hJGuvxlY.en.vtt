00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
device now you don't have to use the the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.870 
device now you don't have to use the the
loop<00:01:12.259> in<00:01:12.470> order<00:01:12.680> to<00:01:12.770> get<00:01:13.190> the<00:01:13.369> text

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880

positioning<00:01:14.860> like<00:01:15.860> this<00:01:16.070> you<00:01:16.190> can<00:01:16.340> actually

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
positioning like this you can actually

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.820 
positioning like this you can actually
just<00:01:16.670> tap<00:01:17.000> it<00:01:17.030> right<00:01:17.360> in<00:01:17.509> there<00:01:17.630> apparently<00:01:18.050> so

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
just tap it right in there apparently so

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.920

that's nice one thing I've noticed

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.469 
that's nice one thing I've noticed
though<00:01:21.259> is<00:01:21.440> there's<00:01:21.770> no<00:01:21.950> way<00:01:21.979> of<00:01:22.190> knowing

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
though is there's no way of knowing

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.060 
though is there's no way of knowing
besides<00:01:23.479> this<00:01:24.020> up<00:01:24.320> arrow<00:01:24.590> whether<00:01:24.830> or<00:01:24.979> not

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
besides this up arrow whether or not

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
unfortunately that is kind of irritating

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.070 
unfortunately that is kind of irritating
because<00:01:31.210> it<00:01:32.210> looks<00:01:32.420> like<00:01:32.539> basically<00:01:32.899> your

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
because it looks like basically your

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:42.790 
because it looks like basically your
caps<00:01:33.259> lock<00:01:33.380> all<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:33.649> time

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.980 

your<00:01:43.400> auto<00:01:43.520> corrected<00:01:44.000> with<00:01:44.150> the<00:01:44.330> apostrophe

there

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.260 

and<00:01:51.830> we<00:01:51.920> have<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.250> other<00:01:52.520> simple<00:01:52.820> keyboard<00:01:53.180> in

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
and we have the other simple keyboard in

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:09.070 
and we have the other simple keyboard in
here

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.540 

and<00:02:10.080> when<00:02:10.440> i<00:02:10.470> mistyped<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:11.040> actually<00:02:11.370> new<00:02:11.520> to

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
pick this one as well but interestingly

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.180 
pick this one as well but interestingly
enough<00:02:15.330> when<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:17.630> hit<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.690> word<00:02:19.080> looks<00:02:20.040> like

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
enough when I hit that word looks like

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.890 
enough when I hit that word looks like
it<00:02:20.370> took<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.240> save<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:22.040> so<00:02:23.040> we<00:02:24.000> n<00:02:24.300> is<00:02:24.690> now

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
it took it and save it so we n is now

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.880 
it took it and save it so we n is now
apparently<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.350> word<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:25.620> my<00:02:25.710> dictionary

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.950 

alright<00:02:32.030> one<00:02:33.030> thing<00:02:33.210> i<00:02:33.300> noticed<00:02:33.630> playing<00:02:33.840> with

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
alright one thing i noticed playing with

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.680 
alright one thing i noticed playing with
this<00:02:34.080> thing<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.320> little<00:02:34.590> bit<00:02:34.680> earlier<00:02:35.070> is<00:02:35.690> from

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
this thing a little bit earlier is from

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.500 
this thing a little bit earlier is from
in<00:02:36.810> safari<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:40.850> see<00:02:41.850> if<00:02:41.940> i<00:02:42.030> can<00:02:42.180> get<00:02:42.330> this

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
in safari and see if i can get this

00:02:42.510 --> 00:03:00.280 
in safari and see if i can get this
thing<00:02:42.570> in<00:02:42.840> landscape<00:02:43.260> mode

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.410 

the<00:03:01.290> landscape<00:03:01.799> keyboard<00:03:01.980> is<00:03:02.489> far<00:03:03.180> larger

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
the landscape keyboard is far larger

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.270 
the landscape keyboard is far larger
keys<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.200> it's<00:03:04.319> much<00:03:04.560> more<00:03:04.739> comfortable<00:03:04.950> type

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
keys and it's much more comfortable type

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:20.720 
keys and it's much more comfortable type
on

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.730 

but<00:03:21.730> apparently<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:22.540> autocorrection<00:03:23.050> or<00:03:23.470> the

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
but apparently the autocorrection or the

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.410 
but apparently the autocorrection or the
correction<00:03:24.280> helper<00:03:24.640> does<00:03:24.880> not<00:03:25.060> really<00:03:25.240> work

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
correction helper does not really work

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.900 
correction helper does not really work
in<00:03:26.190> web<00:03:27.190> fields<00:03:28.140> unlike<00:03:29.140> an<00:03:29.290> email<00:03:29.590> and<00:03:29.910> text
