00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
a lot actually it was while I was doing

a lot actually it was while I was doing
the<00:01:35.820> research<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.509> found<00:01:36.750> out<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.140> how

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
close we did come to confrontation but I

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.730

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
information about beach just how close

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:08.539 
information about beach just how close
where<00:02:01.380> Sperling<00:02:01.830> came<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.429> collapsing<00:02:07.549> there

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
where Sperling came to collapsing there

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.090 
where Sperling came to collapsing there
is<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.670> fair<00:02:08.880> amount<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.090> cormac<00:02:09.739> in<00:02:10.739> me

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
is a fair amount of cormac in me

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.400 
is a fair amount of cormac in me
although<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:11.970> don<00:02:12.209> t<00:02:12.239> on<00:02:12.450> quite<00:02:12.720> as<00:02:12.870> vicious<00:02:13.230> or

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
although I don t on quite as vicious or

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.930 
although I don t on quite as vicious or
as<00:02:14.930> ruthless<00:02:15.930> as<00:02:15.959> he's<00:02:16.610> there<00:02:17.610> might<00:02:17.760> be<00:02:17.790> a

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
as ruthless as he's there might be a

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.920 
as ruthless as he's there might be a
kind<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.150> fantasy<00:02:18.840> figure<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.470> suppose

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.339 

I<00:02:24.989> think<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.650> message<00:02:25.829> is<00:02:26.250> that<00:02:26.780> aimed<00:02:27.780> aim

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
I think the message is that aimed aim

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.500 
I think the message is that aimed aim
today<00:02:28.620> with<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.040> cold<00:02:29.250> war<00:02:29.459> over<00:02:29.879> there<00:02:30.269> still

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
today with the cold war over there still

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.059 
today with the cold war over there still
an<00:02:30.569> awful<00:02:30.659> lot<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:30.900> distrust<00:02:31.530> in<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.859> world
