00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.919
 hello how about my friends from dino yzr 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.260
 puntocom let's do next in 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.990
 the firmware update of this 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.529
 fabulous controller that is the no of 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.989
 nm c6000 very well the first thing we should 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.480
 do after it's on and 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:23.399
 have installed all the drivers that 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.559
 they come originally or have them 

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:28.960
 downloaded from the website what 

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:33.089
 let's do is turn off the equipment 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.089
 and disconnect the usb cable 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.270
 then we will learn it but this time 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.330
 let's enter it in update mode 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.440
 for this we crush the back key and 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.730
 we have here and the key f w of 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.980
 simultaneously and at the same time we press 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.710
 also the shift key 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.160
 on the right side after that 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.160
 we light 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.989
 do it well and then we can let go 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.630
 the keys and we see that when turning on 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.390
 those two are you from the team that 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:13.560
 means that it is in update mode 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:17.720
 then we went to connect the usb cable 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.260
 in its corresponding slot 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.260
 very well 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.650
 the steps are the need to continue such 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.540
 as I explain otherwise the 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.170
 computer software is not going to 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.640
 recognize for the update 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.680
 very well then what we do is 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.780
 in the two files that come inside 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.170
 of the software that we have downloaded from 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:46.490
 the official page of the non dj dotcom 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:48.830
 the one is the firmware and the other is the 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.110
 software that is responsible for doing the 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.659
 update on the computer is 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.470
 we recommend copying these two 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.970
 programs and the windows desktop as well 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.549
 you can make this easier 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.420
 update and we will avoid very problems 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.200
 well then we choose the one that says of 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.979
 of j 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.660
 waterford of nms of 6000 we give you click 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.570
 right and we search 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.690
 the option that says open with and 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.570
 we selected java tm platform s 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.790
 binary it is necessary to have installed 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.320
 also this update very well to 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.750
 Sometimes we can give this inconvenience 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.200
 that says that 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.600
 in my life and vice does not exist then the 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.410
 only thing that we should do is disconnect it 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.710
 again 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:45.190
 the USB cable waited for 3 seconds and 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.190
 we discussed it 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.400
 I have done this process we click 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:56.260
 back in the file 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:59.560
 we can open with and we select java and 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.580
 ready the update software is 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.730
 open 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.510
 then we look in the part that says 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.510
 open file 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.550
 we look at our desk and 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.810
 we select the file 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:22.120
 update that is from the 6000 nms of 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:25.069
 s &amp; p thousand in this case very well done this 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:29.050
 situation we press start 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:31.990
 and we have how the process starts 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.380
 when carried out on the computer and in 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:38.720
 the controller 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.720
 this bar tells us the percentage 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.030
 here we are waiting for you 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.500
 load the software that is both sideways 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.500
 as on the side see 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.780
 come in a few seconds we will see how 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.530
 how the q3 is turned on which means that 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:05.180
 I would be entering already 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.180
 75% 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:13.050
 and finally the club would go on 4 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.150
 very well 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.200
 that means that it is 100% in the 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.170
 equipment update are restarted and 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.520
 we have installed the new one we are 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.910
 important and this is the announcement that we 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.950
 must come out on the woodgate computer 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.409
 lights 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.300
 all we do is accept 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:37.000
 and ready 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.520
 and to finish what we are going to do is 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.120
 calibrate the jocs since after a 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.550
 update happens that they suffer some 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.780
 kind of disqualification so for 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.910
 we turn off the equipment again 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.520
 and this time we will turn it on 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.980
 again but pressing at the same 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:02.120
 time the one who says I do 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:06.080
 with it's worth and the key dcf mode well 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.330
 then lift we turn on the equipment 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.439
 and now it will enter the mode of 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.439
 calibration of gioja 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.630
 we already see that this side is 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.270
 perfectly calibrated since it must 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:26.010
 turn on this blue key that says deck 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:28.050
 ch that happened on the b side in the 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.150
 side to means that this is 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.020
 Decalibrated must be in the same 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.090
 position 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.900
 for this we select the side to or the 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.580
 side b crushing back 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:43.370
 for the side to 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.370
 yfw of for side b 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:50.420
 already then we crush back 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:54.710
 and they will see that by moving 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:57.550
 the scroll bar is going to move 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:01.010
 also there until it should be 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.740
 similar this means the answer that 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.110
 has the jobs 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.479
 for tactile use then there 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.720
 means that it is 0 after that 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:13.210
 we crush the middle key 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.529
 and we crush shift of any of the 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.370
 two sides 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:19.919
 and ready 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.199
 the equipment is perfectly calibrated 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:24.960
 to work and work with any 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:27.680
 software for more security we owe it 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.680
 to turn off 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.530
 and we light it 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:39.950
 and we see that everything is ready right
