built<00:01:43.350> into<00:01:43.800> each<00:01:43.830> level<00:01:44.190> so<00:01:44.550> every<00:01:45.060> skill<00:01:45.360> we

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
built into each level so every skill we

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.660 
built into each level so every skill we
build<00:01:45.900> on<00:01:46.080> in<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> next<00:01:46.500> level<00:01:46.830> which<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.160> very

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
build on in the next level which is very

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.060 
build on in the next level which is very
important<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.510> start<00:01:49.050> at<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.470> very<00:01:49.560> beginning

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
important we start at the very beginning

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.590 
important we start at the very beginning
we<00:01:50.310> learn<00:01:50.460> how<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.670> float<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.060> our<00:01:51.180> stomach<00:01:51.510> and

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
we learn how to float on our stomach and

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.270 
we learn how to float on our stomach and
our<00:01:51.720> back<00:01:51.990> we<00:01:52.410> also<00:01:52.560> learned<00:01:52.770> how<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.920> roll

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
our back we also learned how to roll

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.800 
our back we also learned how to roll
over<00:01:53.310> which<00:01:53.790> introduces<00:01:54.300> the<00:01:54.510> idea<00:01:54.570> of

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
over which introduces the idea of

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.450 
over which introduces the idea of
turning<00:01:55.350> over<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.800> breathe<00:01:56.010> instead<00:01:56.400> of

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
turning over to breathe instead of

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.980 
turning over to breathe instead of
keeping<00:01:56.610> your<00:01:56.700> head<00:01:56.850> up<00:01:56.970> and<00:01:57.180> then<00:01:57.360> we<00:01:57.450> finally

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
keeping your head up and then we finally

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.649 
keeping your head up and then we finally
get<00:01:58.110> into<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.320> freestyle<00:01:58.890> side<00:01:59.100> breath

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.840 

here<00:02:02.020> we<00:02:02.079> go<00:02:02.439> one<00:02:02.770> crucial<00:02:03.009> safety<00:02:03.369> skill<00:02:03.729> we

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
here we go one crucial safety skill we

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.910 
here we go one crucial safety skill we
teach<00:02:04.060> is<00:02:04.329> our<00:02:04.509> wall<00:02:04.689> skill<00:02:05.109> we<00:02:05.469> teach<00:02:05.619> kids

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
teach is our wall skill we teach kids

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.679 
teach is our wall skill we teach kids
how<00:02:06.460> to<00:02:06.520> react<00:02:06.909> when<00:02:07.149> they<00:02:07.210> fall<00:02:07.390> in<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.569> water

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
how to react when they fall in the water

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.779 
how to react when they fall in the water
the<00:02:08.349> common<00:02:08.619> instinct<00:02:09.069> is<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.429> swim<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:09.700> the

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
the common instinct is to swim to the

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.460 
the common instinct is to swim to the
first<00:02:10.000> wall<00:02:10.209> they<00:02:10.330> see<00:02:10.390> which<00:02:10.869> commonly<00:02:11.379> is

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
first wall they see which commonly is

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.839 
first wall they see which commonly is
the<00:02:11.650> farthest<00:02:12.010> one<00:02:12.040> away<00:02:12.160> if<00:02:12.489> you<00:02:12.580> fall<00:02:12.730> in

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
the farthest one away if you fall in

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.490 
the farthest one away if you fall in
forwards<00:02:13.239> it's<00:02:13.930> one<00:02:14.049> of<00:02:14.110> those<00:02:14.200> things<00:02:14.410> that

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
forwards it's one of those things that

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.860 
forwards it's one of those things that
causes<00:02:14.860> drownings<00:02:15.519> and<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:16.330> shouldn't<00:02:16.660> and

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
causes drownings and it shouldn't and

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.119 
causes drownings and it shouldn't and
it's<00:02:16.989> a<00:02:17.049> problem<00:02:17.290> that's<00:02:17.379> easily<00:02:17.590> avoidable

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
it's a problem that's easily avoidable

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.710 
it's a problem that's easily avoidable
if<00:02:18.670> they're<00:02:18.879> taught<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.150> basic<00:02:19.420> safety

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
if they're taught the basic safety

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.420 
if they're taught the basic safety
skills<00:02:19.930> so<00:02:20.470> we<00:02:20.590> teach<00:02:20.709> them<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.040> instinct<00:02:21.370> of

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
skills so we teach them the instinct of

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.949 
skills so we teach them the instinct of
turning<00:02:21.700> around<00:02:21.760> swimming<00:02:22.390> back<00:02:22.599> to<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.810> wall

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
turning around swimming back to the wall

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.630 
turning around swimming back to the wall
and<00:02:23.140> climbing<00:02:23.470> out<00:02:23.530> properly<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.519> that

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
and climbing out properly and that

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.949 
and climbing out properly and that
pretends<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.000> have<00:02:25.180> it<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.510> that's<00:02:25.629> one<00:02:25.780> of<00:02:25.870> our

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
pretends I have it and that's one of our

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.710 
pretends I have it and that's one of our
biggest<00:02:26.110> safety<00:02:26.319> skills<00:02:26.620> we<00:02:26.709> teach<00:02:26.739> here<00:02:27.720> it's

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
biggest safety skills we teach here it's

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.150 
biggest safety skills we teach here it's
very<00:02:28.900> important<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.319> us<00:02:29.410> that<00:02:29.590> kids<00:02:29.709> have<00:02:29.950> fun

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
very important to us that kids have fun

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.800 
very important to us that kids have fun
in<00:02:30.250> our<00:02:30.310> swim<00:02:30.489> lessons<00:02:30.879> so<00:02:31.090> in<00:02:31.480> our<00:02:31.690> curriculum

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
in our swim lessons so in our curriculum

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.170 
in our swim lessons so in our curriculum
we<00:02:32.080> have<00:02:32.200> games<00:02:32.470> we<00:02:32.799> have<00:02:32.920> varieties<00:02:33.430> of<00:02:33.459> ways

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
we have games we have varieties of ways

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.330 
we have games we have varieties of ways
to<00:02:34.420> teach<00:02:34.599> the<00:02:34.780> skill<00:02:35.049> we<00:02:35.590> find<00:02:35.799> that<00:02:35.980> learning

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
to teach the skill we find that learning

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.330 
to teach the skill we find that learning
is<00:02:36.549> much<00:02:37.030> easier<00:02:37.510> much<00:02:37.720> faster<00:02:38.260> when<00:02:39.129> kids

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
is much easier much faster when kids

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.630 
is much easier much faster when kids
enjoy<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.819> are<00:02:39.910> engaged<00:02:40.030> in<00:02:40.420> our<00:02:40.510> lesson
