illustrate this with a bit of a prop so

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.820 
illustrate this with a bit of a prop so
for<00:00:39.330> example<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.960> most<00:00:40.230> games<00:00:40.440> your<00:00:40.680> cover

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:40.830 
for example in most games your cover

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.230 
for example in most games your cover
system<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.190> kind<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.460> like<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:41.940> pick<00:00:42.090> out

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:42.240 
system is kind of like you just pick out

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.050 
system is kind of like you just pick out
that's<00:00:42.960> all<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.230> do<00:00:43.380> but<00:00:43.800> for<00:00:43.980> us<00:00:44.130> you<00:00:44.700> allowed

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
that's all you do but for us you allowed

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.450 
that's all you do but for us you allowed
to<00:00:45.240> pick<00:00:45.420> all<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.840> way<00:00:45.930> around<00:00:46.130> so<00:00:47.130> you<00:00:47.160> can

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
to pick all the way around so you can

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.490 
to pick all the way around so you can
even<00:00:47.640> pick<00:00:47.880> over<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.720> you<00:00:48.810> kind<00:00:48.990> of<00:00:49.050> sweep<00:00:49.380> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
even pick over and you kind of sweep the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.590 
even pick over and you kind of sweep the
area<00:00:49.620> under<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.760> one<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.240> beauties<00:00:51.540> of

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
area under it so one of the beauties of

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.660 
area under it so one of the beauties of
the<00:00:51.840> cover<00:00:52.020> system<00:00:52.200> is<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.489> actually

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the cover system is that it actually

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.910 
the cover system is that it actually
reduces<00:00:54.090> your<00:00:54.450> recoil<00:00:54.840> actually<00:00:55.410> increases

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
reduces your recoil actually increases

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.950 
reduces your recoil actually increases
your<00:00:56.010> accuracy<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.610> it's<00:00:57.210> critical<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.780> this

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
your accuracy and it's critical to this

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.020 
your accuracy and it's critical to this
game<00:00:58.230> if<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.829> do<00:00:58.950> not<00:00:59.070> use<00:00:59.220> cover<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.850> will

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
game if you do not use cover you will

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.569 
game if you do not use cover you will
die<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:01.320> one<00:01:01.530> thing<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.739> we<00:01:02.010> really<00:01:02.040> wanted

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
die so one thing that we really wanted

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.630 
die so one thing that we really wanted

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.859 
example devs will be basically running
the<00:01:57.100> game<00:01:57.310> they'll<00:01:57.670> be<00:01:57.789> giving<00:01:57.880> opinions<00:01:58.270> and

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
the game they'll be giving opinions and

00:01:58.869 --> 00:01:59.880 
the game they'll be giving opinions and
then<00:01:58.990> they'll<00:01:59.110> come<00:01:59.229> back<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.500> me<00:01:59.619> and<00:01:59.740> say

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
then they'll come back to me and say

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.820 
then they'll come back to me and say
okay<00:02:00.610> so<00:02:01.000> this<00:02:01.149> is<00:02:01.330> what<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.569> guns<00:02:01.780> are<00:02:01.990> they

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
okay so this is what the guns are they

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.260 
okay so this is what the guns are they
feel<00:02:03.069> a<00:02:03.100> bit<00:02:03.250> underpowered<00:02:03.520> this<00:02:03.970> particular

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
feel a bit underpowered this particular

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.789 
feel a bit underpowered this particular
weapon<00:02:04.539> this<00:02:04.960> doesn't<00:02:05.170> feel<00:02:05.289> right<00:02:05.649> the

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
weapon this doesn't feel right the

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.919 
weapon this doesn't feel right the
recalls<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.310> hyper<00:02:06.580> hats<00:02:06.909> and<00:02:07.179> after<00:02:07.780> we

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
recalls to hyper hats and after we

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.840 
recalls to hyper hats and after we
collates<00:02:08.470> all<00:02:08.619> this<00:02:08.739> experience<00:02:09.069> we<00:02:09.549> just

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
collates all this experience we just

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.240 
collates all this experience we just
have<00:02:10.539> an<00:02:10.660> analysis<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:11.440> beyond<00:02:11.799> which<00:02:11.950> we<00:02:12.100> go

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
have an analysis and beyond which we go

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.820 
have an analysis and beyond which we go
okay<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.269> think<00:02:13.750> we<00:02:13.870> know<00:02:13.989> what<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.230> do<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:14.620> they

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
okay I think we know what to do and they

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.229 
okay I think we know what to do and they
will<00:02:14.950> try<00:02:15.100> it<00:02:15.160> again<00:02:15.280> until<00:02:15.610> such<00:02:15.970> time<00:02:16.209> that

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
will try it again until such time that

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.330 
will try it again until such time that
everyone<00:02:16.600> is<00:02:16.810> satisfied<00:02:16.930> then<00:02:17.290> we<00:02:17.530> go<00:02:17.680> ok

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
everyone is satisfied then we go ok

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.039 
everyone is satisfied then we go ok
perhaps<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.120> players<00:02:19.330> get<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.540> shot<00:02:19.720> at<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:19.930> now

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
perhaps the players get a shot at it now

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.080 
perhaps the players get a shot at it now
we<00:02:20.530> don't<00:02:20.739> push<00:02:21.100> something<00:02:21.400> out<00:02:21.670> if<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:21.910> don't

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
intention in terms of design but it's

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.819 
intention in terms of design but it's
