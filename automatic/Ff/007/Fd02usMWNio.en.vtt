00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.529
 hello people today, by the way, will be today 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.719
 with a new book in front and that 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.540
 today with the topic smartphone 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.280
 pricing policy yes it's a big topic 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.470
 and I'll just try it all 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.990
 in a little want to summarize 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.810
 So what am I talking about? 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.490
 should go to the prices of smartphones 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.710
 and I'll just stop some 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.750
 analyze and see what manufacturers 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.699
 the smartphones really cost 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.710
 First, I want to watch something 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.620
 smartphone really in production 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.930
 costs and afterwards if we have a few top 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.510
 compare smartphones and there the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.190
 difference of prices analyze afterwards 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.829
 we will look like the smartphones 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.660
 then get your final price 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.760
 everything is in it and last 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.739
 'd try to look the future 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.530
 how the prices are still changing 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.570
 So be curious if we are 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.550
 want to see what a smartphone in the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.190
 production costs we need first 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.399
 pay and pay these were supposedly 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.610
 from a web site yes allegedly 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.170
 the iphone 5 is supposed to be in production only 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.640
 cost about 170 dollars 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.130
 So here you see now as the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.640
 All together, the display closes 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.590
 costs 44 dollars the lte chip 24 dollars 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.560
 and so on, so that really is 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.320
 small small amounts and one comes 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.700
 really only to 170 dollars of course 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.950
 it is not given that these prices 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.299
 but we agree as we do the technology 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.610
 know and how they just always 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.590
 cheaper it will see me one nsds 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.000
 we just want to last in the last 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.369
 two years so much cheaper 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.159
 So that can already happen now 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.619
 we want the price of an old from 5 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.170
 Let's get to know each other 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.020
 Prices of competition so watch from 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.899
 the right prices as they are in the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.540
 load stand so the iphone is in 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.990
 load for 679 euros 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:02.610
 the HTC want for 729 euros 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:06.770
 the samsung galaxy s 4 for 649 and that 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.789
 sony xperia set for 559 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.560
 so if we still have it all now 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.800
 then look at that of the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.450
 cheapest to the most expensive smartphone 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.310
 170 euro differences why is that 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.740
 Sony were not so much lately 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.570
 active in the smartphone market and therefore has 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.610
 a bit back 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.440
 But they have tried it with sony 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.720
 xperia looks to balance 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.030
 they made it a little cheaper but 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.160
 but also very powerful 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.740
 therefore get this free existence 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.670
 but what exactly does this smartphone do 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.550
 is so expensive 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.410
 yes, I have asked myself and 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.990
 we are there a few thoughts in the 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.000
 come and indeed if it once 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.970
 Of course, the material costs the like us 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.650
 have not seen are so extremely expensive 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.470
 then of course that comes 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.360
 software costs so a software 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.690
 the need to develop it eg stop at 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.670
 apple ios on the whole android phones 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.910
 it is already something different from na 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.450
 clearly so samsung nadal touchwiz and htc 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.220
 pays flashing and her sense surface 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.770
 Of course everything will be there anyway 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.060
 that's not a big part either 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.130
 I think I can my 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.850
 developing software costs now 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.370
 not 300 dollars or 300 euros at this 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.530
 Apple also has a huge advantage 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.730
 since they are the first smartphone on the 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.680
 market 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.340
 Maybe it was not the first thing 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.620
 was the most innovative yes they had like that 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.560
 early on, and could do so 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.480
 set the price at the same time very high 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.180
 that is of course for the competition 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.930
 It has been a bit difficult to do that 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.489
 compete 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.380
 So if we have one now 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.140
 draw then we have 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:52.239
 about 100 to 200 euro material costs 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:55.670
 and say 100 to 150 euros 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.540
 software that was it and what with that 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.820
 remaining money 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.380
 the team is just so out of the bag 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.540
 Of course they also want something else 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.040
 win and that's not just a little 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.920
 but pretty much like you are here 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.820
 see and why do you do that 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.910
 It can be easy 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.440
 The companies are so big and so powerful 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.480
 You can simply ask for price 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.090
 Either you buy or you do not buy 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.080
 point around the wild wings something else 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.570
 round 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:24.169
 The last question will be smartphones 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.950
 more or less expensive future first the 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.220
 sword 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.890
 since one does not know the price range is so 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:34.220
 great and you have seen that htc 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:38.030
 bonn is currently more expensive than the iphone 5 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.070
 but again the google nexus 4g is supposed to 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.090
 just 300 euros with eight gigabytes 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.060
 to save 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.980
 if you buy with 16 gigabytes buys 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.980
 the 50 euro just more 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.050
 So we have the top smartphones 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.780
 seen for 300 euro but we have 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.180
 Even top smartphones seen for 700 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.590
 euro and more 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.720
 yes it's just a matter of time 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.010
 we have to wait and we can not do that 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.230
 possible to predict 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.970
 and if you want, you can 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.280
 your opinion on the whole 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.000
 smartphone praise in the comments 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.920
 write 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.500
 I'll be interested in what 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.000
 You continue to think so of me 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.760
 I hope I had this little video 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.650
 If that's the case then you can 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.730
 like to give a thumbs up and 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.190
 help more 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.310
 until then subscribe to comment and 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.310
 ciao
