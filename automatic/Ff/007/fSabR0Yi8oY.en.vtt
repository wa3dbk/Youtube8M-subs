00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.709
 as proud as i was i still have the drawing 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.370
 when i got there i'm sure i think you think it is beautiful 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.569
 flower 

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:10.879
 strain progress stamens 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.399
 hey to set up 

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:16.379
 he looked part of the fen with his own saying 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.640
 have you ever thought anp 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.239
 also pole 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:23.239
 another such posts at the office and came out to be able to set up 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.079
 maybe something for such that easy set 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.029
 and then I realized 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.029
 why this man had become such a successful park 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.710
 those 10 make it spontaneous 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.000
 not the intelligent 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.460
 look back 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.950
 say yourself 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.750
 it has no concise romance 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.590
 again tighter experience it was always for the Netherlands to finish the line 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.610
 wednesday samang peter wendel spurt workshops visited where modulated 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.620
 was after his drawings 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.730
 that was a tackle 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.830
 because they always make sense because raging statements about the work that dylan that 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:03.350
 used to be 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.960
 but then he had a hand of pumping here and there some small ones 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.920
 make a change to the uncircumcised other 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.520
 but when you make those changes well then you knew you 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.840
 swallowed up a bit 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.670
 yes that is why it was time for me to be able to use the mild dictator 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.480
 impose 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.390
 was in place 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.590
 tomtom peaks when he lived the day of his retirement 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.930
 because then he sails like he himself 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.930
 see all the peace in the old-fashioned way 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.430
 as the first chance he got a tin plate with two suits 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.500
 the painting with poli paint has always been a great passion 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.530
 a beautiful series comes a peak paintings was the result 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.550
 in his last years of life, anton peak had a close relationship with the writer 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.660
 in the ride of the week that henk looks hospitable in his office 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.720
 first meeting with peaks on was beautiful you look is like is one 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.810
 mexican 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.660
 and then not taken out of time and at all 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.660
 with the backhand and get to know 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.259
 which immediately all plan 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.679
 because of that I had the feeling that the man lived there 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:17.839
 with an enormous passion for his work and with an enormous attention for the 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:21.329
 beauty clock that share that whole room with someone who is interested in it 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:27.819
 his office tankink is perhaps best described as an oasis 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.979
 came in from rest 

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:32.439
 celebrate the world outside of bush 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:37.429
 it is so that pulled made see max 3 inter 9 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:40.539
 madrid the floor mats but something to dry up lower 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:46.010
 after the very dry ones he used after the sea that was but that smelled 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:47.789
 your profit is always ready 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:51.589
 i think the person lands to piet maybe the best he draws is by 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.229
 the boats that you do yourself 

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:57.209
 and the music center had to draw itself 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.349
 so there was a shed we fly someone who was a bit by the practice 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.669
 soaked 27 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.669
 but they still remained closed and it might be 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:10.999
 for a mayor who could draw and of our natural 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:13.129
 in the second instance 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.849
 because we clear that the syria 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.049
 able to get to know a great man who otherwise might indeed 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.309
 Cinderella 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:23.739
 will have remained closed and where to guess what is actually in it 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.549
 Boston 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.149
 the last few months there was a bit uneasy 

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:30.779
 the helpless as he says himself 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:34.859
 so he must play that must have had his time no longer but just 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.299
 one way this is my great passion resold pencil and paper gasoline 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.679
 for tipping plans for years 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:46.349
 do there are also some work very hard work less than when falling 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.349
 that is what happened in a way 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:56.629
 ontopic with europe league the best pitcher customer picked up at pinkpop hour 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:03.749
 the v70 years of ton anbeek have remained in this ode chair behind this table 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:07.589
 the many beautiful drawings made can now only be enjoyed 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:12.489
 it's me that it's a mystery where time has come to get one 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.649
 person bulky much to sharpen 

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:20.979
 and the night of the twent on November 25, 987 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.590
 the sample died at the age of 92 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.930
 the unfinished chords on the table 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.770
 is a silent witness 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.469
 of this already in society 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:37.469
 and so once said all weekdays was the choice 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:40.479
 if there was a place alleged remo 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.180
 then I hope that open drawing board must wait for this
