close<00:01:27.750> up<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.109> map<00:01:28.319> walkthrough<00:01:29.130> for<00:01:29.310> now

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:29.569 
close up the map walkthrough for now

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:32.330 
close up the map walkthrough for now
this<00:01:30.569> is<00:01:30.719> the<00:01:30.840> third<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.200> final<00:01:31.350> one<00:01:31.649> this<00:01:32.189> is

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
this is the third and final one this is

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.740 
this is the third and final one this is
one<00:01:32.549> that's<00:01:32.700> all<00:01:32.880> over<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.270> internet<00:01:33.600> right

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
one that's all over the internet right

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.469 
one that's all over the internet right
now<00:01:36.590> it<00:01:37.590> takes<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.950> up<00:01:38.069> to<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.399> actual<00:01:38.880> top<00:01:39.240> of

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
now it takes you up to the actual top of

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.480 
now it takes you up to the actual top of
this<00:01:39.630> building<00:01:39.979> south<00:01:40.979> side<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.429> building

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
this building south side of the building

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.919 
this building south side of the building
self<00:01:42.390> building<00:01:42.810> pardon<00:01:43.049> me<00:01:43.109> and<00:01:44.479> this<00:01:45.479> may

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
self building pardon me and this may

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:47.330 
self building pardon me and this may
very<00:01:46.200> well<00:01:46.319> be<00:01:46.469> classified<00:01:46.920> as<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.069> glitch

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
very well be classified as a glitch

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.520 
very well be classified as a glitch
considering<00:01:47.850> its<00:01:48.000> difficulty<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:49.140> once<00:01:49.200> you

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
considering its difficulty but once you

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.319 
considering its difficulty but once you
figure<00:01:49.890> out<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.130> trick<00:01:50.159> it's<00:01:50.849> actually<00:01:51.209> not

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
figure out the trick it's actually not

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.770 
figure out the trick it's actually not
that<00:01:51.390> difficult<00:01:53.179> and<00:01:54.179> I<00:01:54.239> don't<00:01:54.420> know<00:01:54.479> how<00:01:54.659> much

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
that difficult and I don't know how much

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.240 
that difficult and I don't know how much
of<00:01:54.929> an<00:01:54.989> advantage<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.649> really<00:01:55.920> gives<00:01:56.069> you

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
of an advantage it really gives you

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.679 
of an advantage it really gives you
since<00:01:56.489> it<00:01:56.640> takes<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.939> lot<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.090> time<00:01:57.209> and<00:01:57.599> in<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
since it takes a lot of time and in the

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.059 
since it takes a lot of time and in the
midst<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.170> battle<00:01:58.200> where<00:01:58.649> you're<00:01:58.799> running

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
midst of a battle where you're running

in between people should be shooting

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.959 
in between people should be shooting
everywhere<00:02:01.259> it's<00:02:01.950> not<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.399> easiest<00:02:02.429> to<00:02:02.849> get

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
everywhere it's not the easiest to get

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.199 
everywhere it's not the easiest to get
up<00:02:03.149> but<00:02:03.599> for<00:02:03.780> those<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:03.959> do<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:05.030> again<00:02:06.030> have

jumping on these scaffoldings it's

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.130 
jumping on these scaffoldings it's
pretty<00:02:47.130> simple<00:02:47.450> depending<00:02:48.450> on<00:02:48.570> which<00:02:48.810> little

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140

where you come from are you jumping from
the<00:02:51.390> helipad<00:02:51.690> then<00:02:52.020> you<00:02:52.110> jump<00:02:52.320> from<00:02:52.470> these<00:02:52.650> two

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
the helipad then you jump from these two

the helipad then you jump from these two
all<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.970> way<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.270> elevator<00:02:54.390> shaft<00:02:54.690> if
