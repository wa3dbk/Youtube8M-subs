 I want to do the long ago of you and everyone Hello of er this time Monet surface pick of the screen 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.900
 We think 

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:16.330
 0.3 Use it a little a lot of this added tension in the new version 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:17.170
 I tried to create an ephemeral little plane I created an opportunity to spread the wings in the air 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.170
 I tried to make 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:26.480
 Tteyuu has taken this time Jung thought the kana Let's doing there by 8 the 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.920
 Turn the ne propeller is in the Well have gotten you are Hey last time a little request no water 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.790
 Than there was is that I want 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.430
 Well that there has been little first added to doing or let's that Aja new 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.140
 Let's turn this propeller towards 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:41.140
 I either was that Neeee 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:45.670
 Such propeller I also say Unmary 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:50.710
 Hey, but I think that it is not chopsticks changes to in such a Nante say you or I bulls 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:54.740
 At first I think that I would like to do after the paper sinking and I want to do it 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:58.790
 I've been lying for a while now 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:03.320
 Almost no change it is also turning in non-water 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:14.440
 I think I get that air Yes er like this Dechotto 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:14.440
 I 'll tell you I 'll buy this ah I 'll wait to sew Dakaijin Anomachi Otsuka 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.800
 Now 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:27.750
 It looks like this 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:40.510
 Property in the Hi that no one really likes coupon of good water eh ia water stain 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:40.820
 No you yeah do that if it is possible to say frozen something Minnie 9 b 3-inch A'a' 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.050
 so 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:49.729
 But I want you to do that I want you to er also I Somehow a 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.270
 Originally in the er Yes Let's stretched towards the Masei yer little body Please comment 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.360
 sound of 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:58.230
 I think it will be deployed in the air and fly a plane 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:02.030
 It's just here 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.030
 It did not shed west sponge Chi change 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:11.690
 It but is squishy It is such a feeling of let's skip Yes 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:18.410
 Do you say can skip to glide I did Nante here normally and er in Ahhai 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:19.310
 a You can do interesting things. Almost without sliding, of course the engine is that city 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.260
 I do 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.650
 Let's fly away to take a breath 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.650
 I would like to see a little ne masu who there want to put here you can 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.670
 You go 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.670
 Chatty chat 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.349
 I'm sorry to that 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:42.290
 It was reverse Yes that hinge was bent in reverse 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.290
 The next thing will be successful 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.900
 By 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:58.300
 How is this feeling of stability from now on? 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:01.390
 Well I did not think quite Ne can but it is amazing surely such a thing unexpectedly 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:05.020
 But it was limp serves as normally I can firmly flight by this also 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:08.090
 That's Lapita 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.050
 I'm not a giant, but I remember that something like this flower 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.050
 I ignited and flew 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.990
 Well I wow I This unexpectedly and bent me cat I do there is no limp broken wings 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.410
 It returned to the original but a firm posture Te Ne elaborate 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.540
 Can fly 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.930
 Please take a moment 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.930
 By 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.900
 Yes yes yes I'm fine, but this one is liked 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.030
 Oh 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:39.319
 No, this is amazing , it's in the air 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.319
 I'll just that little can kindergarten is I fly now put away you But normally 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:49.810
 Buber such it this way poor people skirt that you can skip to expand the air Hey wings 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.959
 It however was I honestly I goods in the can 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.740
 It is something that is added with something quite various 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.140
 It is fun to put on various things 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.760
 To say 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:05.280
 There Hey, do not listen Huh 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.500
 Well, this time I was trying to make this kind of sound air-ignited airplane like this 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.000
 so 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:13.750
 Long cast has high do you will not be strange story I love another after that 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.799
 Let's face each other now 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:23.240
 Yes I am doing it with ada 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:28.400
 You can spread it out and slide it off like a child . 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:31.409
 Oh engine is not that you can not Well normal flight I even take what pieces 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.490
 It feels like this and you can fly normally 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:36.990
 Elsewhere who've spent 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:41.320
 It is somewhat shaky- 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:44.680
 Maa like this a a Ginjo yeah 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:48.910
 I tried to make an airplane sound that I would not normally make 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:52.560
 a How was it? It has really become shorter this time 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:57.200
 Although it does not come to do something this new 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.360
 Hit was the little I sight How to Let's Do Well day like this is you limit 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.889
 Training changes 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:10.460
 So to say Well, I do not do because what can this Gane 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:15.440
 I Tteyuu be completely stable at great'm a sense of stability this is ne Oh poor of the airplane in 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:18.460
 Nde I'm wings of the I limp but not Tara call it that resistance to reverse 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.470
 I think this is pretty cool 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:25.140
 Haha 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:25.920
 I can not fly in a stable manner, but if the battle has begun , it will also be broken down into the air 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.900
 It is not 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:32.760
 In a sense that it is good I can fly over firmly and that I bring out like this 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:38.010
 It looks like it's a very stable glider 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.460
 I can take a bus, but it's not very good to fly to the summer situation 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.460
 Or 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.569
 Take advantage of this 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.680
 If you do that, even if you give it a lot of speed, maybe an airplane that doesn't differentiate on an empty space 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:50.050
 Not you make 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.710
 I can not make it but I can not make it, but I'm finished this time a little bit this time 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.220
 As to 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:57.430
 In terms of creating a plane that can be deployed in the air 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:01.660
 I'm either eh time would have been everyone how to experiment 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.680
 Anomata This is also I was carrying I request that was drawing one request picture but that 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.340
 I made before 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:10.180
 A very realistic bomb 3 years old 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:12.310
 I think that I will try to fly a bit 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.800
 Once closed 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.969
 To rebuild 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.880
 he 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:21.979
 Does this go well Why do not you open 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.400
 AMELICA USA 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:27.750
 Oh ha 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.590
 Yes, this time I think it will end with such a feeling If you do n't like Chapter 5 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.270
 Thank you very much 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.270
 It was noodles pics thunder was Kurosuke
