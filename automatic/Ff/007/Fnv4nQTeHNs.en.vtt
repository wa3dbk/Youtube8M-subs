00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
going to cover right now basically a

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.499 
going to cover right now basically a
couple<00:01:30.399> of<00:01:30.670> different<00:01:30.970> points<00:01:31.090> like<00:01:31.360> had<00:01:31.479> a

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
couple of different points like had a

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:32.760 
couple of different points like had a
paddle<00:01:31.810> on<00:01:31.869> the<00:01:31.960> board<00:01:32.170> would<00:01:32.409> be<00:01:32.500> one<00:01:32.619> of<00:01:32.649> the

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
paddle on the board would be one of the

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.800 
paddle on the board would be one of the
most<00:01:32.890> important<00:01:33.340> parts<00:01:33.580> the<00:01:34.360> easier<00:01:34.690> we<00:01:34.780> make

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
most important parts the easier we make

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.990 
most important parts the easier we make
paddling<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.830> longer<00:01:36.369> and<00:01:36.549> more<00:01:36.640> energy

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
paddling the longer and more energy

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.490 
paddling the longer and more energy
you'll<00:01:37.149> have<00:01:37.270> out<00:01:37.479> there<00:01:37.509> in<00:01:37.690> the<00:01:37.780> water<00:01:37.930> so<00:01:38.259> it

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
you'll have out there in the water so it

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.719 
you'll have out there in the water so it
can<00:01:38.619> be<00:01:38.740> difficult<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.190> paddle<00:01:39.520> so<00:01:39.610> we'll

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
can be difficult to paddle so we'll

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.249 
can be difficult to paddle so we'll
cover<00:01:39.850> that<00:01:39.970> first<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.390> then<00:01:40.450> quickly<00:01:41.140> we'll

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
cover that first and then quickly we'll

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.779 
cover that first and then quickly we'll
go<00:01:41.350> over<00:01:41.500> how<00:01:41.619> to<00:01:41.649> pop<00:01:41.860> up<00:01:42.039> stand<00:01:42.280> surf<00:01:42.490> on<00:01:42.640> top

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
go over how to pop up stand surf on top
