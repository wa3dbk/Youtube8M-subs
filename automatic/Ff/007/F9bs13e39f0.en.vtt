00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.980 
notice the the key here is getting my
upper<00:02:15.430> body<00:02:15.670> up<00:02:15.970> high<00:02:16.240> enough<00:02:16.540> so<00:02:16.720> that<00:02:16.780> the

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
upper body up high enough so that the

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.950 
upper body up high enough so that the
stomach<00:02:17.260> is<00:02:17.650> engaged<00:02:19.170> okay<00:02:20.400> moving<00:02:21.400> along<00:02:21.960> the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
stomach is engaged okay moving along the

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.550 
stomach is engaged okay moving along the
next<00:02:23.380> exercise<00:02:23.710> is<00:02:24.430> exactly<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.360> same<00:02:25.660> the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
next exercise is exactly the same the

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.980 
next exercise is exactly the same the
only<00:02:26.590> difference<00:02:26.950> is<00:02:27.820> instead<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.750> feet

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
only difference is instead of the feet

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.110 
only difference is instead of the feet
going<00:02:29.230> up<00:02:29.470> and<00:02:29.650> down<00:02:29.770> like<00:02:29.950> this<00:02:30.120> they're

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
going up and down like this they're

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.990 
going up and down like this they're
going<00:02:31.570> over<00:02:32.560> this<00:02:33.130> way<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:34.150> it's<00:02:34.360> scissors<00:02:36.000> the

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
going over this way so it's scissors the

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.140 
going over this way so it's scissors the
other<00:02:37.210> direction<00:02:38.160> alright<00:02:39.160> so<00:02:39.430> again<00:02:39.700> it's

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
other direction alright so again it's

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.600 
other direction alright so again it's
exactly<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.810> same<00:02:41.020> if<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:41.800> would<00:02:41.950> embrace<00:02:42.070> my

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
exactly the same if I would embrace my

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
head and my upper body up high enough so

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.220 
head and my upper body up high enough so
my<00:02:45.790> stomach<00:02:46.000> is<00:02:46.240> held<00:02:46.450> in<00:02:46.570> tight<00:02:46.750> I'm<00:02:47.020> going<00:02:47.140> to
