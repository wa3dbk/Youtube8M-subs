00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.559 

ham<00:02:53.950> looks<00:02:54.130> like<00:02:54.400> was<00:02:54.640> operating

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:17.300 

the<00:02:59.629> crankcase<00:03:00.319> after<00:03:00.650> a<00:03:00.680> bitch

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.130 

fifty-five<00:03:17.850> rpm<00:03:18.330> that's<00:03:18.630> about<00:03:18.900> what<00:03:19.110> it

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
fifty-five rpm that's about what it

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.059 
fifty-five rpm that's about what it
takes<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.680> start<00:03:19.950> an<00:03:20.100> engine

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
takes to start an engine

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:27.910 
takes to start an engine
with<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.400> starter

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
so if you can imagine this thing go on

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.350 
so if you can imagine this thing go on
ten<00:03:31.350> times<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.800> fast<00:03:32.010> 5,000<00:03:32.730> rpm<00:03:33.060> what<00:03:33.180> would

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
ten times that fast 5,000 rpm what would

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.810 
ten times that fast 5,000 rpm what would
look<00:03:33.510> like<00:03:33.780> whoopee<00:03:34.310> well<00:03:35.310> anyway<00:03:35.550> if<00:03:35.700> you
