00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Our theme for this day is an introduction to light. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.310
 Light is a form of energy that enables us to see all the things around us. 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.280
 The main source of light on earth is the sun. 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.000
 Plants are able to prepare their food using sunlight. 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.480
 Some other things also give light. 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.000
 They are known as luminous objects. 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:27.540
 For example, lamps, lamps, candles, etc. are luminous objects. 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.190
 While there are some objects that do not give light. 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.360
 They are known as non-luminous objects. 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:57.430
 For example table, cloth, bag, pots, etc. are non-luminous objects. 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:08.320
 Objects are generally luminous of two types, transparent objects and opaque objects. 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:16.890
 Transparent objects are those that allow light to pass through them, such as glass, water, etc. 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:27.000
 While, non-transparent objects are those that do not allow the light to pass through them, such as wood, stone etc.
