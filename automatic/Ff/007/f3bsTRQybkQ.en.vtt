00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:15.189
 this cake passion fruit mousse 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.550
 ingredients that we will need are 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:22.130
 200 grams of vanilla cookies 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.980
 150 grams of unsalted butter 2 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.640
 Spoons of powdered sugar half a kilo 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.730
 passion fruit or passion fruit 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:34.670
 a cup of white sugar 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.780
 20 grams of grenetine powder weight 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.760
 400 milliliters of milk cream 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.160
 we will start taking our cookies 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.710
 vanilla and we're going to put them all in 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.620
 a food processor 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.399
 if you did not have one, you can 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.170
 use a sturdy plastic bag 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.239
 tightness of preference and we're going to 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.519
 start crushing the cookies up 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.600
 get a fine village another option 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.600
 it would also liquefy 2 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.530
 once we have our powder 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.440
 cookies we are going to put them all in one 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.650
 bowl and there we will add the 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.310
 margarine or melted butter 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:22.970
 I will retain the microwave / standard 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.680
 10 to 15 seconds and moving 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.680
 constantly also the sugar in 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.080
 powder let's stir this mixture let's 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.510
 to join the good until you get a 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.510
 texture more or less similar to this one 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.159
 and with it we are going to cover our mold 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:43.090
 that must previously be greased with 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.090
 a little butter 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.390
 we can all this mix and we're going 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.390
 flatten 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.820
 If you want you can use a hoop 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.820
 I'm using a cake mold 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.730
 We're going to take it to the oven for 10 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.060
 minutes only 10 minutes there you have to 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.940
 control it very well 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.870
 apart let's make our fill and 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.420
 we cut the passion fruit 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.459
 we remove the pulp 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.410
 and we will strain it to obtain 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.380
 only the juice 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.200
 If you wish, you can use the seeds 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.640
 washed and well cleaned to decorate but 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.640
 I'm going to use chocolate 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.060
 we take out all the juice 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.440
 in a saucepan or in a pot we go to 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.500
 put our cup of sugar together with 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.350
 the juice 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.069
 let's stir a little 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:52.349
 already low fire 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.349
 let's wait for a thread to form 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:00.980
 that more or less should be like that but a 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:00.980
 little more resistant right now I value it 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.549
 this point is called strong thread but 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.700
 should stay longer sustained 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.700
 something like that 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.560
 apart let's hydrate our 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:24.370
 Grenetina or our tail fish with 210 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.400
 milliliters of cold water we are going to 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.300
 bring to melt in the microwave also 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.820
 and once I felt good 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.410
 let's prepare it to put our 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.360
 mixture 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.790
 right now I'm whisking the cream 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.500
 let's hope it has a midpoint 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.050
 more or less like this does not completely 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.810
 mounted 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.090
 and add by the sides and little to 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.420
 little bit 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.470
 the syrup or honey we have made 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.470
 We reserve a little to decorate 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.870
 we beat a little 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:03.840
 not much because you can cut 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:07.910
 we add the already dissolved collapse 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.910
 and we beat again just a moment 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.990
 we finished incorporating our 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.540
 ingredients with a spatula 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.859
 to then pass it to our base of 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.770
 cookies 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.810
 we spread very very well we try that 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.530
 be little here they see that I am 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:32.349
 decorating already with what I left of honey 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.710
 or the syrup that we made is called as 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:37.860
 of honey I made like some little lines like that 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.659
 a zigzag 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.360
 and the sweet of our dessert goes to 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:45.289
 depend on which accounts you excuse 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.289
 how much honey we leave 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.250
 good have milk cream can 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.470
 use evaporated milk also frost 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.620
 and almost frosty wash and mental 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:07.070
 preference use white sugar and not 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.070
 blonde 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.910
 the butter must be without salt because 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.150
 if not the mass enough butter is 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.150
 salad 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.580
 because if it does not get very hard and it's going to be 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.260
 says to cut thank you very much for watching 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.870
