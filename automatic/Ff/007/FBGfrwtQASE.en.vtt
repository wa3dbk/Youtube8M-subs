00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
tutorial very simple I've just put tape

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.160 
tutorial very simple I've just put tape
around<00:00:17.609> my<00:00:17.730> paper<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.420> make<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.779> little<00:00:18.960> bit

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
around my paper to make it a little bit

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.200 
around my paper to make it a little bit
easier<00:00:19.500> for<00:00:19.560> me<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:20.070> some<00:00:20.250> edges<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.789> to

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
easier for me to have some edges and to

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.420 
easier for me to have some edges and to
create<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.779> frame<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.740> I'm<00:00:22.859> just<00:00:23.039> using<00:00:23.220> a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
create a frame so I'm just using a

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.890 
create a frame so I'm just using a
bigger<00:00:23.609> brush<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.029> I'm<00:00:24.119> just<00:00:24.150> making<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.660> big

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900

bigger brush and I'm just making a big
puddle<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.619> water<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:26.279> my<00:00:26.519> tray<00:00:26.789> cuz<00:00:27.150> I'm<00:00:27.269> gonna

puddle of water in my tray cuz I'm gonna

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.480 
puddle of water in my tray cuz I'm gonna
first<00:00:27.750> paint<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.320> background<00:00:28.529> which<00:00:29.130> would

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
first paint the background which would

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.189 
first paint the background which would
be<00:00:29.670> if<00:00:29.939> you're<00:00:30.090> looking<00:00:30.359> at<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> landscape<00:00:30.779> it

would be the sky and the landscape we're
gonna<00:00:33.300> be<00:00:33.480> painting<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.020> as<00:00:34.230> if<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.710> were

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
gonna be painting is as if we were

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.650 
gonna be painting is as if we were
sitting<00:00:35.399> on<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.550> mountain<00:00:35.730> looking<00:00:36.270> down<00:00:36.510> at

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
sitting on a mountain looking down at

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.389 
sitting on a mountain looking down at
the<00:00:36.750> valley<00:00:36.960> or<00:00:37.230> other<00:00:37.500> mountains<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.280> I'm

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
the valley or other mountains so I'm

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.720 
the valley or other mountains so I'm
going<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.550> use<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> little<00:00:38.879> bit<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.149> blue<00:00:40.730> now

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
going to use a little bit of blue now

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.950 
going to use a little bit of blue now
since<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.239> going<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.660> be<00:00:42.750> something

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
since this is going to be something

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.330 
since this is going to be something
that's<00:00:43.200> farthest<00:00:43.649> away<00:00:43.800> from<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.280> is

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
that's farthest away from it this is

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.700 
that's farthest away from it this is
going<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.820> be<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.450> lioness<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.320> dullest

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
going to be the lioness and the dullest

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.290 
going to be the lioness and the dullest
color<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.280> as<00:00:47.370> things<00:00:47.640> move<00:00:47.850> further<00:00:48.090> away

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
color so as things move further away

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.029 
color so as things move further away
from<00:00:48.420> us<00:00:48.750> they<00:00:48.960> get<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.140> little<00:00:49.440> bit<00:00:49.559> duller<00:00:49.800> a

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
from us they get a little bit duller a

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.560 
from us they get a little bit duller a
little<00:00:50.309> bit<00:00:50.430> bluer<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.360> called

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
little bit bluer and that is called

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.380 
little bit bluer and that is called
atmospheric<00:00:52.469> perspective<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:54.030> make<00:00:54.180> this

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
atmospheric perspective so to make this

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.600 
atmospheric perspective so to make this
a<00:00:54.449> little<00:00:54.750> bit<00:00:55.020> duller<00:00:55.440> I'm<00:00:55.800> going<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.460> could

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
a little bit duller I'm going you could

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.849 
a little bit duller I'm going you could
add<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> few<00:00:57.180> different<00:00:57.899> colors<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.500> I'm

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
add a few different colors to it I'm

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.939 
add a few different colors to it I'm
going<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.430> add<00:00:59.670> a<00:01:00.030> little<00:01:00.210> bit<00:01:00.420> orange<00:01:00.949> it's

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
going to add a little bit orange it's

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.100 
going to add a little bit orange it's
gonna<00:01:02.100> kind<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.430> turn<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.760> into<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.059> grey<00:01:03.600> you

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
gonna kind of turn it into a grey you

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.960 
gonna kind of turn it into a grey you
might<00:01:04.260> want<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.500> just<00:01:04.680> test<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.519> paper

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
might want to just test it on a paper

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.730 
might want to just test it on a paper
towel<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.510> make<00:01:06.540> sure<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.200> color<00:01:07.409> that

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
towel to make sure it's the color that

towel to make sure it's the color that
you<00:01:07.860> want<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.430> I'll<00:01:08.549> usually<00:01:08.700> just<00:01:09.590> brush<00:01:10.590> it

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
you want so I'll usually just brush it

you want so I'll usually just brush it
on<00:01:10.799> there's<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.159> toe<00:01:11.220> or<00:01:11.610> another<00:01:11.909> piece<00:01:12.150> of

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
on there's a toe or another piece of

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.730 
on there's a toe or another piece of
watercolor<00:01:12.510> paper<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.110> works<00:01:13.290> too<00:01:13.530> and

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
watercolor paper and that works too and

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.260 
watercolor paper and that works too and
then<00:01:13.890> you're<00:01:13.979> gonna<00:01:14.070> paint<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.400> your<00:01:14.430> sky<00:01:14.729> to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
this is still work it's kind of hard to

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.719 
this is still work it's kind of hard to
get<00:01:23.790> used<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.180> painting<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.780> way<00:01:25.520> you<00:01:26.520> just

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
get used to painting that way you just

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.149 
get used to painting that way you just
want<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.970> make<00:01:27.119> sure<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:28.320> can<00:01:28.500> go<00:01:28.650> back<00:01:28.920> in

want to make sure you can go back in

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.910 
want to make sure you can go back in
lightly<00:01:30.150> in<00:01:30.540> places<00:01:31.020> but<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.229> don't<00:01:31.560> want<00:01:31.799> to

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
lightly in places but you don't want to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.700 
lightly in places but you don't want to
scrub<00:01:32.490> your<00:01:32.939> paper

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
scrub your paper

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.960 
scrub your paper
scrubbing<00:01:34.710> would<00:01:34.950> be<00:01:35.070> if<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.280> kept<00:01:35.490> going<00:01:35.759> back

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
scrubbing would be if I kept going back

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.280 
scrubbing would be if I kept going back
and<00:01:36.030> forth<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.509> back<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.659> forth<00:01:36.869> and

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
and forth and back and forth and

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.719 
and forth and back and forth and
eventually<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.950> would<00:01:38.040> rub<00:01:38.250> right<00:01:38.460> through

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
eventually it would rub right through

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.940 
eventually it would rub right through
your<00:01:39.240> paper<00:01:39.479> if<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.810> get<00:01:40.170> bunches<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.770> water

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
your paper if you get bunches of water

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.530 
your paper if you get bunches of water
you<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.159> just<00:01:41.430> dry<00:01:41.820> up<00:01:41.850> your<00:01:42.060> brush<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> little

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
you can just dry up your brush a little

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.740 
you can just dry up your brush a little
bit<00:01:42.710> just<00:01:43.710> drag<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.159> over<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.520> area<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.390> after

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
bit just drag it over that area so after

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.090 
bit just drag it over that area so after
you<00:01:45.810> get<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.110> layer<00:01:46.320> done<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.649> need<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.950> let

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
you get this layer done you need to let

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.590 
you get this layer done you need to let
it<00:01:47.130> dry<00:01:47.220> before<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.790> add<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.210> second<00:01:48.570> layer

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
it dry before you add the second layer

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600 
it dry before you add the second layer
now<00:01:49.140> once<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:49.530> dry<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.799> can<00:01:50.130> tell<00:01:50.310> it's<00:01:50.430> dry

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
now once it's dry you can tell it's dry

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.800 
now once it's dry you can tell it's dry
because<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:51.030> not<00:01:51.149> going<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.420> be<00:01:51.509> shiny

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
because it's not going to be shiny

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.340 
because it's not going to be shiny
anymore

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
anymore

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.380 
anymore

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
middle ground so I'm just adding a

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.260 
middle ground so I'm just adding a
little<00:01:58.950> bit<00:01:59.040> more<00:01:59.310> blue<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.610> my<00:01:59.729> puddle<00:01:59.939> a

little bit more blue to my puddle a
little<00:02:00.810> bit<00:02:00.960> more<00:02:01.110> orange<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.799> am<00:02:01.920> going<00:02:02.130> to

little bit more orange and I am going to

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.980 
little bit more orange and I am going to
lightly<00:02:02.610> paint<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.149> some<00:02:03.329> mountains<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.930> are

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
lightly paint in some mountains that are

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.510 
lightly paint in some mountains that are
gonna<00:02:04.140> be<00:02:04.320> back<00:02:04.500> here<00:02:04.740> these<00:02:04.979> are<00:02:05.130> mountains

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
gonna be back here these are mountains

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.210 
gonna be back here these are mountains
in<00:02:05.759> my<00:02:05.969> head

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
in my head

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.410 
in my head

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
let this dry before I start the next

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.979 
let this dry before I start the next
layer<00:02:11.220> for<00:02:11.580> this<00:02:11.730> next<00:02:11.970> step<00:02:12.239> I've<00:02:12.480> added<00:02:12.780> a

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
layer for this next step I've added a

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.990 
layer for this next step I've added a
little<00:02:13.200> bit<00:02:13.440> more<00:02:13.800> blue<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.400> my<00:02:14.519> puddle<00:02:14.700> and

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
I'm just going to make one more mountain

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.410 
I'm just going to make one more mountain
range<00:02:16.560> before<00:02:16.799> I<00:02:17.250> paint<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:17.970> mountain<00:02:18.269> that

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
range before I paint the mountain that

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.170 
range before I paint the mountain that
we<00:02:18.660> are<00:02:18.810> on<00:02:21.319> hey<00:02:22.319> once<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.190> dried<00:02:23.489> you<00:02:24.060> can

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
we are on hey once this is dried you can

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.520 
we are on hey once this is dried you can
go<00:02:24.299> ahead<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.510> paint<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:25.019> your<00:02:25.170> foreground

go ahead and paint in your foreground
I'm<00:02:25.769> making<00:02:25.980> my<00:02:26.069> puddle<00:02:26.250> just<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.879> little<00:02:27.120> bit

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.080 
I'm making my puddle just a little bit
bigger<00:02:27.450> not<00:02:28.110> too<00:02:28.319> much<00:02:28.549> yeah<00:02:29.549> I'm<00:02:29.700> gonna<00:02:29.819> add<00:02:30.060> a

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
bigger not too much yeah I'm gonna add a

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.530 
bigger not too much yeah I'm gonna add a
lot<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.599> blue<00:02:30.870> it's<00:02:31.610> just<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.730> touch<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.330> orange

lot of blue it's just a touch of orange

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.720 
lot of blue it's just a touch of orange
so<00:02:34.260> I'm<00:02:34.410> gonna<00:02:34.500> paint<00:02:34.769> a<00:02:34.950> hill<00:02:35.190> coming<00:02:35.489> down

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
so I'm gonna paint a hill coming down

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.850 
so I'm gonna paint a hill coming down
here<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:36.420> then<00:02:36.840> maybe<00:02:37.049> starting<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.560> come<00:02:37.739> up

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
here and then maybe starting to come up

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.890 
here and then maybe starting to come up
on<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.160> side<00:02:41.150> if<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.269> bothers<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.870> you

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
on that side if it bothers you you

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.270 
on that side if it bothers you you
because<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.410> can<00:02:43.560> kind<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:43.829> see<00:02:44.099> those

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
because you can kind of see those

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.309 
because you can kind of see those
mountains<00:02:44.489> through<00:02:44.879> this<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.510> can<00:02:45.720> make<00:02:46.079> this

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
mountains through this you can make this

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.220 
mountains through this you can make this
color<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.890> tiny<00:02:47.220> bit<00:02:47.519> darker<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:48.450> brighter<00:02:48.750> and

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
color a tiny bit darker and brighter and

color a tiny bit darker and brighter and
go<00:02:49.530> back<00:02:49.709> over<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:51.860> okay<00:02:52.860> once<00:02:53.129> the<00:02:53.549> last<00:02:53.879> layer

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
go back over it okay once the last layer

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.610 
go back over it okay once the last layer
you<00:02:54.329> painted<00:02:54.690> has<00:02:54.780> dried<00:02:55.079> you're<00:02:55.290> going<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.470> go

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
you painted has dried you're going to go

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.229 
you painted has dried you're going to go
ahead<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:56.069> paint<00:02:56.250> in<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.610> foreground<00:02:56.940> which

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
ahead and paint in the foreground which

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.970 
ahead and paint in the foreground which
is<00:02:57.360> going<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.629> be<00:02:57.840> some<00:02:58.170> pine<00:02:58.379> trees<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.829> want

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
is going to be some pine trees you want

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.710 
is going to be some pine trees you want
to<00:02:59.099> make<00:02:59.220> sure<00:02:59.459> though<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.970> use<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.239> ton

to make sure though that you use a ton
of<00:03:00.750> blue<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.470> make<00:03:01.620> sure<00:03:01.859> you're<00:03:02.040> letting

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
of blue and make sure you're letting

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.880 
of blue and make sure you're letting
each<00:03:02.700> layer<00:03:03.060> dry<00:03:03.510> in<00:03:03.629> between<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:04.290> if<00:03:04.769> you

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
each layer dry in between and if you

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.819 
each layer dry in between and if you
make<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.069> mistake<00:03:05.310> like<00:03:05.819> I<00:03:06.420> did<00:03:06.450> it's<00:03:07.200> okay<00:03:07.470> just

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
make a mistake like I did it's okay just

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.890 
make a mistake like I did it's okay just
figure<00:03:08.280> out<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.430> way<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.730> incorporate<00:03:09.269> it<00:03:09.690> or

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
figure out a way to incorporate it or
