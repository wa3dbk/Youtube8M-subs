00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.399 

this<00:01:26.930> is<00:01:27.079> a<00:01:27.109> bit<00:01:27.409> of<00:01:27.619> a<00:01:27.679> little<00:01:27.979> bit<00:01:29.079> out<00:01:30.079> with

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
this is a bit of a little bit out with

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:31.929 
this is a bit of a little bit out with
one<00:01:30.590> measuring<00:01:31.159> or<00:01:31.280> something<00:01:31.579> must<00:01:31.789> have

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
one measuring or something must have

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.580 
one measuring or something must have
moved<00:01:32.090> somewhere<00:01:32.600> but<00:01:32.780> fortunately<00:01:33.259> they're

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
moved somewhere but fortunately they're

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.510 
moved somewhere but fortunately they're
both<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.979> same

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
both the same

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.980 
both the same
I<00:01:34.719> think<00:01:35.719> what<00:01:35.929> must<00:01:36.170> have<00:01:36.350> happened<00:01:36.380> is<00:01:37.990> a

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
I think what must have happened is a

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.300 
I think what must have happened is a
kill<00:01:39.380> drop<00:01:40.159> down<00:01:41.679> somewhere<00:01:42.679> along<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.100> line

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
kill drop down somewhere along the line

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.080 
kill drop down somewhere along the line
but<00:01:44.060> it's<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.360> same<00:01:44.600> on<00:01:44.810> both<00:01:44.840> sides<00:01:45.110> of<00:01:46.090> the

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
but it's the same on both sides of the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.910 
but it's the same on both sides of the
rather<00:01:47.329> function<00:01:47.899> of<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:51.140> front<00:01:51.439> side<00:01:51.709> Lee

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920
