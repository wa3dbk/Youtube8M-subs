00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.759
 Hello, this is Jorge Df steal point 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.260
 they want to show the new stage of 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.420
 manufacturer of primus version 2013 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.000
 of a capacity of a liter comes 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.970
 always all the traces of good in 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.500
 Kosovo follows transport and let's see 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.360
 the new news as you can see the 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.270
 center of gravity is totally more 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.220
 that the previous model carries the 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.570
 Same characteristics of exchanger 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.830
 of heat but this exchanger of 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.550
 Heat is improved since he has 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.220
 here is template that next to 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.710
 these holes diagonally with this 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.790
 heat exchanger we are going to 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.710
 achieve energy efficiency 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.320
 better live adapt even less 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.760
 fuel as much as gas or as 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.220
 gasoline if we use some kind of 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.610
 multi fuel stove 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.020
 take two handles the cover as you can 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.910
 see is completely transparent in 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.510
 plastic material carries here a 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.040
 rubber gasket is free of bp and a 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.960
 strainer for example if we're not 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.520
 preparing pasta we need 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.760
 empty the water through the window too 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.760
 very well another crater is very much when 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.100
 we will not see inside is the bowl 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.720
 carries all the new models carry 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.210
 this because it can not be like that hillside 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.650
 and also to protect the interior for 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:21.050
 that we do not leave the weight of about 270 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.910
 282 grams and has a measure of a 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.100
 diameter of about 15 centimeters and one 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.409
 height of about 11 and a half centimeters 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.390
 for example we enter a perfectly 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.590
 230 grams gas cartridge we can 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.590
 transport perfectly 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.040
 let's see the interior is aluminum 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.520
 ironized hard with a coating 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.410
 ceramic to make it more resistant 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.650
 Baby has a very bright black color 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.910
 and the exchange theme as you can 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.370
 see here takes here the theme of the 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.280
 graduation can be seen in this 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.320
 side here takes here a graduation 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.300
 so we can see the amount of water 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.130
 what are we going to need if we do 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.470
 let's prepare a theme of the happy self to 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.380
 2 and we need to take a measure of 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.500
 amount of water adjust this state already 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.900
 it is very good for backpackers 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.430
 of a person I will not be able to carry 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.500
 the hostel but we would not stay a 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.319
 little short when it comes to heating water or 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.670
 good food 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.170
 I just like warming up in our water 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.659
 to food directly our stove 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.430
 of gas or multi-fuel I hope that 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.659
 this information is not helpful and if you 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.950
 have liked but then parties in 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:35.150
 your social networks and if you have a 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.150
 I like greetings
