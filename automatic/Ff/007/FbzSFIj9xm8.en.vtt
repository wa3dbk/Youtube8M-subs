00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:16.529
 Hello , this tab is not an introduction to hanta . 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.340
 Normally when we look at Hanta , what happens on both sides and then on both sides 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.029
 Superhuman 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:26.010
 What kind of hits did you start with? 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:29.609
 It was a lot of work , but in fact lol is the most important thing. 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.809
 I can see that once again, the importance of skill, Oh, I can not see it. 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.300
 This skill is equivalent to once at once how big a snowball 5 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:41.760
 It is a kanta that shows if it goes . 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:46.950
 Let's meet one time. Im and Il Guys . 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:51.449
 Hey, it's gone, and im just trying to be a rival . 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.690
 Mad Life is holding on a little longer, 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:59.070
 I feel like something's actually going over to this side. 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:02.280
 The lilac's over, but I just got caught, and I did not get the space. 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.670
 Yui's cj gets elastic and keeps track of 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.820
 Now I wanted to live with Real 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:14.060
 That strongly when catches go chase 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.060
 You might think that cj is not winning 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:22.439
 Uh, I'm looking at the situation now, and it was not a formal one at the time. 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.070
 The champs are literally sparsely populated. 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:30.869
 If im is the same, of course I am here. 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:34.770
 I have something terrific Casa Dean Supernatural side is the side rumble squat im Champ 6 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.750
 4 people are gathered and there is momentary movement even if we push, 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.740
 It looks like I'm going to do a dive. 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.740
 This is now to live rahan energy when such a combination is not important in the context of the situation 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.060
 I do not think it's a win-win situation. 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:52.560
 What I want to focus on right brain take advantage figured indeyo schedule on both sides 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:57.030
 If the child is also in charge of the allies through the grain growth it has been one naaru up or 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:01.229
 You can maximize the dealer's viability even further , 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.579
 Heiri is a very important skill because it is a wide area skill 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.320
 You can see it as a skill 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.920
 Then what Cataclysm will also be dusimyeon out these jobs sizeable sk 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.550
 The same 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.900
 If you have a drug like cj, it would be a historical equalizer. Equalizer 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.650
 So how is used in any way, just something completely the opposite to be the hanta 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.250
 Maybe. 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.910
 Then jakna's a double-edged sword as the skill of the Medical Section Width 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.610
 You can make your opponent all out, and this monsoon is like that equalizer. 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.870
 The same will have to get used in any way itneunjido 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:34.380
 Then, in earnest, this kind of eTeave is the true transformational strategy of iM 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:39.870
 I'm going to watch Eve in some way. 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:44.460
 im2 fact Likes What tipped you first come here now to pull the knife 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.690
 Here's how it's done. Here's the limit. You've seen it, Henry Lee. 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.850
 is 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:54.030
 The first dive I was going to tell Halo that the start was intense and live. 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.380
 It would be best if the tortoise of the tortoise had been opened. 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.090
 It's the same with Jannah. 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.810
 It's just passing by. 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:07.920
 Look at this . You look a little dangerous. 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:14.040
 Have not I seen you, I very well jjipeo 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:16.470
 What is this brilliance is the subject of water Damie Korki can be through Valkyrie 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.090
 I went away and threw it in the water . 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.930
 Plus, we also have resell ahkkyeot yeocha that could survive very much longer 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.720
 I'll tell you. 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:29.880
 It was squatting in im2 everywhere 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:34.170
 But it was a bit vague from the beginning to Nami had just evaporated into the water kkongjja 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.960
 When the subject evaporated dive right that put the opponent fcc need to get 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:41.040
 Two of the key skills in the situation just fell out. 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:44.250
 So I get a job. 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.480
 Ah, but Zarvan has done some work for me. 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:51.330
 Cataclysm was right as soon as I met so when Valkyrie corset is missing key 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:56.400
 Once he flicked upwards, he ran away. 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:04:00.210
 I do not have a flash if I have four. 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:04.709
 Heck, one writes a revision style once I have a different intent 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:08.850
 There are some effects of the monsoon, said annya or screen, but do not get a good 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:12.480
 Do you see this now that the nose secretion nose 2 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:16.320
 It's down there , and it's blowing all the way down because of the monsoon . 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.530
 And to this side, to the left, to the bottom of the nose , 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:23.340
 Nalragat here naeunde the results 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:28.620
 Here it basically depends on your turret Eve show Shijo bottom 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:31.980
 More still, you see that the waves do not have the turret is very alive and well below geunya 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:36.030
 It's about talking. 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:39.720
 Janna monsoon Lorna has one knob but that's caught on the screen, 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:43.140
 I'll show you again. 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:47.730
 There is not much to cut here . 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:51.870
 Everything else goes outside the train so awesome. 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:56.670
 Also performed very well in conjunction got into the semi-open cut'm good skills in conjunction 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:05:00.960
 That suddenly the equalizer is blown up to the sky 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:04.770
 The equalizer came up fall will see the map, where gatguyo nose geumo 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.920
 Once I got out of the way, 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:12.630
 Do you see this behind you? 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:16.710
 The portal is hitting it. It's not visible to me now , but it's great. 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:20.580
 Is an important element Lets you're talking about was a strange fit better putter partners 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:27.180
 You have to see how these breaker risers are written. 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:32.610
 Just put it on the equalizer, it's the rum fire, it's the equalizer. 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:38.130
 And there's a puck tower on the bottom. Meteor is clogged. 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:39.990
 There's the original one sseuk ppajineunge to this next side street completely blocked the attack 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:44.400
 I write and I 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:48.450
 And flamethrowers while entering side trim and much better spent on train 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:52.620
 I told you, this is not a good situation for this good- bye. 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:57.240
 It enters between the spirit of collaboration and why not eotgalrigo Rumble entry and 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:06:01.590
 There was also a little superstitious, and Casa Din arrived 2 sim looks 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:04.740
 This is the position of im as well as the key or the cog . 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.810
 I do not have a photo apartment so I can not manage my physical fitness. 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.810
 Equalizer reads and lights ahead 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:13.360
 I must say I was actually dead. 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:16.960
 Lulu is starting too bad. 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:21.069
 It's a fighting net. It's flying here. 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.360
 Let's take a look at what kind of variables we can make. 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:27.039
 I came over. 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:31.090
 Spit, can you feel it here in this scene surrounded by eight opponents? 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:35.020
 I do not know what will happen as soon as im arrives. 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:37.060
 Now let's wait and wait there butter in this way can be combined with the water 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:44.169
 Is this Lulu ? 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:48.310
 Uh, it just popped up . There's a flash, and it's growing fast and I could not do anything. 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:50.139
 What will happen next? What will the next two people do with this land mine? 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.800
 Can I live? 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:58.000
 You know the ending, but you can not live . 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:02.080
 One end is chasing ah I can not be 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:06.800
 I came running out to save the summoner spell dysentery do not see it as much as possible Kite 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:13.220
 This is the way you are being trafficked. 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:16.970
 Maybe that'll just important in hanta im2 Obviously I have good momentum before 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:20.570
 Despite the design and good positioning 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:24.350
 You can usually see the scene scheduled to be missed very little impractical 

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:29.930
 The caj in that barbarian case was neither intended nor intended 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:33.470
 The monsoon picked up the cup of my great aunt's nose effect results just die 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:36.050
 I made it, and the equalizer position is artistic, so im2 

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:42.199
 In addition, buy an environment that you can put your back in. 4 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:48.440
 I did not like it. There are 10 champs and a lot of skins like this. 

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:52.340
 There is a huge number, but each one of these appears when the neighborhood is piled up. 

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:57.050
 Snowball effect that they can be followed as a router in this kind of hanta 

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:57.710
 Keep in mind that you will always be precise when you match your non-target skills 

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.480
 wish 

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:07.080
 Until now , we have got a class of hantan science introduction . 

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:07.080
 Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
