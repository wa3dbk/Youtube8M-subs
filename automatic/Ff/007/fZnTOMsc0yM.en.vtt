00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
I'll last you a very long time okay to

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.609 
I'll last you a very long time okay to
position<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:29.970> because<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.840> goes<00:00:31.050> down<00:00:31.380> deep

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
position it because it goes down deep

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.830 
position it because it goes down deep
it's<00:00:31.859> really<00:00:32.130> not<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.610> simple<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.390> position

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
it's really not that simple to position

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.770 
it's really not that simple to position
the<00:00:34.320> easiest<00:00:34.680> way<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.670> actually<00:00:36.570> measure

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the easiest way is to actually measure

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.869 
the easiest way is to actually measure
the<00:00:37.050> rope<00:00:37.260> put<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.070> out<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.399> then<00:00:38.610> put<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
the rope put it out and then put the

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.569 
the rope put it out and then put the
witchdoctor<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.350> can<00:00:40.620> see<00:00:40.920> where

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
witchdoctor on so you can see where

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.400 
witchdoctor on so you can see where
we're<00:00:41.790> positioning<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.450> I'll<00:00:42.899> just<00:00:42.960> put<00:00:43.320> this

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
we're positioning it I'll just put this

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.580 
we're positioning it I'll just put this
food<00:00:43.649> on<00:00:43.860> put<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.670> over<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.030> back<00:00:45.920> let<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:46.950> out

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
food on put it over the back let it out

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.569 
food on put it over the back let it out
what<00:00:49.590> we're<00:00:49.710> going<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.010> do<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.550> put<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.840> bird

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
what we're going to do is put the bird

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.819 
what we're going to do is put the bird
right<00:00:53.579> next<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> other<00:00:54.449> lure<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.530> line

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
right next to the other lure in line

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.950 
right next to the other lure in line
with<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.820> gives<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.360> position

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
with it and that gives you that position

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.830 
with it and that gives you that position
and<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:59.039> measurement<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.699> use<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.660> now

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
and the measurement that I use is I now

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.350 
and the measurement that I use is I now
pull<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:02.219> one<00:01:03.290> to<00:01:04.640> two<00:01:05.640> hand<00:01:05.909> spans

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
pull it in so it's one to two hand spans

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.039 
pull it in so it's one to two hand spans
shorter<00:01:07.020> then<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.799> tie<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.100> off<00:01:08.810> wrap<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.960> around

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
shorter then I tie it off wrap it around

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.020 
shorter then I tie it off wrap it around
once<00:01:10.409> around<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> cleat<00:01:11.040> pitch<00:01:12.080> pitch<00:01:13.080> and

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
once around the cleat pitch pitch and

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:25.310 
once around the cleat pitch pitch and
another<00:01:15.030> one<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.450> then<00:01:16.080> pull<00:01:17.330> according

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.889 

take<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.470> marker<00:01:26.799> off<00:01:27.570> now<00:01:28.570> when<00:01:28.750> you're

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
don't position them correctly if a fish

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:20.759

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
close to the boat here and the lures a

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.870 
close to the boat here and the lures a
long<00:02:22.360> way<00:02:22.510> away<00:02:22.660> you're<00:02:23.620> attracting<00:02:24.099> fish<00:02:24.280> if
