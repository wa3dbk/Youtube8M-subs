00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
Facebook and I saw one of the snakes

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.110 
Facebook and I saw one of the snakes
pipping<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.640> kind<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.850> got<00:00:33.059> a

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
pipping and so I just kind of got a

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.350 
pipping and so I just kind of got a
little<00:00:33.360> closer<00:00:33.540> look<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.200> course<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:35.360> the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
little closer look of course and the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.000 
little closer look of course and the
pipping<00:00:36.840> snake<00:00:37.170> was<00:00:37.500> not<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> pastel<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:39.410> as<00:00:40.410> I

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
pipping snake was not a pastel and as I

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.880 
pipping snake was not a pastel and as I
started<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.489> look<00:00:41.670> at<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:41.850> more<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.890> realized

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
started to look at it more I realized

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.450 
started to look at it more I realized
that<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.340> was<00:00:44.520> an<00:00:44.760> albino<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.559> so<00:00:46.559> when<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.340> was

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
that it was an albino and so when I was

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.850 
that it was an albino and so when I was
talking<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.820> Josh<00:00:48.090> we<00:00:48.390> realized<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.230> started

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
talking to Josh we realized and started

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.610 
talking to Josh we realized and started
remembering<00:00:50.250> back<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:51.449> breeder<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.410> got

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
remembering back the breeder that we got

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.810 
remembering back the breeder that we got
the<00:00:53.309> albino<00:00:53.610> from<00:00:54.030> bred<00:00:54.930> his<00:00:55.710> female<00:00:56.399> this

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
the albino from bred his female this

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.139 
the albino from bred his female this
snake<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.620> a<00:00:58.620> cinnamon<00:00:59.520> head<00:00:59.670> albino

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
snake to a cinnamon head albino

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.450 
snake to a cinnamon head albino
as<00:01:01.100> far<00:01:02.100> as<00:01:02.219> we<00:01:02.399> know<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:03.860> that<00:01:04.860> would<00:01:05.100> give<00:01:05.250> us

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
as far as we know so that would give us

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.609 
as far as we know so that would give us
albinos<00:01:06.000> cinnamon<00:01:06.420> albinos<00:01:06.900> Cindy<00:01:07.409> heads

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
albinos cinnamon albinos Cindy heads

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.010 
albinos cinnamon albinos Cindy heads
things<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:09.479> looks<00:01:09.510> like<00:01:09.869> we

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
things like that so it looks like we

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.840 
things like that so it looks like we
have<00:01:10.170> retaining<00:01:10.619> sperm<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:11.220> that's<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
have retaining sperm here that's the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.460 
have retaining sperm here that's the
