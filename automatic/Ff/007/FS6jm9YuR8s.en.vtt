00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.590 
biggity that's absolutely marvelous now
pretty<00:02:54.650> sure<00:02:54.860> this<00:02:55.299> Hoover<00:02:56.299> Dam<00:02:56.450> was

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
pretty sure this Hoover Dam was

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.030 
pretty sure this Hoover Dam was
constructed<00:02:56.630> by<00:02:57.170> Bechtel<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:57.799> I'm<00:02:57.890> actually

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
constructed by Bechtel and I'm actually

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.000 
constructed by Bechtel and I'm actually
working<00:02:58.340> for<00:02:58.670> back<00:02:58.850> tell<00:02:59.060> at<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.239> moment

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
working for back tell at the moment

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.410 
working for back tell at the moment
working<00:03:00.430> with<00:03:00.549> an<00:03:00.670> actual<00:03:01.000> work<00:03:01.120> on<00:03:01.269> their

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
working with an actual work on their

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.990 
working with an actual work on their
project<00:03:01.870> so<00:03:02.530> yeah<00:03:02.769> it's<00:03:03.189> a<00:03:03.250> small<00:03:03.549> world<00:03:03.879> I

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
project so yeah it's a small world I

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.280 
project so yeah it's a small world I
guess<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.390> Bek<00:03:04.510> tells<00:03:04.689> a<00:03:04.780> massive<00:03:05.110> project

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
guess and Bek tells a massive project

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.319 
guess and Bek tells a massive project
management<00:03:05.829> company<00:03:06.129> but<00:03:06.310> yeah<00:03:06.489> whoo<00:03:07.120> that

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
management company but yeah whoo that

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.559 
management company but yeah whoo that
yeah<00:03:07.569> absolutely<00:03:07.930> remarkable<00:03:09.569> absolutely

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
yeah absolutely remarkable absolutely

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:11.910 
yeah absolutely remarkable absolutely
remarkable<00:03:10.840> as<00:03:11.230> we're<00:03:11.409> going<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.650> go<00:03:11.739> to<00:03:11.799> the

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
remarkable as we're going to go to the

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.679 
remarkable as we're going to go to the
next<00:03:12.069> scene<00:03:12.310> I<00:03:12.610> think<00:03:12.790> it's<00:03:13.090> still<00:03:13.390> gonna<00:03:13.599> be

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:13.689 
next scene I think it's still gonna be

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.259 
next scene I think it's still gonna be
over<00:03:13.989> Lake<00:03:14.230> Mead<00:03:14.790> itself<00:03:15.790> like<00:03:15.939> me<00:03:16.090> there

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
over Lake Mead itself like me there

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.000 
over Lake Mead itself like me there
that's<00:03:16.360> we're<00:03:16.720> what're<00:03:17.110> flows<00:03:17.349> into<00:03:17.560> from<00:03:17.920> the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
that's we're what're flows into from the

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.490 
that's we're what're flows into from the
Grand<00:03:18.220> Canyon<00:03:18.610> and<00:03:19.390> it's<00:03:19.750> still<00:03:19.930> like<00:03:20.079> me<00:03:20.290> but

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
Grand Canyon and it's still like me but

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.920 
Grand Canyon and it's still like me but
what<00:03:20.790> we're<00:03:21.790> making<00:03:22.209> our<00:03:22.420> way<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.569> the<00:03:22.750> Grand

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
what we're making our way to the Grand

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.740 
what we're making our way to the Grand
Canyon<00:03:22.989> it's<00:03:23.590> about<00:03:23.799> 30<00:03:24.250> minutes<00:03:24.610> 45<00:03:25.329> minutes

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
Canyon it's about 30 minutes 45 minutes

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.080 
Canyon it's about 30 minutes 45 minutes
are<00:03:25.930> trained<00:03:26.319> of<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.709> Train<00:03:27.579> my<00:03:27.730> buddy

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
are trained of the Train my buddy

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.000 
are trained of the Train my buddy
helicopter<00:03:28.780> ride<00:03:28.930> from<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.379> Grand<00:03:29.620> Canyon

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
helicopter ride from the Grand Canyon

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.250 
helicopter ride from the Grand Canyon
and<00:03:30.250> that's<00:03:30.790> just<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.180> up<00:03:31.420> gripper<00:03:31.689> of<00:03:31.930> Lake

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
and that's just the up gripper of Lake

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.830 
and that's just the up gripper of Lake
Mead<00:03:32.519> so<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.609> basically<00:03:33.909> the<00:03:34.060> car<00:03:34.269> covered

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
Mead so the basically the car covered

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.559 
Mead so the basically the car covered
the<00:03:35.140> Colorado<00:03:35.650> River<00:03:36.209> flows<00:03:37.209> through<00:03:37.450> the

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
the Colorado River flows through the

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.930 
the Colorado River flows through the
Grand<00:03:37.659> Canyon<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.319> down<00:03:38.620> into<00:03:38.920> Lake<00:03:39.099> Mead<00:03:39.340> and

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
Grand Canyon and down into Lake Mead and

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.330 
Grand Canyon and down into Lake Mead and
all<00:03:40.090> this<00:03:40.209> water<00:03:40.389> is<00:03:40.629> held<00:03:40.840> up<00:03:41.019> by<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:42.069> Hoover

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
all this water is held up by the Hoover

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.339 
all this water is held up by the Hoover
Dam<00:03:42.370> so<00:03:42.940> basically<00:03:43.269> it<00:03:43.420> supplies<00:03:43.720> a<00:03:43.750> waterfall

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
Dam so basically it supplies a waterfall

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.640 
Dam so basically it supplies a waterfall
I<00:03:44.680> think<00:03:45.609> it<00:03:45.700> was<00:03:45.849> lost<00:03:46.569> not<00:03:46.900> only<00:03:46.930> las<00:03:47.319> vegas

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
I think it was lost not only las vegas

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.680 
I think it was lost not only las vegas
but<00:03:47.799> a<00:03:47.829> couple<00:03:48.010> of<00:03:48.159> countries<00:03:48.700> on<00:03:48.819> the<00:03:48.970> western

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
but a couple of countries on the western

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.759 
but a couple of countries on the western
seaboard<00:03:49.930> of<00:03:51.090> Canada<00:03:52.090> and<00:03:52.650> sorry<00:03:53.650> I've

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
seaboard of Canada and sorry I've

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.240 
seaboard of Canada and sorry I've
counted<00:03:54.010> on<00:03:54.220> USA<00:03:54.909> and<00:03:55.150> this<00:03:56.019> is<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.560> mouth<00:03:56.950> of

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
counted on USA and this is the mouth of

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.890 
counted on USA and this is the mouth of
the<00:03:57.549> Grand<00:03:57.819> Canyon<00:03:57.940> up<00:03:58.329> there<00:03:58.480> you<00:03:58.569> can<00:03:58.720> see

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
the Grand Canyon up there you can see

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.449 
the Grand Canyon up there you can see
the<00:03:58.959> little<00:03:59.230> river<00:03:59.530> that's<00:03:59.799> kind<00:04:00.400> of

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
the little river that's kind of

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.280 
the little river that's kind of
meandering<00:04:00.909> its<00:04:01.120> way<00:04:01.269> through<00:04:01.569> those<00:04:01.750> massive

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
meandering its way through those massive

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.640 
meandering its way through those massive
cliffs<00:04:02.620> and<00:04:03.629> yes<00:04:04.629> basically<00:04:05.079> we're<00:04:05.290> about<00:04:05.500> to

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
cliffs and yes basically we're about to

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.409 
cliffs and yes basically we're about to
go<00:04:05.739> into<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.069> Grand<00:04:06.340> Canyon<00:04:06.400> how<00:04:06.879> exciting

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
plateau below us and that's the parently

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.099 
plateau below us and that's the parently
where<00:04:11.620> thumber<00:04:12.549> in<00:04:12.730> Louise

where thumber in Louise

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:15.900 
where thumber in Louise
there<00:04:14.410> we<00:04:14.470> go<00:04:14.560> beautiful<00:04:14.739> zooming<00:04:15.549> -<00:04:15.730> that's
