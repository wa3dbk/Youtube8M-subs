the end I don't get the win because USA

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.160

pitched

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
pitched

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.949 
pitched
only<00:02:14.190> two<00:02:14.370> hits<00:02:14.550> allowed<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:15.060> one<00:02:15.240> strikeout<00:02:15.720> I

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
only two hits allowed of one strikeout I

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.190 
only two hits allowed of one strikeout I
think<00:02:16.319> that's<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.620> pretty<00:02:16.770> good<00:02:17.010> job<00:02:17.959> but<00:02:18.959> right

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
think that's a pretty good job but right

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.050 
think that's a pretty good job but right
here<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.620> Rangers<00:02:20.130> traded<00:02:21.440> Eric<00:02:22.440> ball<00:02:22.739> and

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
here the Rangers traded Eric ball and

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.930 
here the Rangers traded Eric ball and
you<00:02:24.060> wouldn't<00:02:24.420> guess<00:02:24.989> what<00:02:25.319> team<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:26.760> San

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
you wouldn't guess what team the San

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.920 
you wouldn't guess what team the San
