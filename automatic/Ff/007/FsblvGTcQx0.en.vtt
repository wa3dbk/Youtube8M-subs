00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.199
 the ingredients to make a cake treat demanded Normans 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.950
 a nice goal 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.950
 brown sugar and butter 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:31.289
 in a type 2 pan container that we can place both in the game as 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.249
 in the oven we put brown sugar and butter 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.310
 we let the whole caramelize in the fire 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.610
 While 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.860
 we prepare percent lemon peels cut in the thin julienne 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.850
 and so we'll put it in a 50% syrup with brown sugar for 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.990
 that caramelize sharpness speak afterwards as an ornament 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.490
 here we have the fleet already cut 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.830
 and the sheet of puff pastry that we will use to cover the cake 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.280
 we will cut it some dimensions percent removed higher than the container that 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.690
 we are using 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.690
 we will keep the puff pastry we will listen to the rest 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.120
 fundamentally to this puff pastry is to echo in balaÃ­dos a fork about 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.130
 holes 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.060
 pd so that in the oven does not rise too much 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.060
 the whole surface will be punctured with the fork 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.200
 We are arranging the pieces of fruit on the sugar candy and 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.220
 Butter 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.530
 the entire surface of the pan or container that we are using 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.790
 will continue to soak in that candy 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.420
 once we have accommodated all the fruit 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.500
 penner we will arrange to place the sheet of puff pastry on top 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.280
 without taking off the paper we help each other with our hands around the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.280
 way that will have fed all the fruit 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.020
 Once the cake is shaped in the same container, what we do is take it to the 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.309
 oven 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:16.159
 8 twelve minutes of ovens at 200 degrees will be enough anyway there are 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.679
 that observing this is the result 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:22.879
 and what we have to do now is as if potato hatch was treated in 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.989
 turn it around helped with a plate 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.089
 and the result that we will have then was this 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:32.659
 and these lemon citrus bark heights in this case 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.560
 so with the syrup that we use to give it a certain acid taste and garnish 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:40.559
 the cake 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.279
 it is convenient this takes to eat hot or warm 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:53.159
 and here we have it accompanied by a bar soternes 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:56.399
 that nothing is wrong 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:57.009
 Health
