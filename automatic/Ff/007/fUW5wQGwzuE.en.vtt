00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:18.200
 I pray you will make me maximalistic roberto 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.869
 who wants ground simera that does 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.860
 hurt all the years not so many 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:31.760
 of tivoli folliero brown roberto state 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:35.540
 dear key guests I clown about this 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.720
 which prompted to draw the rogue round 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.850
 practically there were needs 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.980
 in the Nordic countries which are very windy 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.290
 not to raise the lead too much because the 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.360
 wind carried the latter off-axis 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.030
 hence as an aircraft characteristic 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.810
 ground we will have a lead launch 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:58.970
 what low wheel second what is this 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:01.670
 ground plane a throw that 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.770
 already the characteristics of the 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.620
 heavier and more powerful launchers 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:10.320
 physically as compared to 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:13.650
 classic pendulum is a launch that 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.450
 enhances the physical qualities of the launcher la 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.380
 departure is very similar to the ground the 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.390
 a commuter way 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.610
 a way we say much simpler 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.829
 spinning the lead low for 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.610
 as for the closure is always the 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:31.140
 same ground base pendulum evolution 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.299
 in the rogue round we will have two types of 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.130
 commute a much simpler one 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.220
 both are slightly more complex 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.289
 however they tend to say goal a 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.200
 lead the lead away we say 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.750
 from the launcher the first I sell side of the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.640
 ruining is very simple because 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.409
 will be a simple pill taha in between 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.850
 move the lead 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.939
 behind the pitcher and will come 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.780
 carried out with a simple movement in the 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:00.479
 so a fortune has done so for then 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.549
 lower the top and start the other one 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.830
 the most complex revenge it has however 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.539
 given better results is a revenge 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.190
 which will form an ellipse loop 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.060
 and it is indeed called is that own 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.250
 that form of them 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.280
 it seems to be made and it is a pendulum 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.050
 they will come to look for the form 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.830
 of man this is doing so 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.239
 widen the lead to the maximum possible 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.090
 now let's see the position of 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.510
 departure and let's say it all 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.310
 including the closure of the grave area 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.860
 starting position of the ground plane 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.170
 it is similar to that of the graves therefore 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.370
 we are going to position ourselves horizontally 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.840
 compared to our point of shooting but of 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.760
 I call my legs as always 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.810
 we carry the bags forward the weight on 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.100
 wasp 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:51.180
 at this point we will try the maximum 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.400
 adoption of the bus when we extend 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.849
 our taeg revenge is simple 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.310
 both 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.900
 and when the lead is wide we will leave 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.420
 of the classic closure of the great 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.790
 stretching the foot by shifting the weight 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.390
 of the body carrying in arms in place e 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.190
 looking for closure to satisfy 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.470
 launch albeit simpler gave the 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.970
 great results as I said before but 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.650
 above all to the launchers who are performing 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.690
 physically ie heavy and strong now 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.370
 we will go for a naro ground lunch 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.370
 and in its entirety 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:01.390
 ap the ground ship damage a little less time 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.660
 makes the raves of the raven the one of you there 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:08.610
 roberto pendulum is said on the outside 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.610
 sorry if I talk if you deliver them
