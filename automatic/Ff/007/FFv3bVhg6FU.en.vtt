part of a set called the signature
button<00:01:21.390> set<00:01:21.630> which<00:01:22.229> essentially<00:01:22.710> they<00:01:23.189> wanted

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
button set which essentially they wanted

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.510 
button set which essentially they wanted
to<00:01:23.610> do<00:01:23.759> buttons<00:01:24.360> with<00:01:24.659> skins<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.650> them<00:01:25.860> but

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
couldn't really figure out how to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.690 
couldn't really figure out how to
implement<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.860> since<00:01:29.130> there<00:01:29.250> were<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.369> many

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
implement that since there were so many

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.280 
implement that since there were so many
skins<00:01:30.060> out<00:01:30.180> there<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.570> they<00:01:30.720> picked<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.079> few

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
skins out there so they picked a few

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.109 
skins out there so they picked a few
people<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.799> choose<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.040> skin<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.670> character

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
and they put him at the button and

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.020 
and they put him at the button and
they're<00:01:34.920> called<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.159> signature<00:01:35.490> set<00:01:35.850> because

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
they're called a signature set because

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.090 
they're called a signature set because
that<00:01:36.420> person<00:01:36.630> signature<00:01:37.200> them<00:01:37.439> or<00:01:37.619> signed
