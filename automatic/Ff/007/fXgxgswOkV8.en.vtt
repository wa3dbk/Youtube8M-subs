block<00:00:56.160> order<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.670> your<00:00:56.789> block<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.989> once

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
block order to your block and the once

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.650 
block order to your block and the once
created<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.190> stone<00:00:59.430> steps<00:00:59.760> aren't<00:01:00.090> necessary

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
created the stone steps aren't necessary

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.590 
created the stone steps aren't necessary
so<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:01.489> flip<00:01:02.489> them<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:02.820> as<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.270> desire

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
so you can flip them on as you desire

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.080 
so you can flip them on as you desire
however<00:01:04.080> breaking<00:01:05.010> either<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.489> glass<00:01:05.729> or<00:01:06.030> the

however breaking either the glass or the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.289 
however breaking either the glass or the
tier<00:01:06.600> will<00:01:07.260> destroy<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.070> wort<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.729> you'll

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
tier will destroy the wort and you'll

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.890 
tier will destroy the wort and you'll
have<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:10.580> set<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.729> up<00:01:11.790> again<00:01:12.119> with<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> stairs

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
have to set it up again with the stairs

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.560 
have to set it up again with the stairs
and<00:01:13.020> everything

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
and everything

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.750 
and everything
so<00:01:15.170> those<00:01:15.320> Awards<00:01:15.740> I've<00:01:15.920> covered<00:01:16.220> them<00:01:16.460> up<00:01:16.490> put

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
so those Awards I've covered them up put

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.820 
so those Awards I've covered them up put
a<00:01:16.820> link<00:01:16.970> up<00:01:17.150> for<00:01:17.390> that<00:01:17.540> now<00:01:17.810> instead<00:01:18.470> of<00:01:18.560> using

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
a link up for that now instead of using

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.490 
a link up for that now instead of using
face<00:01:19.190> blocks<00:01:19.490> like<00:01:20.180> I<00:01:20.390> had<00:01:20.600> it<00:01:20.840> set<00:01:21.080> up<00:01:21.229> over

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
face blocks like I had it set up over

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.800 
face blocks like I had it set up over
there<00:01:21.530> we've<00:01:22.159> got<00:01:22.340> toggle<00:01:22.790> blocks<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:23.300> these

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
there we've got toggle blocks and these

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.900 
there we've got toggle blocks and these
are<00:01:24.170> made<00:01:24.500> almost<00:01:25.010> the<00:01:25.160> same<00:01:25.310> way<00:01:25.490> but<00:01:25.729> with

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
are made almost the same way but with

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.240 
are made almost the same way but with
pistons<00:01:26.330> instead<00:01:26.810> of<00:01:26.900> iron<00:01:27.170> ore<00:01:27.470> into<00:01:27.979> the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
pistons instead of iron ore into the

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.609 
pistons instead of iron ore into the
pattern<00:01:28.400> I<00:01:28.760> want<00:01:29.630> these<00:01:29.720> do<00:01:29.960> that<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.590> other

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
pattern I want these do that the other

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.730 
pattern I want these do that the other
ones<00:01:31.070> don't<00:01:31.280> is<00:01:31.520> that<00:01:31.820> instead<00:01:32.210> of<00:01:32.740> changing

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
ones don't is that instead of changing

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.760 
ones don't is that instead of changing
between<00:01:34.570> instead<00:01:35.570> of<00:01:35.690> air<00:01:35.869> going<00:01:35.900> on<00:01:36.410> or<00:01:36.560> off

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
between instead of air going on or off

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.590 
between instead of air going on or off
they<00:01:37.670> simply<00:01:38.030> change<00:01:38.509> between<00:01:39.050> a<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:39.350> B<00:01:40.300> so<00:01:41.300> if

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
they simply change between a and B so if

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.910 
they simply change between a and B so if
I<00:01:41.869> make<00:01:42.470> up<00:01:42.800> something<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:43.820> make<00:01:44.150> a<00:01:44.180> window

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
I make up something to make a window

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.200 
I make up something to make a window
they<00:01:45.920> will<00:01:46.070> change<00:01:46.280> now<00:01:46.520> obviously<00:01:46.850> right<00:01:47.060> now

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
they will change now obviously right now

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.850 
they will change now obviously right now
there's<00:01:47.509> nothing<00:01:47.840> for<00:01:47.960> them<00:01:47.990> to<00:01:48.110> change<00:01:48.440> into

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
there's nothing for them to change into

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.700 
there's nothing for them to change into
so<00:01:49.369> they<00:01:49.520> behave<00:01:49.789> very<00:01:49.970> much<00:01:50.240> like<00:01:50.710> face

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
so they behave very much like face

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.760 
so they behave very much like face
blocks<00:01:52.009> but<00:01:52.280> I'll<00:01:52.460> get<00:01:52.640> some<00:01:53.200> get<00:01:54.200> some<00:01:54.259> iron

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
blocks but I'll get some get some iron

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:02.980 
blocks but I'll get some get some iron
it<00:01:55.640> right-click<00:01:55.910> these<00:01:56.300> out<00:02:00.039> and<00:02:01.840> cut<00:02:02.840> out

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
it right-click these out and cut out

this<00:02:52.920> way<00:02:53.130> that<00:02:53.730> means<00:02:53.940> when<00:02:54.150> i<00:02:54.230> teleport<00:02:55.230> to

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
this way that means when i teleport to

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.980 
this way that means when i teleport to
this<00:02:55.950> point<00:02:56.190> here<00:02:56.610> i<00:02:56.820> will<00:02:57.150> get<00:02:57.480> dropped<00:02:57.780> out

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
this point here i will get dropped out

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.930 
this point here i will get dropped out
there<00:02:58.200> and<00:03:00.470> essentially<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.680> same<00:03:01.860> in<00:03:02.790> all

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
there and essentially the same in all

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.990 
there and essentially the same in all
aspects<00:03:03.510> as<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:04.020> up<00:03:04.830> right<00:03:05.100> where<00:03:05.250> point<00:03:05.490> now

aspects as a up right where point now

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.820 
aspects as a up right where point now
these<00:03:06.240> could<00:03:06.420> be<00:03:06.540> going<00:03:06.720> in<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.260> way<00:03:07.380> facing

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
these could be going in the way facing

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.350 
these could be going in the way facing
in<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.040> way<00:03:08.160> if<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.490> clicked<00:03:08.790> on<00:03:08.910> this<00:03:09.150> side

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
in the way if I clicked on this side

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.480 
in the way if I clicked on this side
then<00:03:09.600> it<00:03:09.750> will<00:03:09.870> place<00:03:10.020> in<00:03:10.230> like<00:03:10.470> or<00:03:10.830> if<00:03:11.220> i<00:03:11.310> click

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
then it will place in like or if i click

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.170 
then it will place in like or if i click
this<00:03:11.670> way<00:03:11.880> in<00:03:12.150> would<00:03:12.270> phase<00:03:12.480> out<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.990> way<00:03:13.110> but

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
this way in would phase out the way but

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.430 
this way in would phase out the way but
so<00:03:15.180> I'll<00:03:15.270> make<00:03:15.330> this<00:03:15.480> one<00:03:15.720> go<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.110> way<00:03:16.230> just

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
so I'll make this one go in the way just

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.540 
so I'll make this one go in the way just
for<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.680> sake<00:03:16.920> of<00:03:16.950> example<00:03:17.910> now<00:03:19.550> that

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
for the sake of example now that

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.610 
for the sake of example now that
basically<00:03:21.000> means<00:03:21.300> that<00:03:21.420> I<00:03:21.630> can<00:03:21.960> teleport<00:03:22.350> to

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
basically means that I can teleport to

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.690 
basically means that I can teleport to
them<00:03:22.800> and<00:03:23.010> in<00:03:23.460> exactly<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.210> same<00:03:24.300> way<00:03:25.700> the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
them and in exactly the same way the

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.010 
them and in exactly the same way the
only<00:03:26.880> difference<00:03:27.060> is<00:03:27.360> where<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.630> come<00:03:27.840> outside

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
only difference is where I come outside

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.320 
only difference is where I come outside
of<00:03:28.350> appearing<00:03:28.800> on<00:03:28.950> top<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.400> appear<00:03:29.790> just<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.240> the

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
of appearing on top I appear just to the

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.490 
of appearing on top I appear just to the
side<00:03:30.570> at<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:31.020> block<00:03:31.230> there

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
side at that block there

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.730 
side at that block there
like<00:03:33.500> so<00:03:33.770> I<00:03:34.780> play<00:03:35.780> something<00:03:36.170> for<00:03:36.200> me<00:03:36.350> to<00:03:36.440> land

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
like so I play something for me to land

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.420 
like so I play something for me to land
on<00:03:37.180> and<00:03:38.180> here<00:03:38.510> I<00:03:38.540> come<00:03:38.720> you<00:03:39.710> can<00:03:39.830> also<00:03:39.980> bounced

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
on and here I come you can also bounced

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.910 
on and here I come you can also bounced
through<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:40.910> air<00:03:41.240> with<00:03:41.570> a<00:03:41.600> solid<00:03:42.080> color<00:03:42.260> just

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
through the air with a solid color just

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.850 
through the air with a solid color just
like<00:03:43.130> before<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:44.210> there<00:03:44.630> is<00:03:44.840> a<00:03:44.870> limit<00:03:45.710> of

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
like before and there is a limit of

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.400 
like before and there is a limit of
about<00:03:46.070> sixty<00:03:46.670> four<00:03:46.850> blocks<00:03:47.090> for<00:03:47.810> these<00:03:48.170> but

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
about sixty four blocks for these but

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.650 
about sixty four blocks for these but
that<00:03:48.500> should<00:03:48.710> be<00:03:48.740> enough<00:03:48.830> and<00:03:49.250> you<00:03:49.910> see<00:03:50.090> I<00:03:50.240> go

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
that should be enough and you see I go

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.840 
that should be enough and you see I go
all<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.050> way<00:03:51.080> and<00:03:51.170> emerge<00:03:51.710> at<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.310> side<00:03:52.520> here

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
all the way and emerge at the side here

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.810 
all the way and emerge at the side here
ananda<00:03:53.390> management<00:03:53.750> platform<00:03:54.140> you<00:03:55.100> can<00:03:55.400> go

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
ananda management platform you can go

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.050 
ananda management platform you can go
through<00:03:56.060> solid<00:03:56.690> objects<00:03:57.130> bear<00:03:58.130> with<00:03:58.340> that<00:03:58.550> in

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
through solid objects bear with that in

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.190 
through solid objects bear with that in
the<00:03:59.240> same<00:03:59.420> way<00:03:59.480> as<00:03:59.750> you<00:03:59.900> can<00:04:00.050> before<00:04:01.990> this<00:04:02.990> is

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
the same way as you can before this is

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.900 
the same way as you can before this is
