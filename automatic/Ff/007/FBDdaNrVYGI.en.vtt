unique for the band lyrically it is a

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.230

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
difficult song to get behind and sing

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.149 
difficult song to get behind and sing
along<00:01:56.479> with<00:01:56.630> that's<00:01:57.259> not<00:01:57.470> to<00:01:57.619> say<00:01:57.740> that<00:01:57.770> lyrics

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
performance but for some reason there is

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.040 
performance but for some reason there is
just<00:02:13.069> nothing<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.459> attach<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.239> there<00:02:14.810> are

just nothing to attach to there are

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.330 
just nothing to attach to there are

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
moments that will build hope and

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.830 
moments that will build hope and
anticipation<00:02:16.850> in<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.180> album<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:17.630> give<00:02:17.750> you

anticipation in the album and give you
the<00:02:17.989> impression<00:02:18.380> that<00:02:18.440> something<00:02:18.530> intense<00:02:19.160> is

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
the impression that something intense is

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.550 
the impression that something intense is
coming<00:02:19.640> with<00:02:20.300> those<00:02:20.540> moments<00:02:21.050> may<00:02:21.200> come<00:02:21.440> of

hue antique romantic feelings where the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:39.610 
hue antique romantic feelings where the
expected<00:02:23.690> explosion<00:02:24.380> doesn't<00:02:24.590> deliver

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.200 

the<00:02:40.620> opening<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.130> God's<00:02:41.340> speed<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:41.880> a<00:02:41.910> great

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
the opening of God's speed is a great

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.940 
the opening of God's speed is a great
start<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:42.630> an<00:02:42.810> album<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.170> has<00:02:43.320> a<00:02:43.350> great<00:02:43.680> build

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
start to an album and has a great build

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.100 
start to an album and has a great build
but<00:02:44.460> it<00:02:44.550> feels<00:02:44.760> like<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.090> payoff<00:02:45.420> isn't<00:02:45.840> there

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
but it feels like the payoff isn't there

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.140 
but it feels like the payoff isn't there
once<00:02:46.800> again<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.220> guitar<00:02:47.520> riffs<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:47.880> rhythm

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
once again the guitar riffs and rhythm

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.090 
once again the guitar riffs and rhythm
are<00:02:48.240> excellent<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:48.900> vocals<00:02:49.260> unique<00:02:49.560> but<00:02:50.010> it

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
are excellent and vocals unique but it

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.520 
are excellent and vocals unique but it
just<00:02:50.340> feels<00:02:50.640> underwhelming<00:02:51.480> like<00:02:52.080> wolves<00:02:52.440> and

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
just feels underwhelming like wolves and

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.200 
just feels underwhelming like wolves and
doors<00:02:52.770> you<00:02:53.040> can<00:02:53.190> tell<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.580> talent<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:54.000> there

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
doors you can tell the talent is there

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.910 
doors you can tell the talent is there
but<00:02:54.420> it's<00:02:54.570> just<00:02:54.720> hard<00:02:55.050> to<00:02:55.110> get<00:02:55.260> into<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.680> song

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
but it's just hard to get into the song

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.010 
but it's just hard to get into the song
throughout<00:02:56.790> five<00:02:57.090> crooked<00:02:57.450> lines<00:02:57.660> there<00:02:57.930> is

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
throughout five crooked lines there is

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.720 
throughout five crooked lines there is
an<00:02:58.140> obvious<00:02:58.620> sense<00:02:58.830> that<00:02:59.070> these<00:02:59.220> men<00:02:59.430> love

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
an obvious sense that these men love

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.310 
an obvious sense that these men love
music<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.270> love<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.540> be<00:03:00.690> in<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.900> moment<00:03:01.230> of

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
music and love to be in the moment of

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.350 
music and love to be in the moment of
the<00:03:01.470> groove<00:03:01.770> but<00:03:02.340> while<00:03:02.520> listening<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:03.120> keep

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
the groove but while listening you keep

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.760 
the groove but while listening you keep
hoping<00:03:03.750> for<00:03:03.900> something<00:03:04.140> more

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
hoping for something more

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.200 
hoping for something more
whether<00:03:05.220> it's<00:03:05.400> wishing<00:03:05.730> for<00:03:05.880> something

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
whether it's wishing for something

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.670 
whether it's wishing for something
reminiscent<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.720> their<00:03:06.870> earlier<00:03:07.230> works<00:03:07.440> are

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
reminiscent of their earlier works are

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.890 
reminiscent of their earlier works are
something<00:03:07.980> exciting<00:03:08.520> to<00:03:08.610> blow<00:03:08.790> you<00:03:08.850> away<00:03:09.000> you

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
something exciting to blow you away you

with<00:03:12.150> what<00:03:12.330> is<00:03:12.420> presented

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.470 

yeah
