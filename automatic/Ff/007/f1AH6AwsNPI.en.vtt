00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.320
 [Music] 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:10.650
 good for 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.150
 remove the red lights from an xbox 360 what 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.340
 first that we will use is a piece 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:20.480
 special to open it with care that 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.480
 do not break anything 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.290
 Well then we will remove 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:38.360
 that's 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.550
 and we have along the air 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.070
 and confiscated it to remove the legs 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.070
 slowly so they do not break 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.359
 [Music] 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.300
 Y 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.390
 and the next 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.390
 ah 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.930
 ah 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.170
 [Applause] 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.210
 slowly always to break nothing good 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.409
 what we will do next 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.409
 It will be hell 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.240
 to clean all the microchips 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.810
 once it is clean 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.900
 to throw pasta 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.990
 up on the plate 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.560
 and here too 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.870
 now this followed what we have to 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.060
 do 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.060
 that is easy or for it to take effect 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.930
 that's 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:06.780
 around here also this plate 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.750
 the more part more of the 6 more I'm going to 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.410
 bÃ¡rzola 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.410
 very well 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.810
 now with the betting plate 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.170
 what you have to do is heat the 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.170
 license plate 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.440
 It gives a little bit of heat so that 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.440
 chips melt 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.300
 and so everything works perfectly 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.289
 [Music] 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.480
 Well, I've already done this, what to do 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.519
 is to put the paper to the bar to protect 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.900
 the areas of possible heat 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.900
 then the bar setter 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.170
 we have all at home 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:02.110
 good and this is all you have to follow 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.110
 putting what are the accessories 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.040
 watch out 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.590
 ah 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.590
 now we put this 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.299
 ah 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:29.220
 a home trick to get it back 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.000
 to warm 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.490
 [Music] 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.690
 to peel always stuck so that you do not 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.690
 go the heat 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.950
 we will put ice
