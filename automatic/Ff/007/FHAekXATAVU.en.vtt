00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.950
 hello my name is jeremy saland age 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.289
 I am a belly breeder 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.420
 canine educator good positive method 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:16.209
 I attended the seminar of killings of 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.040
 rue gaston november 2012 device where 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.960
 she was talking about signs of appeasement on 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.689
 the puppies a few days after their 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.189
 birth so I wish to do this 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.949
 little video to be able to prove his 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.210
 say and show that there are waxes 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.970
 payment a few days after the 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.800
 birth by the yawn that 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.210
 is the first sign of appeasement that the 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.220
 show will be able to communicate everything 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.350
 simply because at birth he was born 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.850
 deaf he puts his eyes shut and he 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.540
 there are no other possibilities of 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.579
 signs of appeasement 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:47.079
 so I'll show you all that so 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.440
 that's the scope I was talking to you all 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.710
 on time 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.420
 dish too badly four females there they 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.670
 currently have three days testing 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.590
 have been done until these three days and 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.449
 we still have not seen tim of appeasement 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.879
 so from the third day we 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.280
 let's start filming our stages of 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.890
 manipulation work on puppies 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.600
 to see if we can distinguish 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.599
 first signals of appeasement 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.250
 So here we go we'll start 

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:13.869
 manipulation sessions or on mission 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.340
 to see if we can start already at 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.849
 distinguish the first signs 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.330
 appeasement 

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:22.840
 so there things are born monday 19 on 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.220
 is Friday the 24th so we'll see if at this 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.160
 stage one is the first signals 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.289
 of appeasement knowing that the first 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.849
 tests have indeed revealed to us that I 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.849
 had not yet so here we go 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.380
 at the level of just manipulation 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.119
 to take the puppy is to maintain 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.679
 so we see we try to see the lured 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:46.959
 agitation if we go a yawn 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:54.569
 something a voice marx 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:59.520
 or the agitated good not especially see 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.520
 right now but after 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.729
 obviously does not happen that on a 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.670
 puppy to know sam we will try in 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.680
 the depresses several because here we are 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.740
 may never know a way to 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:19.840
 another but if the displacement one has 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:22.450
 much faster we have the first sign 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.610
 of appeasement on this championship so we 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.069
 see well that precarious could play after the 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.860
 put but we had the first simonac 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.820
 at markets they do not talk they go 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.930
 I'm very happy because it's the 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.540
 first sign of annoyance is appropriate 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.620
 to have helped then the name of days in 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:56.500
 the fact that several tests on 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:58.510
 languages ​​blur on a good ben laps 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.910
 this little movie is coming to an end so 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.019
 we could see on the film 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.450
 some signs of appeasement 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.280
 so as I said about on the beginning of 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.840
 the video so at the yawning level 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.209
 we could have puppies 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.260
 on certain manipulations that could 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.299
 put them uncomfortable 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.799
 seen they were not used so we 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.450
 had some signs of appeasement that 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.700
 was able to film we are very happy to have 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.070
 had this film taken place 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.260
 so we are the first signals 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.650
 of appeasement from the fourth or 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.390
 fifth day after birth 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.910
 until the beginning of their third week 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.769
 so I obviously intend to continue to 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.930
 make genre movies on different 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.790
 worn to show that it is 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.010
 not an isolated case that we can see it on 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.900
 different doors and we can see it 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.040
 also on different tracks and that the 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.989
 appeasement signals are 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.730
 important just it has to be 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.829
 is really taken into account by the 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.719
 breeders simply on the principle 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.620
 or more we're used to the chu at the 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:52.689
 handling 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.489
 we will learn how to communicate with them 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:57.120
 or will read the signs of appeasement we will 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.439
 can use them understand them the 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.030
 able to pass them on to people 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:03.010
 but really make them understand that 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.019
 it is an indispensable tool in life 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.370
 of the dog and in our life to us for 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.849
 ability to avoid all situations 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.379
 just for breeders who 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.900
 can inhabit their maximum choice of 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:16.060
 manipulation that can talk about it to 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.739
 puppy buyers because that's 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.479
 very important to inform them about 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.919
 signs of appeasement so that he can 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.650
 recognize them and themselves 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.150
 use and after that we can have 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.620
 puppies of better quality at 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.870
 behavioral level simply 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.580
 because we got used to them and especially the 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.199
 more important is not the puppies of 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.820
 better quality we will see it goes 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.310
 to be the customers of better quality 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.320
 who will be able to observe the dogs the 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.449
 puppies who will be able to decrypt them 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.580
 communicate with them and see when they 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:45.729
 are in danger and we stop seeing 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.590
 the TV bites dog aggression on 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.880
 kids things like that because 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.260
 unfortunately there are a lot of signs 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.389
 of appeasement that are sent to 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.979
 people who do not know the lia who 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.479
 go too far in the threshold of 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.760
 trigger of the dog and it's the same 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.380
 aggression systematically and there 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.120
 unfortunately the consequences are 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.400
 that the dog having suffered the consequences 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.930
 of her just by being little ta 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.150
 nasier while it is the people who 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.470
 are not trained so as I say 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.830
 systematically on each of my 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.750
 videos 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.750
 nothing is impossible everything remains to be done
