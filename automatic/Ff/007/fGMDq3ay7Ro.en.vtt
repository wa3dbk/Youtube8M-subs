00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
achieved our threshold and now we are

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.320 
achieved our threshold and now we are
ready

if<00:01:47.390> Joaquin<00:01:48.200> flexes<00:01:48.800> his<00:01:48.950> forearm<00:01:49.370> muscles

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
if Joaquin flexes his forearm muscles

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.820 
if Joaquin flexes his forearm muscles
with<00:01:49.940> sufficient<00:01:50.390> intensity<00:01:50.810> it<00:01:51.170> will<00:01:51.470> drive

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
with sufficient intensity it will drive

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.040 
with sufficient intensity it will drive
the<00:01:52.310> activation<00:01:52.820> of<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.000> leds<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:53.690> relay

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
the activation of the leds and relay

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.050 
the activation of the leds and relay
causing<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:54.860> owner<00:01:55.040> nerve<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:55.490> Gabriela<00:01:55.910> to

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
causing the owner nerve of Gabriela to

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.510 
causing the owner nerve of Gabriela to
fire<00:01:56.300> more<00:01:56.510> impulses<00:01:57.170> and<00:01:57.290> hence<00:01:57.740> her<00:01:58.100> muscles

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
fire more impulses and hence her muscles

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
fire more impulses and hence her muscles
to<00:01:58.610> contract

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.839 

okay<00:02:14.540> oppressed

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:21.609 
and the button closest to the red LEDs

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:23.520 
and the button closest to the red LEDs
switches<00:02:22.150> between<00:02:22.420> a<00:02:22.450> high<00:02:22.659> activation<00:02:22.989> and

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
switches between a high activation and

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.530 
switches between a high activation and
low<00:02:23.859> activation<00:02:24.430> mode<00:02:24.609> so<00:02:24.999> you<00:02:25.030> can<00:02:25.239> decide

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
low activation mode so you can decide

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.940 
low activation mode so you can decide
