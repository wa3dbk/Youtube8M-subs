00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.200
 hello friends in this video I love you 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.299
 talk about where to be able to 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.790
 practice their strokes or their different 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.430
 designs if you are starting with this from the 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:22.300
 pintacaritas or good to be improving 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:25.180
 in case you are already practicing and 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.460
 Well, I think the best part 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.890
 where we can practice that is 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.920
 our own skin if we do not have a 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.629
 child that the model as is my case that 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.730
 I do, but do not like it 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.730
 paint the best place I've found 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.230
 is to practice in my arms or in my 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.750
 legs 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.690
 eventually you too 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.239
 a doll like this that you also 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.980
 they can acquire it although not really 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.590
 there is a better place as I mentioned them 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.720
 that the skin since here sometimes the 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.260
 doll what it has is that it does not dry so 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.540
 fast painting and then I do not know 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.190
 slides the brush the same and sometimes is a 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.930
 little bit different from when we're already 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.180
 working on what is the head of 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.160
 children but it does not work perfectly 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.090
 more or less to locate us as to 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:16.010
 the dimensions of the strokes since by 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.290
 say this doll I like it because it brings 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.210
 the head a little smaller and makes me 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.600
 a little bigger that resemble the 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.759
 face as an adult and this one brings the size 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.190
 of what is a child's face and good 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.170
 baby on this part I like it because more 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.330
 or less key one the dimensions of the 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.000
 arms to that only what has helped me 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.190
 me having the doll 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.490
 but as I said I no like 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.590
 practice in your own arms and 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.840
 first they were going to practice hardly 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.360
 what are the two were the chinitos or 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.490
 the little ones the teen tops the 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.369
 legs are perfect there was where I 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.890
 I started to practice on my legs 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.979
 put on shorts and practice to practice and 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.290
 and nothing else with a wet wipe 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:03.370
 or one 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:06.250
 I do not know with something to clean it takes it away 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.690
 one easily and nothing more cream 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.680
 and ready 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.170
 they also sell some as little squares 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.900
 for this foami but it is not form in 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.090
 where they are more or less is about 30 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.490
 centimeters a square where 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.350
 we can also practice 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.890
 this is more or less like this 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.930
 material 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.350
 in this way they do not sell it very expensive but 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.709
 I think that as there is nothing 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.810
 better than our own skin and therefore not 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.000
 it costs us and we can remove it very 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.250
 easily without spending on 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 that in this box that you mentioned 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.850
 they sell and well that's the guy 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.760
 the advice I give them in this video 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.860
 I hope it serves you something and see you in 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.230
 the next tutorial see you later and 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.230
 much success in his practice of facebook
