00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
reality is is you know we start either

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.970 
reality is is you know we start either
as<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> server<00:00:54.989> or<00:00:55.649> as<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> returner<00:00:56.539> you<00:00:57.539> know

roughly<00:00:58.980> half<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.280> points<00:00:59.699> we<00:01:00.059> start<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.629> the

roughly half the points we start in the

we start up with the net and if you

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
person and you have to have the mindset

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.249 
person and you have to have the mindset
that<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:25.530> know<00:01:25.830> you're<00:01:26.130> really<00:01:27.049> one<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.080> these

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
that you know you're really one of these

that you know you're really one of these
two<00:01:28.500> players<00:01:28.850> on<00:01:29.850> every<00:01:30.329> point<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.990> here's

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
two players on every point and here's

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.340 
two players on every point and here's
where<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:31.920> see<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.430> big<00:01:32.460> problem<00:01:33.090> as<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.420> see<00:01:33.689> for

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
where I see the big problem as I see for

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.469 
where I see the big problem as I see for
example<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.829> see<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.130> server<00:01:35.430> or<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.030> see<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
example I see the server or I see the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.330 
example I see the server or I see the
returner<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.229> when<00:01:37.500> they<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.979> mindset

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
returner and when they have that mindset

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.039 
returner and when they have that mindset
well<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.700> know<00:01:38.790> what<00:01:38.970> I'm<00:01:39.180> really<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.810> put

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
well you know what I'm really the put

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.620 
well you know what I'm really the put
away<00:01:40.259> guy<00:01:40.530> or<00:01:41.250> I'm<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.520> put<00:01:41.700> away<00:01:41.909> gal<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.450> this

you're<00:01:44.159> always<00:01:44.340> thinking<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:45.119> either<00:01:45.720> as

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
you're always thinking that either as

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.960 
you're always thinking that either as
serving<00:01:46.530> or<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:46.860> returning<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.790> you're

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
serving or as returning that you're

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.429 
serving or as returning that you're
going<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.180> do<00:01:48.270> something<00:01:48.540> big<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.960> got<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.290> end

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
going to do something big you got to end

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.880 
going to do something big you got to end
the<00:01:49.619> point<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:51.090> really<00:01:52.079> when<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.320> start

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
the point and and really when you start

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.580 
the point and and really when you start
in<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.159> backcourt<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.820> doubles<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:55.170> have<00:01:55.409> to

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
in the backcourt in doubles you have to

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.230 
in the backcourt in doubles you have to
have<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.920> mindset<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.430> you're<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> that

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
have the mindset that you're the that

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.609 
have the mindset that you're the that
you're<00:01:57.390> really<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.750> set<00:01:57.960> up<00:01:58.110> person<00:01:58.469> you're

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
you're really the set up person you're

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.800 
you're really the set up person you're
not<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.799> put<00:01:59.189> away<00:01:59.399> person<00:01:59.820> I<00:01:59.969> mean<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.570> point

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
not the put away person I mean the point

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.010 
not the put away person I mean the point
might<00:02:01.110> develop<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:02.460> where<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:03.240> are<00:02:03.420> ending<00:02:03.719> up

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
might develop to where you are ending up

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.469 
might develop to where you are ending up
being<00:02:04.380> up<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.740> net<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.939> end<00:02:06.119> up<00:02:06.270> being

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
being up a net and and you end up being

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.630 
being up a net and and you end up being
the<00:02:06.540> put<00:02:06.780> away<00:02:06.990> person<00:02:07.439> but<00:02:07.950> for<00:02:08.129> example<00:02:08.190> if

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
the put away person but for example if
