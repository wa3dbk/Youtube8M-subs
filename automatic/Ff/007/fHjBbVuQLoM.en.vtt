feels like a really high-end product so
it<00:01:44.280> feels<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:44.729> you'd<00:01:44.880> pay<00:01:45.060> something<00:01:45.270> you'd

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
it feels like you'd pay something you'd

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.960 
it feels like you'd pay something you'd
pay<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> lot<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.869> money<00:01:45.990> for<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:47.520> only<00:01:47.790> real

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
pay a lot of money for the only real

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.700 
pay a lot of money for the only real
problem<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.390> had<00:01:48.570> would<00:01:48.750> be<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.990> after<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> while

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
problem I had would be is after a while

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.010 
problem I had would be is after a while
they<00:01:49.950> tend<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.430> be<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> bit<00:01:50.909> uncomfortable<00:01:51.149> and

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
they tend to be a bit uncomfortable and

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.700 
they tend to be a bit uncomfortable and
I<00:01:52.979> think<00:01:53.430> that's<00:01:53.640> due<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.240> how<00:01:54.420> tight<00:01:55.079> they<00:01:55.380> can

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
I think that's due to how tight they can

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.230 
I think that's due to how tight they can
be<00:01:55.890> after<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> while<00:01:56.820> now<00:01:57.810> these<00:01:58.079> are<00:01:58.320> made<00:01:58.710> to

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
be after a while now these are made to

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.539 
be after a while now these are made to
swivel<00:02:00.240> up<00:02:00.630> with<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.920> know<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.189> ear<00:02:02.310> cups

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
swivel up with the you know the ear cups

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.030 
swivel up with the you know the ear cups
to<00:02:02.729> swivel<00:02:03.030> up<00:02:03.149> for<00:02:03.869> like<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.290> know<00:02:04.320> DJ<00:02:04.829> use

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
to swivel up for like you know DJ use

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.639 
to swivel up for like you know DJ use
and<00:02:05.250> things<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:06.259> that<00:02:07.259> does

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
and things like that so that does

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.410 
and things like that so that does
definitely<00:02:07.890> play<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.369> big<00:02:08.640> factor<00:02:08.670> into<00:02:09.270> why

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
definitely play a big factor into why

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.869 
definitely play a big factor into why
these<00:02:09.479> are<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:09.989> tight<00:02:10.319> they're<00:02:11.039> not<00:02:11.310> as<00:02:11.489> bad<00:02:11.730> as

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
these are so tight they're not as bad as

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.640 
these are so tight they're not as bad as
the<00:02:12.030> mixer<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.660> lot<00:02:12.900> more<00:02:13.110> comfortable

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
the mixer is a lot more comfortable

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.979 
the mixer is a lot more comfortable
the<00:02:13.799> mixers<00:02:14.190> but<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.330> definitely<00:02:15.750> think<00:02:15.870> that

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
the mixers but I definitely think that

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.309 
the mixers but I definitely think that
these<00:02:16.230> DJ<00:02:16.830> style<00:02:17.280> headphones<00:02:17.989> are<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.049> little

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
these DJ style headphones are a little

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.369 
these DJ style headphones are a little
tighter<00:02:19.620> because<00:02:20.159> of<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.610> swivel<00:02:21.000> feature

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
tighter because of the swivel feature

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.440 
tighter because of the swivel feature
but<00:02:22.379> you<00:02:23.069> know<00:02:23.220> all<00:02:23.519> that<00:02:23.849> is<00:02:24.000> good<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:24.269> all

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
but you know all that is good and all

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.839 
but you know all that is good and all
and<00:02:24.599> it<00:02:24.690> makes<00:02:24.930> sense<00:02:25.230> but<00:02:26.069> you're<00:02:26.459> not<00:02:26.670> going

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
and it makes sense but you're not going

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.190 
and it makes sense but you're not going
to<00:02:26.909> have<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.180> swivel<00:02:27.420> your<00:02:27.750> ear<00:02:27.989> cuff

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
to have the swivel your ear cuff

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.399 
to have the swivel your ear cuff
swiveled<00:02:28.650> most<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.129> time<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:30.290> majority<00:02:31.290> of

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
swiveled most of the time so majority of

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:32.390 
swiveled most of the time so majority of
your<00:02:31.470> time<00:02:31.709> you're<00:02:31.890> going<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.069> have<00:02:32.129> it

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
your time you're going to have it

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.149 
your time you're going to have it
regularly<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.379> it's<00:02:34.379> going<00:02:34.769> to<00:02:34.860> clamp<00:02:35.069> down

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
regularly and it's going to clamp down

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.770 
regularly and it's going to clamp down
on<00:02:35.310> your<00:02:35.610> ears<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.150> it's<00:02:36.360> going<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.599> cause

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
on your ears and it's going to cause

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.930 
on your ears and it's going to cause
some<00:02:37.049> pain<00:02:37.200> after<00:02:37.650> some<00:02:37.980> time<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:38.819> I've

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
some pain after some time so I've

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.850 
some pain after some time so I've
definitely<00:02:39.090> something<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.629> consider<00:02:39.860> and

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
definitely something to consider and

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.949 
definitely something to consider and
these<00:02:41.579> are<00:02:41.700> definitely<00:02:41.970> like<00:02:42.269> some<00:02:42.510> big<00:02:42.750> ear

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
these are definitely like some big ear

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.789 
these are definitely like some big ear
cups<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:44.720> one<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.959> things<00:02:46.200> with<00:02:46.440> this<00:02:46.590> is

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
cups and one of the things with this is

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.920 
cups and one of the things with this is
it's<00:02:47.010> not<00:02:47.190> big<00:02:47.519> enough<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:48.180> cushion<00:02:48.660> isn't

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
it's not big enough the cushion isn't

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.020 
it's not big enough the cushion isn't
big<00:02:49.049> enough<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.859> get<00:02:50.010> your<00:02:50.220> ear<00:02:50.459> completely

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
big enough to get your ear completely

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.390 
big enough to get your ear completely
inside<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.810> as<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.620> can<00:02:52.769> see<00:02:53.040> this<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.370> a

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
inside of it as you can see this is a

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.729 
inside of it as you can see this is a
very<00:02:53.670> circular<00:02:54.150> ear<00:02:54.510> cut<00:02:54.750> these<00:02:55.319> are<00:02:55.379> supposed

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
very circular ear cut these are supposed
