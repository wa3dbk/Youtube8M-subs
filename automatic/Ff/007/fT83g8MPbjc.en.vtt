okay<00:01:32.290> next<00:01:33.290> step<00:01:33.560> is<00:01:33.770> this<00:01:34.370> this<00:01:35.150> Jam<00:01:35.480> that<00:01:35.660> you

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
okay next step is this this Jam that you

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.040 
okay next step is this this Jam that you
previously<00:01:35.990> broke<00:01:36.740> loose<00:01:37.090> you<00:01:38.090> want<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.390> go

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
ahead and thread it the RET all the way

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.520 
ahead and thread it the RET all the way
off<00:01:40.610> so<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:41.360> can<00:01:41.450> get<00:01:41.570> your<00:01:41.690> bellows<00:01:42.080> boot<00:01:42.350> out

eyeball where this nut was and put it

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.310 
eyeball where this nut was and put it
back<00:02:01.610> there<00:02:01.850> that<00:02:02.150> way<00:02:02.300> to<00:02:02.360> be<00:02:02.510> real<00:02:02.750> close<00:02:03.050> for

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
back there that way to be real close for

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.859 
back there that way to be real close for
when<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:03.650> go<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:03.830> get<00:02:04.070> an<00:02:04.160> alignment<00:02:04.660> step<00:02:05.660> is

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
when you go to get an alignment step is

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.210 
when you go to get an alignment step is
you<00:02:06.140> want<00:02:06.170> to<00:02:06.500> move<00:02:06.619> your<00:02:06.770> remove<00:02:07.070> your

you want to move your remove your
bellows<00:02:07.520> boot<00:02:07.790> usually<00:02:08.479> got<00:02:08.600> a<00:02:08.630> small<00:02:08.959> clamp

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
bellows boot usually got a small clamp

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.140 
bellows boot usually got a small clamp
on<00:02:09.470> this<00:02:09.590> outside<00:02:10.070> it's<00:02:10.729> usually<00:02:10.880> got<00:02:11.120> a

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
on this outside it's usually got a

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.440 
on this outside it's usually got a
larger<00:02:12.070> band<00:02:13.070> style<00:02:13.400> clamp<00:02:13.790> on<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.060> inside

larger band style clamp on the inside

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.260 
larger band style clamp on the inside
it's<00:02:14.600> similar<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.990> a<00:02:15.020> CV<00:02:15.470> joint<00:02:15.770> boot<00:02:16.270> they're

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
it's similar to a CV joint boot they're

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.030 
it's similar to a CV joint boot they're
not<00:02:17.420> reusable<00:02:18.020> so<00:02:18.170> just<00:02:18.320> go<00:02:18.440> ahead<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:18.830> take<00:02:19.010> a

not reusable so just go ahead and take a

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.330 
not reusable so just go ahead and take a
screwdriver<00:02:19.340> sup<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:19.970> break<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.270> off<00:02:20.709> and<00:02:21.709> you

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
screwdriver sup and break it off and you

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.850 
screwdriver sup and break it off and you
should<00:02:22.550> be<00:02:22.610> able<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.760> pull<00:02:22.940> this<00:02:23.120> off<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:24.110> some

should be able to pull this off and some

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.110 
should be able to pull this off and some
of<00:02:24.950> these<00:02:25.010> will<00:02:25.190> have<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.370> little<00:02:25.640> nipple<00:02:25.820> for

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
of these will have a little nipple for

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.120 
of these will have a little nipple for
an<00:02:26.390> air<00:02:26.600> hose<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.140> have<00:02:27.380> an<00:02:27.500> air<00:02:27.650> hose<00:02:27.830> hooked

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.370 
an air hose and have an air hose hooked
to<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:28.489> that's<00:02:28.610> just<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:28.970> vent<00:02:29.180> any<00:02:29.810> air

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
to it and that's just to vent any air

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.680 
to it and that's just to vent any air
pressures<00:02:30.890> as<00:02:31.310> you're<00:02:31.489> steering<00:02:31.760> so<00:02:32.630> you

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
pressures as you're steering so you

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.800 
pressures as you're steering so you
don't<00:02:32.810> have<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:32.989> suction<00:02:33.970> and<00:02:34.970> now<00:02:35.690> you're

here

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.849 

here's<00:03:03.090> just<00:03:03.269> a<00:03:03.329> better<00:03:03.510> view<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.959> it<00:03:04.079> to<00:03:04.650> fit

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
here's just a better view of it to fit

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.740 
here's just a better view of it to fit
on<00:03:04.980> it<00:03:05.010> just<00:03:05.250> like<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.480> then<00:03:06.480> you'll<00:03:06.629> run

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
on it just like that then you'll run

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:22.330 
on it just like that then you'll run
your<00:03:06.810> socket<00:03:07.500> over<00:03:07.709> here<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.099> lock<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:08.609> in

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.089 

half<00:03:23.340> inch<00:03:23.579> drive<00:03:24.379> square<00:03:25.379> on<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.650> end<00:03:25.829> of<00:03:25.980> it

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
half inch drive square on the end of it

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.259 
half inch drive square on the end of it
and<00:03:26.159> that's<00:03:26.310> for<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.519> reason<00:03:26.579> because<00:03:26.969> they<00:03:27.150> are

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
and that's for a reason because they are

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.770 
and that's for a reason because they are
usually<00:03:27.450> really<00:03:27.989> tight<00:03:29.269> go<00:03:30.269> ahead<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.599> bust

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
usually really tight go ahead and bust

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:44.679 
usually really tight go ahead and bust
that<00:03:30.959> loose<00:03:31.790> just<00:03:32.790> want<00:03:33.090> them<00:03:33.180> too<00:03:33.329> bad<00:03:41.510> and

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:44.689 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:48.649 

you<00:03:45.689> can<00:03:45.840> see<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.169> just<00:03:46.200> screws<00:03:46.650> in<00:03:47.389> to<00:03:48.389> the<00:03:48.510> end

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 
you can see it just screws in to the end

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:53.959 
you can see it just screws in to the end
of<00:03:48.840> your<00:03:51.680> rack<00:03:52.680> gear<00:03:53.159> this<00:03:53.400> is<00:03:53.459> actually<00:03:53.909> a

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:53.969 
of your rack gear this is actually a

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:57.319 
of your rack gear this is actually a
gear<00:03:55.250> and<00:03:56.250> every<00:03:56.790> one<00:03:56.969> of<00:03:57.000> these<00:03:57.180> are

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
gear and every one of these are

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.509 
gear and every one of these are
different<00:03:57.680> but<00:03:58.680> they<00:03:58.799> have<00:03:58.980> some<00:03:59.219> sort<00:03:59.459> of

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
different but they have some sort of

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.449 
different but they have some sort of
locking<00:03:59.760> mechanism<00:04:00.540> on<00:04:00.689> them<00:04:01.280> so<00:04:02.280> when<00:04:02.340> you

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
locking mechanism on them so when you

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.679 
locking mechanism on them so when you
screw<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:02.819> new<00:04:02.939> one<00:04:03.090> on<00:04:03.180> you're<00:04:03.389> going<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.569> get

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:03.689 
screw the new one on you're going to get

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:05.689 
screw the new one on you're going to get
a<00:04:03.719> new<00:04:03.900> locking<00:04:04.409> mechanism<00:04:04.980> it's<00:04:05.519> going<00:04:05.639> to

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:05.699 
a new locking mechanism it's going to

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:08.390 
a new locking mechanism it's going to
fit<00:04:05.940> right<00:04:05.970> here<00:04:06.150> in<00:04:06.389> those<00:04:06.510> grooves<00:04:07.400> after

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
fit right here in those grooves after
