to<00:02:05.140> cut<00:02:05.320> that<00:02:05.500> out<00:02:05.560> which<00:02:06.010> I<00:02:06.130> couldn't<00:02:06.460> do<00:02:06.580> with

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
to cut that out which I couldn't do with

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.109 
to cut that out which I couldn't do with
concrete<00:02:07.150> block<00:02:07.420> or<00:02:08.610> concrete<00:02:09.610> and<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:09.970> would

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
concrete block or concrete and I would

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.460 
concrete block or concrete and I would
have<00:02:10.300> to<00:02:10.420> put<00:02:10.660> additional<00:02:11.380> walls<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:12.790> there

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
have to put additional walls in there

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.020 
have to put additional walls in there
the<00:02:14.470> other<00:02:14.620> good<00:02:14.830> thing<00:02:15.040> about<00:02:15.070> it<00:02:15.400> is<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:15.580> we

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
the other good thing about it is that we

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.330 
the other good thing about it is that we
don't<00:02:16.180> when<00:02:16.900> we<00:02:17.110> did<00:02:17.530> this<00:02:17.710> we<00:02:17.980> were<00:02:18.010> not

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
don't when we did this we were not

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.940 
don't when we did this we were not
required<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.970> have<00:02:19.000> heated<00:02:19.900> heated<00:02:20.320> basement

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
required to have heated heated basement

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.300 
required to have heated heated basement
because<00:02:21.370> we<00:02:21.910> have<00:02:22.120> in<00:02:22.270> our<00:02:22.450> 30<00:02:22.810> here<00:02:23.110> our<00:02:23.410> 25<00:02:24.010> in

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
because we have in our 30 here our 25 in

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.880 
because we have in our 30 here our 25 in
the<00:02:24.460> wall<00:02:24.670> for<00:02:25.210> the<00:02:25.330> basement<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:25.930> I<00:02:26.710> have

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
the wall for the basement and I have

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.270 
the wall for the basement and I have
always<00:02:27.070> been<00:02:29.340> environmentally<00:02:31.110> conscious<00:02:32.280> on

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
always been environmentally conscious on

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.350 
always been environmentally conscious on
the<00:02:33.970> heating<00:02:34.330> so<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:36.280> just<00:02:36.490> worked<00:02:36.850> around<00:02:37.120> all

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
the heating so it just worked around all

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
the heating so it just worked around all
over<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:40.180> things<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.540> I<00:02:40.660> like<00:02:40.840> about<00:02:41.020> the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
over the things that I like about the

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.870 
over the things that I like about the
about<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.190> walls<00:02:42.550> is<00:02:42.910> with<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:45.190> 12<00:02:45.700> inch

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
about the walls is with the the 12 inch

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.130 
about the walls is with the the 12 inch
thickness<00:02:46.209> it<00:02:46.570> gives<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.260> old<00:02:48.900> almost<00:02:49.900> like

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
thickness it gives the old almost like

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.830 
thickness it gives the old almost like
an<00:02:50.350> Adobe<00:02:50.830> feel<00:02:51.070> when<00:02:51.850> when<00:02:52.330> we're<00:02:52.510> in<00:02:52.630> here

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
an Adobe feel when when we're in here

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.170 
an Adobe feel when when we're in here
because<00:02:53.260> we<00:02:53.470> have<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:53.860> thick<00:02:54.070> walls<00:02:54.310> I<00:02:54.550> would

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
because we have the thick walls I would

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.910 
because we have the thick walls I would
like<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:55.810> have<00:02:55.959> had<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.260> windows<00:02:56.590> maybe<00:02:56.800> a

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
like to have had the windows maybe a

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.190 
like to have had the windows maybe a
little<00:02:57.160> bit<00:02:57.400> inside<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.450> then<00:02:58.630> fill<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:59.080> the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
little bit inside and then fill to the

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.199 
little bit inside and then fill to the
inside<00:02:59.530> and<00:02:59.650> outside<00:02:59.800> but<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.340> decided<00:03:00.670> no<00:03:01.000> I'm

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
inside and outside but I decided no I'm

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.060 
inside and outside but I decided no I'm
just<00:03:01.480> going<00:03:01.750> ahead<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.020> use<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.380> outside<00:03:02.530> and

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
just going ahead and use the outside and

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.190 
just going ahead and use the outside and
then<00:03:03.190> have<00:03:03.430> large<00:03:03.880> shelf<00:03:04.239> areas<00:03:04.630> here<00:03:04.840> so<00:03:05.050> we

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
then have large shelf areas here so we

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.130 
then have large shelf areas here so we
have<00:03:05.410> a<00:03:05.440> shelf<00:03:06.190> that<00:03:06.910> is<00:03:07.060> nearly<00:03:07.420> 12<00:03:07.840> inches

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
have a shelf that is nearly 12 inches

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.260 
have a shelf that is nearly 12 inches
it's<00:03:08.470> about<00:03:08.830> yeah<00:03:09.310> it's<00:03:09.520> nearly<00:03:09.700> 12<00:03:10.030> inches

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
it's about yeah it's nearly 12 inches

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.810 
it's about yeah it's nearly 12 inches
deep<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:11.440> we're<00:03:12.040> going<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.280> finish<00:03:12.459> those

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
deep and we're going to finish those

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.150 
deep and we're going to finish those
most<00:03:13.270> likely<00:03:13.780> by<00:03:14.020> doing<00:03:14.350> stucco<00:03:14.620> around<00:03:15.040> the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
most likely by doing stucco around the

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.080 
most likely by doing stucco around the
corner<00:03:15.580> and<00:03:16.209> then<00:03:16.570> putting<00:03:17.170> I<00:03:17.850> will<00:03:18.850> probably

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
corner and then putting I will probably

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.910 
corner and then putting I will probably
put<00:03:19.450> in<00:03:19.630> wood<00:03:19.930> as<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.230> as<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.930> base<00:03:22.930> unit<00:03:23.650> for

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
put in wood as the as the base unit for

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.300 
put in wood as the as the base unit for
the<00:03:24.130> for<00:03:24.580> the<00:03:24.640> silk<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.630> area<00:03:25.930> down<00:03:26.140> here<00:03:26.310> for

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
the for the silk the area down here for

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.640 
the for the silk the area down here for
now<00:03:27.459> is<00:03:27.700> going<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.000> be<00:03:28.090> storage<00:03:28.450> area<00:03:28.840> but<00:03:29.350> it

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
now is going to be storage area but it

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.320 
now is going to be storage area but it
could<00:03:29.890> also<00:03:30.070> be<00:03:30.250> we're<00:03:30.850> setting<00:03:31.150> it<00:03:31.180> up<00:03:31.269> so

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
could also be we're setting it up so

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.850 
could also be we're setting it up so
that<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:31.750> can<00:03:31.810> be<00:03:32.140> converted<00:03:32.470> into<00:03:32.650> a

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
that it can be converted into a

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.240 
that it can be converted into a
mother-in-law<00:03:33.220> type<00:03:33.670> of<00:03:33.959> house<00:03:34.959> and<00:03:35.290> with<00:03:36.100> the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
size of the house in here it's going to

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.570 
size of the house in here it's going to
be<00:03:39.459> about<00:03:39.940> a<00:03:40.000> thousand<00:03:41.220> with<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.370> wall

be about a thousand with the wall

square feet of usable space and we have

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.449 
square feet of usable space and we have
it<00:03:46.750> we<00:03:46.989> will<00:03:47.170> have<00:03:47.200> it<00:03:47.500> plumbed<00:03:47.800> we've<00:03:48.040> got<00:03:48.250> the

it we will have it plumbed we've got the

rough

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
rough

what<00:03:50.070> I<00:03:50.100> did<00:03:50.430> with<00:03:50.730> our<00:03:50.850> lentils<00:03:51.300> was<00:03:51.690> how<00:03:52.910> they

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
what I did with our lentils was how they

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.690 
what I did with our lentils was how they
are<00:03:54.180> just<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.720> basketball<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:55.620> what<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:56.370> did

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
are just the basketball and what I did

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.690 
are just the basketball and what I did
was<00:03:56.910> I<00:03:57.060> built<00:03:57.330> a<00:03:57.780> buck<00:03:58.230> in<00:03:58.470> here<00:03:58.770> so<00:03:59.010> I<00:03:59.040> had<00:03:59.340> a

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
was I built a buck in here so I had a

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.030 
was I built a buck in here so I had a
two<00:04:00.420> by<00:04:00.570> twelve<00:04:00.870> too<00:04:01.260> but<00:04:01.410> in<00:04:01.590> actually<00:04:02.010> I

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
two by twelve too but in actually I

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.180 
two by twelve too but in actually I
guess<00:04:02.220> it<00:04:02.310> was<00:04:02.490> that<00:04:03.450> I<00:04:03.750> built<00:04:04.260> across<00:04:04.830> and

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
guess it was that I built across and

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.160 
guess it was that I built across and
then<00:04:05.310> supported<00:04:05.910> in<00:04:06.150> on<00:04:06.300> the<00:04:06.480> four<00:04:06.720> footers<00:04:07.050> I

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
then supported in on the four footers I

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.290 
then supported in on the four footers I
had<00:04:07.320> a<00:04:07.350> single<00:04:07.800> stud<00:04:08.370> in<00:04:08.550> the<00:04:08.610> middle<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:09.120> all

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
had a single stud in the middle and all

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.060 
had a single stud in the middle and all
I<00:04:09.330> did<00:04:09.510> was<00:04:09.900> just<00:04:10.290> support<00:04:10.740> that<00:04:10.890> in<00:04:10.980> the

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
I did was just support that in the

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.610 
I did was just support that in the
middle<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.550> I<00:04:11.940> put<00:04:12.600> him<00:04:12.720> in<00:04:12.840> built<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.440> wall

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
middle and I put him in built the wall

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.160 
middle and I put him in built the wall
around<00:04:14.070> that<00:04:14.340> and<00:04:14.640> then<00:04:14.850> we<00:04:15.480> put<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.810> rebar

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
around that and then we put the rebar

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.760 
around that and then we put the rebar
above<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:17.070> below<00:04:17.459> again<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:18.320> when<00:04:19.320> we<00:04:19.500> got

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
above and below again and when we got

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.370 
above and below again and when we got
that<00:04:20.040> done<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:20.940> was<00:04:21.180> they<00:04:21.870> poured<00:04:22.230> the

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
that done it was they poured the

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.070 
that done it was they poured the
concrete<00:04:22.590> into<00:04:23.370> that<00:04:23.670> with<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.600> rebar<00:04:24.900> in<00:04:25.050> it

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
concrete into that with the rebar in it

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.230 
concrete into that with the rebar in it
so<00:04:25.380> it's<00:04:25.530> got<00:04:25.680> rebar<00:04:26.100> throughout<00:04:26.550> and<00:04:26.880> it's

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
so it's got rebar throughout and it's

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.370 
so it's got rebar throughout and it's
pretty<00:04:27.870> solid

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
pretty solid

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.760 
pretty solid
it<00:04:28.710> seems<00:04:29.190> to<00:04:29.490> have<00:04:29.670> not<00:04:30.140> any<00:04:31.140> effect<00:04:31.530> at<00:04:31.680> all

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
it seems to have not any effect at all

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.130 
it seems to have not any effect at all
but<00:04:32.310> the<00:04:32.760> ability<00:04:33.240> is<00:04:33.510> going<00:04:33.630> to<00:04:33.780> come<00:04:33.930> from

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
but the ability is going to come from

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.510 
but the ability is going to come from
the<00:04:34.260> inside<00:04:34.650> rather<00:04:34.920> than<00:04:35.160> from<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.490> outside

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
the inside rather than from the outside

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.910 
the inside rather than from the outside
and<00:04:36.180> we're<00:04:36.810> going<00:04:36.960> to<00:04:37.020> use<00:04:37.140> a<00:04:37.170> standard<00:04:37.500> line

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
and we're going to use a standard line

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.350 
and we're going to use a standard line
based<00:04:38.190> stucco<00:04:38.610> on<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:38.880> inside<00:04:39.300> and<00:04:41.000> we<00:04:42.000> could

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
based stucco on the inside and we could

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.170 
based stucco on the inside and we could
use<00:04:42.780> traditional<00:04:43.170> stucco<00:04:43.890> that<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:44.940> fellow

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
use traditional stucco that the fellow

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.620 
use traditional stucco that the fellow
who<00:04:45.390> is<00:04:45.420> doing<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:45.840> stucco<00:04:46.080> for<00:04:46.440> us<00:04:46.560> joseph

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
who is doing the stucco for us joseph

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.570 
who is doing the stucco for us joseph
has<00:04:48.630> said<00:04:48.900> if<00:04:49.110> we<00:04:49.350> would<00:04:49.500> like<00:04:49.710> to<00:04:49.890> have<00:04:50.100> a<00:04:50.130> nice

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.000 
has said if we would like to have a nice
kind<00:04:51.000> of<00:04:51.150> a<00:04:51.270> brownish<00:04:51.810> color<00:04:51.840> in<00:04:52.470> our<00:04:52.650> stuff

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
kind of a brownish color in our stuff

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.960 
kind of a brownish color in our stuff
that<00:04:53.040> he<00:04:53.400> would<00:04:53.580> use<00:04:53.760> horse<00:04:54.060> manure<00:04:55.700> I'm<00:04:56.700> not

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
that he would use horse manure I'm not

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.400 
that he would use horse manure I'm not
sure<00:04:57.240> that<00:04:57.540> we're<00:04:57.750> ready<00:04:57.840> to<00:04:57.990> do<00:04:58.230> that

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
sure that we're ready to do that

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.830 
sure that we're ready to do that
apparently<00:04:59.220> doesn't<00:04:59.430> have<00:04:59.760> any<00:04:59.940> smell<00:05:00.210> but<00:05:00.510> I

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
apparently doesn't have any smell but I

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.510 
apparently doesn't have any smell but I
think<00:05:01.500> that<00:05:01.650> we're<00:05:01.800> probably<00:05:01.980> going<00:05:02.370> to<00:05:02.430> go

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
think that we're probably going to go

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.310 
think that we're probably going to go
with<00:05:02.700> a<00:05:02.730> line<00:05:02.970> based<00:05:03.240> stucco<00:05:03.600> down<00:05:03.810> here<00:05:04.080> which

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
with a line based stucco down here which

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.520 
with a line based stucco down here which
is<00:05:04.530> a<00:05:04.560> traditional<00:05:05.190> method<00:05:05.370> and<00:05:06.320> this<00:05:07.320> will

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
is a traditional method and this will

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.880 
is a traditional method and this will
all<00:05:07.680> be<00:05:07.710> done<00:05:08.070> after<00:05:08.760> we<00:05:08.790> put<00:05:09.360> in<00:05:09.540> after<00:05:10.410> I<00:05:10.590> put

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
all be done after we put in after I put

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.590 
all be done after we put in after I put
in<00:05:11.040> electrical<00:05:11.640> and<00:05:11.820> plumbing<00:05:11.880> and<00:05:12.360> all<00:05:12.420> that

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
in electrical and plumbing and all that

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.180 
in electrical and plumbing and all that
kind<00:05:12.840> of<00:05:12.900> stuff<00:05:13.020> so<00:05:13.380> that<00:05:13.560> it<00:05:13.770> will<00:05:14.010> be<00:05:14.160> a

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
about the the fast wall is that I can

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.670 
about the the fast wall is that I can
inset<00:05:20.220> those<00:05:20.490> into<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.030> fastball<00:05:21.510> after<00:05:21.750> like

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
inset those into the fastball after like

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.220 
inset those into the fastball after like
I'm<00:05:22.890> going<00:05:23.340> to<00:05:23.400> be<00:05:23.520> doing<00:05:23.700> now<00:05:24.000> I<00:05:24.270> can<00:05:24.960> route<00:05:25.170> it

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
I'm going to be doing now I can route it

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.910 
I'm going to be doing now I can route it
I<00:05:25.680> can<00:05:26.430> run<00:05:26.610> a<00:05:26.940> conduit<00:05:27.720> in<00:05:28.020> those<00:05:28.260> in<00:05:28.740> the

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
I can run a conduit in those in the

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.070 
I can run a conduit in those in the
channels<00:05:29.370> and<00:05:29.640> then<00:05:29.940> we<00:05:30.240> can<00:05:30.390> stucco<00:05:30.600> over

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
channels and then we can stucco over

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.900 
channels and then we can stucco over
those<00:05:31.260> channels<00:05:31.560> which<00:05:32.010> is<00:05:32.190> really<00:05:32.700> going<00:05:32.820> to

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
those channels which is really going to

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.990 
those channels which is really going to
be<00:05:33.030> a<00:05:33.060> nice<00:05:33.330> way<00:05:33.540> of<00:05:33.570> doing
