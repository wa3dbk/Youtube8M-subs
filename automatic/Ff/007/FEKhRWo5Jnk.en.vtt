another<00:04:21.169> part<00:04:21.530> of<00:04:21.620> three<00:04:21.859> would<00:04:22.370> you<00:04:22.520> have

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
another part of three would you have

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:28.240 
another part of three would you have
guessed<00:04:22.910> that<00:04:23.620> probably<00:04:26.770> this<00:04:27.770> is<00:04:27.919> actually

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
guessed that probably this is actually

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.890 
guessed that probably this is actually
pretty<00:04:28.460> tricky<00:04:28.850> hole<00:04:29.090> if<00:04:29.389> you<00:04:29.539> have<00:04:29.870> a

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
pretty tricky hole if you have a

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.710 
pretty tricky hole if you have a
character<00:04:30.229> with<00:04:30.500> a<00:04:30.620> really<00:04:30.919> high<00:04:31.130> shot

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
character with a really high shot

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.270 
character with a really high shot
because<00:04:32.720> you<00:04:33.080> won't<00:04:33.260> be<00:04:33.560> able<00:04:33.680> to<00:04:33.919> get<00:04:34.010> into

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
because you won't be able to get into

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.960 
because you won't be able to get into
this<00:04:34.639> alcove<00:04:35.510> into<00:04:35.810> the<00:04:35.900> tree<00:04:36.139> very<00:04:36.410> easily<00:04:36.970> so

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
this alcove into the tree very easily so
