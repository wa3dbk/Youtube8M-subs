 played a little bit too 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:53.260

 generate a wall of zero coordinates 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:31.280
 was pro generated enemies not pro 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.169
 God generated the letter p and became not 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.050
 to pronounce was 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.029
 and so here are the zero coordinates here I am 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.069
 I am trying to do so pretty 

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:41.379
 extensive excursion from the center of you to 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:43.240
 we have industrial dynamite turns 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:45.520
 Activate the button with the right usually this 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.590
 Unfortunately there did not know him by chance 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.180
 clicking here is such a pretty interesting 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.150

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:58.270
 site a lot of things you can find go in 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:05:01.749
 let's go down to the bar 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:05.169
 and portal well here you can go and 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:12.189
 you can still go to separate us from doing 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:15.099
 we had a portal so damn sure whether 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:15.479
 nazar nazar they are not like a frontal report 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.009
 behind 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.589
 strange he was supposed to be on grain 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:23.800
 here I see and portal and should be 

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:26.409
 the portal to the ender does not matter for jumping 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.120
 in nz we run away and I did not force 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:30.969
 their twilight since becoming and other things because 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.870
 that in principle it is meaningless so here 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:37.449
 our meter had time and the world is with us 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.189
 textures do not worry guys 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:41.319
 you will be fine yes and in principle 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:43.330
 it is normal a sort of texture as yet 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:47.529
 it seems that the room is closed on the very 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:49.750
 business but so let's fly quickly 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.719
 dragon look at it in general 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.979

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:02.800
 ultra nano ultra mini swarm this 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.439
 bjork even for storms on and stuff but in 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.229
 principle that's why it didn't deliver 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:10.360
 forestry because forestry makes sense 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:13.139
