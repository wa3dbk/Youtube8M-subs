00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
kind of fill up for you know skin pack

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.109 
kind of fill up for you know skin pack
and<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.740> match<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.070> back<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.430> i<00:01:32.640> don't<00:01:33.000> know

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
and a match it back so i don't know

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.270 
and a match it back so i don't know
about<00:01:33.270> batman<00:01:33.869> arkham<00:01:34.110> city<00:01:34.530> but<00:01:35.189> i'm

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
about batman arkham city but i'm

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.490 
about batman arkham city but i'm
thinking<00:01:35.310> more<00:01:35.820> along<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.630> lines<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.290> like

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
thinking more along the lines of like

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.280 
thinking more along the lines of like
maybe<00:01:38.159> grand<00:01:38.579> theft<00:01:38.729> auto<00:01:38.970> but<00:01:39.329> again<00:01:40.140> with

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
maybe grand theft auto but again with

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.719 
maybe grand theft auto but again with
that<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.710> can<00:01:40.860> create<00:01:41.040> your<00:01:41.130> own<00:01:41.250> character

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
that you can create your own character

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.969 
that you can create your own character
so<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:42.000> not<00:01:42.119> like<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.509> get<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> set<00:01:43.470> amount<00:01:43.649> of

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
so it's not like you get a set amount of

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.460 
so it's not like you get a set amount of
character<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:44.579> that's<00:01:45.540> kind<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.079> why<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.229> was

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
character so that's kind of why I was

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.530 
character so that's kind of why I was
thinking<00:01:46.770> like<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.130> know<00:01:47.490> call<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> duty

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
thinking like you know call a duty

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.970 
thinking like you know call a duty
possibly<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:49.409> at<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.619> same<00:01:49.829> time

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
possibly but at the same time

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.100 
possibly but at the same time
you<00:01:51.040> you<00:01:51.490> don't<00:01:51.700> i<00:01:52.060> don't<00:01:52.240> know<00:01:52.420> i<00:01:52.450> just<00:01:52.570> don't

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
you you don't i don't know i just don't

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.140 
you you don't i don't know i just don't
see<00:01:53.170> call<00:01:53.470> of<00:01:53.590> duty<00:01:53.800> happening<00:01:54.190> either<00:01:54.370> good<00:01:54.970> i

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
see call of duty happening either good i

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.720 
see call of duty happening either good i
just<00:01:55.180> changed<00:01:55.630> my<00:01:55.720> mind<00:01:55.930> that<00:01:56.140> fast<00:01:56.410> hmm<00:01:57.310> let's

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
just changed my mind that fast hmm let's

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.580 
just changed my mind that fast hmm let's
think<00:01:57.850> here<00:01:58.180> so<00:01:58.570> what's<00:01:58.840> a<00:01:58.990> video<00:01:59.260> game<00:01:59.560> that

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
think here so what's a video game that

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.980 
think here so what's a video game that
they<00:02:00.100> could<00:02:00.310> actually<00:02:00.520> use<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:01.720> hands

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
they could actually use the hands

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.430 
they could actually use the hands
characters<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:03.010> you<00:02:03.400> can<00:02:03.550> also<00:02:03.790> have<00:02:04.180> a

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
characters and you can also have a

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.200 
characters and you can also have a
scenery<00:02:05.440> with<00:02:05.830> it<00:02:06.010> and<00:02:06.190> that's<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.820> one<00:02:07.000> thing

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
scenery with it and that's the one thing

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.060 
scenery with it and that's the one thing
that<00:02:07.270> that<00:02:07.840> that's<00:02:08.020> gonna<00:02:08.260> be<00:02:08.380> crazy<00:02:08.530> now<00:02:08.890> they

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
that that that's gonna be crazy now they

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.830 
that that that's gonna be crazy now they
could<00:02:09.460> possibly<00:02:09.790> pull<00:02:10.030> off<00:02:10.119> call<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.510> duty<00:02:10.720> but

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
could possibly pull off call of duty but

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.290 
could possibly pull off call of duty but
at<00:02:10.960> the<00:02:11.050> same<00:02:11.290> time<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:12.310> will<00:02:12.490> be<00:02:12.520> kind<00:02:12.970> of<00:02:13.090> more

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
at the same time it will be kind of more

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.730 
at the same time it will be kind of more
like<00:02:13.330> different<00:02:13.990> countries<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.470> different

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
like different countries and different

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.550 
like different countries and different
you<00:02:15.370> know<00:02:15.520> things<00:02:16.330> like<00:02:16.450> that<00:02:16.720> like<00:02:17.020> warriors

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
you know things like that like warriors

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.560 
you know things like that like warriors
or<00:02:17.590> maybe<00:02:18.070> like<00:02:18.310> Rayman<00:02:18.790> legends<00:02:19.390> or

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
or maybe like Rayman legends or

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.510 
or maybe like Rayman legends or
something<00:02:19.930> or<00:02:20.080> like<00:02:20.110> Alan<00:02:20.740> Wake<00:02:20.950> or<00:02:21.160> something

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
something or like Alan Wake or something

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.580 
something or like Alan Wake or something
crazy<00:02:21.700> like<00:02:22.000> that<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.630> maybe<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.350> where<00:02:23.500> they

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
crazy like that I maybe to where they

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.260 
crazy like that I maybe to where they
have<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:24.040> don't<00:02:24.340> know<00:02:24.430> characters<00:02:24.940> like<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:25.240> I

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
have I don't know characters like that I

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.060 
have I don't know characters like that I
didn't<00:02:25.750> really<00:02:25.870> play<00:02:26.080> alan<00:02:26.440> wake<00:02:26.470> like<00:02:26.800> that

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
didn't really play alan wake like that

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.890 
didn't really play alan wake like that
to<00:02:27.520> be<00:02:27.640> honest<00:02:27.910> i<00:02:27.970> think<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.210> may<00:02:28.300> just<00:02:28.330> be<00:02:28.540> one

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
to be honest i think it may just be one

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.140 
to be honest i think it may just be one
man<00:02:29.140> character<00:02:29.530> Oh<00:02:29.800> Bioshock<00:02:30.640> will<00:02:30.820> be<00:02:30.910> pretty

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
man character Oh Bioshock will be pretty

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.850 
man character Oh Bioshock will be pretty

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
is out of the question maybe we'll get

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.550 
is out of the question maybe we'll get
like<00:02:45.400> DC<00:02:46.240> or<00:02:46.450> something<00:02:46.870> crazy<00:02:46.990> like<00:02:47.200> that<00:02:47.290> if

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
like DC or something crazy like that if

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.990 
like DC or something crazy like that if
that's<00:02:47.740> not<00:02:47.950> like<00:02:48.130> on<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.400> sunny<00:02:48.610> side<00:02:48.700> which

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
that's not like on the sunny side which

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.420 
that's not like on the sunny side which
I<00:02:49.120> I<00:02:49.360> don't<00:02:49.750> think<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:50.830> maybe<00:02:51.100> we'll<00:02:51.280> get

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
I I don't think so so I maybe we'll get

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.940 
I I don't think so so I maybe we'll get
DC<00:02:52.030> maybe<00:02:52.360> that'll<00:02:52.690> be<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.840> next<00:02:53.140> mashup<00:02:53.740> pack
