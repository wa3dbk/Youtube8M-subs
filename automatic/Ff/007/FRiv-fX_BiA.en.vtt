00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello friends I have returned after no 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.660
 have internet I have given the task of 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.820
 make a top and good as you saw the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.070
 title will already know what this top is about 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.380
 the top I mean it's just from me 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.570
 opinion and only mine if they did not like how 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.520
 So your problem was there, so 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.380
 bother please and that goes for the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.270
 fanboys alright let's start with the top 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.490
 to 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.920
 batman suit Trilogy 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.930
 gentleman of the night I do not say it was a 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.820
 file I just put it to be something 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.100
 ridiculous before the costume of the version 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.140
 porn that they took out I know it's something 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.090
 impossible but me to make the suit 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.460
 of the pornographic version is more 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.440
 attached to the comic and it's something darker I know 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.110
 that the director of this great trilogy 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.879
 he put on that suit that does look good 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.129
 I say that the pornographic version 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.050
 he liked his suit better both are good 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.770
 costumes but I would stay with the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.770
 pornographic version 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.190
 the lizard of the amazing spiderman 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.199
 to me since I was little I always wanted to see 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.600
 a lizard in a movie was one of 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.790
 my favorite villains in childhood and 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.580
 be it for the famous one would be the 90s where 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.710
 they interpreted it very well the lizard in 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.690
 this movie must admit I did not like it 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.910
 for nothing if only they had put him 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.369
 a bluish green and the longest snout 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.350
 as it is shown in the series it would have 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.360
 stayed a little better with the technology 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.570
 and digitalization of shawn but in short 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.450
 so it was left you can not do anything 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.060
 ah 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.460
 black card from the movie ghost rider no 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.530
 seriously I imagined a wonderful 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.020
 ghost movie rider the movie I liked it 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.539
 only one thing that angered me was the 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.640
 appearance of bleaching by God what 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.710
 they put a normal type and nothing else says that 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.600
 He is the son of the devil but then I said 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.579
 maybe they put it better in the movie and 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.259
 I only saw this a great disappointment of the 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.390
 way of talking about that art in a 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.000
 very disappointing movie in my opinion 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.950
 already many and that's why I put it in this top 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.789
 as one of the great files of 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.789
 marvel movies 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.119
 as a bonus I will put venom of the 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.370
 trilogy of spiderman by god all 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.290
 We were expecting a big venom but this one 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.720
 he looked so great in the movie though 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.640
 it was not the director's fault he did not want 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.620
 put venom in the movie but what 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.360
 they pressed as the fans craved 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.120
 still venom in the last movie in 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.100
 those times this venom almost did not 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.050
 I saw the body and when it was seen 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.270
 removed the symbiote from the face never 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.000
 we saw that he will stick out his tongue and also that 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.950
 he was very thin to be a good and this 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.750
 was the bonus of this top of the countries 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.600
 from the marvel movies 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.960
 ah 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.940
 the mandarin of the movie iron man 3 ok 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.340
 when I first saw the trailer for 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.260
 this movie got me really excited 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.150
 could there be Mandarin in action 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.010
 I went to the premiere and I was so excited that 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.350
 I was very disappointed when I left 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.390
 God put to the command of John as if it were 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.700
 only one actor in the movie Iron Man 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.260
 3 I was very disappointed and I speak for all 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.480
 that was the biggest mistake that 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.520
 committed in this movie I must admit 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.470
 that I got some laugh but not 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.540
 justifies the great disappointment of changing 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.470
 the mandarin paper a great file of 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.400
 marvel for this top 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.920
 ah 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.379
 now we come to the big movie file 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.450
 of comics in my opinion 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.400
 that's how he talked about the great file of putting a 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.489
 character in a movie 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.019
 spoke of current in x-men origins and 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.629
 all who saw this movie are 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.489
 they were quite disappointed by the 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.530
 big disappointment that this movie gave and 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.579
 the great file of the current by god not 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.890
 there is more to say 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:43.049
 at the beginning it was fine but afterwards 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.030
 they put the experiment and they ruin everything 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.769
 how to sew her mouth if it was the 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.720
 real spirit would have used his 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.609
 blades and he would have opened his mouth and 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.459
 talk about pure crazy things like 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.079
 accustomed actor but it was not like that alone 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.209
 it was a huge disappointment and a 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:00.329
 Foulness of alcohol in this movie 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.519
 there is nothing more to say good until 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.950
 here this top ends thanks for watching 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.930
