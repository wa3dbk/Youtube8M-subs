 Baker Corporation Let's see what 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.769
 would come to be the unboxing and the video 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.090
 video review of the multifunctional hp in 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.670
 35 25 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:19.030
 we can see the logo on the box 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:22.300
 of hp in saying the characteristics of 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.009
 wireless connection 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.050
 and the characteristics locations 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.770
 multifunctional is to say that prints 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.080
 scan and copy 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.870
 we see here the ink advantage logo 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.200
 that high quality printing at a cost 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.200
 lower 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.430
 we also observed what would become 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.460
 the print feature that we 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:50.600
 allows through wireless connection 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:55.220
 be able to use the printer by means of 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.810
 a smartphone via wifi also has the 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.620
 monochromatic screen feature 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.680
 high resolution printing adopt 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.680
 automatically we see here what 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.150
 would come to be the logo of the type of 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.210
 cartridge that uses that in this case 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.460
 it would be the number 670 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.680
 with the skills that are cartridges 4 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.760
 individual translation that is black 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.760
 yellow red and blue 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.390
 going through this side 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.190
 we see again what is the 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.290
 characteristics of the cartridges also 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.300
 optionally optional 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.790
 use the xl kind of greater 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.480
 capacity is the characteristic that 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.520
 It Includes USB cable and here we see what 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.659
 must be the minimum requirements of the 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.369
 system 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.770
 It is important to mention that he works 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.719
 both for s frames and for windows 7 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.719
 vista and xp service pack 3 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.440
 and now we proceed to open the box 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.550
 we can see that generally we 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.550
 we found with the power cable 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.920
 so that we have it 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.210
 as well 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.100
 we got the manual 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.660
 in different languages ​​including the 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.140
 Spanish because it would be the manual 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.080
 with the specifications of the printer 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.610
 explaining what the buttons and the 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.870
 operating system as engracia the 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.870
 driver installation 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:44.520
 here we have what would come to be the 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.520
 Quick installation guide 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:54.200
 warranty certificate hp 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.880
 said with the printer drivers 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.280
 and here 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.959
 we can see what 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.959
 bring the cartridges 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.849
 we see that they are in this case cartridges 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.849
 individual as they indicate in the box 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.450
 what would come to be red yellow 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.450
 blue and black finally 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.320
 now we proceed to take out the 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.320
 multifunctional 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.319
 ok finally here we can observe what 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.230
 what would become the multifunctional 35 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.090
 25 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.720
 the first thing we can see straightens the

 top down the button 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:03.250
 confirmation then I have ok what 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:05.650
 it would be the wifi button 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.320
 or wireless connection and the button 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.450
 print as I mentioned to be able to 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.060
 transfer or send to print from 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.430
 any smartphone and we also see what 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.160
 that would come to be the power button 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.590
 on this side we have what is the 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.630
 identification of the type of printer 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.820
 Multifunctional type hp deskjet in 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.820

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.000
 in the back 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.120
 we observed what would become the 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.690
 connector for the current and the for 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.690
 USB Cable 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:52.430
 above is where the 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.620
 photocopied in this black 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.170
 and reviewing the characteristics of this 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.870
 multifunctional we have that has a 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.600

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.870
 as for the scan 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.330
 the scanning is done of course in the 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:35.480
 front part is a color way since 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:38.449
 be format jpg df efe 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.749

 resolution of 600 dots per inch dpi 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.699
 in terms of connectivity we have to 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:02.300
 a wi-fi connectivity beats the series 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:04.849
 bgn usb connection as we saw in the 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.880
 back in this case is 2.0 of 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:10.240
 high speed 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.680
 the characteristic of spring and how much 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.720
 to the size of the paper can handle 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:19.180
