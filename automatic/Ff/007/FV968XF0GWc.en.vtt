edge that's right and then also on the
table<00:01:44.729> you'll<00:01:44.850> find<00:01:44.909> Eva<00:01:45.570> planks<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.799> we<00:01:46.920> put

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
table you'll find Eva planks that we put

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.480 
table you'll find Eva planks that we put
here<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.030> can<00:01:49.100> use<00:01:50.100> them<00:01:50.310> to

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
here so that you can use them to
