the skids pause neutralize all movements

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.850 
the skids pause neutralize all movements
then<00:00:24.930> when<00:00:25.110> you're<00:00:25.200> ready<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.590> lift<00:00:25.740> the

now<00:00:31.200> the<00:00:31.289> new<00:00:31.860> ver<00:00:32.040> has<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.430> few<00:00:32.790> more<00:00:32.940> inputs

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
now the new ver has a few more inputs

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.229 
now the new ver has a few more inputs
than<00:00:33.720> that<00:00:33.960> but<00:00:34.590> simply<00:00:34.920> put<00:00:35.340> two<00:00:36.000> step

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239
