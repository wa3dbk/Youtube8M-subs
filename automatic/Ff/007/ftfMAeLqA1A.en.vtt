00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.649
 very good to everyone today the dow that 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:09.059
 We are in minecraft blanket 1.5 point 1 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:14.639
 I think I've never done a review of 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.139
 no way I quite like weapons and 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.600
 Well the link you have in the 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.900
 description you have there the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.130
 the mod and the dairy are there what 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.950
 you can see there 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.290
 in general, this is used 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.520
 then two items to build the 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:34.560
 weapons gunpowder iron is also used and 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.990
 you have some objects and weapons that 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.760
 you care that they also have models 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.750
 super chulos income 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.750
 m 16 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.180
 It's done 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:57.600
 Hello 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.840
 p 90 are cool like those of those who 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.840
 make 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.920
 to me 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.520
 I would like to find bugs 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.509
 practice aim 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.509
 from ay ay ay 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.410
 fourth this looks like they are like rifles 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.950
 or something like that I do not understand 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.509
 these things 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.409
 I think it's call of duty things and 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:27.289
 little but this is the one that cause the most 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.690
 then there he went on the right you see the 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:33.490
 look 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:37.610
 is a sniper like the one that is super 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:42.290
 I tell you skinny skinny 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.820
 plates as the web this weapon but if 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.690
 I had to play a game of these types 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.390
 much more capable type call of duty things 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.640
 so I think I would get this kind of 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.420
 weapon 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:59.640
 good if not point directly until 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.109
 it's pretty cool this what I do not 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.640
 like the way for example is that for 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:04.789
 put together as you are seeing that I point 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.789
 here 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.360
 to sign up you use the key to the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.910
 key to you already know what it is to turn the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.460
 left so we have forward for 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.590
 back right and that's because if you give 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.600
 to the point that is what we liked 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.600
 is used for example 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.370
 also the design 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.200
 but it does not make a big bang 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.200
 It is very small 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.319
 not even sport hole 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.370
 here it has appeared more but because 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.880
 there was a hole to see here that is 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.880
 flat car 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.480
 I think it's a little bit the truth 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:59.820
 hey was pretty cool you have in the 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.350

 if you want to keep an eye on it there they are 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.860
 all flogging and so on 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.340

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.500
