00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.669
 off to a new shadertact review 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:20.170
 This time is for Tuesday I shake 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:21.910
 shake pack and this is it 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.510
 to get a jetpack which i also let's do 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.330
 play uses what xe has made 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.710
 and those are here on the server in 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.940
 our secret belongs with worldwide 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.720
 people maybe on the server 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:37.510
 they know that and play for the first time 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.390
 I care about what I mean the whole time 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.650
 small teeny little question in advance I have 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.879
 now for every week shader pack 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.500
 even if it might 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.790
 Some people do not like it 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.170
 the question is then again like me 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.670
 it can make these people happy 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.010
 Further there was a demand from 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.540
 a person that you think you do 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.610
 nomad reviews is a bit 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.260
 boring, well, I'm wondering now 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.480
 I just do let's play swat reviews 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.640
 texture pack presentation and shader pÃ©cs 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.960
 Now I'm still wondering that should me 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.309
 do more but you can give me one 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.220
 Some suggestions say what else 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.500
 I like to see adventure maps 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.149
 both no idea just let yourself 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.200
 something just as cool maybe 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.850
 I should have a few other people then 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.950
 Get the ones that are all that big for you 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.780
 I can not get there so you can 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.910
 but me a few small suggestions 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.470
 do 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.789
 Furthermore, I would say we catch 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.649
 they simply equal time to 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:27.490
 Let's start with the water to the water 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:29.590
 Looks very cool and there 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.840
 I have justine money which I am very 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.459
 for me people at steam write and 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.289
 again to ace of spades one of the 

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:39.910
 worst player invite so that 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.890
 Water is actually such a relative 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.440
 cool water is also like in the cooler 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.950
 otherwise the leaves wobble there 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.660
 here is a reflection and the shaders are 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.920
 very very light I do the whole thing 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.800
 by the way, in the 5 112 x 512 512 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.660
 512 tech bacon from the 3d i can as 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.280
 very heartfelt because that really 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.220
 very very cool is action pack 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.750
 although I must say makes 100 1828 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.729
 actually no big difference on 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.209
 far away if you like it can be like 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.700
 demonstrate 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.040
 you can see the sharpness of the textures here 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.270
 which of course change a bit yes 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.920
 otherwise probably already from 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.150
 the shader tact you can get the whole 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.750
 to have a look 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.489
 There is also something here at night 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.510
 Which day is a 15,000 made 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.640
 Naturally 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.640
 of course that's the sky that shines 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.720
 very nice the moon reflects like that 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.579
 a bit is not quite 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.260
 cool 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:35.019
 the water with the moon so radiate 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.069
 bit to look gives the reflection in the 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.599
 we can also look up water 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.180
 they are not here for example 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.079
 available as with the crusaders or at 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.480
 the other I do not remember 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.459
 Exactly I would have my capek where that too 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.900
 reflects but here you can ever 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.090
 looks nice in the dark, too 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.420
 very cool and in the daytime 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.819
 Of course, day looks like this 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.129
 actually still very cool 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.150
 well, what the link from me to 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.400
 download is not my description 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.909
 gesture counts as well would be the next 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.799
 Video 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:06.959
 I suppose that would be tomorrow 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.959
 texture pack or murder review
