00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.620 
chord it's gonna be an f-sharp minor
with<00:04:58.960> C<00:04:59.290> sharp<00:04:59.530> in<00:04:59.710> the<00:04:59.800> base<00:04:59.830> so<00:05:00.729> all<00:05:01.449> the

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
with C sharp in the base so all the

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:14.550 
with C sharp in the base so all the
notes<00:05:01.780> are<00:05:02.020> C<00:05:02.560> sharp<00:05:02.860> a<00:05:03.130> C<00:05:03.900> sharp<00:05:04.900> F<00:05:05.530> sharp<00:05:05.889> a

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.600 

and<00:05:15.560> then<00:05:15.680> it<00:05:15.800> goes<00:05:15.980> to<00:05:16.010> B<00:05:16.640> minor<00:05:18.490> then<00:05:19.490> you're

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
and then it goes to B minor then you're

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.420 
and then it goes to B minor then you're

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
gonna do a little cool thing here it's

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.600 
gonna do a little cool thing here it's
gonna<00:05:22.640> go<00:05:23.680> first<00:05:24.680> I'll<00:05:24.890> teach<00:05:25.040> you<00:05:25.220> the<00:05:25.280> left

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:47.599 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:06:04.790 

so<00:05:48.599> altogether<00:05:48.810> it<00:05:49.439> sounds<00:05:49.860> like

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.890 

so<00:06:05.800> the<00:06:05.950> whole<00:06:06.130> bridge<00:06:06.340> park<00:06:06.670> together<00:06:07.000> sounds

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
so the whole bridge park together sounds

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:23.629 
so the whole bridge park together sounds
like

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639
