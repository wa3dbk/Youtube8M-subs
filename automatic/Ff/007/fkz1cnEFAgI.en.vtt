00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.650

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:12.890
 sexual yes 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.530
 if you see me 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:18.390
 for me 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.390
 it's the bmv 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.500
 and 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.160
 same 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:33.760
 of head 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:38.789
 at the same time and this one of the baby to give me 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.789
 carries out 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.930
 all right 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.930
 green 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.000
 how nice 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.000
 a death 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.850
 is 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.850
 today 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.850
 Giving me a call 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.180
 do not look at me 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.620
 I want my life 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.870
 it can be 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.180
 a car leaving 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.760
 for a moment I lost my mind to 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.320
 wake 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.320
 towards her coli 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.780
 when he saw me I cry and he said something 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.780
 guayas 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.650
 a week 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.860
 and maybe because it rots me 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.850
 well the brazier 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.260
 Nevertheless 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.260
 for a minute 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.649
 my hunger 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.020
 why 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.310
 why 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.310
 because he taught 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:30.060
 It must be good for them 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.060
 with my love 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.409
 d 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.430
 very well 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:10.109
 this duel 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.549
 complicated difficult let's repeat it 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.790
 Well, Carlos MorÃ¡n said it 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:18.459
 seconds those minutes to them give them the 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.629
 song today to prepare the 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.760
 I grieve and they do it by taking the challenge and 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:27.370
 doing it the best it can now 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.280
 we listen to the opinion of our jury 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.879
 fernando we heard good has had 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.409
 nuances 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:37.599
 has had nuances has had moments 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:40.450
 good moments and moments also there 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:42.549
 that have been shocked and have tried to 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.709
 leave because even the letters do not 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.540
 they were part a part of the current 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.129
 hour because indeed the English I 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.829
 there is no no I have nothing to do but 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:54.250
 but it has really been a duo for me 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:57.730
 funny thank you very much 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.620
 fernando arma mari carmen a smile 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.840
 enjoyed the song with the enjoyed 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.370
 tell us please feel those nerves 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.250
 that exist when you do not have the 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.950
 security of the letter and new here your 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.900
 little eyes that look but good is part 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.740
 of the contest these tests are going to happen 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.220
 everyone 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:18.470
 amy days you were in character I liked it 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.390
 and you had the title 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.120
 Ã¡lex is also that you dress very well 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:26.030
 only that that fails the letter that 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.550
 anyway you wanted it to emit surprise from 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.010
 letter but good put there too very 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:35.440
 well guys, thank you very much 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.440
 what is the fateful part 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:43.769
 but they changed it by which unclear but 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.979
 I did first and did it in the second 

00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:48.979
 part you did the part that he could not 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.979
 yes 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:53.960
 because good a good solution a 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.820
 good solution 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:00.730
 It's a good solution 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:04.000
 ricardo morÃ¡n listens to him voice that yes of and 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:06.370
 it has been loaded with sense thanks 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.889
 I was telling you 18 different things to 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.099
 the choice is to say 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:14.439
 good for years the many artists 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:16.449
 nationals considering that we live in 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:19.419
 a country in which the vast majority 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:22.539
 we speak English perfectly and at least 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:25.240
 be this benefited of that singing in 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:29.080
 pubs and in bars singing a popular wash 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:31.150
 and where are sorry things that look like 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:36.069
 to the letter of which today amy 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:39.599
 winehouse has long displayed no no 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:41.889
 they are not applauding because it is wrong 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:45.069
 because instead of singing the letter to 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:47.169
 sing of something that looks and has 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:49.120
 tried to leave and when I said good 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.620
 it's an advantage that suddenly the 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.449
 Spanish-speaking artists who do 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.650
 they can learn the letter immediately 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:55.629
 which began to get phrases from the 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.539
 second verse in the first verse and 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:06:00.550
 the girl was dying and the 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:03.120
 they turned on the lights of the car was the 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:06.370
 story was all told upside down 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.830
 very strange I am the version to different 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.620
 an alternative world of song e 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.190
 industries the end I wanted to tell the 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:17.270
 fret you want to see apologies 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.270
 it is lawful 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.820
 in one in a day of competitions guys 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.350
 all those who remain in the competition 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.880
 They are very good for us 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.770
 very hard day to one of the four 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.930
 we see having to say goodbye I do not know which one 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:36.650
 of the three it is the day you 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:38.419
 it's your turn that's good then it's going to be 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:42.050
 Now I realize that it is triply 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:44.389
 difficult then and I thought listening 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.910
 the four solos that was going to be very 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:48.410
 difficult but unlike yesterday that 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.030
 both were much better than 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.220
 alone which shows that the challenge if 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.570
 can be achieved today 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.699
 the truth that the two have not been very 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:58.039
 good guys neither of the two 

00:06:55.699 --> 00:07:00.259
 I feel that they have tried to get ahead 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:02.630
 but their solos have been much better 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:04.490
 of the 4 many thanks in this 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.729
 jury I ask you please take 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.729
 seat
