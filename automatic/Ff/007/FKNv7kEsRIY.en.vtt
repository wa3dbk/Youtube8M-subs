00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.570
 we not with a consumer and for the session more often but for lionesses and 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:07.899
 six f 16 s 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.599
 we stay bizarre and not in connection with it 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:14.009
 perform the duties of the army not only calling the Netherlands but 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.399
 everything off 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:17.259
 to support this football 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:19.769
 with those six f16 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.960
 the boys say 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.519
 it is these missions and suspicions 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.640
 well we know it will be a few months 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.739
 but two more government aircraft are ready day and night 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:31.980
 within 30 minutes 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.980
 we are coming and if necessary 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.790
 Calling NATO at the request have also decided to come out to Maria 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.090
 it recently started again with a hundred meters further on the 4 6 2 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
 we are disappointed i think we are 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.400
 that suggested blatter is the same 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.400
 We naturally hope that this call states that have been grateful use 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.620
 made of it 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.620
 he did know how much in a preparatory work 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.380
 yes i know it actually came to be a little less small 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.990
 the two go between utrecht and geldermalsen 4 for a few weeks 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.930
 the sun three dogs 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.640
 I am grateful to Parliament 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.950
 get a bit of support waiting 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.460
 i'm a bit quiet the press believes here in kana 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.020
 as in the training center Bruges 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.460
 and then three days and we are ready for the first missions 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.510
 earthquakes 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.810
 we do this together with the Dutch on the cooperation with the kids 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.710
 you see that the first several start 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.960
 there is a no information and a few showers so that our pilots in March on the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.830
 was here to blame 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.770
 and that is still 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.980
 Independence stands out as you seem to indicate 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:25.219
 it is also not the first time that we work together 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.519
 for some of this netbook for myself is the third time 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.250
 the first Belgian to do the liver cancer in Eindhoven 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.339
 were flying before the ball 

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:39.389
 three years ago that the day before half a year will also be in kabul alongside us 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:40.279
 come to stand 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:44.029
 but now again the same so in that regard we have experience that we have this in 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:45.219
 collaboration with the car
