okay<00:00:02.939> so<00:00:03.000> this<00:00:03.360> is<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.570> playthrough<00:00:04.170> of<00:00:04.290> Hana<00:00:04.620> in

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
okay so this is a playthrough of Hana in

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.740 
okay so this is a playthrough of Hana in
a<00:00:04.890> chopper<00:00:05.130> with<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.759> hard<00:00:06.029> controls<00:00:06.480> that's

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
a chopper with the hard controls that's

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.160 
a chopper with the hard controls that's
using<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.140> mouse<00:00:08.540> not<00:00:09.540> many<00:00:09.719> people<00:00:09.929> play<00:00:10.050> on

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
using the mouse not many people play on

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.930 
using the mouse not many people play on
the<00:00:10.260> how<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.410> controls<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:10.860> guess<00:00:11.040> they<00:00:11.880> are

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
the how to controls I guess they are

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.240 
the how to controls I guess they are
quite<00:00:12.360> tricky<00:00:12.590> this<00:00:13.590> really<00:00:13.860> just<00:00:13.889> sort<00:00:14.130> of

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
quite tricky this really just sort of

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.950 
quite tricky this really just sort of
proves<00:00:14.490> that<00:00:14.580> it<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:14.759> possible<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.269> do<00:00:15.480> perfect

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
proves that it is possible to do perfect

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.480 
proves that it is possible to do perfect
sand<00:00:16.139> fasts<00:00:16.529> all<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.980> way<00:00:17.039> through<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.340> game

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
sand fasts all the way through the game

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.580 
sand fasts all the way through the game
on<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.750> difficult<00:00:19.050> controls

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
on the difficult controls

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.160 
on the difficult controls
okay<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:20.490> level<00:00:20.760> 1<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.000> 2<00:00:21.150> just<00:00:21.510> pretty<00:00:22.020> easy

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
okay so level 1 and 2 just pretty easy

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.460 
okay so level 1 and 2 just pretty easy
to<00:00:22.380> fly<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.830> exit<00:00:23.390> at<00:00:24.390> level<00:00:24.630> 3<00:00:24.960> you've

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
to fly to the exit at level 3 you've

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.540 
to fly to the exit at level 3 you've
gotta<00:00:25.590> tap<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:25.920> little<00:00:26.010> brick<00:00:26.369> out<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.609> way

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
gotta tap this little brick out the way

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.980 
gotta tap this little brick out the way
the<00:00:29.550> nice<00:00:29.670> thing<00:00:29.820> about<00:00:29.849> mouse<00:00:30.420> controls<00:00:30.779> is

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
the nice thing about mouse controls is

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.209 
the nice thing about mouse controls is
that<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.349> kind<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.740> give<00:00:31.920> things<00:00:32.070> a

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
that you can kind of give things a

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.740 
that you can kind of give things a
little<00:00:32.430> nudge<00:00:32.790> like<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.390> can<00:00:33.510> kind<00:00:33.600> of

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
little nudge like that you can kind of

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.970 
little nudge like that you can kind of
flick<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.170> chopper<00:00:34.440> around<00:00:34.680> nicely<00:00:35.809> and<00:00:36.980> that

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
flick the chopper around nicely and that

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.290 
flick the chopper around nicely and that
gives<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> little<00:00:38.489> bit<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.610> ability<00:00:39.059> that

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
gives you a little bit of ability that

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.200 
gives you a little bit of ability that
you<00:00:39.329> don't<00:00:39.570> get<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.989> basic<00:00:40.770> controls

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.420 

level<00:00:45.210> for<00:00:45.890> turning<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.950> chopper<00:00:47.190> upside

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
level for turning the chopper upside

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.830 
level for turning the chopper upside
down<00:00:47.579> flying<00:00:47.879> through<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> fan<00:00:48.390> makes<00:00:48.750> you

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
down flying through the fan makes you

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.590 
down flying through the fan makes you
get<00:00:48.960> down<00:00:49.079> there<00:00:49.200> really<00:00:49.379> quick<00:00:53.390> this<00:00:54.390> one's

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
get down there really quick this one's

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.510 
get down there really quick this one's
again<00:00:55.199> pretty<00:00:55.379> easy<00:00:55.469> just<00:00:55.800> throw<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.399> little

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
again pretty easy just throw the little

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.110 
again pretty easy just throw the little
balls<00:00:56.789> into<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.090> hole<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.600> you're<00:00:58.170> out<00:01:02.120> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
balls into the hole and you're out the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.420 
balls into the hole and you're out the
trick<00:01:03.510> with<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:03.780> one<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.830> pick<00:01:05.129> up<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
trick with this one is to pick up the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.640 
trick with this one is to pick up the
weight<00:01:05.880> as<00:01:06.150> early<00:01:06.360> as<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.540> can<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.229> don't<00:01:07.500> move

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
weight as early as you can so don't move

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.780 
weight as early as you can so don't move
any<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.979> other<00:01:08.070> balls<00:01:08.280> out<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.490> way<00:01:08.610> just

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
any of the other balls out the way just

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.250 
any of the other balls out the way just
find<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.150> little<00:01:09.299> gap<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.689> middle<00:01:09.810> and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
find that little gap in the middle and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.469 
find that little gap in the middle and
pull<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.950> up<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.820> don't<00:01:11.970> need<00:01:12.060> all<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.210> many

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
pull it up you don't need all that many

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.730 
pull it up you don't need all that many
balls<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.810> go<00:01:12.900> down<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> hole<00:01:13.290> that's

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
balls to go down the hole that's

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.740 
balls to go down the hole that's
probably<00:01:14.010> enough<00:01:14.240> yeah<00:01:15.240> there<00:01:15.509> we<00:01:15.600> go

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
probably enough yeah there we go

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:25.219 
probably enough yeah there we go
and<00:01:16.170> we're<00:01:16.350> done<00:01:16.470> okay<00:01:23.659> this<00:01:24.659> one<00:01:24.810> takes<00:01:24.990> quite

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
and we're done okay this one takes quite

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.740 
and we're done okay this one takes quite
a<00:01:25.290> lot<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.560> luck<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.390> gotta<00:01:27.390> get<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.570> lot<00:01:27.689> of

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
a lot of luck and gotta get a lot of

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.539 
a lot of luck and gotta get a lot of
time<00:01:27.900> with<00:01:28.049> mentum<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.740> fluke<00:01:29.280> our<00:01:29.430> way

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
time with mentum and fluke our way

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.179 
time with mentum and fluke our way
through<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.880> bees<00:01:30.000> takes<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.689> few<00:01:30.810> goes<00:01:31.189> you

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
through the bees takes a few goes you

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.490 
through the bees takes a few goes you
can't<00:01:32.400> do<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.610> with<00:01:32.790> late<00:01:33.060> it's<00:01:33.900> quite<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> lot

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
can't do this with late it's quite a lot

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.990 
can't do this with late it's quite a lot
harder<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.860> get<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.070> fast<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.579> way<00:01:35.729> as<00:01:35.850> well

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
harder to get the fast that way as well

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.170 
harder to get the fast that way as well
though<00:01:36.920> again<00:01:37.920> upside<00:01:38.310> down<00:01:38.490> helps<00:01:38.939> us<00:01:39.000> fly

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
though again upside down helps us fly

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.179 
though again upside down helps us fly
down<00:01:39.360> as<00:01:39.509> quickly<00:01:39.840> made<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> nice<00:01:40.470> little<00:01:40.500> zip

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
down as quickly made a nice little zip

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.530 
down as quickly made a nice little zip
through<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.490> bees<00:01:41.780> job<00:01:42.780> done

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.520 

ok<00:01:48.540> everyone<00:01:48.750> complains<00:01:49.079> about<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.350> one

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
ok everyone complains about this one

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.620 
ok everyone complains about this one
it's<00:01:49.680> actually<00:01:49.770> quite<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.100> bit<00:01:50.310> easier<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:50.850> on

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
it's actually quite a bit easier on on

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.420 
it's actually quite a bit easier on on
the<00:01:51.930> difficult<00:01:52.259> controls<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:53.130> turn<00:01:53.340> the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
the difficult controls just turn the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.130 
the difficult controls just turn the
chopper<00:01:53.670> upside<00:01:53.909> down<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.329> fly<00:01:54.540> through<00:01:54.750> and

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
chopper upside down you fly through and

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.929 
chopper upside down you fly through and
as<00:01:55.979> long<00:01:56.100> as<00:01:56.189> you're<00:01:56.280> in<00:01:56.310> front<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.700> flag

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
as long as you're in front of the flag

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.030 
as long as you're in front of the flag
it<00:01:57.240> doesn't<00:01:57.479> matter<00:01:57.600> what<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.869> hit<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.829> still

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
it doesn't matter what you hit you still

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.100 
it doesn't matter what you hit you still
have<00:01:59.189> your<00:01:59.310> perfect

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.770 

this<00:02:04.110> one's<00:02:05.119> relatively<00:02:06.119> tricky<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:06.540> again<00:02:06.750> a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
this one's relatively tricky but again a

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.119 
this one's relatively tricky but again a
little<00:02:06.930> bit<00:02:07.049> easier<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.560> hard<00:02:07.740> controls

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
little bit easier on the hard controls

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.440 
little bit easier on the hard controls
so<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.369> get<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> bit<00:02:08.700> more<00:02:08.819> control<00:02:09.119> when

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
so you get a bit more control when

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.349 
so you get a bit more control when
you're<00:02:09.569> upside<00:02:09.810> down

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:14.359 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:16.670 

difficult<00:02:15.359> thing<00:02:15.540> here<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:15.959> remembering

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
difficult thing here is remembering

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.979 
difficult thing here is remembering
which<00:02:17.609> way<00:02:17.790> at<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:17.969> chopper<00:02:18.239> is<00:02:18.390> because<00:02:18.659> the

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
which way at the chopper is because the

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.319 
which way at the chopper is because the
the<00:02:19.560> controls<00:02:19.859> are<00:02:19.980> relative<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:21.239> the

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
the controls are relative to to the

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.869 
the controls are relative to to the
gravity<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.780> suppose<00:02:22.109> in<00:02:22.379> in<00:02:23.370> our<00:02:23.579> control

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
gravity I suppose in in our control

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.490 
gravity I suppose in in our control
shouldn't<00:02:24.689> really<00:02:24.780> hit<00:02:24.989> that<00:02:25.109> little<00:02:25.379> bit

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
shouldn't really hit that little bit

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.030 
shouldn't really hit that little bit
there<00:02:25.709> in<00:02:25.799> the<00:02:25.859> mind<00:02:27.439> that<00:02:28.439> could<00:02:28.650> easily<00:02:28.799> have

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
there in the mind that could easily have

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.229 
there in the mind that could easily have
rolled<00:02:29.220> off<00:02:29.400> or<00:02:29.579> hang<00:02:29.700> around<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:30.000> little<00:02:30.090> bit

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
rolled off or hang around a little bit

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.800 
rolled off or hang around a little bit
just<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.450> make<00:02:30.599> sure<00:02:30.629> it<00:02:30.870> rolls<00:02:31.079> into<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.409> hole

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
just to make sure it rolls into the hole

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:43.879 
just to make sure it rolls into the hole
and<00:02:33.810> straight<00:02:34.079> to<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.290> exit<00:02:42.379> okay<00:02:43.379> trick<00:02:43.769> you

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
and straight to the exit okay trick you

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:45.740 
and straight to the exit okay trick you
start<00:02:44.189> there<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.939> got<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.269> somehow<00:02:45.450> there<00:02:45.689> at

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
start there you got and somehow there at

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.179 
start there you got and somehow there at
that<00:02:45.840> first<00:02:46.109> button<00:02:46.439> if<00:02:46.560> you<00:02:46.650> want<00:02:46.769> to<00:02:46.829> go<00:02:46.920> fast

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
that first button if you want to go fast

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.490 
that first button if you want to go fast
you<00:02:47.579> also<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.269> have<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.569> hit<00:02:48.720> not<00:02:49.200> hit<00:02:49.379> the

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
you also you have to hit not hit the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.319 
you also you have to hit not hit the
walls<00:02:49.709> so<00:02:50.159> use<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.669> winch<00:02:50.879> and<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.090> little

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
walls so use the winch and a little

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.210 
walls so use the winch and a little
flick<00:02:51.569> to<00:02:52.230> flick<00:02:52.439> the<00:02:52.530> winch<00:02:52.680> over<00:02:52.859> that<00:02:53.099> way

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
flick to flick the winch over that way

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.990 
flick to flick the winch over that way
and<00:02:54.379> there<00:02:55.379> we<00:02:55.470> go<00:02:55.590> fast<00:02:55.919> and<00:02:56.069> perfect<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.879> can

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
and there we go fast and perfect you can

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.339 
and there we go fast and perfect you can
do<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.209> on<00:02:57.299> the<00:02:57.389> easier<00:02:57.629> controls<00:02:57.959> just<00:02:58.230> by

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
do that on the easier controls just by

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:59.539 
do that on the easier controls just by
flying<00:02:58.530> over<00:02:58.739> there<00:02:59.010> but<00:02:59.159> you<00:02:59.189> can<00:02:59.370> turn

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
flying over there but you can turn

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:00.649 
flying over there but you can turn
around<00:02:59.819> fast<00:03:00.030> enough<00:03:00.150> with<00:03:00.419> the<00:03:00.480> hard

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
around fast enough with the hard

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.599 
around fast enough with the hard
controls<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.139> do<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.620> keep<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.099> perfect<00:03:02.489> as

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
controls to do to keep the perfect as

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:08.929 
controls to do to keep the perfect as
well<00:03:06.650> now<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.709> nice<00:03:07.889> simple<00:03:08.250> level<00:03:08.459> you<00:03:08.549> fly

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 
well now the nice simple level you fly

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.940 
well now the nice simple level you fly
straight<00:03:09.000> across<00:03:09.359> the<00:03:09.629> exit<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.590> landings

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
straight across the exit the landings

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.330 
straight across the exit the landings
all<00:03:11.099> important<00:03:11.519> that<00:03:12.120> worked<00:03:12.480> pretty<00:03:12.629> good

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.129 

okay<00:03:17.340> that<00:03:17.489> flick<00:03:17.790> there's<00:03:18.090> pretty<00:03:18.659> important

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
okay that flick there's pretty important

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:20.930 
okay that flick there's pretty important
to<00:03:19.260> get<00:03:19.349> yourself<00:03:19.620> moving<00:03:19.739> across<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:20.430> to

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
to get yourself moving across and to

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.670 
to get yourself moving across and to
keep<00:03:21.090> your<00:03:21.269> height<00:03:21.479> as<00:03:21.690> well<00:03:21.720> it's<00:03:22.199> quite<00:03:22.650> a

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
keep your height as well it's quite a

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.710 
keep your height as well it's quite a
tricky<00:03:23.010> little<00:03:23.099> maneuver<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:23.849> this<00:03:24.329> level<00:03:24.629> is

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
tricky little maneuver and this level is

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.629 
tricky little maneuver and this level is
relatively<00:03:25.109> easy<00:03:25.379> on<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.859> on<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.519> easy

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
relatively easy on the on the easy

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.979 
relatively easy on the on the easy
controls<00:03:27.060> but<00:03:27.239> on<00:03:27.329> the<00:03:27.389> hard<00:03:27.510> controls

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
controls but on the hard controls

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.339 
controls but on the hard controls
getting<00:03:28.500> there<00:03:28.620> for<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:28.859> finish<00:03:29.129> is<00:03:29.400> tough<00:03:30.349> in

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
getting there for the finish is tough in

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.069 
getting there for the finish is tough in
the<00:03:31.620> appropriate<00:03:31.979> time<00:03:32.569> you<00:03:33.569> can<00:03:33.690> go<00:03:33.810> up<00:03:33.900> the

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
the appropriate time you can go up the

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.369 
the appropriate time you can go up the
the<00:03:34.440> shaft<00:03:34.709> if<00:03:34.919> you<00:03:35.370> wanted<00:03:35.609> to<00:03:35.669> go<00:03:35.729> easier

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
the shaft if you wanted to go easier

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.520 
the shaft if you wanted to go easier
okay<00:03:37.379> this<00:03:37.500> is<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.650> tricky<00:03:37.949> level<00:03:38.989> in<00:03:39.989> terms<00:03:40.260> of

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
okay this is a tricky level in terms of

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.159 
okay this is a tricky level in terms of
doing<00:03:41.489> it<00:03:41.669> fast<00:03:41.879> and<00:03:42.060> perfect<00:03:42.569> it's<00:03:42.840> easier<00:03:43.109> on

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
doing it fast and perfect it's easier on

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.449 
doing it fast and perfect it's easier on
the<00:03:43.379> easy<00:03:43.650> controls<00:03:44.069> but<00:03:44.940> with<00:03:45.060> hard<00:03:45.239> controls

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
the easy controls but with hard controls

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.569 
the easy controls but with hard controls
you<00:03:47.459> kind<00:03:47.879> of<00:03:47.940> need<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.919> get<00:03:49.919> that<00:03:50.099> magnet<00:03:50.459> down

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
you kind of need to get that magnet down

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:51.979 
you kind of need to get that magnet down
as<00:03:50.729> fast<00:03:50.940> as<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.180> can<00:03:51.389> that<00:03:51.569> usually<00:03:51.720> means

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
as fast as you can that usually means

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.259 
as fast as you can that usually means
crashing<00:03:53.629> so<00:03:54.629> there<00:03:54.780> we<00:03:54.870> go<00:03:54.900> fast<00:03:55.970> next<00:03:56.970> ups

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
crashing so there we go fast next ups

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.690 
crashing so there we go fast next ups
the<00:03:57.389> perfect

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.880 

okay<00:04:02.599> so<00:04:02.660> it's<00:04:02.900> perfect<00:04:03.349> we<00:04:03.500> have<00:04:03.590> to<00:04:03.650> spend<00:04:03.830> a

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
okay so it's perfect we have to spend a

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.350 
okay so it's perfect we have to spend a
little<00:04:03.950> bit<00:04:04.099> of<00:04:04.250> time<00:04:04.430> teasing<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.970> magnetic

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
little bit of time teasing the magnetic

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.210 
little bit of time teasing the magnetic
Ross<00:04:05.540> I<00:04:05.860> was<00:04:06.860> close<00:04:08.410> we<00:04:09.410> can<00:04:09.530> use<00:04:09.890> the<00:04:10.040> little

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
Ross I was close we can use the little

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.339 
Ross I was close we can use the little
flick<00:04:10.459> of<00:04:10.610> the<00:04:10.640> tail<00:04:11.090> rotor<00:04:11.480> to<00:04:11.810> to<00:04:12.080> flick<00:04:12.230> it

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
flick of the tail rotor to to flick it

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.009 
flick of the tail rotor to to flick it
across<00:04:12.530> a<00:04:12.590> little<00:04:12.830> bit<00:04:13.540> yeah<00:04:14.540> that's<00:04:15.050> the<00:04:15.200> one

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
across a little bit yeah that's the one

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.780 
across a little bit yeah that's the one
and<00:04:18.019> we've<00:04:18.139> got<00:04:18.230> a<00:04:18.260> hover<00:04:18.500> very<00:04:18.980> precisely<00:04:19.519> up

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
and we've got a hover very precisely up

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.810 
and we've got a hover very precisely up
here<00:04:19.970> not<00:04:20.870> touching<00:04:21.200> the<00:04:21.290> ground<00:04:21.700> and<00:04:22.700> not

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
here not touching the ground and not

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.730 
here not touching the ground and not
flying<00:04:23.120> so<00:04:23.360> high<00:04:23.389> that<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:23.990> magnet<00:04:24.470> jerks

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
flying so high that the magnet jerks

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.640 
flying so high that the magnet jerks
away<00:04:25.040> and<00:04:25.250> drops<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.760> other<00:04:25.790> magnet<00:04:26.470> this<00:04:27.470> is

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
away and drops the other magnet this is

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:35.890 
away and drops the other magnet this is
a<00:04:27.710> fairly<00:04:28.040> precise<00:04:28.340> piece<00:04:28.520> of<00:04:28.700> flying<00:04:34.900> there

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
a fairly precise piece of flying there

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.140 
a fairly precise piece of flying there
we<00:04:36.020> go<00:04:36.250> there's<00:04:37.250> a<00:04:37.310> nice<00:04:37.460> little<00:04:37.610> glitch<00:04:37.940> on

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
we go there's a nice little glitch on

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.330 
we go there's a nice little glitch on
this<00:04:38.270> level<00:04:38.570> which<00:04:39.500> lets<00:04:39.680> you<00:04:39.800> get<00:04:39.919> fast<00:04:40.190> and

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
this level which lets you get fast and

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.780 
this level which lets you get fast and
perfect<00:04:41.710> if<00:04:42.710> you<00:04:42.860> spin<00:04:43.130> fast<00:04:43.400> enough<00:04:43.669> and

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
perfect if you spin fast enough and

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.879 
perfect if you spin fast enough and
flick<00:04:44.270> the<00:04:44.450> wind<00:04:44.780> fast<00:04:45.110> enough<00:04:45.380> you<00:04:45.770> can

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
flick the wind fast enough you can

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.050 
flick the wind fast enough you can
actually<00:04:46.010> flick<00:04:46.340> it<00:04:46.460> right<00:04:46.639> the<00:04:46.700> way<00:04:46.760> through

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
actually flick it right the way through

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.370 
actually flick it right the way through
there<00:04:47.419> to<00:04:47.540> the<00:04:47.600> level<00:04:47.870> you<00:04:47.990> can<00:04:48.110> press<00:04:48.260> the

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
there to the level you can press the

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.550 
there to the level you can press the
button<00:04:48.560> with<00:04:48.650> it<00:04:48.800> so<00:04:49.600> simple<00:04:50.600> as<00:04:50.690> that<00:04:50.810> after

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
button with it so simple as that after

00:04:51.560 --> 00:05:01.409 
button with it so simple as that after
the<00:04:51.650> exit

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.510 

have<00:05:02.419> a<00:05:02.479> sheep<00:05:02.660> everyone<00:05:03.050> that's<00:05:03.199> the<00:05:03.349> Sheep

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.649 

relatively<00:05:07.520> simple<00:05:07.849> levels<00:05:08.150> just<00:05:08.360> a<00:05:08.479> case<00:05:08.629> of

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:08.659 
relatively simple levels just a case of

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:11.110 
relatively simple levels just a case of
flying<00:05:09.289> accurately<00:05:09.740> learning<00:05:10.699> how<00:05:10.819> you<00:05:10.879> pick

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
flying accurately learning how you pick

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.760 
flying accurately learning how you pick
chief<00:05:11.330> up<00:05:11.509> with<00:05:11.659> the<00:05:11.780> winch<00:05:11.930> like<00:05:12.199> that<00:05:12.379> the

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
chief up with the winch like that the

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.710 
chief up with the winch like that the
winch<00:05:13.129> always<00:05:13.400> unfurls<00:05:13.759> in<00:05:13.909> a<00:05:13.970> certain<00:05:14.270> sort

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
winch always unfurls in a certain sort

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.390 
winch always unfurls in a certain sort
of<00:05:14.810> kind<00:05:15.740> of<00:05:15.830> way<00:05:15.979> if<00:05:16.099> you're<00:05:16.220> falling

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
of kind of way if you're falling

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.210 
of kind of way if you're falling
backwards<00:05:16.909> and<00:05:17.530> if<00:05:18.530> you<00:05:18.650> get<00:05:18.770> the<00:05:18.860> timings

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
backwards and if you get the timings

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.860 
backwards and if you get the timings
just<00:05:19.280> right<00:05:19.610> you<00:05:20.120> can<00:05:20.150> kind<00:05:20.539> of<00:05:20.599> flick<00:05:20.750> it<00:05:20.840> down

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
just right you can kind of flick it down

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.360 
just right you can kind of flick it down
so<00:05:21.169> it<00:05:21.229> hits<00:05:21.379> the<00:05:21.470> Sheep<00:05:21.680> just<00:05:21.949> right<00:05:22.159> just

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
so it hits the Sheep just right just

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.339 
so it hits the Sheep just right just
practice<00:05:23.300> thing<00:05:23.479> really<00:05:26.020> flicked<00:05:27.020> him<00:05:27.199> rather

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349 
practice thing really flicked him rather

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:28.659 
practice thing really flicked him rather
hard<00:05:27.620> than<00:05:27.830> just<00:05:28.039> hanging<00:05:28.159> around<00:05:28.310> just<00:05:28.610> to

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
hard than just hanging around just to

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.219 
hard than just hanging around just to
make<00:05:28.699> sure<00:05:28.819> he<00:05:28.970> doesn't<00:05:29.120> bounce<00:05:29.330> right<00:05:29.569> back<00:05:29.629> I

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
make sure he doesn't bounce right back I

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:31.809 
make sure he doesn't bounce right back I
have<00:05:30.800> to<00:05:30.860> play<00:05:31.009> a<00:05:31.039> bit<00:05:31.190> of<00:05:31.220> Apple<00:05:31.520> and<00:05:31.610> footy

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:31.819 
have to play a bit of Apple and footy

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:33.760 
have to play a bit of Apple and footy
with<00:05:31.940> him<00:05:32.180> but<00:05:33.050> he<00:05:33.229> fell<00:05:33.440> into<00:05:33.560> the<00:05:33.650> hole

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
with him but he fell into the hole

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:43.029 
with him but he fell into the hole
nicely<00:05:41.470> sometimes<00:05:42.470> you<00:05:42.560> can<00:05:42.680> flick<00:05:42.860> these

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
nicely sometimes you can flick these

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:44.950 
nicely sometimes you can flick these
sheep<00:05:43.520> rather<00:05:44.180> further<00:05:44.479> you<00:05:44.720> can<00:05:44.810> do

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
sheep rather further you can do

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.809 
sheep rather further you can do
backflips<00:05:45.770> off<00:05:45.949> the<00:05:46.039> chopper<00:05:46.250> to<00:05:46.460> flick<00:05:46.639> them

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:46.819 
backflips off the chopper to flick them

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:49.029 
backflips off the chopper to flick them
and<00:05:47.599> he<00:05:47.810> needed<00:05:47.990> a<00:05:48.139> cover<00:05:48.289> little<00:05:48.560> nudges<00:05:48.889> on

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 
and he needed a cover little nudges on

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:50.550 
and he needed a cover little nudges on
the<00:05:49.159> ground<00:05:49.370> just<00:05:49.520> to<00:05:49.580> make<00:05:49.729> sure<00:05:49.759> he's<00:05:50.030> there

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
the ground just to make sure he's there

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.200 
the ground just to make sure he's there
but<00:05:51.560> the<00:05:51.710> time<00:05:51.919> limits<00:05:52.159> very<00:05:52.370> easy<00:05:52.580> fast<00:05:53.060> and

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
but the time limits very easy fast and

00:05:53.210 --> 00:06:03.810 
but the time limits very easy fast and
perfect

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.910 

okay<00:06:04.480> the<00:06:04.600> first<00:06:04.780> the<00:06:04.960> tower<00:06:05.140> levels<00:06:05.470> dead

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:05.920 
okay the first the tower levels dead

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.800 
okay the first the tower levels dead
easy<00:06:06.100> you<00:06:06.280> just<00:06:06.340> pulled<00:06:06.640> tower<00:06:06.910> over<00:06:07.270> fly<00:06:07.540> over

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
easy you just pulled tower over fly over

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:15.560 
easy you just pulled tower over fly over
it<00:06:07.930> and<00:06:08.530> at<00:06:08.680> the<00:06:08.740> exit<00:06:09.210> no<00:06:10.210> trouble<00:06:10.570> at<00:06:10.630> all

this<00:06:16.570> level<00:06:16.900> is<00:06:16.960> just<00:06:16.990> the<00:06:17.230> slog<00:06:17.530> has<00:06:17.830> just

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.040 
this level is just the slog has just

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.620 
this level is just the slog has just
case<00:06:18.220> of<00:06:18.400> pick<00:06:18.760> up<00:06:18.850> all<00:06:19.030> the<00:06:19.120> people<00:06:19.270> taking

all<00:06:19.840> to<00:06:19.930> the<00:06:20.020> exit<00:06:21.390> you<00:06:22.390> gotta<00:06:22.510> be<00:06:22.600> a<00:06:22.660> little

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
all to the exit you gotta be a little

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.360 
all to the exit you gotta be a little
bit<00:06:22.900> careful<00:06:23.020> when<00:06:23.230> you<00:06:23.320> drop<00:06:23.530> on<00:06:23.650> them<00:06:23.800> that

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
bit careful when you drop on them that

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.550 
bit careful when you drop on them that
went<00:06:24.550> rather<00:06:24.670> well

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.440 

this<00:06:29.560> guy<00:06:29.770> looks<00:06:30.520> those<00:06:30.730> great<00:06:30.970> go<00:06:31.120> spinning

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.450 
this guy looks those great go spinning

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.150 
this guy looks those great go spinning
so<00:06:31.840> it's<00:06:32.290> not<00:06:32.410> a<00:06:32.440> bad<00:06:32.590> idea<00:06:32.710> to<00:06:32.920> give<00:06:33.040> them<00:06:33.130> a

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
so it's not a bad idea to give them a
