weakest<00:00:43.710> center<00:00:43.950> back<00:00:44.100> at<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.610> moment<00:00:44.940> not

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
weakest center back at the moment not

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.400

counting<00:00:46.320> my<00:00:46.559> cooking<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:48.020> black<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.260> think

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
counting my cooking so black and I think

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.810 
counting my cooking so black and I think
he's<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:49.770> Blackett<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.430> better<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.700> think

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
he's but Blackett is better I think

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.340 
he's but Blackett is better I think
Jonny<00:00:51.300> Evans<00:00:51.480> was<00:00:51.660> better<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.320> think

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
Jonny Evans was better and I think

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.750 
Jonny Evans was better and I think
though<00:00:52.649> Jones<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.039> definitely<00:00:53.520> better<00:00:53.610> than

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
though Jones is definitely better than

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.310 
though Jones is definitely better than
