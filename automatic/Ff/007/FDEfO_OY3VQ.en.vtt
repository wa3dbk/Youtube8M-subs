00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.250
 d 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.760
 very good 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.760
 today he plays 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.730
 I keep preparing this little tree for the 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.830
 sleeve 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.240
 then although the triangular and the 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.590
 triangular long gone that is very 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.690
 well right now and this branch is very 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.320
 a little branched a branch very very very 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.320
 basic 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.940
 the dry lace this branch comes out a lot 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.020
 of the triangular and that then I'll 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.379
 put a wire 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.379
 just a wand to take it to your site 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:54.190
 if you break them the singularity a 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:56.769
 so blatant way without paying for it 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.199
 so I'm going to anchor the connection here 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.860
 back behind the trunk so you do not 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.860
 crosses ahead 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.550
 the wire crossed there 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.150
 I'll try 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.500
 on tender shoulders 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.690
 I have to enter a dream of the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.050
 way 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.050
 to 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.510
 but well, only one 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.510
 and now this branch 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.310
 super delicate not 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.310
 but no no 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:46.080
 there it is here is this is named 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:50.110
 here in this branch is only part of the 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.760
 branch connection and now 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.770
 what we will do with care 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.790
 Well, be very careful not to break it 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.460
 young shoots because the branch is a 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.680
 very young branch very thin and very 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.260
 flexible and it's not going to break and then 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.979
 what we do with these branches is to bend 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:14.020
 we're going to like a very malleable branch 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:17.110
 let's look at it so that it occupies a 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.709
 space inside the triangular and that 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.390
 imaginary that this tree has if you see 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.510
 right now the front of each visitor 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.090
 to see a little here the girl always in 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.180
 you see half is now perfectly 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.250
 inside the triangular and dad tree 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.530
 and here has not needed to be 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.140
 nothing simply put a wire and give 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.250
 a little bit the branch and it's already we have 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.490
 our tree 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.070
 corrected a small bug fixed not 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.950
 it is necessary to cut of grafting neither 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.640
 history rolls in several branches of it 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.640
 point 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.430
 and this brought dry 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.239
 were 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.239
 beautiful 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.590
 Well, that's how it's going to stay 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:14.099
 tree to see if it branches more from here to 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.489
 sleeves is a hug and until next time 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.489
 video
