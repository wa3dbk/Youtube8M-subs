00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.850
 came at handbags in a vicious 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.410
 as promised here asos 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.470
 cube army by android nexteer at asus 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.050
 and that is a google tv dice quasi 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.150
 So google tv now synonymous with asos 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.220
 based on google tv 3.0 is so 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.570
 officially that means you see on the 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.679
 big screen up here we have that 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.060
 TV channel which I now have in 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.040
 split screen packed i can do that too 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.050
 once again, bring up the big picture 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.450
 Watch TV as normal as usual and 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.130
 then just a google tv 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.780
 The surface is a bit like this 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.370
 homescreen would be adapted by asus 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.950
 was with such a dice there you can 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.270
 here through the different categories 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.430
 scrolling through it then sees it 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.630
 but as of bible tv I dÃ¼lmen 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:56.120
 go here for a short time where to look 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.730
 here on an on a standard app 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.790
 drawer can go 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.680
 left just as here in the apps apps so there 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.170
 You see, that's the standard apps 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.159
 which one knows from google tv gives here 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.570
 different users have too 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.250
 connection to the place gate that is yes 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.060
 actually relatively important try times 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.060
 there to navigate 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.450
 the navigation is something for me now 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.469
 getting used to but now have 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.179
 seen the place you have yes we have 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.840
 It tried that works on 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:22.880
 every case 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.530
 I can also switch on mouse mode 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.780
 maybe something will work for that 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.240
 easier we'll see so now I 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.380
 I'm simulating a mouse here 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.210
 I'll show you the same on the 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.200
 Remote control over such a 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.789
 use touchscreen and then I can 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.920
 just with the mouse here I go through 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.299
 can of course also the language search 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.780
 make sure there is a language 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.939
 button 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.429
 november from now I'll give you time to 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.289
 on the remote then should be here 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.109
 The joke of the tongue rises and I say 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.429
 now time teller therefore received the 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:55.130
 she does not have to finish box yet 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.479
 I say that should all in march in 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.310
 he should come to the first markets 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.899
 be relatively cheap around the $ 150 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.020
 you are aiming in the usa 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:17.290
 So nbc 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:19.000
 again nbc and then he is looking for me nbc 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.800
 and then list all sorts of things here 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.930
 results so then there is one 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.680
 there is the channel there is the 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.750
 website 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.550
 it gives the google results and it 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.710
 gives msi on youtube so there I have 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.940
 with the language then everything from one 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.960
 hand, let's have a look now 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.280
 the remote control to that is namely 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.170
 also relatively exciting 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.459
 So we have something like that here in front of you 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.959
 more or less classic tv 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.360
 Remote here with the typical 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.610
 google logo on it and the whole can 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.400
 as well as touchscreen as well as 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.110
 would have here with vip function as if 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.280
 Switches are used and important 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.740
 at google tv of course on the 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.700
 back a full querty in 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.230
 In this case keypad there is one 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.430
 normal google experience nothing more in the 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.600
 away we are now looking forward once were 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.430
 that's what comes to germany 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.380
 costs as I said from March then in 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.870
 intended for international markets 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.760
 $ 150 which will cost a bit in itself 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.260
 very exciting device and nice that it 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.330
 Now also in google tv power sets 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.070
 This is a beautiful TV system 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.989
 hopefully through one of 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.989
 android next till later bye 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.459
 a 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.250
 this fair 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.230
 more 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.230
 xd
