00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.170
 Hello, I have many times 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.030
 used that generator on command 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.020
 blocks but in detail at this point not 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.150
 stayed 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.550
 so today i want to fix it and 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.090
 I want to immediately warn all these schemes are not 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.400
 my 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.710
 the author is not I atrophy unfortunately I do not know 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.410
 so I don't call them so let's 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.150
 let's start here we have the first scheme 1 cola 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.009
 command block generator 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.169
 circuits this is quite famous and it is 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.970
 perhaps the fastest and most stable 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.070
 plug-in rotar on command blocks 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.570
 it is very easy to install 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.000
 two command blocks small 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.590
 the gap between them is further defined 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.450
 in what order are these command blocks 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.490
 will work with simultaneous 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.830
 activation by the way they can be located 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.120
 both horizontally and vertically 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.610
 here is a family lower command unit 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.500
 trigger the upper second one 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.850
 following in the lower command block then 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.860
 there is the command unit that we have 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.440
 works first install team 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.390
 set block which puts the air block then 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.310
 there is a dummy between 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.680
 command blocks in the second command 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.840
 block command it seems only she will 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.210
 put a redstone block in this gap 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.310
 how this scheme works for activation 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.469
 generator coke between command blocks 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.390
 we set slavery block after 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:16.520
 this cola generator is already running 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.229
 it happens in the following way game 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.990
 the process is divided into separate 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.149
 measures in each measure of the game, both teams 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.859
 block we get a simultaneous signal 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.719
 first the command is executed at the bottom 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:28.579
 command block in this case it 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.710
 the bottom one is the first command block and 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.520
 this command removes the grow block 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.439
 here at the top 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.119
 Whom do we have a team for 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.310
 the second command block which 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.499
 returns the ration block to this place 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.270
 signaling both teams again 

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:43.429
 blocks on the next clock given 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.619
 the situation will repeat that is every beat 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.869
 games the signal that is published by this 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.369
 upset by the unit will be updated to 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.709
 turn off this clone generator 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.009
 it is enough to give a signal for 2 command 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:53.659
 block 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.759
 this scheme has two obvious 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.619
 lack of the first we can not change 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.079
 the speed of this scheme it will always be 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.060
 equal one measure and second for her 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.799
 work need to use team 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.959
 the blocks that will receive the signal 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.819
 directly from our redstone unit 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.479
 no other way too fast 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.700
 update 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.040
 let's move on to the following diagram and this 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.050
 modification of standard clodiro 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.090
 tarot made on the basis of two harper 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.750
 vkola hopper generators work 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.100
 heaps 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.230
 wreck we have two hoppers 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.060
 aimed each other in them is located 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.800
 item that moves and when 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.900
 getting into the corresponding hopper he 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.910
 gives the signal a varnish of steam then this circuit 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.770
 slow and now let's see 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.390
 include as you can see here topics 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.820
 it is slow and here much 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.950
 faster in this scheme added 2 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.900
 command blocks which through 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.000
 additional comparator through blocks 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.190
 to work on one command 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.140
 block signal is transmitted when here 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.180
 hits the subject the signal hits then 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.950
 the comparator is passed to the command block 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.690
 and there we have a team that changes 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.880
 data corresponding block and 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.370
 sets red cooldown to zero then 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.350
 have for the appropriate cooper with us 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.180
 there will be a delay to the recipes set to 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.190
 zero that will allow the subject immediately 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.560
 heading to the opposite hooper it 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.700
 accelerates the work of this mechanism 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.739
 application of this chlorine generator 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.600
 certainly controversial however very much here 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.459
 interesting approach used can 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.530
 used not only when creating 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.690
 clone generators so I decided too 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.430
 consider it well and finally the third 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.890
 Klava generator, he is also enough 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.230
 the famous one has already used it and 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.709
 so login rotar based on the falling 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.570
 sand 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.340
 we only need one command block 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.280
 in which we enter the following command 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.220
 calling the falling sand one block higher 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.739
 our command block tile id 152 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.470
 this roadstone is stupid and we are moving 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.180
 y only vertical displacement 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.430
 it should be positive ie we 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.530
 call the essence of the form of falling times 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.630
 town block over our command block and 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.940
 send it up let's check 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.489
 how does this thing work let's say we run 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.370
 corner so forgive here so of course and 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.350
 starts jumping block redstone each 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.360
 the time it lands triggers 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.459
 signal and at the output of the circuit we have 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.709
 signal how this circuit works well 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.600
 let me stop him and see 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.000
 initially when we set the moan 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.950
 block he activates our command block 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.959
 place of the installed stone block 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.670
 a falling entity appears which 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.620
 goes up with a certain 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.510
 speed by the way speed can be changed 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.790
 let's say we can speed up our flesh 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.620
 generator here in this way as a fact 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.450
 he began to work faster that is here 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.400
 there is a variable speed and this one 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.560
 feed block it starts to bounce 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.690
 that moment when he lands he 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.910
 turns into a regular redstone block and 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.190
 energizes our command block again 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.990
 have the whole process repeated in a circle 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.880
 unlike previous ones of course huge 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.190
 the dignity of this clock of niro taro 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.500
 the fact that you can change the speed of work and 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.570
 generally it works quite accurately 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.400
 however, it has disadvantages for 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.260
 stable operation depending on 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.540
 the periods that you choose ie 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.160
 depending on the height of which is jumping 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.350
 block need big enough 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.210
 space above our command block 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.010
 Well, the second to reliably stop 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.110
 we will need this clone generator 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.450
 two additional command blocks at once 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.490
 1 command block using the kill command 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.560
 must kill the required amount 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.420
 the essence of the falling sand that is our 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.080
 this bouncing block should be 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.970
 destroyed 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.130
 well, and the second command block just 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.020
 case over our main command 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.310
 block sets the block to rest then 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.680
 there is if by some miracle 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.690
 we will have a team to stop 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.730
 came at the moment to the block landed and 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.650
 not in the form of serving entities but in the form of 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.770
 stable block it also need 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.020
 destroy well something like this such three 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.120
 different lo generator hope so how are they 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.160
 work has become for you a little clearer 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.320
 and on this for today all thank you very much 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.870
