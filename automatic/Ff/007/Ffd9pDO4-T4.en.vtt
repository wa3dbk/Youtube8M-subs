00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.870
 stop me I think so and the mile with 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.350
 a plant aed a fir tree with plenty of 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.950
 plants 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.690
 here there are plenty of droids on sand 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:15.480
 a little plant there is a little bit of land 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.340
 so here is the sand no here there is 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.930
 android that took a thousand years coming 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.020
 from here so enjoyed yet no style of 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.730
 marc is a little water an explosion 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.120
 rather actually here a fir tree with 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.330
 plants 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.770
 so here I am going to try to go pretty 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.860
 I have a lot of batteries 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.960
 so here an explosion like this with a 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.880
 art that is dead so the fir solves 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.140
 so here in fez has made a long date 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.240
 air with tall trees 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.870
 so here we start with this long 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.050
 papaya fight allows a movie will only be 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:56.310
 still so after gad of clown here from the 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:02:00.840
 company gold with shields so here 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:04.050
 after here there is an art with sniper 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.099
 with a small a little beep there is we 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:11.820
 have done well here at an ebook 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.360
 Here swinging spears so here 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.050
 a year 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:20.490
 hole in the crate if a tree does that 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.910
 like that hop I do not know if it's here he 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:28.020
 there is a tree trunk and a kind of wall 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:31.340
 on the pattern a made with wood appreciated to 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:35.880
 a pretty good art i'm going to show you 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.610
 like that hop and try a little one that a 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.420
 wind who so there is the leader of words that 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:48.270
 with a stick and the head of a droid a 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:54.390
 little drum here so like that you have 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:57.420
 well done wait for a campfire 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.010
 yoda and a lance what there is a 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.280
 clown running to try to protect 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.540
 yoga so lyall the vegetation a little 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:10.410
 everywhere so here is the tree and if we see 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.820
 and the little canvas way I like the 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.820
 foot when I find myself pretty well done 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:24.030
 so we'll start here 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.220
 if there are such plants here here a 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.590
 small detail 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:33.720
 that's it with a cable that goes up to 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.840
 windows here I remember how it 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.160
 go on and the droids do not pull that 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.769
 in the modules race so I 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.830
 had iron that will see the generator if he 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.950
 was not affected so the generator that 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:50.220
 is like that so with that it raises there 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.010
 on the energy the base is full of 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.340
 little things related to his 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.810
 rear seat formed between pedestrians and 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.690
 hop 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.480
 so here we are thinking so I think 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.900
 It's okay 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.420
 ok there is a sliding door so I 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.049
 there are windows so the appearance 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.720
 to see very simple hop 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.030
 so there is just a small detail then 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:23.130
 like that 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:31.630
 so here's the piping sees 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:36.160
 here at the commander kerry who shows to 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.960
 his troops to a few sergeant the field 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.870
 battle 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.389
 so yes it will have to hit everything so 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.310
 the 28th that passes you there are the buttons 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.840
 here to activate lorient little tricks 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.960
 like that 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.570
 media library is expensive the gift that it is 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.930
 the sergeant of bins attack 2013 and there 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:59.919
 it's a bit that I created here that the 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:02.729
 mine so there is an art running for 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:06.910
 go to the battlefield 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:08.289
 here two missiles of optimizing purposes 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.320
 the big ones so it was a long time 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:15.340
 that I did not put that would have so 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.849
 as I already told you I had 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.889
 everything here covered with flu has that this 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:24.039
 either to but of which I did not put a 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:27.990
 do the closets closed nor you so here 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.990
 a clown taking his blaster 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:37.300
 good here is this there is a locker with 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:40.870
 bombs in the blaster bin a 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.680
 little detail another little detail a 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.419
 sniper a shield 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.690
 so if a guy who puts on without a helmet and 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.710
 who will not touch talent and help the 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.590
 commander grimm 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:56.860
 I know too much so by the room 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:59.620
 computer with here a pipe that goes up 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:03.099
 this computer in a small mouth bottles 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:06.160
 aeration so and the window we see a 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:09.599
 other computer with the cable that arrives a 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.540
 pipe that will be in a crate and some 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:13.970
 computer with gunnar 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.570
 so follows the series if there is a small 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:20.000
 hologram or so I think I have 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.170
 completed for this base I was presenting 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.390
 pretty quickly since I have more 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.500
 a lot of battery there I go when 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.090
 even show you some facts 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.310
 quickly 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:30.440
 So here it is for my 300 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.740

 I hope to reach the 350 before but a 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.310
 year but I think it'll be hard 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.980
 I think it's a year or two 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.260
 month but a year on youtube so I 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.880

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.940
 I'll do it later so that's it 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.220
