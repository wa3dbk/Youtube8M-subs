00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:07.540
 that is possible with the starting blocks to come this just after a breeze a church the 

00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:09.269
 code off the newspaper 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.269
 a the stump needed a tiebreak 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.789
 I do that too much for the world 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.300
 that is possible in Kerkrade 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.300
 but today 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:25.749
 what that does what 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.579
 others 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.579
 but if it's up 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.780
 I never actually have the peak 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.770
 this matters 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.920
 it's true what led to the find being conquered 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.960
 what i especially like 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.910
 this property 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.910
 animal park 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.390
 and that is also something finished 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.390
 just before that, a police officer who performs tasks from that full is full 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.970
 4 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.950
 I will continue 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.740
 5 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.740
 5 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.590
 anp 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.150
 also the parker production volume beh 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.150
 the police were super it had worse 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.740
 ap ap ap 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.740
 the paper newspaper 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.960
 about 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.439
 the church 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:11.439
 hackers 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:17.570
 sellers has it with 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.980
 the emergency points 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.010
 Of course I hope that is not up 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.279
 that is according to the latest statistics 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:27.340
 Here again, the board chosen by the public is more expensive, side by side 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.869
 although 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:35.869
 a keyboard 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:39.119
 Thomas Mars has 

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:40.309
 who knows 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:44.499
 I have a lot of strength for the seller, it is of course that too 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:50.689
 this by bart the farmer's work is placed the plus 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.980
 Also the PVV naturally think so 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:57.839

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:00.849
 too bad I just didn't reach you 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.309
 I succeeded in waiting 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:05.069
 on-board 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.949
 but also live there 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:09.709
 the public in these places too 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.279
 what a misery 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:13.919
 9 especially 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.859
 especially as for a quarter for ten million euros 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.049
 at all places where he like 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.399

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:22.539

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.759
 percent of staff 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:40.209
 yes it is true 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.319
 on the latest sports news 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.319
 both teams made good lead there 

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:52.289
 they were that a craftsman soon declared the man during 

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:53.359
 interrogation 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.099
 the protests were 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.979
 then we have it 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.039

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:04.399
