 it's been good alright to forgive 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.930

 played in the national voice as we have 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.410
 serious now let's talk about how many millions 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.330
 he has paid activision to sabotage the 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.780
 battlefield project 4 from within 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.550

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.009
 who have also told us that he has 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.259
 seized the moment of the dubbing of 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.360
 battlefield 4 to record some of your 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.369
 favorite songs of childhood and 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.310
 the odd mythical movie scene 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.869
 If you like, let's see if it is 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.060
 true and also I think it was pretty 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.060

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.960

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.360
 it was something 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.140

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.190
 the straw 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.880

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.840
 will never 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.420
 because with 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.769
 I believe that the voice is a form a 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.080
 instrument that we have to work 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.780
 the interpreters that also only improves 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.349
 with age a secret agent will coordinate 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.349
 the operation 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.030

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.580

 the last song and everything you 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:40.810
