want that curve into it so you have to

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.960 
want that curve into it so you have to
do<00:03:12.840> that<00:03:13.080> fixing<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:14.070> tweaking<00:03:14.520> to<00:03:14.670> make<00:03:14.820> it

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
do that fixing the tweaking to make it

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.500 
do that fixing the tweaking to make it
thinner<00:03:15.360> thinner<00:03:16.050> for<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.440> eyebrow<00:03:17.390> you<00:03:18.390> can

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
thinner thinner for the eyebrow you can

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.530 
thinner thinner for the eyebrow you can
actually<00:03:18.840> make<00:03:19.080> anything<00:03:19.680> thinner<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:20.700> just

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
actually make anything thinner I just

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.900 
actually make anything thinner I just
chose<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:22.050> swoop<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:23.220> if<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:23.519> guys<00:03:23.610> want<00:03:23.850> to

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
chose the swoop so if you guys want to

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.110 
chose the swoop so if you guys want to
use<00:03:24.030> something<00:03:24.060> else<00:03:24.390> go<00:03:24.840> for<00:03:25.140> it<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:26.850> world

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
use something else go for it the world

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.500 
use something else go for it the world
of<00:03:27.380> possibilities<00:03:28.380> is<00:03:28.739> endless<00:03:29.370> in<00:03:29.700> this<00:03:29.910> in

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
of possibilities is endless in this in

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.900 
of possibilities is endless in this in
these<00:03:30.950> emblem<00:03:31.950> making<00:03:33.500> what's<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:34.709> I<00:03:34.980> icons

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
these emblem making what's it I icons

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.750 
these emblem making what's it I icons
items<00:03:36.570> and<00:03:36.840> long<00:03:37.470> pieces<00:03:37.739> whatever<00:03:38.430> you<00:03:38.610> want

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
items and long pieces whatever you want

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.820 
items and long pieces whatever you want
to<00:03:38.820> call<00:03:38.940> them<00:03:39.000> so<00:03:39.540> let's<00:03:39.810> let's<00:03:40.080> go<00:03:40.290> on<00:03:40.470> go<00:03:40.800> on

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
to call them so let's let's go on go on

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.100 
to call them so let's let's go on go on
so<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.640> same<00:03:41.820> pieces<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.450> use<00:03:42.720> for<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.080> eye

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
so the same pieces you use for the eye

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.660 
so the same pieces you use for the eye
so<00:03:43.620> it's<00:03:43.920> just<00:03:44.489> like<00:03:44.720> flipped<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:46.310> then<00:03:47.310> we<00:03:47.459> go

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
so it's just like flipped and then we go

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.500 
so it's just like flipped and then we go
on<00:03:47.959> 10<00:03:48.959> a<00:03:49.950> I<00:03:50.160> made<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.400> circle<00:03:50.850> you<00:03:51.120> want<00:03:51.299> to<00:03:51.360> make

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
on 10 a I made a circle you want to make

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.630 
on 10 a I made a circle you want to make
this<00:03:51.720> circle<00:03:52.170> inverted<00:03:52.950> so<00:03:53.130> it<00:03:53.250> just<00:03:53.430> hasn't

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
this circle inverted so it just hasn't

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.150 
this circle inverted so it just hasn't
not<00:03:54.180> what's<00:03:54.900> it<00:03:55.019> called<00:03:55.200> let's<00:03:55.560> go<00:03:55.769> on<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.040> it

not what's it called let's go on to it

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.400 
not what's it called let's go on to it
