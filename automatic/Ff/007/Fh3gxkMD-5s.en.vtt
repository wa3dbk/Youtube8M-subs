00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
stigma think that's what's called a

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.580 
stigma think that's what's called a
glass<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.820> stigma<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.930> reason<00:00:37.260> why<00:00:37.530> I'm

replanting<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.670> tech<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.149> because<00:00:39.510> I

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
replanting this tech is because I

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.130 
replanting this tech is because I
recently<00:00:40.590> went<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.160> Vietnam<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.570> came<00:00:42.870> home

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
recently went to Vietnam and I came home

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.910 
recently went to Vietnam and I came home
to<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> plant<00:00:43.980> built<00:00:44.870> field<00:00:45.870> truck<00:00:46.469> filled<00:00:46.800> with

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
to a plant built field truck filled with

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.029 
to a plant built field truck filled with
algae<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.670> all<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.940> stuff<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:49.440> couldn't

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
algae and all that stuff so I couldn't

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.639 
algae and all that stuff so I couldn't
take<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:51.000> had<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.390> retake<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.379> whole

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
take it and I had to retake this whole

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.100 
take it and I had to retake this whole
entire<00:00:53.100> aquarium<00:00:53.399> part<00:00:53.879> because<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.360> should

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
entire aquarium part because you should

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.290 
entire aquarium part because you should
have<00:00:55.230> seen<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.770> algae<00:00:56.129> growing<00:00:56.340> plants<00:00:56.879> it

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
have seen the algae growing plants it

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.369 
have seen the algae growing plants it
was<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:57.780> horrendous<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:59.809> I'm<00:01:00.809> basically

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
was just horrendous and I'm basically

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.520 
was just horrendous and I'm basically
liking<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.730> world<00:01:02.940> aquarium<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.899> like<00:01:04.500> how

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530

that<00:01:04.729> aquifer<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:05.970> place<00:01:06.240> I'm<00:01:06.689> going<00:01:07.439> to

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590

move the aquifer and soon the only

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.960

reason<00:01:10.260> why<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.770> have<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.490> buyer<00:01:11.729> right

Chinese objects cleaner eater just
chillin<00:01:42.079> so<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.850> reason<00:01:45.060> why<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:46.020> put<00:01:46.560> another

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
chillin so the reason why I put another

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.130 
chillin so the reason why I put another
fish<00:01:47.790> here<00:01:48.060> even<00:01:48.570> though<00:01:48.659> they're<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:48.960> danger

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
fish here even though they're in danger

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.399 
fish here even though they're in danger
being<00:01:49.560> eaten<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.759> parents<00:01:51.409> so

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
being eaten is so that the parents so

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.770 
being eaten is so that the parents so
parents<00:01:52.649> will<00:01:53.189> learn<00:01:53.369> some<00:01:53.670> parenting<00:01:54.149> skills

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
parents will learn some parenting skills

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.649 
parents will learn some parenting skills
I<00:01:55.049> guess<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.560> could<00:01:55.710> say<00:01:55.920> because<00:01:56.670> if<00:01:57.360> there's

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
I guess you could say because if there's

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.219 
I guess you could say because if there's
fish<00:01:57.990> around<00:01:58.189> there<00:01:59.189> will<00:01:59.280> be<00:01:59.399> more<00:01:59.670> than<00:02:00.229> what

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
fish around there will be more than what

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.270 
fish around there will be more than what
you<00:02:01.259> thought

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
you thought

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.649 
you thought
the<00:02:03.280> parenting<00:02:03.850> skills<00:02:04.149> would<00:02:04.299> be<00:02:04.360> much

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
the parenting skills would be much

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.090 
the parenting skills would be much
better<00:02:04.689> because<00:02:05.200> they<00:02:05.439> have<00:02:05.560> more<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:05.950> look

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
better because they have more to look

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.940 
better because they have more to look
out<00:02:06.280> for<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:07.210> first<00:02:07.390> feel<00:02:07.930> spawns<00:02:08.560> we're

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
out for the first feel spawns we're

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.650 
out for the first feel spawns we're
pretty<00:02:09.280> horrible<00:02:09.759> but<00:02:10.149> then<00:02:12.569> because<00:02:13.569> the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
pretty horrible but then because the

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.100 
pretty horrible but then because the
parents<00:02:13.780> ate<00:02:14.110> them<00:02:14.379> but<00:02:14.650> now<00:02:14.800> after<00:02:15.690> five<00:02:16.690> or

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
parents ate them but now after five or

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.920 
parents ate them but now after five or
six<00:02:17.560> bonds<00:02:18.340> they're<00:02:19.269> starting<00:02:19.569> to<00:02:19.599> get<00:02:19.720> the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
six bonds they're starting to get the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.770 
six bonds they're starting to get the
hang<00:02:19.959> of<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.580> like<00:02:21.580> this<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.209> actually<00:02:22.660> the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
hang of it like this is actually the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.890 
hang of it like this is actually the
second<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.880> first<00:02:24.880> seven<00:02:25.330> days<00:02:25.510> they've<00:02:25.870> been

I'm<00:02:39.329> kind<00:02:40.329> of<00:02:40.480> scared<00:02:40.840> of<00:02:41.049> the<00:02:41.170> fry<00:02:41.440> going<00:02:42.130> into

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
I'm kind of scared of the fry going into

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.819 
I'm kind of scared of the fry going into
the<00:02:42.790> Bolivian<00:02:43.269> Rams<00:02:43.569> territory<00:02:44.349> but<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:46.829> don't

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
the Bolivian Rams territory but I don't

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:53.650 
the Bolivian Rams territory but I don't
put<00:02:48.730> this<00:02:48.849> thing<00:02:49.060> in

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.860 

that's<00:02:54.290> not<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.650> know<00:02:55.330> all<00:02:56.330> right<00:02:56.480> that's<00:02:56.720> my

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
that's not to know all right that's my

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.580 
that's not to know all right that's my
video<00:02:57.320> guys<00:02:57.890> um<00:02:58.370> thanks<00:02:59.360> for<00:02:59.540> watching<00:03:00.020> and

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
video guys um thanks for watching and

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.430 
video guys um thanks for watching and
look<00:03:03.590> at<00:03:03.770> that<00:03:03.800> placement<00:03:04.670> I'm<00:03:05.440> thinking

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
look at that placement I'm thinking

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.920 
look at that placement I'm thinking
about<00:03:06.700> leveling<00:03:07.700> this<00:03:07.940> up<00:03:08.120> a<00:03:08.270> bit<00:03:08.300> so<00:03:08.660> it<00:03:08.750> looks

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
about leveling this up a bit so it looks

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.900 
about leveling this up a bit so it looks
like<00:03:08.990> a<00:03:09.080> little<00:03:09.350> hill<00:03:09.770> and<00:03:10.400> then<00:03:12.640> tank<00:03:13.640> is<00:03:13.790> not

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
like a little hill and then tank is not

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.270 
like a little hill and then tank is not
fully<00:03:14.120> going<00:03:14.390> out<00:03:14.510> your<00:03:14.690> family<00:03:15.110> use<00:03:15.620> the

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
fully going out your family use the

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.990 
fully going out your family use the
triangle<00:03:16.730> rule<00:03:17.450> so<00:03:18.140> here<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:21.260> here<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:22.100> it'll

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
triangle rule so here to here so it'll

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.540 
triangle rule so here to here so it'll
be<00:03:23.060> a<00:03:23.150> little<00:03:23.210> clearer<00:03:23.630> patch<00:03:23.840> there<00:03:24.140> and<00:03:24.550> then

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
be a little clearer patch there and then

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.840 
be a little clearer patch there and then
here<00:03:25.850> so<00:03:26.740> basically<00:03:28.000> here<00:03:29.000> here<00:03:30.070> here<00:03:31.070> and

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
here so basically here here here and

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.520 
here so basically here here here and
make<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.480> whole<00:03:32.660> little<00:03:32.960> triangle<00:03:33.350> so<00:03:33.500> I

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
make the whole little triangle so I

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.230 
make the whole little triangle so I
don't<00:03:33.890> know<00:03:33.980> what<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:34.190> put<00:03:34.430> here<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.820> make<00:03:35.120> it

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
don't know what to put here to make it

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.530 
don't know what to put here to make it
look<00:03:35.390> appealing<00:03:36.070> but<00:03:37.070> I<00:03:37.400> think<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.180> can<00:03:38.210> work

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
look appealing but I think I can work

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.440 
look appealing but I think I can work
something<00:03:38.930> out<00:03:39.080> and<00:03:39.380> then<00:03:39.890> for<00:03:40.850> here<00:03:41.060> I'm

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
something out and then for here I'm

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.450 
something out and then for here I'm
thing<00:03:41.720> about<00:03:41.840> getting<00:03:42.170> that<00:03:42.290> spun<00:03:42.680> bill<00:03:43.250> to

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 
thing about getting that spun bill to

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.580 
thing about getting that spun bill to
replace<00:03:43.850> to<00:03:44.300> add<00:03:44.480> more<00:03:44.720> space<00:03:45.110> but<00:03:47.410> but<00:03:48.410> I

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
replace to add more space but but I

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.460 
replace to add more space but but I
don't<00:03:48.860> know<00:03:48.950> right<00:03:49.190> now<00:03:49.220> cuz<00:03:49.790> i<00:03:50.290> read<00:03:51.290> that

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
don't know right now cuz i read that

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.530 
don't know right now cuz i read that
sponge<00:03:51.890> filter<00:03:52.220> is<00:03:52.460> doing<00:03:52.760> really<00:03:53.060> well<00:03:53.360> in

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
sponge filter is doing really well in

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.880 
sponge filter is doing really well in
this<00:03:53.630> tank<00:03:53.930> i<00:03:54.140> really<00:03:54.500> like<00:03:54.740> it<00:03:54.950> and<00:03:55.130> a<00:03:56.890> few

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
this tank i really like it and a few

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.000 
this tank i really like it and a few
guys<00:03:58.070> are<00:03:58.370> one<00:03:58.520> roof<00:03:58.760> or<00:03:58.970> like<00:03:59.209> lighting<00:04:00.010> it's

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
guys are one roof or like lighting it's

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.630 
guys are one roof or like lighting it's
a<00:04:01.370> have<00:04:02.060> a<00:04:02.090> halogen<00:04:02.780> lamp<00:04:02.990> here<00:04:03.290> it's<00:04:03.470> 27<00:04:04.400> wats

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
a have a halogen lamp here it's 27 wats

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.500 
a have a halogen lamp here it's 27 wats
so<00:04:05.030> five<00:04:05.750> watts<00:04:06.110> a<00:04:06.290> gallon<00:04:06.770> and<00:04:07.270> i<00:04:08.270> think

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
so five watts a gallon and i think

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.780 
so five watts a gallon and i think
that's<00:04:08.660> more<00:04:08.930> than<00:04:08.990> enough<00:04:09.200> to<00:04:09.680> support<00:04:10.040> glass

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
that's more than enough to support glass

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.110 
that's more than enough to support glass
of<00:04:11.030> stigmas<00:04:11.450> and<00:04:11.480> stay<00:04:12.020> required<00:04:12.560> moderate<00:04:13.250> to

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
of stigmas and stay required moderate to

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.539 
of stigmas and stay required moderate to
high<00:04:14.330> lighting<00:04:14.630> i<00:04:14.959> would<00:04:15.800> say<00:04:16.040> if<00:04:16.340> you're

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
high lighting i would say if you're

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.240 
high lighting i would say if you're
raising<00:04:16.760> loss<00:04:17.090> of<00:04:17.299> stigma<00:04:17.720> about<00:04:18.350> 3<00:04:18.739> watts<00:04:19.010> or

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
raising loss of stigma about 3 watts or

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.970 
raising loss of stigma about 3 watts or
four<00:04:19.910> wats<00:04:20.150> a<00:04:20.299> gallon<00:04:20.690> this<00:04:21.049> is<00:04:21.169> 5<00:04:21.440> watts<00:04:21.739> so

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
four wats a gallon this is 5 watts so

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.450 
four wats a gallon this is 5 watts so
it's<00:04:22.130> more<00:04:22.550> than<00:04:22.760> enough<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:24.710> Bolivian<00:04:25.190> round

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
it's more than enough the Bolivian round

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.980 
it's more than enough the Bolivian round
really<00:04:25.850> likes<00:04:26.090> to<00:04:26.270> make<00:04:26.390> a<00:04:26.450> mess<00:04:26.750> of<00:04:26.780> things

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
really likes to make a mess of things

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.610 
really likes to make a mess of things
actually<00:04:27.530> i'm<00:04:28.040> trying<00:04:28.669> to<00:04:29.230> relocate<00:04:30.230> it

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
actually i'm trying to relocate it

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.350 
actually i'm trying to relocate it
somewhere<00:04:30.650> else<00:04:30.980> so<00:04:31.580> that<00:04:31.610> it<00:04:31.850> doesn't<00:04:32.060> mess

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
somewhere else so that it doesn't mess

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.360 
somewhere else so that it doesn't mess
things<00:04:32.630> up<00:04:33.200> because<00:04:34.160> I<00:04:34.730> guess

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
things up because I guess

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.040 
things up because I guess
it's<00:04:37.880> a

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.430 
youtube i got a petco I know Peck hole

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.180 
youtube i got a petco I know Peck hole
isn't<00:07:10.640> the<00:07:10.940> best<00:07:11.210> place<00:07:11.360> to<00:07:11.780> get<00:07:11.930> fish<00:07:12.830> or

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:13.190 
isn't the best place to get fish or

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.940 
isn't the best place to get fish or
plans<00:07:13.460> but<00:07:13.820> i<00:07:14.180> guess<00:07:15.020> the<00:07:15.230> aquifer<00:07:15.710> was

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:15.950 
plans but i guess the aquifer was

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.040 
plans but i guess the aquifer was
appealing<00:07:16.460> to<00:07:16.610> me<00:07:16.760> and<00:07:17.000> this<00:07:17.450> PEC<00:07:17.720> hole<00:07:17.930> just

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.050 
appealing to me and this PEC hole just

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.560 
appealing to me and this PEC hole just
opened<00:07:18.440> up<00:07:18.560> so<00:07:18.860> all<00:07:19.100> of<00:07:19.130> its<00:07:19.460> topless<00:07:20.030> fresh<00:07:20.300> so

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:20.570 
opened up so all of its topless fresh so

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.320 
opened up so all of its topless fresh so
I<00:07:20.750> just<00:07:21.530> snapped<00:07:21.830> out<00:07:22.100> the<00:07:22.220> chance<00:07:22.550> and<00:07:22.850> took

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.330 
I just snapped out the chance and took

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.070 
I just snapped out the chance and took
it<00:07:23.890> but<00:07:24.890> normally<00:07:25.550> I<00:07:25.790> would<00:07:26.330> not<00:07:26.510> go<00:07:26.540> to<00:07:26.750> peck

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:27.080 
it but normally I would not go to peck
