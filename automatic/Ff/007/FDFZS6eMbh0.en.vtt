00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.540
 after we got home you started to speak ill of the Chilean goal and 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.540
 but seek the approval of the powers 

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:10.649
 the agent 

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:15.019
 the piloteiro joked about changing my life last night that was before or after 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.460
 that you look for a piece of your child 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.620
 there was nothing 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.769
 hill reaches the limit 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.499
 he asked from now on my actions will not be stronger than 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.250
 From now on I figured on the cable in my life and I 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.970
 the corporation questioned by 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.710
 that produced in the warehouse 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.140
 it's a rush 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.570
 You're all going to see 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.570
 from now on I have exposed the new model 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.330
 maria pstu 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.230
 from now on 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.430
 I do not have female disapproval anymore 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.430
 so it's a challenge that I had a bad day and could not vote 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.580
 I do not like this thing 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.420
 good for you 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.940
 the mainz that best meets latina 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.520
 what I think you do not care what counts is what you think of you 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.710
 I have a dream 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.710
 It's what I think of me. 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.680
 I forgot what you think of you. 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.970
 the purse I think I'm close to more pressing is clearly 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.340
 this year 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.790
 the gross domestic product 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.790
 but letting your side of yours be me 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.170
 but be sure to be ready 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.660
 no, he was not 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.660
 Of course he says 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.229
 as he is not 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.010
 and if you want to be angry with me about it 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.010
 You can be angry because I'm walking for you. 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.550
 What did you say at the boutique hotel? 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.550
 the search begins to take effect 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.099
 they know that if they 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:10.979
 to another
