00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:17.539
 this is the video review for the dragon that 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:20.210
 figure perfect cell he comes 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.119
 with 1 julia and a little dragon 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.339
 ball but before we get the accessories 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.070
 look at us marcel 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:31.369
 and before inzell I explain 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.670
 Let's take a look at these figures 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.050
 I have a lot of them 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.350
 and yes I thought the beginning 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.780
 Marcel makes these figures today 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.110
 as well as the television series germany 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:49.699
 no open latest was 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.759
 I bought that in one at that time 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.920
 local comic shop so that was one 

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:58.159
 mix of comic and load as well 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.629
 had tons of merchandise and yes 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.629
 he also has this dragonball 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.390
 figures and yes that was great 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.390
 due i was totally im at the time 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.770
 dragon ball fever and therefore had to 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.750
 me, of course, the figures 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.920
 to get 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.829
 disadvantage is that the figures are not 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.140
 But then you could be too cheap 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.930
 do not take five figures at a time 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.170
 but every month has number 1 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.700
 especially if you are still on your parents 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.380
 as instructed and still pocket money 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.790
 and yes that's why the collection is 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.580
 grown slowly but steadily 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:39.770
 that's enough, let 's start with sell 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.840
 At first glance he sees his 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.340
 Model really very similar 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.990
 and it's actually almost 90 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.170
 percent I would say about one 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.479
 because there is something in it from him 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.840
 but it is very different 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.810
 face one sees here that is pretty 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.490
 squat and small and recommend too 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:08.959
 here this purple violet thing 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:13.610
 Anyway this muster here 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:16.430
 his face so who series you 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.349
 or knows the manga white 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.250
 yes that his face is here at the side 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.600
 such a purple demarcation has and was missing 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.820
 has this figure over here 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.910
 but otherwise I have to say where you are 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.200
 pretty much rather put into detail 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.220
 The figures are also great 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.520
 high quality 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.530
 I do not know if that at the 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.140
 here the material wants to fly 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.470
 is because it almost feels 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.780
 rather like rubber so a very solid 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.130
 rubber and that just feels easy 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.840
 much higher quality and you do not have 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.810
 So much you fear something broke 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.800
 make something in the figures yet 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.920
 it's a pity 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:03.320
 they are not too flexible I show 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.320
 now it can be here on zell his head 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.450
 completely it does not think I want 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.470
 Do not overuse it now 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.400
 and if the figure is still very good 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.600
 quality on the battery every case after 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.010
 left and right if I am here now 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.560
 I want to continue then I feel like that 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.989
 a small resistance and I want that 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.340
 do not mess with it now 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.920
 then here you can go up and down the arm 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.060
 down 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.690
 but you can not do it anymore 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.580
 soothe 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.920
 So that's the only move it 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.410
 goes up and down otherwise that is 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:39.600
 as it is fixed here 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.230
 In this case , it is the same to the poor 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:47.239
 only the breath of the leaves is down again 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:50.730
 and the rest is solid again 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.310
 Then you can get him here at the hip 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.489
 still moving 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:59.430
 This is completely about and then 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:04.560
 you can go up the leg here 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.120
 Anwinkeln and yes backwards knows even 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.489
 not if she feels at all going 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.880
 Not so, but it would be better anyway 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:14.040
 be hampered by his feelings 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:18.239
 but you can here on the knee that again 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.370
 bend but the foot is nothing so here is 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.160
 then the same 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.190
 and yes that's pretty much the only one 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.570
 movement esl has on it 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.390
 It will be a whole year later 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.800
 piece a worse but I say for 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.450
 such a figure that you can nicely into 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.960
 want to make shelf full ranges 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.680
 out 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.270
 you can not help them 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:44.610
 give any positions and me 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.499
 say that's enough for me 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.969
 certainly enough at that time 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:50.270
 I am so in motion 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:52.559
 movement fetishist here figurines there 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.150
 Do you come to other things I have 

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:54.990
 It's better if they look good and there 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.529
 You can also relax a bit 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.740
 make a mark in the movement so then 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:03.389
 The figure sometimes from behind her 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.139
 we also see his own two 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.639
 outstrip 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:10.259
 yes I already had a bit of one 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.180
 he has a head of wear here 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:14.069
 By the way, also on the tank a bit 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.339
 that comes from my move to berlin 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:19.199
 Back then we were all in a box 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:23.669
 he might have you in here and there 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:26.569
 a bit more careful in cotton 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.770
 but should pack only too late 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:31.559
 and what else he has here, too 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:35.789
 its needle in the back to prevent his having 

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:37.979
 An adversary cares so will say so much 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:41.279
 At first we are too much for you now 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:43.919
 First what I say here in the figure 

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:45.749
 this has not been that recently 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.909
 has been since I bought it 

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:49.949
 The joints of the legs are very loose 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:52.499
 but if that is now a general problem 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.560
 is or if it only gets them here 

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:57.060
 has no idea 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.800
 then yes, the junior was still with us 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.610
 doing under chorus dragon ball 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:06.899
 outside picture I hold that tight 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:10.770
 the junior has no moves on it 

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:14.189
 So that has a fixed, so to speak 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.029
 figure and a movement is there 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:17.490
 do not drink 

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:19.379
 even with him we are the main problem 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:23.249
 the face is not really that 

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:25.409
 similar but he has this pattern here 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:30.139
 on the side of the face the bavaria 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:33.330
 but otherwise missing here again 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:36.680
 Apart from the face really 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:39.060
 faithfully and serially 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.980
 for such a little extra that is 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.590
 In addition to the figure was none 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.700
 complaints 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.460
 then it was still in dragon ball 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:50.430
 It should and Dragon Ball always had 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:53.370
 every figure and still has 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:55.650
 such a small medal in there and there 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:59.190
 was then some scenes from the anime 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.540
 on it and knows now, however 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.270
 not where they need to be in one 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.500
 I could and could lay another carton 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:08.840
 now first do not find 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:11.730
 maybe I'll get it after that 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.620
 Do you have the dragon ball with the six? 

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:15.960
 I do not know if every figure is staring 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.670
 always the same so if each had l 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.160
 Now always figure the dragon ball in 

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.630
 had six or sternen whether it since that 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.390
 by chance I do not know now 

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:27.840
 but my father, mine, had that 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:31.620
 founder with the six stars so that 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.940
 were in the set of sell now and 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.110
 we are now at the end of it 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.820
 the review arrived 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.160
 I thank you again for 

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.290
 watching does not get the dragon ball 

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.410
 to stay on the spot after all 

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.970
 Now so again, I thank you for 

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.990
 watch and see you in the 

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.410
 next district 

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.410
 See you
