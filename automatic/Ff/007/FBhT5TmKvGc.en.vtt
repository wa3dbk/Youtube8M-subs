00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.269 

now<00:00:01.230> this<00:00:01.439> next<00:00:01.620> knot<00:00:01.920> here<00:00:03.799> was<00:00:04.799> taught<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.069> me

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
now this next knot here was taught to me

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.230 
now this next knot here was taught to me
by<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.460> fishermen<00:00:05.940> who<00:00:06.029> gave<00:00:06.210> me<00:00:06.330> this<00:00:06.480> real

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
by the fishermen who gave me this real

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:16.120 
by the fishermen who gave me this real
this<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.710> led<00:00:10.710> Coraline<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:13.580> whole<00:00:14.580> lot<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.089> it

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 
this is led Coraline a whole lot of it

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.790 
this is led Coraline a whole lot of it
so<00:00:17.130> he<00:00:17.279> called<00:00:17.430> this<00:00:17.699> not<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> blood<00:00:18.449> knot<00:00:21.800> I've

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
so he called this not a blood knot I've

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.970 
so he called this not a blood knot I've
seen<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.189> called<00:00:23.400> just<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.789> ledcor<00:00:24.029> not<00:00:24.680> as<00:00:25.680> well

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
seen it called just a ledcor not as well

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.670 
seen it called just a ledcor not as well
I<00:00:26.330> don't<00:00:27.330> know<00:00:27.420> if<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.660> nod<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.320> going<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.560> let

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
I don't know if this nod is going to let

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:36.680 
I don't know if this nod is going to let
you<00:00:28.769> do<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.849> tie<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:33.680> strand<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.800> line<00:00:35.540> that<00:00:36.540> is

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
you do is tie a strand of line that is

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.260 
you do is tie a strand of line that is
essentially<00:00:37.140> inside<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.579> your<00:00:38.820> lead<00:00:39.000> core

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
essentially inside of your lead core

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.389 
essentially inside of your lead core
line<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:40.230> what<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.500> need<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.890> extra<00:00:41.160> line

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
line and what you need that extra line

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.750 
line and what you need that extra line
for<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.000> because<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.450> lead<00:00:42.629> core<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.140> thick

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
for is because the lead core is so thick

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.090 
for is because the lead core is so thick
it<00:00:44.760> becomes<00:00:45.300> quite<00:00:46.200> difficult<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.890> work<00:00:47.039> with

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
it becomes quite difficult to work with

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.779 
it becomes quite difficult to work with
in<00:00:47.489> time<00:00:47.730> odds<00:00:48.350> so<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:50.039> gives<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> piece

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
in time odds so this gives you a piece

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.010 
in time odds so this gives you a piece
of<00:00:51.030> line<00:00:51.329> I'm<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:51.600> going<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.899> use<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> chunk<00:00:52.469> of

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
of line I'm just going to use a chunk of

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.470 
of line I'm just going to use a chunk of
braided<00:00:55.020> line<00:00:55.460> to<00:00:56.460> run<00:00:56.610> out<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.940> end<00:00:57.059> just<00:00:57.300> for

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
braided line to run out the end just for

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.510 
braided line to run out the end just for
this<00:00:57.570> demonstration<00:00:57.949> can<00:00:58.949> use<00:00:59.129> whatever<00:00:59.309> you

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
this demonstration can use whatever you

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.299 
this demonstration can use whatever you
want<00:01:00.590> so<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.770> first<00:01:02.010> step<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.510> want<00:01:03.539> to

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
want so the first step is you want to

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.539 
want so the first step is you want to
slide<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> Dacron<00:01:06.420> coating<00:01:07.369> over<00:01:08.369> top

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
slide this is a Dacron coating over top

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.850 
slide this is a Dacron coating over top
of<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.850> lead<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.049> want<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> do<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.619> just

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
of the lead so you want to do is just

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.390 
of the lead so you want to do is just
pull<00:01:12.380> it<00:01:13.380> back

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.039 

so<00:01:18.450> that's<00:01:19.450> your<00:01:19.630> let<00:01:19.900> just<00:01:20.740> pull<00:01:21.009> back<00:01:21.250> a<00:01:21.280> bit

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
so that's your let just pull back a bit

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.050 
so that's your let just pull back a bit
the<00:01:23.049> snip<00:01:23.409> it's<00:01:23.830> really<00:01:24.100> soft<00:01:24.430> so<00:01:24.790> we<00:01:24.880> should

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
the snip it's really soft so we should

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.310 
the snip it's really soft so we should
sit<00:01:25.360> very<00:01:25.600> easily

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.350 

what'd<00:01:29.320> you<00:01:29.470> end<00:01:29.560> up<00:01:29.710> with<00:01:29.950> now<00:01:30.220> and<00:01:30.880> pull<00:01:31.210> this

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
what'd you end up with now and pull this

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.880 
what'd you end up with now and pull this
back<00:01:31.630> out<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:33.570> your<00:01:34.570> lead<00:01:34.869> is<00:01:35.080> up<00:01:35.110> here<00:01:35.560> and<00:01:35.799> you

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
back out is your lead is up here and you

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.450 
back out is your lead is up here and you
have<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:36.159> hollow<00:01:37.680> chunk<00:01:38.680> of<00:01:39.810> Dacron<00:01:40.810> and<00:01:41.460> then

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
have a hollow chunk of Dacron and then

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.669 
have a hollow chunk of Dacron and then
just<00:01:42.759> quickly<00:01:43.000> tie<00:01:44.130> regular<00:01:45.130> overhand<00:01:45.520> knot

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
just quickly tie regular overhand knot

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.109 
just quickly tie regular overhand knot
making<00:01:47.679> sure<00:01:47.860> that<00:01:48.009> the<00:01:48.159> lead<00:01:48.429> is<00:01:48.580> not<00:01:48.729> inside

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
making sure that the lead is not inside

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.210 
making sure that the lead is not inside
of<00:01:49.300> it

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.109 

just<00:01:54.580> push<00:01:54.820> it<00:01:55.000> back<00:01:55.030> a<00:01:55.240> bit

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.899 

Wow<00:01:59.020> so<00:01:59.619> this<00:01:59.770> demonstration<00:02:00.429> we're<00:02:00.700> going<00:02:00.729> to

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
Wow so this demonstration we're going to

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.899 
Wow so this demonstration we're going to
use<00:02:01.030> this<00:02:01.179> small<00:02:01.539> little<00:02:01.689> bit<00:02:02.020> here<00:02:02.909> but

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
use this small little bit here but

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.639 
use this small little bit here but
generally<00:02:04.119> when<00:02:04.390> I<00:02:04.420> tie<00:02:04.659> it<00:02:04.689> I<00:02:04.869> go<00:02:04.990> back<00:02:05.259> about

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
generally when I tie it I go back about

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.740 
generally when I tie it I go back about
six<00:02:06.159> inches<00:02:06.490> make<00:02:06.789> sure<00:02:06.969> I<00:02:07.000> get<00:02:07.119> lots<00:02:07.359> of<00:02:07.479> line

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
six inches make sure I get lots of line

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.050 
six inches make sure I get lots of line
in<00:02:07.960> there<00:02:08.140> he<00:02:09.129> told<00:02:09.369> me<00:02:09.550> you<00:02:09.640> only<00:02:09.759> need<00:02:10.030> a

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
in there he told me you only need a

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.180 
in there he told me you only need a
couple<00:02:10.420> of<00:02:10.629> inches<00:02:10.840> but<00:02:11.910> are<00:02:12.910> we<00:02:13.150> trust<00:02:13.420> them

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
couple of inches but are we trust them

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.930 
couple of inches but are we trust them
so<00:02:15.190> now<00:02:15.310> you're<00:02:15.519> going<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.700> do<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:15.849> you're

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
so now you're going to do is you're

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.720 
so now you're going to do is you're
going<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.090> feed<00:02:16.480> your<00:02:16.860> weed<00:02:17.860> line<00:02:20.430> inside<00:02:21.430> the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
going to feed your weed line inside the

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.190 
going to feed your weed line inside the
Dacron<00:02:22.620> helps<00:02:23.620> sometimes<00:02:24.510> just<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.720> trim<00:02:26.170> that

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
Dacron helps sometimes just to trim that

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.550 
Dacron helps sometimes just to trim that
and<00:02:26.680> get<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:26.980> nice<00:02:27.220> clean<00:02:28.049> area<00:02:29.049> to<00:02:29.170> work<00:02:29.349> with

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.479 

you<00:02:32.560> can<00:02:32.739> sort<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.069> see<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.310> small<00:02:33.640> hole<00:02:33.880> there

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
you can sort of see a small hole there

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:42.790 
you can sort of see a small hole there
just<00:02:36.489> slide<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:37.030> right<00:02:37.090> in<00:02:37.360> there<00:02:37.690> like<00:02:37.930> so

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:50.010 

slide<00:02:43.580> it<00:02:43.850> in<00:02:44.090> as<00:02:44.420> far<00:02:44.780> as<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.080> can<00:02:45.260> get

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.290 

three<00:02:50.590> down<00:02:50.770> in<00:02:51.010> there

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
three down in there

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.410 
three down in there
preferably<00:02:53.050> you<00:02:53.260> can<00:02:53.380> hit<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.770> lead<00:02:54.010> golden

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.800
