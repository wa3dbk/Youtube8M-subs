00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:21.720
 hello to all the videos from my second count 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:25.580
 nickname is called a moped and therefore write down 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.700
 today the passage of wave q is a lot of who 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:33.300
 requested 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:35.670
 asks ordinary heroes we pass two 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:44.550
 all of them are legendary 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:47.940
 this is the druid and paladin and look at the end 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.840
 then show what skills everyone has 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.410
 hero but now it is clear that all over 87 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.370
 hero in the basic skill of all 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.370
 resurrection stay 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:07.200
 but so far gave on 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.840
 arrangement as before called 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.890
 point sweetie not sweetie you were 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:18.440
 in the form of two slaves now I rebuilt the mini 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.810
 format with as your primary account 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.970
 there is just more bass so 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.510
 bigger arrangement and more fence 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.760
 accordingly, there are fewer cars here 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.260
 less fence beat mini say so 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:37.090
 format 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:44.410
 on the waves means using heroes 3 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:47.250
 I have the usual hero of the stage vat panel and 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:51.790
 cyclops those heroes who can inflict 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.910
 massive damage could instead get 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.240
 uses the serpent queen 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:02.110
 it is even more effective for these 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:06.090
 waves we somehow start to me just 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:11.890
 You are not bad, but the executioner has it all 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:16.350
 the very beginning for the mind is there 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.350
 We are looking at a wave to 3 have already reached 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:31.780
 4 just started on top not all 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:36.940
 broke here you have griffins of 10 com 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.170
 or 11 barracks each is but 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.770
 helps well 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.770
 than without griffins 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:53.340
 We are looking at everything now 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.340
 4 I worry a dose there already to 5 nearby 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:13.299
 here on wave d griffins everything is strong 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:16.659
 destroys the enemy so you have to 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.989
 pump the building more strongly 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:25.090
 located inside the castle so they 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:29.530
 longer broke them and your heroes stamp 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:32.200
 made out sorted out if you already then 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.319
 switched to the griffin so they are there 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.379
 lingered longer so I shoved 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:42.209
 inside slavery is not the property of life well here 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:48.010

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:52.239

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:58.840
 launch live 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:03.989
 key less block that percent 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.379
 60 such damage can not hold something 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.650
 dinosaur 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:14.590
 life is all filled up here my two worked 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:18.769
 bombs and all the dinosaurs didn't fall in all 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:23.259

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:36.909
