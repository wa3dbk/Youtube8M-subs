00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
ended the habs got up two goals early

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.729 
ended the habs got up two goals early
well<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.540> should<00:00:54.780> probably<00:00:54.809> say<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.290> Leafs<00:00:55.559> got

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
well I should probably say the Leafs got

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.500 
well I should probably say the Leafs got
down<00:00:55.980> two<00:00:56.250> goals<00:00:56.489> early<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:57.059> seems<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.450> be

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
down two goals early that seems to be

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.720 
down two goals early that seems to be
the<00:00:57.630> trend<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.920> pretty<00:00:59.160> much<00:00:59.280> spelled

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
the trend and that pretty much spelled

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.520 
the trend and that pretty much spelled
the<00:00:59.850> end<00:00:59.880> of<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.180> game<00:01:00.210> well<00:01:00.719> kaberle<00:01:01.200> took<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
the end of the game well kaberle took a

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.650 
the end of the game well kaberle took a
shot<00:01:01.770> which<00:01:02.100> was<00:01:02.250> amazing<00:01:02.760> he<00:01:03.180> did<00:01:03.390> he<00:01:03.629> did

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
shot which was amazing he did he did

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.479 
shot which was amazing he did he did
actually<00:01:04.020> that<00:01:04.410> was<00:01:04.500> kind<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.739> cool<00:01:04.800> the<00:01:05.280> only

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
actually that was kind of cool the only

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.130 
actually that was kind of cool the only
real<00:01:05.729> highlights<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.479> leaf<00:01:06.690> seem<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.050> be

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
real highlights for the leaf seem to be

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.930 
real highlights for the leaf seem to be
the<00:01:07.229> fight<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.800> guess<00:01:08.190> let's<00:01:08.340> go<00:01:08.550> over<00:01:08.790> those

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
the fight so I guess let's go over those

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.210 
the fight so I guess let's go over those
Brad<00:01:09.570> may<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.380> comes<00:01:10.590> over<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.039> Leafs

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220

any<00:01:15.210> reports<00:01:15.720> said<00:01:16.200> he<00:01:16.410> did<00:01:16.619> but<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.250> looked

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
any reports said he did but it looked

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.980 
any reports said he did but it looked
like<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.820> that's<00:01:18.000> kind<00:01:18.300> of<00:01:18.360> what<00:01:18.509> happens<00:01:18.810> when

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
like it that's kind of what happens when

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.450 
like it that's kind of what happens when
you<00:01:19.050> punched<00:01:19.440> some<00:01:19.560> guy's<00:01:19.740> helmet<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.190> bunch<00:01:20.340> of

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
you punched some guy's helmet a bunch of

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.040 
you punched some guy's helmet a bunch of
times<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.910> by<00:01:21.149> the<00:01:21.180> way<00:01:21.330> my<00:01:21.420> thoughts<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:22.020> that

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
times and by the way my thoughts on that

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.450 
times and by the way my thoughts on that
trade<00:01:22.440> since<00:01:22.649> I've<00:01:22.830> been<00:01:23.009> getting<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.280> lot<00:01:23.399> of

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
trade since I've been getting a lot of

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.480 
trade since I've been getting a lot of
questions<00:01:23.940> uh<00:01:24.590> Leafs<00:01:25.590> need<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.950> get<00:01:26.100> tougher

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
questions uh Leafs need to get tougher

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.190 
questions uh Leafs need to get tougher
unfortunately<00:01:27.240> they<00:01:27.390> can't<00:01:27.600> punch<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.050> puck

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
unfortunately they can't punch the puck

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.539 
unfortunately they can't punch the puck
in<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.380> net<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:28.830> they<00:01:29.010> do<00:01:29.070> need<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> get

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
in the net but they do need to get

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.190 
in the net but they do need to get
tougher<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.270> they<00:01:30.540> only<00:01:30.689> gave<00:01:30.900> up<00:01:31.080> a

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
tougher and they only gave up a

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.140 
tougher and they only gave up a
conditional<00:01:31.830> sixth-round<00:01:32.369> pick<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.820> don't

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
conditional sixth-round pick so I don't

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.789 
conditional sixth-round pick so I don't
