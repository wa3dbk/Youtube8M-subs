00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.289

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.720

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.789
 trade trick or a tip and then have 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.339
 I have another special trick 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.050
 or tip for you all the still 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:31.759
 can not come into the web app 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.050
 maybe it does not help too well 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.510
 I'll just start with that 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.540
 and you see my web app is up 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.510
 I asked myself to say English 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.000
 let or I have learned that the 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.460
 web app in german also german 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.750
 server and accordingly 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.930
 maybe the german server 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.610
 are overloaded and you with a bit 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.460
 luck that there is no guarantee 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.040
 You only need to change the web app 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.890
 in English and then you have one 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.970
 Higher chance to come in and 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.560
 of course I have a bit too 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.980
 more hope finally come in too 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.200
 come 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.770
 how that works shows you now and that 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.840
 if you are on ebay.com blablabla 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.770
 you have if you scroll down here 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.540
 since at the beginning yes up here and at 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.580
 scroll down here and see below 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.470
 Then germany right with you are her 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.720
 then click on it you see as I said 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.080
 germany just click on united 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.670
 kingdom or in English and then you can 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.930
 you might try luck again 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.870
 you are lucky and will come back 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.640
 or come back in or out 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.510
 first time I push you on 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.690
 every thumbs down 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.910
 and now it's time for a trade tip 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.650
 this is about contract cards because of that 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.050
 I just call this method 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.240
 contract card device i have 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.610
 bought me some contract cards 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.910
 golden does not shine the normal 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.120
 contract cards and always for 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.920
 150 as you can see her here i 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.070
 I still have some in the club 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.160
 actually saved a lot if 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.050
 So you see, I already have some 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:11.250
 contracted garden bought every 450 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:14.460
 Also here I have for 250 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.760
 good at auction as we proceed 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.440
 you just look for it here 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.720
 Development level gold and up 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.860
 contract or contract and 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:29.820
 then search maximum price 150 and now 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.950
 you look for so long I always have it like that 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.890
 I am here about 30 pages 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.270
 jumped forward what I am now in 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.250
 video do not do that you can then 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.200
 and you just look for it 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.130
 Contract cards which are not yet bid 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.989
 have on it and offers a maximum of 150 that 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.180
 is very important because only by doing so 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.040
 make sure you get the maximum 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.170
 You can win profit 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.959
 of course also for 200 buy now 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.780
 but then he makes less profit so 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.260
 I would recommend a maximum of 150 too 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.540
 Offer 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.040
 and sometimes you just have to keep going 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.459
 scroll because many this method 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.320
 use right now and then just yours 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.260
 luck on I have everything 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.989
 These contract cards can be seen here 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.489
 example a 450 i have a rare one 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.040
 all my contract cards within 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.350
 had a maximum of one hour auctioned 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.600
 that is possible for you too and if 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.220
 one now considers that currently no 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.440
 man who can use contracts or 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.870
 respectively needs and few 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.250
 Know how much they are worth because they are 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.450
 actually at the moment 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.530
 forgive nothing because they said yes 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:38.040
 no one needs then you know now 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.830
 even as soon as fifa 13 was released 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.480
 and the players can be used 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.120
 possibly already in your club 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.040
 then have saved the contracts 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.110
 down 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.049
 and of course you need it too 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.459
 Contracts for your players and there comes 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.799
 then this tactic into the game 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.500
 then the prices rise because they are 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:59.959
 needed and I guess 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.239
 if you have a contract for 150 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.799
 you have bought for them 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.730
 At least that's just it 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:09.189
 at least 500 coins get rid of that is 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.810
 as sure as the name in the church 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:14.439
 I'm 100 percent sure that 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.850
 the contracts at least right at the beginning 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:18.919
 worth at least 500 coins 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.209
 but it can also be that they 1000 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.090
 Of course, then you have one more heart 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.919
 a little more luck has lost 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.680
 you definitely not because you need 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.720
 only at fifa 13 at fifa 12 look there 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.349
 were even near the end of fifa 12 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.840
 even the rare end of the normal 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:38.509
 the normal golden contracted garden 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.940
 are also between 300 and 500 away 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:43.130
 gone and that is now at fifa 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.090
 13 at the beginning very different because it is 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.949
 significantly more expensive 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.599
 and that's why this method is right 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.770
 I do not need anything anymore 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:51.409
 I just have to wait now 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.110
 until the prices rise and then I have 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:55.699
 my whole contract cards out and 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.440
 if it goes well then I will without 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:00.110
 somehow to have a great deal of effort 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.550
 up here already 30,000 coins 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.280
 or maybe even more if it is 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.199
 is going really well who knows loss think 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.720
 I do not do this in any case 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.280
 I can only recommend this method 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.560
 try it out you'll be surprised 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:17.409
 what you will take to win 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:20.750
 when fifa 13 comes out officially and 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:22.460
 then I wanted to say something briefly and 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.530
