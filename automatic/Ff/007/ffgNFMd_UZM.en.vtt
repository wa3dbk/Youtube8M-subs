00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
the peasants are closer but when I moved

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.979 
the peasants are closer but when I moved
forward<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.489> war<00:02:30.489> band<00:02:30.700> always<00:02:31.209> marches

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
forward the war band always marches

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.770 
forward the war band always marches
forward<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:32.590> attacked<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:33.370> I'm<00:02:33.549> gonna

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
my cavalry out of there which is kind of

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.530 
my cavalry out of there which is kind of
thing<00:03:02.950> because<00:03:03.950> they<00:03:04.550> got<00:03:04.790> stuck<00:03:05.030> in<00:03:05.180> combat

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
thing because they got stuck in combat

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.690 
thing because they got stuck in combat
anyways<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:07.330> we<00:03:08.330> got<00:03:08.510> three<00:03:09.130> to<00:03:10.130> three

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.260 
anyways so we got three to three
casualties<00:03:12.670> unnecessary<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:16.240> managed<00:03:17.240> to

make<00:05:24.730> casualties<00:05:25.690> now<00:05:26.590> they<00:05:26.770> didn't<00:05:27.040> charge

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
make casualties now they didn't charge

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.200

as<00:05:27.880> much<00:05:27.910> as<00:05:28.240> I<00:05:28.360> thought<00:05:28.660> they<00:05:28.900> would<00:05:29.080> but

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
as much as I thought they would but

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.420 
as much as I thought they would but
semester<00:05:31.210> wavering<00:05:32.040> and<00:05:33.040> I<00:05:35.100> was<00:05:36.100> going<00:05:36.280> for

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
semester wavering and I was going for

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.840 
semester wavering and I was going for
triple<00:05:36.970> speed<00:05:38.040> just<00:05:39.040> the<00:05:39.430> fighting<00:05:39.760> gets

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
triple speed just the fighting gets

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:56.030 
triple speed just the fighting gets
boring<00:05:40.240> after<00:05:40.450> all<00:05:40.830> so<00:05:42.720> it's<00:05:43.720> a<00:05:43.810> victory<00:05:44.110> and<00:05:44.740> I
