00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.050
 the restoration of the endodontic tooth ado 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.670
 part of the endodontic treatment 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:16.079
 Many cases are essential when praying a test restoration before starting 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.490
 the treatment 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.180
 since if you do not do quad to the restoration is not going to be possible 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.230
 it is worthwhile to carry out the treatment of said ducts 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.789
 for the risk of fracture and failures that we will have later 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.760
 you have to consider that one endodontic tooth two a more fragile tooth 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.739
 of vido 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:37.770
 aa 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.520
 tooth destruction 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.830
 progressive loss of elastic fibers 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.140
 and above all 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.190
 mainly due to the loss of dental tissue 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.540
 what is supposed 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.230
 preceding streets plus the elimination of the vault 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.030
 what is the reinforcement of the cameral ceiling 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.350
 it is shown in studies that the coronary structure to reduction goes to 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.410
 favor 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.150
 the fracture especially in the later sectors 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.150
 besides a point in dogma technology have a color change 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.700
 those changes 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.910
 they are from vido 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.910
 especially attention of the products placed in the interior 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.630
 the pipe hopefully pulp remains 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.170
 and its subsequent degradation 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.170
 when is the best time to restore a tooth 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.400
 We know that endodontic treatment is not enough until it is restored 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.130
 totally the tooth and that as soon as possible to toronto bouquets ablation much better 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.880
 the coronary leak is maybe 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.880
 the most important 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.150
 of the reasons for failure in Don Kiko 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.250
 we know that the exposure of the hanger uta to the conduit 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.160
 of the mayoral driver 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.390
 will force a retreat in rooms to right armchair this few weeks 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.780
 exposed 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.150
 besides the tooth I know you'll be easier to break 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.220
 and he has not 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.360
 It makes sense to wait to see how to treat the high percentage 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.599
 95% success 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.599
 what endodontics entails with current techniques 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.540
 depending on the face or the cross you are going to receive it is evident 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.110
 we will make a kind of restoration or another one on baxter front teeth that will not 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:27.080
 have a great destruction we will opt for a direct action October 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:29.209
 as well 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.039
 If there is a big color change 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:35.079
 we will proceed to an internal whitening 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.849
 taking into account the risk of external action raxÃ³ that there 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.549
 we generate heat to accelerate that approach 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:47.169
 if against the injury 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:48.329
 dental 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:53.199
 It is very big, it means a loss, overflows and salts, we will restore 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:59.409
 with post-expo trunnions on subsequent days whenever you make a 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:04.779
 full coronary count of all cusps unless it is clear from quebec not 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:06.409
 there is little allusion 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.409
 with an antagonist 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:16.519
 usual questions we ask ourselves about the poles 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:20.909
 are the following posts reinforce the tooth 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:22.899
 the answer is no 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:27.359
 that reinforce us but that can even favor its fracture 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:32.619
 therefore only use a post when we need retention of 

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:33.529
 dental stump
