00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello everyone with you alex and so 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.890
 it turned out that the other day there two days ago 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.690
 and looked at my channel and realized that I 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.769
 re released the last video that 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.110
 only 3 February 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.210
 that is, it took almost 2 weeks as 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.029
 that's when you don't make a video 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.400
 time flies very very quickly 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.740
 that I just recently released cops 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.660
 already half a month behind 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:29.580
 so I decided today so this is part 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.380
 comment like this and shoot 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.800
 Before you Like episode which by the way is very 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.660
 for a long time was not playing of course in the back 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.239
 lubricate as essentially alternatives to 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.730
 while there is no special version 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.450
 There is of course domination but I somehow 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.489
 it’s necessary to distinguish it alone 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.079
 the right team with which with we 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.449
 set of you will destroy the public 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.480
 one to play like no other 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.120
 pleasure so the hindu match it 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.649
 the best choice when the question arises about 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.860
 where is all the same today to play playing with 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.760
 scorpion weapons one of the most will 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.760
 one of the best 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.710
 far more brutal 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.609
 rate of fire which may be 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.609
 now let me down 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:21.710
 how i don't know and why i didn't take everything 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.049
 in the hands of pp 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.079
 I did n’t run with them there for a long time 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.369
 skoreicha bacon already got out stop then 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.740
 I hardly took a gun 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.060
 machine gun however the other day so let's say up 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.880
 already loved again 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.490
 all thanks to one wonderful things i 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.459
 earlier for some reason he never 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.140
 used remember very giving doing 

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:44.179
 various non class quotes 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.329
 and even though I think these videos are no longer 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:49.489
 today's video is foreseen 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:53.299
 will contain some kind of advice format best 

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:55.250
 class stage try to put on class 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.020
 from colleagues a machine gun such a wonderful RKK 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.259
 dexterity with agility if you used to 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.780
 didn't do it just transforms 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.629
 this weapon absolutely play becomes 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.909
 so comfortable because you 

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:10.190
 get out of a sprinter instantly 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.639
 I have not persistently accepted before I did not understand 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.739
 advantage in essence 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:18.079
 accepted player perfectly what does this mean 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.060
 and now saw through that is really 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:22.459
 I manage to shoot remington cheek 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.590
 shoot from the hip faster than he does 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:30.590
 at least once shoot me 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:33.459
 and it's so comfortable that I want to play 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.390
 how am I going to die in this situation 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.370
 pretty good start 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.370
 I hope the guy does not decide to jump 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:45.920
 that's why now 2 ero 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.930
 submachine gun he's in my 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:53.750
 if you can call black ops 2 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:58.000
 career this era I really like a 16 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.560
 Kilows are already on defense and you know how everything is 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.040
 very smart goes I did not even expect 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.489
 this start writing ended yes of course 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.489
 not the best 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:15.700
 the act will be better than a neighbor of course 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.700
 best course tights to play without him this 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.070
 this is complete nonsense tin is already a novel dress 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.380
 even on the table chopper will not call 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:28.090
 so let's say not to spoil everything 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:32.780
 the situation is audible and murder and too 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:35.300
 nuclear finish very vigorously I began 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.510
 In no case did I expect this . 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:42.200
 even forgot about which although you have today 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.420
 I ask me very often people 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.440
 surprised when they found out about how i 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:52.250
 I play I play it turns out to be very 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.140
 high sensitivity is simple 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.840
 marvel at dude like a stat card with such 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.130
 sensitivity at all you can play 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.130
 that's the essence of the game 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:08.950
 playing at 1600 dipyai on their mice also 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:12.550
 I expose 6 and 5 hours in black ops 2 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.820
 and everyone says it is not possible 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:19.120
 will shoot I can't play with where 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.580
 smaller salt to me is impossible 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.190
 how so how can you raise the mouse and 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.110
 move your hand so active therefore 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.700
 I would like to ask you a question if you are already 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:32.200
 kaplan play and what 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:34.030
 sensitivity you will be interested it 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.610
 public opinion about this 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:41.740
 the question is what sense is basically 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:45.010
 prefer people with this should have been 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.980
 not at claire but apparently it was just not 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.850
 fate so of course the match turned out even 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:54.370
 better than i could plan at times better 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:57.610
 because I thought that if I play 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:01.420
 at least 5 in the end it will already be 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.100
 good game i have 40 two and match still 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.830
 not over so there is time yet 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.830
 destroy enemy force a little 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.900
 I think I will practice life episodes 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.300
 when there is absolutely nothing to do on the channel 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.930
 the channel is very often doing nothing now 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.450
 I think it will still make 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.490
 press and anal activity 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.860
 I also think it will be possible 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.360
 separately just 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.060
 tell me how you feel about it 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.849
 because it will be interesting about it 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.310
 find out about if it does or not that is 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:36.819
 interesting question what is it very good 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.129
 the match will be or is it a silly idea here 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:41.530
 meanwhile the match ends and the full 45 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:43.360
 to three in the first game it's true 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.460
 my very first game is literally only 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.120
 sat down to record that is, this time was not 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.569
 some much else of everything else i am 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.599
 sat down 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:55.529
 I immediately did so I am very surprised 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:59.460
 and of course I had to kill this guy 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:06:03.129
 let's guys bring this slowly 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:05.590
 I will do my terrible accuracy and I 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:08.650
 I think it turned out very good game 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.389
 47 to four I did not even expect this and I 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.669
 I hope you liked this match 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:15.219
 try to type a hundred and fifty fingers 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:18.520
 up for this almost brutal in the first 

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:22.860
 match and thank you all for watching before 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.860
 new meetings with you was alex bye
