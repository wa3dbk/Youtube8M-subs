in<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.930> picture<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:23.190> design<00:04:23.520> isn't<00:04:23.820> after

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
in the picture the design isn't after

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.470 
in the picture the design isn't after
shown<00:04:24.600> here<00:04:25.530> this<00:04:25.860> design<00:04:26.310> i<00:04:26.340> did<00:04:26.700> but<00:04:27.420> i

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
shown here this design i did but i

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.680 
shown here this design i did but i
thought<00:04:28.020> it<00:04:28.170> looks<00:04:28.320> good<00:04:29.210> you<00:04:30.210> should<00:04:30.540> not

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
thought it looks good you should not

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.970 
thought it looks good you should not
this<00:04:31.050> is<00:04:31.170> not<00:04:31.350> the<00:04:31.560> right<00:04:31.680> piece<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:33.410> yeah<00:04:34.410> so

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
this is not the right piece and yeah so

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.670 
this is not the right piece and yeah so
I<00:04:35.310> kind<00:04:36.060> of<00:04:36.240> involved<00:04:36.720> with<00:04:36.720> it<00:04:37.020> a<00:04:37.050> little<00:04:37.290> but

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
I kind of involved with it a little but

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.600 
I kind of involved with it a little but
I<00:04:38.240> think<00:04:39.240> it<00:04:39.360> walked<00:04:39.540> out<00:04:39.750> pretty<00:04:40.460> so<00:04:41.460> yeah

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610
