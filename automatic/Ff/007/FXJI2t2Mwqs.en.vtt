keeping the rep range between six and

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.709 
keeping the rep range between six and
eight<00:00:49.520> ok<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.579> I'm<00:00:50.789> doing<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.270> t-bar

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
guarantee you stimulate in as much

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.700 
guarantee you stimulate in as much
muscle<00:01:08.400> fibers<00:01:08.909> as<00:01:09.119> possible<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.530> whole

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
muscle fibers as possible the whole

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.060 
muscle fibers as possible the whole
purpose<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:12.710> maximize<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
purpose of this is to maximize the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.480 
purpose of this is to maximize the
muscle<00:01:14.490> recruitment<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.350> also<00:01:16.350> muscle<00:01:17.280> fiber

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
muscle recruitment and also muscle fiber

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.300 
muscle recruitment and also muscle fiber
stimulation<00:01:18.270> that's<00:01:18.659> why<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:19.320> go<00:01:19.500> heavy<00:01:19.740> for

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
stimulation that's why we go heavy for

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.580 
stimulation that's why we go heavy for
the<00:01:20.400> first<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.790> now<00:01:20.970> we<00:01:21.570> get<00:01:21.720> info<00:01:22.020> sculpted

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
the first and now we get info sculpted

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.580

for<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.000> muscle<00:02:33.510> I'm<00:02:33.750> increasing<00:02:34.710> the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
for the muscle I'm increasing the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.090 
for the muscle I'm increasing the
mitochondria<00:02:35.670> in<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.210> muscle<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.890> great

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
mitochondria in the muscle and the great

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.890 
mitochondria in the muscle and the great
thing<00:02:38.130> about<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.820> is<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.690> more

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
thing about that is the more

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.050 
thing about that is the more
mitochondria<00:02:40.110> having<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.830> muscle<00:02:41.190> the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
mitochondria having the muscle the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.990 
mitochondria having the muscle the
amount<00:02:42.270> ATP<00:02:42.960> i'll<00:02:43.440> have<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.490> that<00:02:44.670> means<00:02:44.910> that

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
amount ATP i'll have so that means that

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.080 
amount ATP i'll have so that means that
i<00:02:45.360> can<00:02:45.530> when<00:02:46.530> i<00:02:46.560> start<00:02:46.980> weight<00:02:47.160> training<00:02:47.700> or

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
i can when i start weight training or

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.240 
i can when i start weight training or
doing<00:02:48.150> my<00:02:48.480> weight<00:02:48.690> training<00:02:49.170> segments<00:02:50.100> i'll

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
doing my weight training segments i'll

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.420 
doing my weight training segments i'll
be<00:02:50.550> able<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:51.030> have<00:02:51.960> more<00:02:52.230> power<00:02:52.560> lift<00:02:53.190> more

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
be able to have more power lift more

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.120 
be able to have more power lift more
weight<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.910> have<00:02:54.360> more<00:02:55.170> endurance<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:56.100> the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
weight and have more endurance to the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.460 
weight and have more endurance to the
workout<00:02:56.670> okay<00:02:57.240> so<00:02:57.300> that's<00:02:57.630> about<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:58.020> i<00:02:58.260> got

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
workout okay so that's about it i got

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.770 
workout okay so that's about it i got
two<00:02:58.710> more<00:02:58.920> sets<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.280> go<00:02:59.480> remember<00:03:00.480> knowledge

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
two more sets to go remember knowledge

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.950 
two more sets to go remember knowledge
is<00:03:01.080> key<00:03:01.490> executions<00:03:02.490> power<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:03.270> go<00:03:03.630> get<00:03:03.810> it

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
is key executions power so go get it

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.530 
is key executions power so go get it
done<00:03:04.170> right
