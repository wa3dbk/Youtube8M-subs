00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.830
 hello youtube friends today I'm going to 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:10.830
 teach how to make this paper shield 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.700
 It's very easy to do 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.700
 same 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:24.920
 we need a sheet so a tip 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.660
 up a sleeve here but it's all a 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.690
 triangle the square station and this 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:35.230
 point to this point so a triangle 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.230
 a triangle 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:43.390
 this board for this pump but at the same 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.390
 to the world like this 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:01:01.330
 then to this part box this up 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:05.840
 this tip kakÃ¡ this tip because this 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:09.050
 to be here like this and we saw it we do 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.420
 the other side this point is up to 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.420
 point well 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:21.850
 we must talk well we grab these 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.020
 tip 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.020
 down the line 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:33.600
 so let's go this this is 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:38.939
 A) Yes 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:42.010
 then we doubled this this patita 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.580
 the line but if up 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.580
 yes 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:55.150
 well this is a little bit along the line 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.370
 i 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.370
 if this is so 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.920
 so 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:14.020
 up to the middle and this tip to the 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:17.160
 another half forgive for God uploaded to and 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.160
 background 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.080
 ah 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.770
 so 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.400
 now to fly this like this for 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.549
 little while 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:45.370
 this until here we import in another time 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.370
 we follow and we mark well 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.319
 now this we raise a few tabs 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.319
 hours 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.940
 has spent the shield but we talked a 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.030
 alone 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.549
 the other defense and when we raise those 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.830
 waves 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.830
 we put it inside 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.730
 then it will not be the same with the other 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.730
 we leave 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.390
 and now we have the shield finished and 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.390
 Now I'm going to teach you 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.540
 unfold this like this and it's like that 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:47.739
 well the lace and rasta 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.739
