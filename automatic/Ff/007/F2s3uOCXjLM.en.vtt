00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.610
 Hi, people, I'm right. 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.450
 barak to do the shopping video 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.700
 fashion 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.670
 so we'll have you what's new 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.039
 I'm going to start it so I will not 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.230
 do that scheme show the clothes 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.160
 of my body because very soon it will 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.320
 what book 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.150
 I'm going to use most of these pieces and 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.890
 I also hope that I did not show what 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.710
 I'm sure I'll show 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.840
 eventually as it stays in the body through 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.000
 of looks and finally just not to stay 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.840
 repetitive even to go to help in the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.510
 edition 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.010
 so I'll start with the accessories 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.629
 It's necessary to talk is this earring. 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.760
 here because I'm using it on purpose 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:47.879
 and it's basically bad classic piece is 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.460
 has this turquoise stone and it shrouds 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.170
 for one of the details and I think it's cool 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.960
 this type of earring I really like 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.780
 turquoise as an accessory has a one ring 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:03.719
 turquoise purpose they have seen but it is 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:07.049
 this one here and I to suggestions what 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.360
 I think it gives one of the legs alive in the 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.280
 clothes I bought in the store each in 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.470
 collaborative store that for me 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.439
 Come on, I commented, it's on the street. 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.130
 Augusta at the end of my life, what am I going to do? 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.560
 shopping 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.540
 I go down some gardens and 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.150
 entering shops and notorious and 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.880
 buying later I turn on oscar freire 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.009
 I 'm going to campello that is proposed is the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.909
 that I will now show the person 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.070
 is a little out of control but it is not what 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.170
 I'm thinking, people, I mean 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.610
 I bought so far I think some copies of 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.990
 clothes at sea with the leg but it's because 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.430
 was in liquidation 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.100
 I think twice a year they have 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.869
 this business of making a breast art with 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.579
 80% off 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.040
 so imagine we understand how 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.280
 pieces of clothing that in total and even more 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.250
 sexy and with 80 on account 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.680
 650 so it was pretty crazy, a lot of it 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.299
 people I came late to have gone more 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.189
 early in the event 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.140
 Let's see you thing I bought that 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.909
 there were not many as I said 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.440
 the best thing you have to show is 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:13.560
 and this makes the infinite he is 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.500
 black basic giant will be perfect 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.120
 for cold days that do not apply 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.080
 now I'll have to wait until the sesc 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.080
 school but it's very simple as well as 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.910
 will be very useful to the end of the 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.709
 year in the middle of the year, right? 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.790
 and type initially he was around 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.590
 of one hundred reais 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.480
 so I paid about twenty 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.700
 in it was very cheap and did not 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.390
 demonstrated the rivals I bought there in 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.720
 shit and the high waist shorts 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.540
 It has a color so cream does not arrive if it 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.060
 the caravel is a little more clear 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.580
 that this started electoral, always having 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.040
 here and it's perfect to use 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.590
 photoshop but it is also perfect for 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.070
 use with those parts that you know are 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.630
 very long on the top to be 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.260
 but it's too short to be 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.540
 invested 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.570
 so no dilemma right there, me too 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.180
 I thought about using this kind of piece 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.670
 because that way if you happen to look 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.470
 some will give to see that you were 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.480
 with a shorts underneath and last thing 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.250
 I even bought three pieces to buy 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.049
 also a set of lingerie but I 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.420
 I will not show here but I had a lot 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.920
 beautiful people there lace that shirt 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.549
 florida 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.390
 I asked to be very well fresh and also 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.400
 there's that 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.410
 the two daughters that you are kind of 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.780
 makes a steel I do not like that kind of 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.209
 I think maybe I'm going to 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.650
 seamstress to indicate cut but is well 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.709
 female right? 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.450
 And how cool it is, so I guess. 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.120
 that you can use even in this heat 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.150
 hell but it's in america I bought only 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.850
 that's off the bra and panties 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.320
 I'm coming back accessories right now. 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.870
 two necklaces 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.880
 the first is that at the beginning of 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.829
 I do not know if they realized that 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.900
 certainly so, but almost all 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.160
 shops are with very very special 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.510
 Good, that's why I also 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.840
 I bought this outfit. 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.090
 all the parts here that I bought them 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.580
 have had 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.090
 minimum 30% discount we have here 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.970
 70% and I understand the advice I know 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.079
 is a vial is for the bottle of 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.350
 perfume né 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.590
 and it is transparent has this detail 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.340
 here are the black fringes 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.800
 I really like long necklace, right? 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.900
 I intend to actually use more 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.510
 dark parts because there will give to give 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.020
 Emphasis on the necklace and I of course I too 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:42.889
 I bought that one here that is a 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.030
 I bought the stone and it was in the square 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.150
 school hail 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.690
 But this one I bought in the 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:54.350
 masp in são paulo always stay these 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.250
 expensive hips selling imitation jewelry 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.040
 thing 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.710
 then I really wanted one agree 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.169
 knows those fake crystals that they 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.330
 are more transparent type plus or 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:09.110
 less of this color or has pink as well 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:12.200
 those rooms in purple have black 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:15.080
 but I found it very expensive it was in the gap 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.780
 luxury in a mall I always buy was 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.810
 130 anger I will not pay 130 reais no 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.180
 necklace but I know it has online too 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.789
 to buy the Internet that kind of 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.919
 something that I want but I also think 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.930
 that's a price so I do not know if 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.160
 It's worth it, but finally I bought it here. 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.470
 that was not exactly how I wanted it 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.349
 because he is a little longer and he is 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:39.050
 From a weird brown I really liked the 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:40.430
 color but only 20 reais so I guess 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.139
 that is very worth it 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.680
 and as it is shorter it intends to use 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:48.530
 Type 2 knows that one long and one 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:53.090
 closer to the coolest thing in the 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:06:00.470
 video that this covas tshirts 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:06:03.229
 People are a person who in instagram and I 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.630
 I won this one as my best friend. 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:07.940
 It's beautiful he completes the king boy who is 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.580
 a website that is very cool coming from this 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:14.690
 type t-shirts from bands writers and 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.919
 series and as gogó camelo favorite author 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.990
 but you can not give anyone 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:20.380
 He bought this one the red I 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.750
 I already cut aquino 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:26.920
 a little below also just to leave 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:31.150
 the better the body asks the old bukowski 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:33.310
 cane brandy since 1920 because 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.540
 I do not think you know what you expect. 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.550
 drunk 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.470
 below checked is distributed 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.780
 for signs that I am simply 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.690
 in love with my shirt and mine 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:46.180
 Colleagues now have topshop hat 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.040
 This environment is you being a flop 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.170
 but it's a bit different from the 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:54.160
 ground of the hat that I have to start 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:56.500
 in a tone it is burgundy wine and it is more 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.970
 For summer I think the kind of hat that 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.450
 they may not be ashamed to use 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:03.760
 during the day because our life in this 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:06.250
 to download because it protects even 

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.720
 software heats up his head but he is 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.060
 very beautiful and I mostly enjoyed 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:13.150
 color and the last thing I have to 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.350
 also show on the top is this monkey and 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.450
 beautiful 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.800
 well I'm going to fall for you to be happy but 

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.840
 I'm living this way the kimono 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.740
 practically every holy day and he is kind 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:27.760
 divine he is lacy and has flowers in a 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:29.580
 blend of golden green and here too 

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:32.920
 underneath it has fringes 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.730
 then from chips to shorts and t-shirt 

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.040
 white 

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:39.310
 if you put a kimono on it 

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:41.530
 kind of something else and he is not so 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:46.150
 eastern oriental jazz is right that this use 

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:48.520
 oriental monkey fitch a lot of trips but 

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:50.890
 I also commented on a kimono that he 

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.980
 it is well oriented but for now it is 

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:56.620
 here is being my darling 

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.870
 So I guess this is how I said it. 

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.600
 You'll end up seeing your clothes well. 

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:03.220
 No, do not worry, I'll see you. 

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:08.940
 in the next video that will be from movies 

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:08.940
 books I promise that I will also
