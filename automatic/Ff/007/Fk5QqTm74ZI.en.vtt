00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:09.060
 and it 's where it feels most comfortable 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.100
 barcelona at times had this class 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:16.080
 of plays where his DNA cost again 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:19.140
 which is to continue with the touch follow 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.480
 looking for me it seems that I am that place the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.029
 Respect team is at the time of 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.710
 be losing the miss the idea that 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.710
 Santaní led against the magician 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:36.000
 knowledge of where the pitch comes from 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.960
 where will the door and act now 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.170
 the water would stop doing that just 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.820
 for perfect Christians to mark your 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.820
 goal 12 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.270
 there too 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:04.510
 we are closing four is with him 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.510
 but it would be 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.690
 de maría also had a very good level 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.820
 national mother why that leaves him nailed 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.320
 A lot of skating parts cost in the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.320
 plays broke their waists 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:38.380
 and thinking more about jumping and crossing 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.800
 the center and do not notice how it ends 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.130
 losing the mark 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.130
 and then 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.740
 lose it and then how to choose the 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.650
 movement of the short head to 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.540
 locate it and encase its faults 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.980
 and he will thank mourinho who has 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.810
 had many times that jobs 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.909
 do not 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.909
 for clays classes put 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:15.709
 we say to the counterattack or to Barcelona or 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.480
 we call it santiago solari del 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.580
 party in madrid your team 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:25.569
 kickback and how to play the team 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.569
 controlled because always always against 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:37.459
 the team of the world you can do 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.890
 always because that provokes the rival the 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.250
 adversary and he knows how he does 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.250
 counter 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:51.599
 these interactions is a small barça 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.819
 which is to look for space without a ball and it 's 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.769
 with evolution and here are missing some 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.020
 ordial little bills at the end of the 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:03.100
 come to me it seemed an acceptable match 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:10.220
 there is a tree coming we threw it was an art 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:11.870
 I fully trust that he is the one who kept 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.860
 level 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.860
 in the whole team
