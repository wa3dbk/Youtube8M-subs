00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.260
 on a flashy model filled with 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.970
 design that surpassed its predecessor 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:33.250
 wants to know more about the model 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:35.350
 evaluated so I'm less beautiful here 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.149
 available in single configuration and 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.829
 ltz full 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:43.569
 the trail blazer offered in two 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:47.079
 3.6 v6 petrol engines and 2.8 

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:49.179
 turbo diesel we tested the 2.8 both 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.760
 are equipped with automatic 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:53.679

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.870

 gps integrated fruit 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.369
 but the main novelty was 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.469
 account of an engine-driven 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.000
 diesel engine that received a 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:18.399
 plastic admission 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.740

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.960

 horses more and 3.1 m kgf of touch 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:38.939

 200 horsepower and 50.1 mkgf at 2,000 rpm 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.560

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.229
 old blazer but always remembered too 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.000
 that police car will change what 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.119
 remained for this new model was a 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.210
 part of the name and feel of the robustness 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.009
 car impose presence where light passes 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.659
 that heavy traffic is complicated 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.979
 demonstrate your comfort 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.319

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.049

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.959
 being used but rises to 878 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.940
