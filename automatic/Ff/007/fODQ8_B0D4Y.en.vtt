00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:57.340 
look but it's also going to be very
sharp<00:01:43.540> and<00:01:43.810> very<00:01:44.049> pulled<00:01:44.439> together

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.649 

now<00:01:58.220> that<00:01:58.400> we<00:01:58.490> have<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.730> liner<00:01:58.970> really<00:01:59.330> smoked

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
now that we have the liner really smoked

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.390 
now that we have the liner really smoked
out<00:01:59.900> we<00:02:00.140> are<00:02:00.350> gonna<00:02:00.470> sharpen<00:02:00.860> up<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.220> edge

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
out we are gonna sharpen up the edge

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.969 
out we are gonna sharpen up the edge
with<00:02:01.820> a<00:02:02.030> makeup<00:02:02.390> removing<00:02:02.840> wipe<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.350> this<00:02:03.740> is

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
with a makeup removing wipe and this is

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.370 
with a makeup removing wipe and this is
the<00:02:04.220> easiest<00:02:04.729> trick<00:02:05.300> ever<00:02:05.570> to<00:02:05.930> make<00:02:06.110> things

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
the easiest trick ever to make things

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.109 
the easiest trick ever to make things
look<00:02:06.560> really<00:02:06.800> pulled<00:02:07.130> together<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:07.760> sharp

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
look really pulled together and sharp

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.310 
look really pulled together and sharp
but<00:02:08.179> you<00:02:08.420> are<00:02:08.509> still<00:02:08.780> going<00:02:08.959> to<00:02:09.020> get<00:02:09.110> that

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
but you are still going to get that

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.650 
but you are still going to get that
smoked<00:02:09.679> out<00:02:09.860> effect<00:02:10.280> because<00:02:11.090> we<00:02:11.120> smudged<00:02:11.540> the

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
smoked out effect because we smudged the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.280 
smoked out effect because we smudged the
liner<00:02:11.930> so<00:02:12.050> much<00:02:12.440> on<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.770> upper<00:02:13.040> lash<00:02:13.220> line<00:02:14.290> I'd

over<00:03:13.489> curl<00:03:13.760> now<00:03:14.480> I'm<00:03:14.630> just<00:03:14.840> finishing<00:03:15.019> up<00:03:15.320> my

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
over curl now I'm just finishing up my

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.090 
over curl now I'm just finishing up my
lips<00:03:15.829> and<00:03:16.280> as<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.150> final<00:03:17.570> step<00:03:17.989> I<00:03:18.230> thought<00:03:18.560> why

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
lips and as a final step I thought why

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.180 
lips and as a final step I thought why
not<00:03:19.400> see<00:03:20.000> how<00:03:20.209> this<00:03:20.420> looks<00:03:20.690> with<00:03:21.140> some<00:03:21.530> extra

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
not see how this looks with some extra

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.130 
not see how this looks with some extra
drama<00:03:22.549> so<00:03:22.970> I<00:03:23.000> guess<00:03:23.239> technically<00:03:23.750> this<00:03:23.959> would

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
drama so I guess technically this would

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.590 
drama so I guess technically this would
be<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.470> fourth<00:03:24.829> step<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:25.519> am<00:03:25.790> taking<00:03:26.360> some

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.259 
be the fourth step I am taking some
