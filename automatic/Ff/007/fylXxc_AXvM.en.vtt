00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:07.109
 plus 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.540
 multiculturalist memory of my father 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.330
 at home, little by little he left 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.540
 turning into a holiday passion 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.730
 in Uruguay from Montevideo and I heard a noise 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.400
 for an engine that I identified that was 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.739
 and suddenly I looked out and it was a payment of 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.700
 white convertible and I said when ball 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.430
 Spain, they try to find you some 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.360
 the pagoda is a usual icon in 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.910
 our facilities 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.620
 a classic born in the 60s but they are so 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.600
 good ones that have even arrived units 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.090
 practically untouched to our days 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.770
 and that still retain that brightness and that 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.570
 Technique in good condition not with Mercedes 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.840
 then it was a bet really for 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.310
 the quality 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.350
 I think one of the greatest 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.540
 advantages that this car has is that it is 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.650
 classic enough and that you can 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.210
 use has a technology 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.739
 relatively modern to use it to 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.500
 daily so that I use the car 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.910
 practically every day 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.220
 restoration activity is a 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.229
 very complex activity needs a lot 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.300
 Honey, you need to like it and then 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.520
 you need an organization always 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.560
 dump the details and show the 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.300
 quality because we make a process that 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.900
 in his day it was industrial in a way 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.050
 totally handmade manual 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.080
 Maybe you feel the responsibility 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.970
 to keep it well from keeping an icon 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.410
 of the automotive industry as being of pagoda and 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.510
 why not try to be 50 years old 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.010
 but I do not think that even the 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.770
 engineers in their day were raised that 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.960
 a car could last 50 60 100 years 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.430
 as there are vehicles that can reach or 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.050
 that will come to have what we 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.420
 we will restore on all the difference 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.520
 is the perception of driving going to 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.100
 be a normal speed and it's feeling 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.710
 the car is a pretty philosophy 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.930
 different this car has meant to 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.270
 me be aware that something exists 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.690
 they call classic cars and get into this 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.690
 roller 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.420
 all right 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.660
 good
