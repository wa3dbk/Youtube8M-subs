so<00:00:06.350> I'm<00:00:06.410> going<00:00:06.560> to<00:00:06.620> take<00:00:06.799> passage<00:00:07.220> a<00:00:07.279> few

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.460 
so I'm going to take passage a few

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.940 
so I'm going to take passage a few
things

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:08.950 
things

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.320 
things
thake<00:00:09.950> fascinating<00:00:10.459> is<00:00:10.549> a<00:00:10.580> lot<00:00:10.700> like<00:00:10.879> fasting

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
thake fascinating is a lot like fasting

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.670 
thake fascinating is a lot like fasting
that<00:00:11.510> you're<00:00:11.660> thinning<00:00:11.959> out<00:00:12.139> one<00:00:12.350> spot

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:12.680 
that you're thinning out one spot

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.279 
that you're thinning out one spot
expanding<00:00:13.639> it<00:00:13.730> so<00:00:13.910> that<00:00:14.029> it<00:00:14.150> changes<00:00:14.510> shape<00:00:14.570> as

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
expanding it so that it changes shape as

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.980 
expanding it so that it changes shape as
it<00:00:15.350> expands<00:00:16.330> I'm<00:00:17.330> going<00:00:17.480> to<00:00:17.570> start<00:00:17.779> with<00:00:17.900> the

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
it expands I'm going to start with the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.260 
it expands I'm going to start with the
same<00:00:18.230> structure<00:00:18.830> in<00:00:19.070> the<00:00:19.160> beginning

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
same structure in the beginning

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.380 
same structure in the beginning
a<00:00:20.390> thick<00:00:20.900> wall

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.380 

even<00:00:24.080> thickness

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.160 

scrape<00:00:29.140> it<00:00:29.289> down

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
scrape it down

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.139 
scrape it down
and<00:00:31.260> then<00:00:31.830> I'm<00:00:31.920> going<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.189> change<00:00:32.970> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
and then I'm going to change the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.330 
and then I'm going to change the
thickness<00:00:33.329> for<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.110> first<00:00:34.320> one<00:00:34.559> I'm<00:00:35.100> going<00:00:35.280> to

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
thickness for the first one I'm going to

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.060 
thickness for the first one I'm going to
press<00:00:35.550> from<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.760> bottom<00:00:36.149> up<00:00:36.590> my<00:00:37.590> finger<00:00:37.860> gets

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
press from the bottom up my finger gets

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.389 
press from the bottom up my finger gets
the<00:00:38.220> inside<00:00:39.949> and<00:00:41.150> this<00:00:42.150> will<00:00:42.390> make<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:43.399> thin

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
the inside and this will make a thin

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.639 
the inside and this will make a thin
spot<00:00:44.699> where<00:00:44.850> my<00:00:44.940> finger<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.500> we'll<00:00:46.500> also

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
spot where my finger is we'll also

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.850 
spot where my finger is we'll also
create<00:00:46.890> edges<00:00:47.839> where<00:00:48.839> the<00:00:48.960> parts<00:00:49.320> where<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
create edges where the parts where the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.799 
create edges where the parts where the
rib<00:00:50.670> come<00:00:51.000> together<00:00:51.800> make<00:00:52.800> edges<00:00:53.629> I'll<00:00:54.629> push

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
rib come together make edges I'll push

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.319 
rib come together make edges I'll push
it<00:00:54.839> out

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.369 

it's<00:00:59.809> a<00:00:59.899> safer<00:01:00.320> way<00:01:00.469> to<00:01:00.879> Fassett<00:01:01.879> something

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
it's a safer way to Fassett something

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.910 
it's a safer way to Fassett something
but<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:04.010> lack<00:01:04.220> of<00:01:04.250> risk<00:01:05.619> makes<00:01:06.619> it<00:01:06.770> a<00:01:06.830> little

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
but the lack of risk makes it a little

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:24.700 
but the lack of risk makes it a little
less<00:01:07.159> interesting

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.200 

so<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:25.890> see<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.130> there's<00:01:26.460> still<00:01:26.670> facets

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
so you can see that there's still facets

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.289 
so you can see that there's still facets
they're<00:01:27.930> just<00:01:28.079> not<00:01:28.170> as<00:01:28.350> deep<00:01:28.909> then<00:01:29.909> get<00:01:30.119> pushed

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
they're just not as deep then get pushed

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.830 
they're just not as deep then get pushed
a<00:01:30.360> little<00:01:30.450> further

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.010 

by<00:01:34.740> making<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.189> thicker

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
by making it thicker

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:50.260 
by making it thicker
and<00:01:37.350> pressing<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:37.950> further

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.560 

so<00:01:50.869> same<00:01:51.110> idea<00:01:51.439> I'm<00:01:52.399> going<00:01:52.670> to<00:01:52.729> press<00:01:53.210> in<00:01:53.390> but

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
so same idea I'm going to press in but

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.899 
so same idea I'm going to press in but
I'm<00:01:53.659> going<00:01:53.810> to<00:01:53.869> do<00:01:53.990> it<00:01:54.079> a<00:01:54.140> lot<00:01:54.290> more<00:01:54.700> so<00:01:55.700> that

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
I'm going to do it a lot more so that

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.880 
I'm going to do it a lot more so that
there's<00:01:56.329> a<00:01:56.390> bigger<00:01:57.229> difference<00:01:57.500> in<00:01:57.799> the

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
there's a bigger difference in the

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.139 
there's a bigger difference in the
thickness<00:01:58.100> from<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.670> part<00:01:58.880> that's<00:01:59.060> not

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
thickness from the part that's not

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:15.870 
thickness from the part that's not
pressed<00:01:59.659> in<00:01:59.869> and<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.830> part<00:02:01.070> that<00:02:01.100> is

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.020 

so<00:02:16.420> again<00:02:16.630> press<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:17.050> out

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.430 

put<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.630> up

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:36.750 

and<00:02:25.890> give<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.070> a<00:02:26.190> shake

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.089 

so<00:02:37.239> this<00:02:37.330> is<00:02:37.480> closer<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.840> faceting<00:02:38.409> but<00:02:38.980> it

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
so this is closer to faceting but it

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.600 
so this is closer to faceting but it
still<00:02:39.430> misses<00:02:40.209> a<00:02:40.239> little<00:02:40.599> bit<00:02:40.720> of<00:02:40.810> that<00:02:40.959> that

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
still misses a little bit of that that

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:49.170 
still misses a little bit of that that
shape

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.410 

it's<00:02:49.629> another<00:02:49.840> way<00:02:49.989> that's<00:02:50.140> not<00:02:50.379> linear<00:02:51.420> to

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
it's another way that's not linear to

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.259 
it's another way that's not linear to
make<00:02:52.569> a<00:02:52.599> facet<00:02:53.760> I'm<00:02:54.760> gonna<00:02:54.909> start<00:02:55.090> by<00:02:55.239> making

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
make a facet I'm gonna start by making

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.319 
make a facet I'm gonna start by making
the<00:02:55.900> same<00:02:56.319> kind<00:02:56.680> of<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:57.370> wall<00:02:57.579> isn't<00:02:58.120> gonna

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
the same kind of the wall isn't gonna

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.670 
the same kind of the wall isn't gonna
wall

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.839 

I'm<00:03:01.069> gonna<00:03:01.250> make<00:03:01.400> it<00:03:01.549> a<00:03:01.790> little<00:03:02.390> bit<00:03:02.569> thinner

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
I'm gonna make it a little bit thinner

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.649 
I'm gonna make it a little bit thinner
I'm<00:03:04.849> going<00:03:05.030> to<00:03:05.090> push<00:03:05.299> in<00:03:05.920> dents<00:03:07.450> almost<00:03:08.450> like

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:08.659 
I'm going to push in dents almost like

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:13.830 
I'm going to push in dents almost like
polka<00:03:08.900> dots<00:03:09.170> on<00:03:10.129> the<00:03:10.670> outside

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.080 

you<00:03:14.840> take<00:03:15.019> my<00:03:15.110> finger<00:03:15.550> I'm<00:03:16.550> gonna<00:03:16.700> press<00:03:16.879> send

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
you take my finger I'm gonna press send

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.600 
you take my finger I'm gonna press send
I<00:03:17.120> don't<00:03:17.239> want<00:03:17.360> to<00:03:17.420> get<00:03:17.510> too<00:03:17.629> close<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.110> top

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
I don't want to get too close to the top

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:30.500 
I don't want to get too close to the top
because<00:03:19.610> it'll<00:03:19.819> rip

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.330 

and<00:03:30.989> these<00:03:31.080> polka<00:03:31.349> dots<00:03:31.590> are<00:03:31.769> much<00:03:31.920> thinner

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
and these polka dots are much thinner

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.850 
and these polka dots are much thinner
than<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:33.780> rest<00:03:33.959> of<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.170> claims<00:03:34.379> I'm<00:03:34.560> pressing

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
than the rest of the claims I'm pressing

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.699 
than the rest of the claims I'm pressing
on<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.040> inside<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.549> outside

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
on the inside and the outside

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.170 
on the inside and the outside
it<00:03:37.709> would<00:03:37.830> be<00:03:37.920> like<00:03:38.040> faceting<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.730> inside<00:03:39.030> and

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
it would be like faceting the inside and

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.899 
it would be like faceting the inside and
outside<00:03:39.299> of<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.659> pop<00:03:40.580> just<00:03:41.580> going<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.760> stretch

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
outside of the pop just going to stretch

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.220 
outside of the pop just going to stretch
it<00:03:42.060> out

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:57.120 

I'm<00:03:45.590> gonna<00:03:45.769> give<00:03:45.920> it<00:03:46.010> shape

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.890 

on<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:57.730> outside

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
on the outside

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.990 
on the outside
you<00:04:00.439> can<00:04:00.560> see<00:04:00.650> that<00:04:00.769> the<00:04:00.890> dots<00:04:01.099> have<00:04:01.640> stretched

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
you can see that the dots have stretched

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.770 
you can see that the dots have stretched
and<00:04:02.239> moved

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
and moved

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.420 
and moved
and<00:04:03.870> there'll<00:04:04.470> be<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.620> lot<00:04:04.770> thinner<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.400> can

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
and there'll be a lot thinner you can

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.910 
and there'll be a lot thinner you can
see<00:04:05.610> how<00:04:05.670> thin<00:04:05.940> they<00:04:06.060> are<00:04:06.319> when<00:04:07.319> it<00:04:07.500> gets<00:04:07.650> fired

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
see how thin they are when it gets fired

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.070 
see how thin they are when it gets fired
you'll<00:04:08.220> be<00:04:08.310> able<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.520> see<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:09.660> light<00:04:09.870> through

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
you'll be able to see the light through

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.980 
you'll be able to see the light through
it<00:04:10.170> because<00:04:10.590> of<00:04:10.740> course
