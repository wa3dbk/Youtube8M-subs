to being the smaller and six being the
larger<00:00:37.800> hook<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:40.140> reason<00:00:40.530> why<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.710> do<00:00:41.010> like

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:41.519 
larger hook the reason why I do like

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:44.329 
larger hook the reason why I do like
this<00:00:41.760> design<00:00:42.269> is<00:00:42.660> because<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.650> designed

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
this design is because it is designed

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:48.500 
this design is because it is designed
for<00:00:45.080> live<00:00:46.080> bait<00:00:46.460> if<00:00:47.460> you're<00:00:47.790> hooking<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.330> in

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
for live bait if you're hooking it in

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.119 
for live bait if you're hooking it in
the<00:00:49.260> mouth<00:00:49.879> it's<00:00:50.879> going<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.239> set<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.620> mouth<00:00:52.860> in

the mouth it's going to set the mouth in

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.820 
the mouth it's going to set the mouth in
right<00:00:53.339> here<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:55.049> hook<00:00:55.290> lays<00:00:55.530> down<00:00:55.769> a

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
right here and the hook lays down a

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.920 
right here and the hook lays down a
little<00:00:56.159> bit<00:00:56.339> more<00:00:56.549> flat<00:00:56.970> so<00:00:57.330> it<00:00:57.449> doesn't<00:00:57.750> pick

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
little bit more flat so it doesn't pick

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.060 
little bit more flat so it doesn't pick
up<00:00:57.960> debris<00:00:58.290> when<00:00:59.129> you're<00:00:59.280> using<00:00:59.460> current<00:01:01.070> also

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
up debris when you're using current also

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.270 
up debris when you're using current also
in<00:01:02.489> my<00:01:02.640> opinion<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.330> sits<00:01:04.049> really<00:01:04.290> nicely<00:01:04.440> when

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
in my opinion it sits really nicely when

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.450 
in my opinion it sits really nicely when
you<00:01:05.369> hook<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.880> back<00:01:07.310> right<00:01:08.310> here

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.730 

versus<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.790> circle<00:01:12.420> hook<00:01:12.570> or<00:01:13.439> like<00:01:13.590> an

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
versus the the circle hook or like an

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.080 
versus the the circle hook or like an
octopus<00:01:14.220> hook

better<00:02:32.549> leaders<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.180> don't<00:02:33.359> like<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:34.700> movement

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
better leaders I don't like the movement

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.780 
better leaders I don't like the movement
of<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:35.970> leader<00:02:36.829> it's<00:02:37.829> not<00:02:38.040> quite<00:02:38.250> as<00:02:38.370> natural

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
of the leader it's not quite as natural

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.879 
of the leader it's not quite as natural
and<00:02:38.849> plus<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.209> personally<00:02:39.690> think<00:02:39.900> it's<00:02:40.829> a

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:40.889 
and plus I personally think it's a

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.950 
and plus I personally think it's a
little<00:02:40.980> bit<00:02:41.130> more<00:02:41.370> visible<00:02:41.910> than

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
little bit more visible than

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.729

the line i'm using this is a 50-pound

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.380 
the line i'm using this is a 50-pound
test<00:02:51.810> braided<00:02:52.349> line<00:02:52.590> powerpro

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.470 

I<00:02:57.590> like<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.830> braided<00:02:59.460> line<00:02:59.730> because<00:03:00.150> it's

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
I like the braided line because it's

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.620 
I like the braided line because it's
let's<00:03:00.750> stretch<00:03:01.370> get<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.400> nice<00:03:02.640> hook<00:03:02.880> set<00:03:03.209> it's<00:03:03.540> a

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
let's stretch get a nice hook set it's a

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:11.940 
let's stretch get a nice hook set it's a
little<00:03:03.840> tougher<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.670> monofilament

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.470 

so<00:03:12.550> now<00:03:12.730> you<00:03:12.790> have<00:03:13.200> just<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.260> little<00:03:14.290> bit<00:03:15.480> more

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
so now you have just a little bit more

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.390 
so now you have just a little bit more
leeway

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
leeway

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.130 
leeway
now<00:03:18.849> that<00:03:19.090> i<00:03:19.150> have<00:03:19.329> that<00:03:20.220> hook<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.340> up<00:03:21.459> to<00:03:21.489> a<00:03:22.140> to

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
now that i have that hook it up to a to

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.330 
now that i have that hook it up to a to
a<00:03:23.549> swivel<00:03:26.579> most<00:03:27.579> people<00:03:27.879> might<00:03:28.329> argue<00:03:28.360> that

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
a swivel most people might argue that

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:37.970 
a swivel most people might argue that
that<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:33.519> less<00:03:33.849> connections<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:35.769> better<00:03:36.010> i

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
that the less connections the better i

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.050 
that the less connections the better i
agree<00:03:38.980> with<00:03:39.010> that<00:03:39.989> but<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:42.790> know<00:03:42.819> obviously

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
agree with that but you know obviously

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.929 
agree with that but you know obviously
there's<00:03:43.569> less<00:03:44.470> places<00:03:44.739> for<00:03:45.370> it<00:03:45.579> to<00:03:45.730> go<00:03:45.879> wrong

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:47.939 
there's less places for it to go wrong

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:54.270 
there's less places for it to go wrong
although<00:03:48.939> if<00:03:49.239> you're<00:03:49.569> using<00:03:51.209> good<00:03:53.280> equipment

although if you're using good equipment
i<00:03:54.790> guess<00:03:55.540> you<00:03:55.629> could<00:03:55.720> say<00:03:55.930> good

you're using the drag correctly you

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.170 
you're using the drag correctly you

believe if you lose a fish using

believe if you lose a fish using
50-pound<00:04:11.100> test<00:04:11.930> it's<00:04:12.930> not<00:04:13.920> going<00:04:14.070> to<00:04:14.160> be<00:04:14.430> the

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
going to go with a Carolina rig so since

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.610 
going to go with a Carolina rig so since
we're<00:04:31.950> in<00:04:32.160> a<00:04:32.280> calm<00:04:32.520> lake<00:04:32.880> I<00:04:33.180> could<00:04:33.630> use<00:04:33.900> a<00:04:34.200> just

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
we're in a calm lake I could use a just

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.910 
we're in a calm lake I could use a just
regular<00:04:37.400> wait<00:04:38.400> slip<00:04:39.030> wait

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.350 

now<00:04:42.520> if<00:04:42.820> you<00:04:43.060> were<00:04:43.210> going<00:04:43.630> to<00:04:43.660> be<00:04:44.260> in<00:04:45.360> rough

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
now if you were going to be in rough

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.400 
now if you were going to be in rough
waters<00:04:46.810> I<00:04:46.990> would<00:04:47.170> definitely<00:04:47.320> use<00:04:47.590> a<00:04:48.100> non-slip

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
waters I would definitely use a non-slip

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:55.830 
waters I would definitely use a non-slip
non-role<00:04:50.410> wait<00:04:53.220> now<00:04:54.220> you<00:04:54.370> take<00:04:54.790> a<00:04:55.060> bead<00:04:55.570> and

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
non-role wait now you take a bead and

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.670 
non-role wait now you take a bead and
the<00:04:56.380> bead<00:04:56.620> is<00:04:56.800> going<00:04:56.980> to<00:04:57.040> basically<00:04:57.460> protect

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
the bead is going to basically protect

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.670 
the bead is going to basically protect
the<00:05:00.300> not<00:05:01.300> from<00:05:01.840> getting<00:05:02.110> bashed<00:05:02.320> by<00:05:02.650> the

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
the not from getting bashed by the

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.220 
the not from getting bashed by the
weight<00:05:03.240> this<00:05:04.240> is<00:05:04.450> definitely<00:05:04.930> the<00:05:05.050> best

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
weight this is definitely the best

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.550 
weight this is definitely the best
catfish<00:05:05.830> and<00:05:06.330> what<00:05:07.330> I'm<00:05:07.450> going<00:05:07.480> for<00:05:07.780> today<00:05:08.230> is

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
catfish and what I'm going for today is
