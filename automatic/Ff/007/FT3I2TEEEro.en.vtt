better<00:00:32.930> so<00:00:33.469> I<00:00:33.800> studied<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:34.460> game<00:00:34.670> real<00:00:34.969> hard

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
better so I studied the game real hard

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.270 
better so I studied the game real hard
and<00:00:35.539> I<00:00:35.690> tried<00:00:35.989> to<00:00:36.020> figure<00:00:36.320> out<00:00:36.590> the<00:00:36.800> best<00:00:37.070> way
