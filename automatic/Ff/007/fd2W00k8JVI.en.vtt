and like I said I feel strong I feel
good<00:02:21.020> so<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:22.150> part<00:02:23.150> of<00:02:23.330> that<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:23.720> know<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:23.900> think

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
good so a part of that you know I think

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.760 
good so a part of that you know I think
been<00:02:25.190> long<00:02:25.370> enough<00:02:25.640> in<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.850> game<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.360> I<00:02:27.020> was

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
been long enough in a game and I was

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.190 
been long enough in a game and I was
last<00:02:28.220> week<00:02:28.310> watching<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.940> game<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.630> see<00:02:30.170> I

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
last week watching the game and I see I

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.250 
last week watching the game and I see I
see<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.650> score<00:02:30.920> then<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.430> team<00:02:31.670> done<00:02:32.000> well

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
see the score then the team done well

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.440 
see the score then the team done well
but<00:02:33.260> we've<00:02:33.650> got<00:02:33.800> young<00:02:33.980> squad<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:34.910> think

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
but we've got young squad and I think

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.850 
but we've got young squad and I think
they<00:02:35.600> need<00:02:35.780> Libby<00:02:36.080> help<00:02:36.320> and<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:36.620> don't<00:02:36.680> think

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
they need Libby help and I don't think

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.720 
they need Libby help and I don't think
it<00:02:37.040> will<00:02:37.100> do<00:02:37.250> any<00:02:37.370> harm

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
it will do any harm

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.430 
it will do any harm

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
of an Edinburgh da because obviously I

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.510 
of an Edinburgh da because obviously I
