00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:03.679
 hello good morning 13 and 30 degrees 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.759
 the companies we all know the neighborhood organizations 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:09.599
 if that is the way 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.740
 because although it wants to be better still to change because it is not doing so well 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.679
 to get better 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.349
 they knew why they are renovating 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.749
 they change by practice they will not sell 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:23.550
 also to activate markets by offering apple products 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.300
 The pipe area are 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.399
 cleveland 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.429
 the changes continue 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.110
 the companies in addition will go through the pictures of people 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.190
 because certainly with the changes 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.890
 kan strategy vision changes tmg people management 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.410
 carmen too many times 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.070
 the dozens of people 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.320
 already in September they check people with other areas the island the things the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.620
 group companies 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.719
 in some cases 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.890
 faithful to organizations 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.890
 I think one thing is that it's vital when these changes 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.100
 that we have already seen 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.100
 jmg can not be rejected because 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.280
 The clinging to a status has meant that one has been seen mainly 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.660
 common enemy of change 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.570
 I put it to 1m blacklists that 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.080
 quintana brakes we do not want to enter 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.080
 int but here the silver question key is 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.950
 in the face of any change 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.040
 my life my with a strategic resource of the company 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.890
 what to say 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.689
 and I'm on the white list 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.920
 mejía list of those people who whatever happens I want to remove 9 asik 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.399
 and cleaning that no matter what happens he feels happy and cited to follow 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.399
 contributing that I go as I go as your boss 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.450
 eye eye and the company can continue to count on the services workers 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.160
 and employees of executive professionals 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.610
 this manager 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.659
 yes christ 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.850
 many times it's a life decision it's career mention 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:52.860
 many people 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.620
 they do not take by themselves 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.970
 1-1 messi is the best strategic resource 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.659
 I want you to be a champion propose proposing is that as I said holy 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.509
 is able to generate is not enough to say it 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.429
 but that very important first step 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.719
 it is in this to consider oneself 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:11.670
 what to be 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.029
 the right arm the boss as an expression to be desired by the neighbor gecp 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:19.180
 you have to think which the boss needs 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.080
 to be able to work well today that the organization needs as I said to 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.899
 to be able to do things well 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:28.529
 today be the bugle team the key member of the team 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:30.919
 efe josé latasa so valued 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.079
 the other areas of the organization 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.789
 that position is very much security 

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:39.500
 us that takes the level of employability very much and in the end 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.729
 I saw what it takes is certainly 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:43.280
 added what you have to add 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.379
 stay current and competitive 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.590
 wake up the skills that are required to have but I would prefer to say 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.019
 fundamentally 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.300
 it's a personal decision and even more so it's 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.989
 and without attitude 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.169
 You already know what 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.169
 p heard me say before this block and many times this 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.659
 can 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.389
 one can not walk the face that has 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:06.129
 well the face that puts 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.430
 the strategic resource operation the theme of the attitude is that one assumes 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.049
 in the face of its role in the company in the face of its role of service and collaboration 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.449
 centers work teams the organization in general 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:19.100
 your boss and your collaborators 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.919
 current angels 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.009

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:26.009
 yes someone who is a strategic resource to return 

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:28.889
 highly employ 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.359
 that therefore has the ability to better manage your career of managing your 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.509
 options between the company 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:36.780
 if it is the case 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.110
 to manage good options quickly sources 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:41.519
 then to 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:42.439
 discouragement 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:45.210
 to think do it to decide if they want 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.490
 and still does not do so seriously 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.679
 a strategic resource when inviting companies 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:52.589
