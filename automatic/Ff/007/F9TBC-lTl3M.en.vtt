it's added right there like I said and
you<00:04:04.610> put<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:04.970> name<00:04:05.120> servers<00:04:05.570> in<00:04:05.780> for<00:04:06.050> the

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
you put the name servers in for the

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.430 
you put the name servers in for the
domain<00:04:06.470> on<00:04:06.740> your<00:04:07.040> domain<00:04:07.910> service<00:04:08.440> then

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
domain on your domain service then

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.960 
domain on your domain service then
you're<00:04:09.590> all<00:04:09.709> set<00:04:09.739> the<00:04:10.250> only<00:04:10.459> thing<00:04:10.700> is<00:04:10.850> that

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
you're all set the only thing is that

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.000 
you're all set the only thing is that

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
you're going to need to wait up to 72

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.010 
you're going to need to wait up to 72
hours<00:04:13.040> actually<00:04:13.640> for<00:04:14.090> it<00:04:14.150> to<00:04:14.239> take<00:04:14.420> complete

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
hours actually for it to take complete

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.050 
hours actually for it to take complete
effect<00:04:15.380> there's<00:04:16.010> something<00:04:16.370> called<00:04:16.520> DNS

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
effect there's something called DNS

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.720 
effect there's something called DNS
propagation<00:04:17.959> which<00:04:18.590> is<00:04:18.770> where<00:04:19.010> you<00:04:19.609> know

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
you're in the United States no other

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.010 
you're in the United States no other
side<00:04:44.520> of<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.669> world<00:04:44.850> is<00:04:45.330> probably<00:04:45.570> going<00:04:45.960> to

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
side of the world is probably going to

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.320 
side of the world is probably going to
take<00:04:46.230> longer<00:04:46.590> but<00:04:47.100> that's<00:04:47.610> not<00:04:47.850> a<00:04:47.880> huge<00:04:48.150> big

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
take longer but that's not a huge big

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.760 
take longer but that's not a huge big
deal<00:04:48.360> but<00:04:48.600> as<00:04:48.720> soon<00:04:48.930> as<00:04:49.110> you<00:04:49.320> can<00:04:49.440> see<00:04:49.680> the

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
deal but as soon as you can see the

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.320 
deal but as soon as you can see the
domain<00:04:50.070> you<00:04:50.190> can<00:04:50.250> get<00:04:50.490> ready<00:04:50.639> to<00:04:50.790> work<00:04:50.970> on<00:04:51.180> it

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
domain you can get ready to work on it

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.950 
domain you can get ready to work on it
it's<00:04:51.960> pretty<00:04:52.410> easy<00:04:52.470> and<00:04:53.750> this<00:04:54.750> of<00:04:54.930> course

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
it's pretty easy and this of course

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.290 
it's pretty easy and this of course
works<00:04:55.440> for<00:04:55.680> not<00:04:55.800> only<00:04:55.950> comm<00:04:56.550> domains<00:04:56.940> but<00:04:57.120> any

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
works for not only comm domains but any

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.200 
works for not only comm domains but any
type<00:04:57.540> of<00:04:57.690> domain<00:04:57.870> including<00:04:58.500> code<00:04:58.770> cc<00:04:59.430> if<00:04:59.700> you

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
type of domain including code cc if you

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.320 
type of domain including code cc if you
use<00:05:00.389> the<00:05:00.630> DNS<00:05:01.050> way<00:05:01.560> instead<00:05:01.950> of<00:05:02.070> the

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
use the DNS way instead of the

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.480 
use the DNS way instead of the
forwarding<00:05:03.330> way<00:05:03.860> so<00:05:04.860> there<00:05:05.010> you<00:05:05.130> go<00:05:05.280> that's

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490
