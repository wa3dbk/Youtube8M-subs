think that would be too light although I

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.930 
think that would be too light although I
wasn't<00:00:40.500> really<00:00:40.620> able<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.070> test<00:00:41.340> out<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.700> shade

cream<00:02:25.450> just<00:02:25.840> my<00:02:26.230> thoughts<00:02:26.530> on<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.830> products<00:02:27.250> I

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
cream just my thoughts on the products I

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.610 
cream just my thoughts on the products I
don't<00:02:27.549> really<00:02:27.730> think<00:02:27.819> that<00:02:28.209> it<00:02:28.569> is<00:02:28.840> worth

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
don't really think that it is worth

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.699 
don't really think that it is worth
buying<00:02:30.040> at<00:02:30.400> all<00:02:30.670> given<00:02:31.540> my<00:02:31.959> skin<00:02:32.230> type<00:02:32.440> I

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
buying at all given my skin type I

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.490 
buying at all given my skin type I
wouldn't<00:02:33.100> really<00:02:33.280> waste<00:02:34.030> my<00:02:34.299> money<00:02:34.500> buying

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
wouldn't really waste my money buying

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.710 
wouldn't really waste my money buying
another<00:02:36.040> vital<00:02:36.549> glow<00:02:36.700> BB<00:02:36.880> cream<00:02:37.180> just<00:02:37.360> because

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
another vital glow BB cream just because

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.720 
another vital glow BB cream just because
it<00:02:37.870> doesn't<00:02:38.230> really<00:02:38.380> give<00:02:38.620> me<00:02:38.950> that<00:02:39.489> any

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
it doesn't really give me that any

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.160 
it doesn't really give me that any
coverage<00:02:40.209> so<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.630> doesn't<00:02:40.900> give<00:02:40.989> me<00:02:41.019> any

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
coverage so it doesn't give me any

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.830 
coverage so it doesn't give me any
coverage<00:02:41.739> at<00:02:42.010> all<00:02:42.280> just<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.090> tiny<00:02:43.360> tiny<00:02:43.660> amount

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
coverage at all just a tiny tiny amount

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.710 
coverage at all just a tiny tiny amount
just<00:02:44.380> a<00:02:44.440> very<00:02:44.680> sheer<00:02:45.120> coverage<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:46.390> I<00:02:46.540> don't

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
just a very sheer coverage and I don't

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.030 
just a very sheer coverage and I don't
really<00:02:46.930> think<00:02:47.109> that<00:02:47.230> I<00:02:47.320> would<00:02:47.620> wear<00:02:47.769> this

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
really think that I would wear this

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.949 
really think that I would wear this
during<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.489> summer<00:02:48.670> because<00:02:49.150> it's<00:02:49.329> very<00:02:49.600> very

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
during the summer because it's very very

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.470 
during the summer because it's very very
hot<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.500> I<00:02:51.130> don't<00:02:51.160> really<00:02:51.670> like<00:02:52.030> that<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.450> has

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
hot and I don't really like that it has

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.009 
hot and I don't really like that it has
like<00:02:52.989> like<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.130> shimmery<00:02:54.630> particles<00:02:55.630> because

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
like like the shimmery particles because

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.930 
like like the shimmery particles because
I<00:02:56.049> don't<00:02:56.380> like<00:02:56.530> that<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.920> also<00:02:57.340> think<00:02:57.670> that<00:02:57.760> this

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
I don't like that I also think that this

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.030 
I don't like that I also think that this
product<00:02:58.420> would<00:02:58.510> only<00:02:58.780> work<00:02:59.200> on<00:02:59.380> people<00:02:59.799> with

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
product would only work on people with

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.670 
product would only work on people with
really<00:03:00.459> really<00:03:00.910> beautiful<00:03:01.390> skin<00:03:02.140> texture<00:03:02.650> and

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
really really beautiful skin texture and

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.069 
really really beautiful skin texture and
skin<00:03:03.160> type<00:03:03.459> because<00:03:04.359> they<00:03:04.480> wouldn't<00:03:04.870> really

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
skin type because they wouldn't really

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.170 
skin type because they wouldn't really
need<00:03:05.410> that<00:03:05.709> much<00:03:05.950> coverage<00:03:06.220> any<00:03:06.670> more<00:03:06.940> so<00:03:07.150> I

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
need that much coverage any more so I

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.690 
need that much coverage any more so I
think<00:03:07.299> that<00:03:07.600> would<00:03:07.870> fit<00:03:08.709> people<00:03:09.220> with<00:03:09.400> normal

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
think that would fit people with normal

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.900 
think that would fit people with normal
or<00:03:10.209> very<00:03:10.959> perfect<00:03:11.470> skin<00:03:11.799> now<00:03:12.310> with<00:03:12.489> regards<00:03:12.880> to

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
or very perfect skin now with regards to

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.120 
or very perfect skin now with regards to
the<00:03:12.970> shade<00:03:13.269> I<00:03:13.450> have<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.750> one<00:03:13.900> in<00:03:14.019> beige<00:03:14.320> and<00:03:14.709> if

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
the shade I have the one in beige and if

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.009 
the shade I have the one in beige and if
you<00:03:15.310> saw<00:03:15.519> in<00:03:15.609> the<00:03:15.670> demo<00:03:15.790> video<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:16.570> kind<00:03:16.900> of

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
you saw in the demo video it kind of

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.660 
you saw in the demo video it kind of
matched<00:03:17.230> my<00:03:17.500> skin<00:03:17.769> tone<00:03:17.950> so<00:03:18.010> there's<00:03:18.370> nothing

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
matched my skin tone so there's nothing

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.699 
matched my skin tone so there's nothing
wrong<00:03:18.820> with<00:03:19.030> that<00:03:19.180> it<00:03:19.450> doesn't<00:03:20.049> look<00:03:20.200> too<00:03:20.410> pale

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
wrong with that it doesn't look too pale

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.160 
wrong with that it doesn't look too pale
or<00:03:20.980> too<00:03:21.220> dark<00:03:21.430> on<00:03:21.579> my<00:03:21.790> skin<00:03:22.060> tone<00:03:22.269> I<00:03:22.540> don't<00:03:22.750> like

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
or too dark on my skin tone I don't like

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.069

that this BB cream has a very sticky

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.630 
that this BB cream has a very sticky
finish<00:03:26.079> or<00:03:26.290> sticky<00:03:26.620> feel<00:03:26.950> after<00:03:27.459> the

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
throwing it away because I'm gonna use

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.610

it<00:03:45.220> as<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.730> lotion<00:03:46.209> because<00:03:46.690> it<00:03:47.079> has<00:03:47.319> that

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
it as a lotion because it has that

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.729
