00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
loop on the screen you can actually trim

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.309 
loop on the screen you can actually trim
the<00:02:34.660> loop<00:02:34.810> out

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.369 

you<00:02:40.890> can<00:02:41.040> trim<00:02:41.219> the<00:02:41.610> loop<00:02:41.790> in<00:02:42.110> just<00:02:43.110> by<00:02:43.230> moving

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
you can trim the loop in just by moving

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.479 
you can trim the loop in just by moving
the<00:02:43.590> jog<00:02:43.769> wheel<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:46.590> then<00:02:46.769> reduce<00:02:47.099> gets<00:02:47.340> you

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
the jog wheel and then reduce gets you

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.360 
the jog wheel and then reduce gets you
out<00:02:47.640> of<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.760> loop

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.370 

step<00:02:52.370> back<00:02:52.520> down<00:02:52.760> again<00:02:53.000> so<00:02:53.540> controls<00:02:54.290> you

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
step back down again so controls you

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.650 
step back down again so controls you

can see is that twisted goes from one a

00:03:48.290 --> 00:04:07.540 
can see is that twisted goes from one a

you<00:04:40.979> have<00:04:41.129> Necco<00:04:41.519> now<00:04:42.089> a<00:04:42.860> question<00:04:43.860> that<00:04:43.979> I

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
you have Necco now a question that I

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:45.739 
you have Necco now a question that I
know<00:04:44.099> we're<00:04:44.279> going<00:04:44.399> to<00:04:44.459> get<00:04:44.610> is<00:04:45.029> does<00:04:45.539> it<00:04:45.659> do

00:04:45.739 --> 00:04:45.749 
know we're going to get is does it do

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:47.209 
know we're going to get is does it do
post-fader<00:04:46.229> effects<00:04:46.619> and<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:46.889> answer<00:04:47.099> that

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:47.219 
post-fader effects and the answer that

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:49.549 
post-fader effects and the answer that
question<00:04:47.369> is<00:04:47.759> no<00:04:47.939> it<00:04:48.089> does<00:04:48.119> not<00:04:48.419> but<00:04:49.229> we<00:04:49.469> were

00:04:49.549 --> 00:04:49.559 
question is no it does not but we were

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:50.959 
question is no it does not but we were
tinkering<00:04:49.800> with<00:04:49.949> it<00:04:50.159> earlier<00:04:50.279> and<00:04:50.610> Kevin<00:04:50.879> I

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:50.969 
tinkering with it earlier and Kevin I

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:52.429 
tinkering with it earlier and Kevin I
actually<00:04:51.149> came<00:04:51.419> up<00:04:51.569> with<00:04:51.659> a<00:04:51.689> way<00:04:51.869> that<00:04:51.899> you<00:04:52.199> can

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:52.439 
actually came up with a way that you can

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:55.489 
actually came up with a way that you can
do<00:04:52.769> an<00:04:53.009> echo<00:04:53.339> phase<00:04:53.629> with<00:04:54.629> the<00:04:54.779> next<00:04:55.050> step<00:04:55.229> and

00:04:55.489 --> 00:04:55.499 
do an echo phase with the next step and

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:59.719 
do an echo phase with the next step and
using<00:04:56.069> the<00:04:56.159> DJ<00:04:56.429> intro<00:04:56.550> software<00:04:57.119> so<00:04:58.729> you've

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
using the DJ intro software so you've

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.779 
using the DJ intro software so you've
got<00:04:59.879> your<00:05:00.089> wet<00:05:00.509> fader<00:05:00.809> all<00:05:01.319> the<00:05:01.499> way<00:05:01.619> up<00:05:01.789> and

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
got your wet fader all the way up and

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:05.239 
got your wet fader all the way up and
the<00:05:02.939> effect<00:05:03.209> is<00:05:03.389> disengaged<00:05:03.949> and<00:05:04.949> these<00:05:05.099> here

00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:05.249 
the effect is disengaged and these here

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:06.769 
the effect is disengaged and these here
on<00:05:05.339> the<00:05:05.429> screen<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.789> beat<00:05:05.939> multiplier<00:05:06.449> said

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:06.779 
on the screen the beat multiplier said

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:08.329 
on the screen the beat multiplier said
for<00:05:06.989> one<00:05:07.169> to<00:05:07.259> one<00:05:07.409> so<00:05:07.589> it'll<00:05:07.709> just<00:05:07.860> be<00:05:07.979> a<00:05:08.069> one

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:08.339 
for one to one so it'll just be a one

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:10.730 
for one to one so it'll just be a one
count

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.550 

one<00:05:10.889> counter

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:26.230 

see<00:05:16.560> if<00:05:16.620> we<00:05:16.680> can<00:05:16.830> do<00:05:16.920> this

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.670 

so<00:05:27.240> it's<00:05:27.480> kind<00:05:27.720> of<00:05:27.780> sensitive<00:05:28.170> you<00:05:28.260> can't<00:05:28.500> move

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
so it's kind of sensitive you can't move

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.440 
so it's kind of sensitive you can't move
your<00:05:28.860> finger<00:05:29.250> on<00:05:29.460> the<00:05:29.700> jogwheel<00:05:29.910> because<00:05:30.360> you

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
your finger on the jogwheel because you

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.720 
your finger on the jogwheel because you
hear<00:05:30.600> that<00:05:30.720> little<00:05:30.840> tear<00:05:31.200> but<00:05:31.410> it's<00:05:31.639> it's<00:05:32.639> a

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
hear that little tear but it's it's a

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.220

really<00:05:32.970> sensitive<00:05:33.300> jogwheel<00:05:33.630> so<00:05:33.990> you<00:05:34.080> don't

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
really sensitive jogwheel so you don't

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.320 
really sensitive jogwheel so you don't
have<00:05:34.320> to<00:05:34.410> push<00:05:35.370> on<00:05:35.520> too<00:05:35.580> much<00:05:35.730> it<00:05:35.910> on<00:05:35.970> if<00:05:36.210> you

have to push on too much it on if you
push<00:05:36.480> towards<00:05:36.750> the<00:05:36.780> center<00:05:37.110> just<00:05:37.680> move<00:05:37.919> it

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
push towards the center just move it

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.530 
push towards the center just move it
around<00:05:38.160> too<00:05:38.490> much<00:05:38.669> so<00:05:38.970> you<00:05:39.000> can<00:05:39.270> do<00:05:39.360> nice
