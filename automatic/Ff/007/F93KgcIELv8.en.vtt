00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
pretty sticky it's pretty thick so I you

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.400 
pretty sticky it's pretty thick so I you
know<00:00:50.460> sometimes<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.690> good<00:00:51.899> for<00:00:52.140> staying

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.229 
know sometimes it's good for staying
powder<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:52.949> sometimes<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.399> know<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.520> flick<00:00:54.059> my

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239

hair<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:55.230> know<00:00:55.260> something<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.829> gets

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
hair you know something it gets

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.580 
hair you know something it gets
continent<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.629> just<00:00:57.899> can<00:00:58.050> feel<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.289> little

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
continent and it just can feel a little

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.400 
continent and it just can feel a little
you<00:00:58.980> know<00:00:59.039> thick<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.359> thought<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:00.989> would<00:01:01.260> look

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
you know thick so I thought I would look

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.349 
you know thick so I thought I would look
for<00:01:01.710> something<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.370> maybe<00:01:02.520> had<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:03.239> know

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
for something that maybe had you know

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.509 
for something that maybe had you know
still<00:01:03.629> had<00:01:03.750> good<00:01:03.899> stain<00:01:04.260> powder<00:01:04.650> but<00:01:05.309> maybe

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
still had good stain powder but maybe

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.500 
still had good stain powder but maybe
was<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.090> little<00:01:06.420> bit<00:01:06.570> less<00:01:07.040> sticky<00:01:08.060> so<00:01:09.060> I

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
was a little bit less sticky so I

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.399 
was a little bit less sticky so I
thought<00:01:09.900> I'd<00:01:10.020> give<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> Dior<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.710> try<00:01:12.320> when<00:01:13.320> you

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
thought I'd give the Dior a try when you

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.039 
thought I'd give the Dior a try when you
look<00:01:13.619> at<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> two<00:01:14.070> colors<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.479> bottles

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
look at the two colors in the bottles

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.359 
look at the two colors in the bottles
the<00:01:17.420> you<00:01:18.420> know<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.530> Mac<00:01:19.860> looks<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.220> little

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
the you know the the Mac looks a little

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.560 
the you know the the Mac looks a little
bit<00:01:20.610> lighter<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:22.470> Mac<00:01:23.430> also<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:24.420> can

bit lighter and the Mac also you can

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.440 
bit lighter and the Mac also you can
definitely<00:01:24.780> see<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.259> shimmer<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.700> Dior

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.210 
looks
on<00:02:13.849> so<00:02:14.849> I<00:02:17.090> think<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.540> they<00:02:19.440> are<00:02:19.769> both<00:02:20.010> really

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
on so I think that they are both really

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.790 
on so I think that they are both really
pretty<00:02:20.519> colors<00:02:20.910> but<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:21.750> think<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.769> the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
pretty colors but I think that the the

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.009 
pretty colors but I think that the the
nice<00:02:23.580> thing<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.000> Mack<00:02:24.209> is<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.750> that

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
nice thing of the Mack is is that

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.000 
nice thing of the Mack is is that
probably<00:02:25.290> wouldn't<00:02:25.730> color<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:27.330> know<00:02:28.010> your

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
probably wouldn't color you know your

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.220 
probably wouldn't color you know your
lips<00:02:29.310> as<00:02:29.519> much<00:02:29.849> it's<00:02:30.480> not<00:02:30.599> gonna<00:02:30.720> change<00:02:31.019> the

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
lips as much it's not gonna change the

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.990 
lips as much it's not gonna change the
color<00:02:31.379> of<00:02:31.530> your<00:02:31.620> lipstick<00:02:32.099> leave<00:02:32.730> me<00:02:32.849> more

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
color of your lipstick leave me more

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.580 
color of your lipstick leave me more
neutral<00:02:33.450> but<00:02:33.989> if<00:02:34.019> you're<00:02:34.200> wanting<00:02:34.379> something

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
neutral but if you're wanting something

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.080 
neutral but if you're wanting something
that's<00:02:34.860> gonna<00:02:34.950> pop<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.280> little<00:02:35.610> more<00:02:35.819> and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
that's gonna pop a little more and

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.030 
that's gonna pop a little more and
actually<00:02:36.690> give<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:37.019> some<00:02:37.049> color<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.620> think<00:02:37.739> the

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
actually give you some color I think the

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:46.390 
actually give you some color I think the
Dior<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.400> probably<00:02:38.640> about<00:02:38.760> our<00:02:38.910> choice<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:40.010> am

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.900 

putting<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:49.200> dealer<00:02:49.500> on<00:02:49.560> now<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.610> doer

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
putting the dealer on now and the doer

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.400 
putting the dealer on now and the doer
is<00:02:51.120> actually<00:02:51.450> what<00:02:51.599> I<00:02:51.630> already<00:02:51.959> had<00:02:52.140> on<00:02:52.290> my

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
is actually what I already had on my

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.440 
is actually what I already had on my
lips<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:52.860> it's<00:02:53.040> not<00:02:53.220> changing<00:02:53.940> anything<00:02:54.180> I'm

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
lips so it's not changing anything I'm

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.750 
lips so it's not changing anything I'm
just<00:02:54.599> adding<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.959> little<00:02:55.019> bit<00:02:55.230> more<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:55.890> so

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.130 

you<00:02:59.760> can<00:02:59.790> see<00:03:00.090> it's<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.329> really<00:03:00.599> beautiful

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
you can see it's a really beautiful

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.160 
you can see it's a really beautiful
color<00:03:01.319> it<00:03:01.739> makes<00:03:02.400> my<00:03:02.640> lips<00:03:02.849> look<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:04.049> know

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
color it makes my lips look you know

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.580 
color it makes my lips look you know
even<00:03:04.500> fuller<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.370> I<00:03:06.299> think<00:03:06.599> that<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.200> is

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
even fuller and I think that it is

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.410 
even fuller and I think that it is
really<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.459> know<00:03:08.549> just<00:03:08.610> makes<00:03:09.030> your<00:03:09.150> lips

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
really you know just makes your lips

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.970 
really you know just makes your lips
look<00:03:09.480> really<00:03:09.840> glossy<00:03:10.379> it<00:03:10.500> doesn't<00:03:10.829> look

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
look really glossy it doesn't look

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.130 
look really glossy it doesn't look
sparkly<00:03:11.819> so<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.180> think<00:03:12.390> it's<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.780> good<00:03:12.930> choice

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
sparkly so I think it's a good choice

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.490 
sparkly so I think it's a good choice
for<00:03:13.200> day<00:03:13.650> as<00:03:14.040> well<00:03:14.670> as<00:03:14.790> night<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:15.930> like<00:03:16.319> it

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
for day as well as night I like it

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.979 
for day as well as night I like it
because<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:17.040> is<00:03:17.069> not<00:03:17.310> as<00:03:17.670> sticky<00:03:17.940> as<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.750> Mac

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
because it is not as sticky as the Mac

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.009 
because it is not as sticky as the Mac
it<00:03:19.260> is<00:03:19.319> a<00:03:19.590> little<00:03:20.100> bit<00:03:20.569> you<00:03:21.569> know<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.720> lighter

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
it is a little bit you know a lighter

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.949 
it is a little bit you know a lighter
consistency<00:03:22.859> but<00:03:23.609> it<00:03:23.970> also<00:03:24.329> has<00:03:24.660> pretty<00:03:24.870> good

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
consistency but it also has pretty good

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.870 
consistency but it also has pretty good
staying<00:03:25.319> power<00:03:25.470> I<00:03:25.769> don't<00:03:25.829> think<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.430> has<00:03:26.579> as

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
staying power I don't think it has as

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.140 
staying power I don't think it has as
much<00:03:27.780> stain<00:03:28.230> powder<00:03:28.530> as<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.829> Mac<00:03:29.069> but<00:03:29.819> I<00:03:29.849> guess

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
much stain powder as the Mac but I guess

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.670 
much stain powder as the Mac but I guess
that's<00:03:30.329> kind<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.840> trade-off<00:03:31.260> if<00:03:31.530> you're

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
that's kind of the trade-off if you're

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.020 
that's kind of the trade-off if you're
not<00:03:31.829> really<00:03:32.130> into<00:03:32.340> something<00:03:32.519> that's<00:03:32.849> gonna

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
not really into something that's gonna

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.830 
not really into something that's gonna
be<00:03:33.299> really<00:03:33.599> heavy<00:03:33.900> feeling<00:03:34.590> kind<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.069> you<00:03:35.609> know

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
be really heavy feeling kind of you know

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.280 
be really heavy feeling kind of you know
gloppy<00:03:36.840> on<00:03:37.230> your<00:03:37.380> lips<00:03:37.590> so<00:03:37.980> um<00:03:38.750> so<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:39.780> like<00:03:40.049> them

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
gloppy on your lips so um so I like them

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.640 
gloppy on your lips so um so I like them
both<00:03:40.530> but<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.609> think<00:03:42.450> that<00:03:42.630> even<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.319> Dior

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
both but I think that even the the Dior

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.080 
both but I think that even the the Dior
is<00:03:43.919> a<00:03:43.950> little<00:03:44.190> bit<00:03:44.310> more<00:03:44.430> expensive<00:03:44.730> than<00:03:44.970> the

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
is a little bit more expensive than the

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.870 
is a little bit more expensive than the
Mac<00:03:45.329> I<00:03:45.569> would<00:03:45.840> still<00:03:46.230> purchase<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:47.190> think

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
Mac I would still purchase it I think

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.190 
Mac I would still purchase it I think
that<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.060> will<00:03:48.239> purchase<00:03:48.450> another<00:03:48.870> one<00:03:49.049> after

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
that I will purchase another one after

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.620 
that I will purchase another one after
this<00:03:49.470> is<00:03:49.650> gone<00:03:49.859> and<00:03:50.220> I<00:03:51.030> probably<00:03:51.359> will<00:03:51.599> use

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
this is gone and I probably will use

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.440 
this is gone and I probably will use
them<00:03:51.959> both<00:03:52.139> but<00:03:52.500> but<00:03:53.489> I'm<00:03:53.579> actually<00:03:53.760> leaning

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
them both but but I'm actually leaning

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.750 
them both but but I'm actually leaning
more<00:03:54.930> towards<00:03:55.349> the<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.829> Dior<00:03:56.160> at<00:03:56.280> this<00:03:56.459> point

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
more towards the the Dior at this point

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.509 
more towards the the Dior at this point
