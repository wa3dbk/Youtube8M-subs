 kubot to the world 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.170
 so when this video I'm going to you 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.640

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.450
 which I feel most so for 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:18.529
 start my ipod is there before 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:23.369
 latest version so it's a 32 j because 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.779
 it has a shell in ears of 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.699
 rabbit or I stuck a chorus on it 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.839
 to differentiate it from others so 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.030
 in my menu we epode basic and 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:33.750
 it's from the second page that 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.480
 it will change 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.700
 so there all linked not the little boxes 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.040
 I will show you the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.860
 applications that I prefer so in the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.580
 first box we have skype blogger 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.910

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.710
 instagram and youtube youtube all the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.280
 world knows we are currently 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:57.360
 on blogger so this is a site that 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.580
 is about to post either as 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.190
 this is called the silk of texts be 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.019

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.570
 block where we spend what we want you 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.340

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.240

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.260
 other blogs 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.030
 so then skype well it's a year 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.130
 an application that everyone gets 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.229
 is used to dialogue good facebook is 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.690
 a little the same principle and instagram 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.210
 so that's good I think you 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.100
 know all the same any 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.510
 application where everyone posts these photos 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.990
 and we can like to comment on the photos 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.390
 another one and also his pictures so 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.700
 that's then in the second box 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.070
 so we have the calculator the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.070
 microphone some stuff that we do not 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.810
 do not go out a lot and cats lady then 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.400
 shazam I use it all the time because 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.440
 that it's just huge as an application 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.810
 even if it does not work all the time 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.530
 the time so in the third box 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.180
 we have applications for them 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.729
 to photograph so it's true that 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.200
 I like to find fake 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.930
 but Instagram photo I like 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.600
 change the backgrounds the colors so 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.190
 that's my apps for them 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.160
 pictures so in the 4th box 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.640
 these are applications that I have 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.740
 never served 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.230
 so 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.440
 do not know I clicked on it once 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.450
 but I do not really know what's the point 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.220
 in the fifth box so these are the 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.800
 games the games I do not play 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.620
 hardly ever because my ipod 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:35.630
 message for other than games so 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.580
 this is tac 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.800
 so again good games this is the 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.760

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.920

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.630

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.140
 a lot and I want to beat my 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.450
