 Hello good people, I want to bring a 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.030
 news for you here that's for sure 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.410
 You'll end up listening because 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.029
 I got out of a thousand 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.220
 If you do not know, you're going to end up. 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.380
 receiving this video here they 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.800
 Send me already my opinion here 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.859
 10 white spheres appeared 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.650
 floating in the sky of osaka in japan are 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.200
 causing astonishment it moves in a way 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.930
 they seemed to dance in the sky these lights 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.570
 in common are similar to those 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.510
 appeared in London at a concert in the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.610
 hayarkon park last month but the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.100
 lights in london sighting 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.930
 in the sky for a brief moment before 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.140
 disappear suddenly in the air so 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.270
 quickly as summer and this sim osaka 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.789
 were clearly seen for a long time 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.100
 the sky and certainly more people saw 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.670
 elton waiting there to seem more videos 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.379
 huh 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.629
 If you stayed so long in the sky will appear 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.390
 more people with other footage is 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.100
 possible and now I will not change my 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.049
 opinion here is the following before me 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.600
 Ask me, I'll give you my opinion 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.760
 with weather balloons can not be 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.770
 because what would make a lot of balloon 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.409
 weather together so does not have 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.250
 I think they are not one for 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.530
 not right 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.810
 but not at once, unless 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.619
 I'm wrong if I 'm wrong you 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.140
 correct me 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.700
 It's what we do not know for now. 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.590
 nobody knows how to be an alien now 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.869
 we can not calmly affirm people 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.740

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.960
 drones together is also testing there
