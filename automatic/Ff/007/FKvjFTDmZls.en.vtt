00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
just the ipad or whatever it is they're

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.279 
just the ipad or whatever it is they're
calling<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.230> so<00:00:14.160> I've<00:00:14.280> got<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.870> I<00:00:15.870> clip<00:00:16.109> here

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
calling it so I've got the I clip here

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.230 
calling it so I've got the I clip here
right<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.830> I've<00:00:17.730> got<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.270> new<00:00:18.390> iPad<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.100> I

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.980 
right and I've got the new iPad and I
guess<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.660> prove<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.320> new<00:00:22.470> one<00:00:23.210> I<00:00:24.210> can't

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
guess to prove this the new one I can't

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.259 
guess to prove this the new one I can't
because<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.650> just<00:00:25.740> says<00:00:25.920> ipad<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:27.060> how<00:00:27.150> about

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
because it just says ipad so how about

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.109 
because it just says ipad so how about
that<00:00:27.740> only<00:00:28.740> get<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.099> in<00:00:29.220> focus<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:29.789> it's<00:00:30.000> just

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
that only get that in focus so it's just
