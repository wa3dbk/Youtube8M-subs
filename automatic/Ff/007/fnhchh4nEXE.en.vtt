I think it's gonna help make my channel
a<00:00:47.450> little<00:00:47.600> more<00:00:48.340> sturdy<00:00:49.340> I<00:00:49.610> guess<00:00:50.120> is<00:00:50.300> a<00:00:50.330> word

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
a little more sturdy I guess is a word

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.460 
a little more sturdy I guess is a word
for<00:00:50.660> it<00:00:52.000> I'll<00:00:53.000> have<00:00:53.150> a<00:00:53.180> scheduled<00:00:53.840> content<00:00:54.290> so

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470
