00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:30.690
 but how is he mr gray waiting for you 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.760
 he is extremely clever and truly 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:38.550
 strong to which you owe my success i 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:42.360
 I understand people well by instinct 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.260
 I feel how to manage them 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.260
 peasants 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.070
 noticed 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.900
 he is your eye 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.050
 you are with someone you meet innovation 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.090
 and freedoms 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.160
 I prefer to see your face so that 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.790
 understand what you think seems to be 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.240
 dictator I keep everything under control 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.240
 sounds pretty boring 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.570
 you play a double game 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.770
 you'd better stay away from me 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.810
 and not the one you need 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.689
 you have too many secrets I 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:40.250
 difficult past is all you have to do 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:42.410
 know my tastes quite unusual 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.410
 I'm afraid you will not understand 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.410
 open up 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.290
 why are you trying to change me 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.270
 they are so 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.270
 do you make me different 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.670
 and only 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.380
 with 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.240
 not sure that I can give him what he 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.110
 wants 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.039
 lyceums 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.039
 breaker 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.370
 if I stay what happens next 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.460
