I<00:00:00.650> have<00:00:01.650> been<00:00:01.829> meaning<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.100> talk<00:00:02.370> about<00:00:02.550> this

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:03.170 
I have been meaning to talk about this

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.619 
I have been meaning to talk about this
bearing<00:00:04.220> for<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.250> piper<00:00:05.549> Comanche<00:00:05.790> for<00:00:06.390> some

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
bearing for the piper Comanche for some

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.299 
bearing for the piper Comanche for some
time

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
time

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.890 
time
today's<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:09.000> first<00:00:09.030> time<00:00:09.269> I've<00:00:09.420> got<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.599> chance

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
today's the first time I've got a chance

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.169 
today's the first time I've got a chance
to<00:00:10.080> actually<00:00:10.200> videotape<00:00:10.920> this<00:00:11.179> these

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
to actually videotape this these

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.759 
to actually videotape this these
bearings<00:00:12.660> were<00:00:12.870> removed<00:00:13.320> out<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.679> the

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
bearings were removed out of the

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.849 
bearings were removed out of the
airplane<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.400> bought<00:00:14.670> several<00:00:15.000> years<00:00:15.360> ago

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:15.859 
airplane that I bought several years ago

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.390 
airplane that I bought several years ago
I<00:00:17.210> wanted<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.359> show<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:19.170> they're<00:00:20.130> very

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
I wanted to show you that they're very

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.160 
I wanted to show you that they're very
hard<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.789> see<00:00:22.430> if<00:00:23.430> they<00:00:24.150> are<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.390> fact<00:00:24.630> good<00:00:25.019> or

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
hard to see if they are in fact good or

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.089 
hard to see if they are in fact good or
not<00:00:25.880> when<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:26.910> purchased<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.660> airplane

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
not when I purchased the airplane

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.680 
not when I purchased the airplane
there<00:00:29.400> was<00:00:29.519> no<00:00:29.730> outward<00:00:30.300> signs<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:32.690> resistance

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
there was no outward signs of resistance

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.990 
there was no outward signs of resistance
when<00:00:34.260> using<00:00:35.809> the<00:00:36.809> control<00:00:37.230> surfaces<00:00:37.770> but<00:00:38.520> if

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
when using the control surfaces but if

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.260 
when using the control surfaces but if
you<00:00:39.210> try<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.540> spin<00:00:40.020> these<00:00:40.260> bearings<00:00:41.100> they<00:00:42.000> just

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
you try to spin these bearings they just

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.750 
you try to spin these bearings they just
don't<00:00:42.540> spin<00:00:42.989> there's<00:00:43.739> they're<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.520> so

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
don't spin there's they're just so

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.479 
don't spin there's they're just so
corroded<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:45.870> rusted<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:47.010> they're<00:00:47.190> next

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
corroded and so rusted that they're next

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.299 
corroded and so rusted that they're next
to<00:00:47.700> impossible<00:00:48.410> to<00:00:49.410> spin<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.010> can<00:00:50.160> only

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
to impossible to spin so I can only

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.410 
to impossible to spin so I can only
imagine<00:00:50.520> what<00:00:51.449> kind<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.809> forces<00:00:52.410> were<00:00:52.559> being

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
imagine what kind of forces were being

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.380 
imagine what kind of forces were being
applied<00:00:54.710> to<00:00:56.780> to<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> aircraft<00:00:58.320> during<00:00:58.710> flight

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
applied to to the aircraft during flight

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.799 
applied to to the aircraft during flight
I'm<00:01:00.390> glad<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.840> my<00:01:01.140> MP<00:01:01.739> spent<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> time<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.270> to

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
I'm glad that my MP spent the time to to

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.490 
I'm glad that my MP spent the time to to
review<00:01:03.989> these<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.930> suggest<00:01:06.930> these<00:01:07.290> be

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
review these and to suggest these be

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.600 
review these and to suggest these be
replaced<00:01:07.950> honey<00:01:08.520> once<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.090> saw<00:01:09.360> these<00:01:10.610> just

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
replaced honey once you saw these just

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.450 
replaced honey once you saw these just
take<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> look<00:01:12.030> here<00:01:12.090> I'm<00:01:12.869> going<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.409> point<00:01:13.740> you

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
take a look here I'm going to point you

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.330 
take a look here I'm going to point you
can<00:01:14.610> see<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:14.970> some<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> protective

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
can see that some of the protective

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.850 
can see that some of the protective
coating<00:01:17.340> from<00:01:18.000> where<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.500> bearings<00:01:19.500> are

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
coating from where the bearings are

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.609 
coating from where the bearings are
supposed<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.580> be<00:01:20.729> hidden<00:01:21.000> behind<00:01:21.240> or<00:01:21.960> is

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
supposed to be hidden behind or is

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.460 
supposed to be hidden behind or is
completely<00:01:23.400> gone<00:01:23.610> I'm<00:01:24.299> going<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.720> start<00:01:25.350> to

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
completely gone I'm going to start to

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.700 
completely gone I'm going to start to
dissect<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.750> we're<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.930> see<00:01:28.200> what

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
dissect this and we're going to see what

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.429 
dissect this and we're going to see what
we<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:29.040> actually<00:01:29.189> find<00:01:29.670> behind<00:01:30.570> here<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.320> how

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
we can actually find behind here and how

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.960 
we can actually find behind here and how
bad<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:33.560> give<00:01:34.560> me<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> second<00:01:35.100> here<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.520> yank

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
bad it is give me a second here to yank

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.100 
bad it is give me a second here to yank
this<00:01:36.150> out<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.159> can<00:01:41.430> see<00:01:41.960> that<00:01:42.960> I've

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
this out so you can see that I've

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.690 
this out so you can see that I've
removed<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:45.030> spring<00:01:45.560> clamp<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:47.430> now<00:01:47.640> I'm

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
removed the spring clamp and now I'm

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.889 
removed the spring clamp and now I'm
removing<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.329> protective<00:01:49.640> material<00:01:50.899> from

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
removing this protective material from

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.920 
removing this protective material from
the<00:01:52.350> bearing<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:53.640> feels<00:01:53.939> like<00:01:54.180> paper<00:01:54.509> almost

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
the bearing this feels like paper almost

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.440 
the bearing this feels like paper almost
and<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.500> very<00:01:55.740> brittle<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.549> can<00:01:57.090> see<00:01:57.270> that

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
and it's very brittle you can see that

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.520 
and it's very brittle you can see that
it's<00:01:57.570> been<00:01:58.130> like<00:01:59.240> this<00:02:00.240> for<00:02:00.299> some<00:02:00.780> time<00:02:03.530> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
it's been like this for some time the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.410 
it's been like this for some time the
bearings<00:02:06.290> completely<00:02:07.429> rusted<00:02:08.429> all<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.300> way

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
bearings completely rusted all the way

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.100 
bearings completely rusted all the way
around<00:02:09.780> there's<00:02:10.050> no<00:02:10.319> lubrication<00:02:11.360> whatsoever

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
around there's no lubrication whatsoever

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.820 
around there's no lubrication whatsoever
on<00:02:13.260> these<00:02:13.950> bearings<00:02:14.490> if<00:02:15.180> you've<00:02:15.480> got<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:16.200> piper

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
on these bearings if you've got a piper

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.640 
on these bearings if you've got a piper
Comanche<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.730> you've<00:02:18.570> never<00:02:18.930> had<00:02:19.320> these

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
Comanche and you've never had these

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.600 
Comanche and you've never had these
bearings<00:02:20.400> replaced<00:02:21.890> which<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:23.130> my<00:02:23.280> airplane

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
bearings replaced which in my airplane

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.000 
bearings replaced which in my airplane
appears<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.720> be<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.960> case<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.440> appears<00:02:25.800> to

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
appears to be the case that appears to

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.910 
appears to be the case that appears to
be<00:02:26.240> the<00:02:27.240> original<00:02:27.630> bearings<00:02:28.530> from<00:02:30.620> 1961<00:02:31.620> or

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
be the original bearings from 1961 or

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.280 
be the original bearings from 1961 or
1962<00:02:33.320> I<00:02:34.320> would<00:02:34.740> strongly<00:02:35.130> suggest<00:02:35.520> that<00:02:35.910> you

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
1962 I would strongly suggest that you

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.820 
1962 I would strongly suggest that you
have<00:02:37.290> your<00:02:37.350> a<00:02:37.620> MP<00:02:38.540> take<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.750> time<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:42.680> look<00:02:43.680> at

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
have your a MP take the time to look at

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.870 
have your a MP take the time to look at
these<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.280> just<00:02:44.760> can't<00:02:45.270> believe<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:46.140> can't<00:02:46.880> move

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
these I just can't believe I can't move

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.060 
these I just can't believe I can't move
any<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:48.540> these<00:02:48.720> bearings<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:49.590> they're<00:02:49.860> just
