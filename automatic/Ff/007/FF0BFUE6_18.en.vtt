years Street skating around compared to
other<00:00:19.110> countries<00:00:19.620> around<00:00:20.040> the<00:00:20.190> world<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:21.140> it's

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
other countries around the world is it's

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.020 
other countries around the world is it's
I'd<00:00:22.500> say<00:00:22.770> it's<00:00:22.920> far<00:00:23.130> more<00:00:23.160> challenging<00:00:23.400> and

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.030 
I'd say it's far more challenging and

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.120 
I'd say it's far more challenging and
the<00:00:24.840> spots<00:00:25.200> are<00:00:25.560> very<00:00:26.460> rough<00:00:26.760> yeah<00:00:27.120> or<00:00:28.130> there's

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
the spots are very rough yeah or there's

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.610 
the spots are very rough yeah or there's
something<00:00:29.850> always<00:00:30.690> something<00:00:30.990> funny<00:00:31.230> with

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:31.620 
something always something funny with

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.700 
something always something funny with
the<00:00:31.800> spots<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.899> so<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.170> makes<00:00:34.499> it<00:00:34.649> more

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
the spots and so it just makes it more

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:43.790 
the spots and so it just makes it more
difficult<00:00:40.550> on<00:00:41.550> July<00:00:41.850> tenth<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.679> will<00:00:43.679> be
