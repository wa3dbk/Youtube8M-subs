00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.560 

so<00:05:45.650> that<00:05:46.040> is<00:05:46.220> what<00:05:46.460> it<00:05:46.580> should<00:05:46.610> look<00:05:46.820> like<00:05:47.030> when

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.840 
top especially around the parting and I
did<00:05:56.270> not<00:05:56.390> apply<00:05:56.690> any<00:05:57.020> product<00:05:57.770> to<00:05:58.160> this<00:05:58.340> hair

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
did not apply any product to this hair

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.090 
did not apply any product to this hair
I'm<00:05:59.630> just<00:05:59.810> going<00:05:59.930> to<00:05:59.960> let<00:06:00.140> it<00:06:00.290> air<00:06:00.500> dry<00:06:00.530> and

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
I'm just going to let it air dry and

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.520 
I'm just going to let it air dry and
it's<00:06:01.250> natural<00:06:01.910> you<00:06:02.450> know<00:06:02.480> state<00:06:02.930> without<00:06:03.200> any

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
it's natural you know state without any

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.820 
it's natural you know state without any
product<00:06:04.220> so<00:06:04.910> I'll<00:06:05.060> let<00:06:05.180> it<00:06:05.330> air<00:06:05.540> dry<00:06:05.830> overnight

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
product so I'll let it air dry overnight

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.280 
product so I'll let it air dry overnight
and<00:06:07.250> this<00:06:07.760> is<00:06:08.000> what<00:06:08.240> it<00:06:08.480> looks<00:06:08.750> like<00:06:08.840> when<00:06:09.140> it's

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
and this is what it looks like when it's

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.610 
and this is what it looks like when it's
fully<00:06:09.650> dry<00:06:10.280> it<00:06:11.240> has<00:06:11.420> kind<00:06:11.810> of<00:06:11.870> a<00:06:11.990> slight<00:06:12.380> wave

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
fully dry it has kind of a slight wave
