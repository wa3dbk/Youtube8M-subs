all right some people you're just
getting<00:00:02.460> started<00:00:02.700> into<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.240> hobby<00:00:03.510> and<00:00:04.440> don't

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
getting started into the hobby and don't

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.700 
getting started into the hobby and don't
really<00:00:05.250> know<00:00:05.430> what<00:00:05.609> car<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:05.940> get<00:00:06.120> this

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.710 
really know what car to get this

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.919 
really know what car to get this
hopefully<00:00:07.710> should<00:00:07.890> help<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.660> mean<00:00:09.660> you<00:00:09.750> can<00:00:09.900> go

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
hopefully should help I mean you can go

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.289 
hopefully should help I mean you can go
with<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.730> nitro<00:00:11.730> car<00:00:12.300> or<00:00:12.630> you<00:00:12.870> can<00:00:13.019> go<00:00:13.200> with<00:00:13.230> a

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:14.299 
with a nitro car or you can go with a

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.960 
with a nitro car or you can go with a
electric<00:00:15.299> version<00:00:15.929> car<00:00:16.550> starting<00:00:17.550> out<00:00:17.730> it's

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
electric version car starting out it's

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.640 
electric version car starting out it's
your<00:00:18.090> first<00:00:18.359> time<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.690> would<00:00:18.960> definitely<00:00:19.170> go

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
your first time I would definitely go

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.410 
your first time I would definitely go
with<00:00:19.680> electric<00:00:20.340> but<00:00:20.580> it's<00:00:20.789> totally<00:00:21.180> up<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.390> you

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
with electric but it's totally up to you

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.109 
with electric but it's totally up to you
I<00:00:21.539> guess<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.279> what<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.369> electric<00:00:23.699> cars<00:00:23.939> that

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
I guess and what is electric cars that

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.550 
I guess and what is electric cars that
I'd<00:00:24.210> recommend<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:25.230> start<00:00:25.439> out<00:00:25.590> with<00:00:30.560> would

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
I'd recommend and start out with would

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.979 
I'd recommend and start out with would
be<00:00:31.830> like<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.430> traxxas<00:00:33.000> rustler<00:00:35.840> one<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
be like a traxxas rustler one of the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.720 
be like a traxxas rustler one of the
reasons<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:38.040> because<00:00:39.350> it's<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.730> very

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
reasons that is is because it's a very

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.420 
reasons that is is because it's a very
very<00:00:42.200> reliable<00:00:43.200> car<00:00:45.289> works<00:00:46.289> gratings<00:00:46.800> big<00:00:47.250> and

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
very reliable car works gratings big and

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.369 
very reliable car works gratings big and
easy<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.789> work<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.149> you're<00:00:48.539> not<00:00:48.870> going<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.260> want

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
easy to work on you're not going to want

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.189 
easy to work on you're not going to want
to<00:00:49.530> start<00:00:49.800> out<00:00:49.980> with<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.730> de<00:00:51.480> Lucia<00:00:51.750> microbe

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
to start out with a de Lucia microbe

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.260 
to start out with a de Lucia microbe
going<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.949> be<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.340> hard<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.670> work<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.149> if

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
going to be really hard to work on if

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.819 
going to be really hard to work on if
you<00:00:54.329> haven't<00:00:54.510> worked<00:00:54.629> on<00:00:54.719> RC<00:00:55.050> cars<00:00:55.289> before<00:00:55.500> I

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
you haven't worked on RC cars before I

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.910 
you haven't worked on RC cars before I
mean<00:00:56.039> they're<00:00:56.219> not<00:00:56.600> hard<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.930> mean<00:00:58.320> RC<00:00:58.680> cars

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
mean they're not hard I mean RC cars

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.709 
mean they're not hard I mean RC cars
aren't<00:00:59.250> hard<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.670> work<00:00:59.879> on<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.570> going

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
aren't hard to work on but this is going

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.139 
aren't hard to work on but this is going
to<00:01:00.780> make<00:01:00.870> things<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.559> lot<00:01:01.739> easier<00:01:02.070> if<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:02.879> your

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
to make things a lot easier if it's your

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.870 
to make things a lot easier if it's your
first<00:01:03.180> time<00:01:03.510> getting<00:01:04.409> like<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.710> bigger<00:01:04.880> like

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
first time getting like a bigger like

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.850 
first time getting like a bigger like
110<00:01:06.330> scale<00:01:06.659> car<00:01:07.820> you<00:01:08.820> know<00:01:08.909> I'd<00:01:09.060> go<00:01:09.240> with<00:01:09.390> a

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
110 scale car you know I'd go with a

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.890 
110 scale car you know I'd go with a
brushed<00:01:11.330> version<00:01:13.040> of<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.220> car<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.909> know<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.840> a

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
brushed version of a car you know like a

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.249 
brushed version of a car you know like a
traxxas<00:01:16.350> rustler<00:01:16.560> traxxas<00:01:17.520> stampede<00:01:18.259> traxxas

bandit you know we'll see strike Traxxas

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.140 
bandit you know we'll see strike Traxxas
Slash<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:26.040> mean<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.369> list<00:01:26.520> goes<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:26.909> on

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
Slash I mean the list goes on and on

Slash I mean the list goes on and on
line<00:01:27.420> their<00:01:27.720> brush<00:01:28.049> cars<00:01:28.549> really<00:01:29.549> good<00:01:29.790> really

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
line their brush cars really good really

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.240 
line their brush cars really good really
durable<00:01:30.299> for<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.630> first<00:01:30.869> time<00:01:31.079> driving<00:01:31.909> and

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
durable for the first time driving and

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.830 
durable for the first time driving and
one<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.400> reasons<00:01:35.430> i<00:01:36.000> recommend<00:01:36.420> brushed

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
one of the reasons i recommend brushed

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.429 
one of the reasons i recommend brushed
is<00:01:37.970> because<00:01:38.970> with<00:01:39.479> brushless<00:01:39.869> if<00:01:40.320> you're

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
is because with brushless if you're

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.999 
is because with brushless if you're
starting<00:01:40.829> out<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.340> mean<00:01:42.060> 50<00:01:42.630> 60<00:01:43.500> miles<00:01:43.710> an<00:01:43.860> hour

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
starting out I mean 50 60 miles an hour

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.020 
starting out I mean 50 60 miles an hour
is<00:01:44.340> bit<00:01:44.820> too<00:01:45.060> fast

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
is bit too fast

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.109 
is bit too fast
and<00:01:47.170> I<00:01:48.170> mean<00:01:48.470> if<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:48.799> have<00:01:48.920> a<00:01:48.950> traxxas<00:01:49.580> rustler

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
and I mean if you have a traxxas rustler

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.890 
and I mean if you have a traxxas rustler
mean<00:01:50.960> if<00:01:51.170> you<00:01:51.259> have<00:01:51.530> it<00:01:51.740> for<00:01:51.950> a<00:01:52.009> few<00:01:52.220> months<00:01:52.900> you

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
mean if you have it for a few months you

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.719 
mean if you have it for a few months you
you<00:01:54.740> know<00:01:54.860> you're<00:01:55.040> getting<00:01:55.130> used<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:55.610> it

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
you know you're getting used to it

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.639 
you know you're getting used to it
you're<00:01:55.850> getting<00:01:56.119> better<00:01:56.390> RC<00:01:56.840> car<00:01:57.080> driving<00:01:57.530> you

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
you're getting better RC car driving you

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.190 
you're getting better RC car driving you
can<00:01:57.830> upgrade<00:01:58.159> type<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.880> velineon<00:01:59.200> brushless

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
can upgrade type the velineon brushless

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.820 
can upgrade type the velineon brushless
systems<00:02:01.930> you<00:02:02.930> know<00:02:03.049> same<00:02:03.259> way<00:02:03.409> with<00:02:03.590> like<00:02:03.799> a

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
systems you know same way with like a

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.620 
systems you know same way with like a
lil<00:02:04.009> c<00:02:04.159> strike<00:02:04.460> you<00:02:04.640> can<00:02:04.729> always<00:02:05.000> get<00:02:05.240> like<00:02:05.479> the

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
lil c strike you can always get like the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.380 
lil c strike you can always get like the
accelerant<00:02:06.020> brushless<00:02:06.409> and<00:02:07.179> stuff<00:02:08.179> like<00:02:08.330> that

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
accelerant brushless and stuff like that

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.979 
accelerant brushless and stuff like that
for<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:09.160> but<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:10.190> running<00:02:10.520> brushed<00:02:10.880> it's<00:02:11.870> your

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
for it but it running brushed it's your

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.570 
for it but it running brushed it's your
first<00:02:12.230> time<00:02:12.350> I'd<00:02:12.620> recommend<00:02:12.890> getting<00:02:13.250> like<00:02:13.550> a

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.550 
battery nickel metal hydride one reason
i<00:02:22.700> don't<00:02:22.760> like<00:02:23.060> nine<00:02:23.630> can't<00:02:23.989> batteries<00:02:24.410> is

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
i don't like nine can't batteries is

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.470 
i don't like nine can't batteries is
because<00:02:24.830> they<00:02:24.980> don't<00:02:25.130> hold<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.940> charge<00:02:25.970> long

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
because they don't hold a charge long

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.759 
because they don't hold a charge long
and<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:29.060> amperage<00:02:29.600> like<00:02:30.080> say<00:02:30.350> if<00:02:30.530> it's<00:02:30.709> a

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
and the amperage like say if it's a

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.590 
and the amperage like say if it's a
