00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 on the eve of Easter is great 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.710
 from those who produce 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.530
 chocolate to earn extra income 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.809
 the branch became so profitable that 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.519
 There are people changing jobs to 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.519
 bet on the new market 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.189
 a year ago priscila transformed the kitchen 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.130
 home a small factory 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.660
 chocolates and I told you Friday the 10th she 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.580
 has already tripled wages only with 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.149
 orders for this Easter 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.360
 the values ​​are between 25 and 50 reais 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.640
 bet 2014 on organic eggs she 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.200
 saw a good deal by changing the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.120
 feeding of the family because of 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.960
 child allergy to various types of 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.660
 foods 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.039
 I participate in a group of mothers they 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.270
 They commented how difficult it was 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.670
 find the egg in the market 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.120
 be industrialized without milk without 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.820
 so I offered to do those 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.980
 games for him and I ended up having a lot 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.480
 a greater demand than I imagined 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.539
 organic even think I'll 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.000
 do in the course of the year in other 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.770
 formats but I will continue to make 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.830
 organic eggs have no added milk 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.110
 gluten or soy derivatives because they contain 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.280
 a higher cocoa concentration the price 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.920
 It's higher 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.439
 priscila spent almost 900 reais only 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.420
 in the purchase of this raw material researches 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.070
 Brazil points out that Brazil is the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.439
 third largest consumer of chocolate 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.080
 of the world on average each Brazilian 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.119
 consumes almost three pounds of chocolate 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.250
 per year and just as priscilla 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.939
 many people end up investing in 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.409
 sector at this time of year the association 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.850
 Brazilian chocolate industry 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.070
 still do not have a follow-up 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.140
 production but the family that 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.930
 during Easter they even earn up to 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.659
 eight times more than monthly income alone 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.240
 with the chocolate eggs this family 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.040
 has been producing Easter eggs for nine years now 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.250

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.390

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.430
 family just opened a store 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.829
 specializing in candy 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.409
 the investment of 40 thousand reais that should 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.259
 recovered within two years, one of the 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.610
 more requests is the honey bread egg costs 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.010
 68 reais but the eggs range from 22 to 115 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.260
 if you want to 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.180
 to try at least 20% of last year 's 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.849
 sale of at least three more 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.540
