00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
there isn't really a number you have to

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.210 
there isn't really a number you have to
take<00:02:05.880> as<00:02:06.060> many<00:02:06.330> students<00:02:06.960> who<00:02:07.530> fit<00:02:07.830> into<00:02:08.010> the

take as many students who fit into the
cut-offs<00:02:08.850> that<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.360> very<00:02:09.660> strange

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
cut-offs that is a very strange

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.170 
cut-offs that is a very strange
situation<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:10.980> say<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.430> you're<00:02:11.610> back<00:02:11.820> beyond

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
situation to say that you're back beyond

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.580 
situation to say that you're back beyond
capacity<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.020> just<00:02:13.260> have<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.470> keep

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
capacity and you just have to keep

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.040 
capacity and you just have to keep
welcoming<00:02:14.130> more<00:02:14.310> students<00:02:14.730> exactly<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:15.870> this

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
welcoming more students exactly and this

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.950 
welcoming more students exactly and this
has<00:02:16.260> been<00:02:16.440> traditionally<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.670> practice<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.630> I

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
has been traditionally the practice I I

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.770 
has been traditionally the practice I I
think<00:02:19.440> it's<00:02:19.680> high<00:02:19.890> time<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.190> we<00:02:20.700> don't<00:02:21.450> just

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
think it's high time that we don't just

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.570 
think it's high time that we don't just
reboot<00:02:22.200> but<00:02:22.470> we<00:02:22.620> change<00:02:22.890> completely<00:02:23.310> the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
reboot but we change completely the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.510 
reboot but we change completely the
operating<00:02:24.240> system<00:02:24.750> as<00:02:25.740> you<00:02:25.980> already<00:02:26.310> have

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
operating system as you already have

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.030 
operating system as you already have
said<00:02:26.820> you<00:02:27.570> know<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.720> problem<00:02:28.170> will<00:02:28.530> be<00:02:28.770> with

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
said you know the problem will be with

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.980 
said you know the problem will be with
the<00:02:29.130> infrastructure<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.240> over<00:02:30.540> admission

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
the infrastructure and over admission

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.810 
the infrastructure and over admission
means<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.500> somewhere<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.310> quality<00:02:32.700> of

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
means that somewhere the quality of

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.130 
means that somewhere the quality of
education<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.540> going<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.870> suffer

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
education is going to suffer

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.830 
education is going to suffer
tremendously<00:02:34.520> right<00:02:35.520> if<00:02:35.910> I'm<00:02:36.239> looking<00:02:36.570> at<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
tremendously right if I'm looking at the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.650 
tremendously right if I'm looking at the
Miranda<00:02:37.260> house<00:02:38.000> cut<00:02:39.000> offs<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.420> course

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
Miranda house cut offs of course

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.830 
Miranda house cut offs of course
economic<00:02:40.470> honors<00:02:40.770> is<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.040> highest<00:02:41.340> 94<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:42.300> 96

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
economic honors is the highest 94 to 96

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.630 
economic honors is the highest 94 to 96
so<00:02:43.260> right<00:02:43.470> now<00:02:43.650> you're<00:02:43.860> saying<00:02:44.070> that<00:02:44.220> there

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
so right now you're saying that there

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.370 
so right now you're saying that there
won't<00:02:44.880> be<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.150> second<00:02:45.600> cut<00:02:45.750> off<00:02:45.870> list<00:02:46.080> at<00:02:46.200> least

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
won't be a second cut off list at least

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.830 
won't be a second cut off list at least
in<00:02:46.530> such<00:02:46.709> flagship<00:02:47.130> courses<00:02:47.630> absolutely<00:02:48.630> in

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
in such flagship courses absolutely in

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.229 
in such flagship courses absolutely in
economics<00:02:49.410> there's<00:02:50.160> just<00:02:50.459> no<00:02:50.640> chance<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:51.120> a

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
economics there's just no chance of a

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.570 
economics there's just no chance of a
second<00:02:51.570> cut<00:02:51.750> off<00:02:51.930> what's<00:02:52.770> going<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.040> happen<00:02:53.430> is

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
second cut off what's going to happen is

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.729 
second cut off what's going to happen is
that<00:02:53.610> some<00:02:54.270> colleges<00:02:54.810> might<00:02:55.050> lower<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.470> cut

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
that some colleges might lower the cut

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.040 
that some colleges might lower the cut
off<00:02:55.920> by<00:02:56.130> say<00:02:56.370> one<00:02:56.610> mark<00:02:56.880> which<00:02:57.420> is<00:02:57.450> 0.25

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
off by say one mark which is 0.25

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.530 
off by say one mark which is 0.25
percent<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:59.070> then<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.880> musical<00:03:00.330> chair

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
percent and then the musical chair

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.170 
percent and then the musical chair
begins<00:03:00.959> but<00:03:01.590> if<00:03:01.709> I<00:03:01.860> look<00:03:02.100> at<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.520> percentage

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
begins but if I look at a percentage

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.630 
begins but if I look at a percentage
with<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.480> V<00:03:03.750> let's<00:03:03.989> say<00:03:04.200> Hans<00:03:04.620> Raj<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.220> Hindu

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
with a V let's say Hans Raj and Hindu

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.020 
with a V let's say Hans Raj and Hindu
and<00:03:05.850> SRC<00:03:06.810> see<00:03:07.080> I<00:03:07.770> suspect<00:03:08.489> if<00:03:08.640> they<00:03:08.820> are<00:03:08.880> going

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
and SRC see I suspect if they are going

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.640 
and SRC see I suspect if they are going
to<00:03:09.150> come<00:03:09.330> up<00:03:09.450> with<00:03:09.570> a<00:03:09.630> second<00:03:10.050> list<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:10.470> where

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
to come up with a second list so where

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.040 
to come up with a second list so where
are<00:03:10.800> these<00:03:10.920> students<00:03:11.370> going<00:03:11.550> to<00:03:11.820> move<00:03:12.630> on<00:03:12.870> to

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
are these students going to move on to

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.370 
are these students going to move on to
right<00:03:13.770> in<00:03:14.640> fact<00:03:14.850> in<00:03:15.030> one<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:15.810> our<00:03:15.959> reporters

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
right in fact in one of our reporters

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.229 
right in fact in one of our reporters
was<00:03:16.680> speaking<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.100> some<00:03:17.250> principals<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.060> they

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
was speaking to some principals and they

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.640 
was speaking to some principals and they
were<00:03:18.360> saying<00:03:18.570> that<00:03:18.690> why<00:03:19.170> doesn't<00:03:19.530> the

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
were saying that why doesn't the

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.470 
were saying that why doesn't the
university<00:03:20.220> look<00:03:20.430> at<00:03:20.640> proper<00:03:21.060> evening

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
university look at proper evening

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.300 
university look at proper evening
courses<00:03:21.810> there's<00:03:22.320> of<00:03:22.800> course<00:03:22.860> there's<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.250> big

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
courses there's of course there's a big

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.880 
courses there's of course there's a big
perception<00:03:24.090> about<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.930> day<00:03:25.110> colleges<00:03:25.680> and

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
don't come on to the same platform why

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.840 
don't come on to the same platform why
is<00:03:30.660> that<00:03:30.810> should<00:03:31.350> we<00:03:31.410> be<00:03:31.800> exploring<00:03:32.550> such<00:03:32.700> an

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
is that should we be exploring such an

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.000 
is that should we be exploring such an
options<00:03:33.180> considering<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.870> crunch<00:03:34.380> we<00:03:34.590> really

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
options considering the crunch we really

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.130 
options considering the crunch we really
are<00:03:35.190> looking<00:03:35.340> at<00:03:35.640> on<00:03:35.820> one<00:03:36.030> hand<00:03:36.300> we<00:03:36.480> have<00:03:36.510> we

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
are looking at on one hand we have we

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.310 
are looking at on one hand we have we
are<00:03:37.170> about<00:03:37.440> probably<00:03:37.769> 200<00:03:38.430> or<00:03:38.550> 250<00:03:39.200> 95%<00:03:40.200> as

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
are about probably 200 or 250 95% as

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.380 
are about probably 200 or 250 95% as
last<00:03:40.560> year<00:03:40.770> this<00:03:40.950> time<00:03:41.100> we<00:03:41.280> have<00:03:41.430> five<00:03:42.090> times

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
last year this time we have five times

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.670 
last year this time we have five times
the<00:03:42.690> number<00:03:42.840> so

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
the number so

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.190 
the number so
well<00:03:44.519> Before<00:03:44.879> we<00:03:44.909> jump<00:03:45.060> on<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.840> the

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
well Before we jump on to the

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.429 
well Before we jump on to the
possibility<00:03:46.890> of<00:03:46.920> starting<00:03:47.370> evening<00:03:47.939> colleges

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 
possibility of starting evening colleges

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.559 
possibility of starting evening colleges
where<00:03:49.439> none<00:03:49.680> exists<00:03:50.159> probably<00:03:51.120> we<00:03:51.269> need<00:03:51.299> to

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
where none exists probably we need to

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.990 
where none exists probably we need to
look<00:03:51.750> at<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.500> possibility<00:03:53.189> of<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.819> more

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
look at the possibility of a more

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.750 
look at the possibility of a more
rational<00:03:54.299> admission<00:03:55.140> policy<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.890> that's

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
rational admission policy and that's

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.309 
rational admission policy and that's
where<00:03:57.030> you<00:03:57.299> can<00:03:57.420> only<00:03:57.629> need<00:03:57.810> to<00:03:57.930> think<00:03:58.140> from

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
where you can only need to think from

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.289 
where you can only need to think from
basic<00:03:58.769> principles<00:03:58.799> if<00:03:59.579> this<00:03:59.760> policy<00:04:00.239> is

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
basic principles if this policy is

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.080 
basic principles if this policy is
working<00:04:00.720> for<00:04:00.959> us<00:04:01.109> in<00:04:01.680> changing<00:04:01.980> times<00:04:02.519> when<00:04:02.879> a

larger and larger number of students is

we have the colleges giving the cut-offs
first<00:05:07.289> and<00:05:07.620> then<00:05:07.830> we<00:05:08.010> have<00:05:08.220> our<00:05:08.460> students

applying<00:05:09.389> but<00:05:10.020> what's<00:05:10.650> really<00:05:11.010> changed<00:05:11.580> in

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
applying but what's really changed in

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.670 
applying but what's really changed in

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
becomes simpler will students be able to

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.210 
becomes simpler will students be able to
have<00:05:17.720> will<00:05:18.720> many<00:05:18.960> of<00:05:19.050> them<00:05:19.289> you<00:05:19.889> know<00:05:20.010> because

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
have will many of them you know because

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.980 
have will many of them you know because
the<00:05:20.370> second<00:05:20.729> cut<00:05:20.849> off<00:05:20.970> in<00:05:21.150> a<00:05:21.240> lot<00:05:21.419> of<00:05:21.449> colleges

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
the second cut off in a lot of colleges

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.779 
the second cut off in a lot of colleges
which<00:05:22.199> will<00:05:22.409> come<00:05:22.650> will<00:05:23.039> be<00:05:23.159> more<00:05:23.370> realistic

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
which will come will be more realistic

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:26.240 
which will come will be more realistic
so<00:05:24.180> will<00:05:24.659> a<00:05:24.690> lot<00:05:24.930> of<00:05:24.960> students<00:05:25.500> finally<00:05:25.949> get<00:05:26.220> a
