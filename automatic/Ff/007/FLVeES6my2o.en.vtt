I'm<00:00:06.870> going<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.170> see<00:00:07.620> whether<00:00:08.040> I<00:00:08.130> can<00:00:08.250> turn<00:00:08.670> this

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
I'm going to see whether I can turn this

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:24.380 
I'm going to see whether I can turn this
old<00:00:09.360> pallet<00:00:10.110> into<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:11.690> herb<00:00:12.690> growing<00:00:13.410> bed<00:00:23.390> first

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
old pallet into a herb growing bed first

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.080 
old pallet into a herb growing bed first
of<00:00:24.570> all<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:25.109> was<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> case<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.859> moving<00:00:26.670> the

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
of all it was a case of moving the

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.630 
of all it was a case of moving the
pallet<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.380> final<00:00:28.830> position<00:00:29.010> where<00:00:29.490> it

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
pallet to the final position where it

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.910 
pallet to the final position where it
was<00:00:29.730> going<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.150> live<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.230> quite<00:00:31.470> possibly

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
was going to live this is quite possibly

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.950 
was going to live this is quite possibly
the<00:00:32.219> heaviest<00:00:32.880> pallet<00:00:33.480> I've<00:00:33.660> ever

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
the heaviest pallet I've ever

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.100 
the heaviest pallet I've ever
encountered<00:00:34.640> so<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.880> thought<00:00:36.239> by<00:00:36.510> moving<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
encountered so I thought by moving it to

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.440 
encountered so I thought by moving it to
its<00:00:37.260> final<00:00:37.829> place<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.610> would<00:00:38.790> make<00:00:38.940> life<00:00:39.210> just

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
its final place it would make life just

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:48.650 
its final place it would make life just
a<00:00:39.809> little<00:00:40.050> bit<00:00:40.170> easier

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.319 

next<00:00:49.660> I<00:00:49.870> decided<00:00:50.769> at<00:00:51.190> what<00:00:51.460> angle<00:00:51.879> I<00:00:51.969> wanted

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
next I decided at what angle I wanted

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.869 
next I decided at what angle I wanted
the<00:00:52.449> palette<00:00:52.899> to<00:00:52.930> be<00:00:53.289> propped<00:00:53.710> up<00:00:53.949> and<00:00:54.100> then<00:00:54.789> I

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
the palette to be propped up and then I

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:01.180 
the palette to be propped up and then I
needed<00:00:55.210> to<00:00:55.329> create<00:00:55.570> a<00:00:55.719> couple<00:00:56.050> of<00:00:56.230> legs

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.880 

I<00:01:01.360> used<00:01:02.360> the<00:01:02.570> first<00:01:02.840> leg<00:01:03.170> as<00:01:03.290> a<00:01:03.380> template<00:01:03.829> to

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
I used the first leg as a template to

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:12.100 
I used the first leg as a template to
cut<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.550> second<00:01:05.000> leg

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.640 

there<00:01:12.890> we<00:01:12.950> go<00:01:13.100> -<00:01:13.160> identical<00:01:14.150> legs<00:01:14.540> and<00:01:15.500> they'll

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
there we go - identical legs and they'll

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.580 
there we go - identical legs and they'll
be<00:01:15.800> used<00:01:16.040> to<00:01:16.280> prop<00:01:16.910> up<00:01:16.940> the<00:01:17.350> pallet<00:01:18.350> in<00:01:18.500> the

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
be used to prop up the pallet in the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.340 
be used to prop up the pallet in the
upright<00:01:18.890> position

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.760 

quick<00:01:22.100> test<00:01:22.430> fit<00:01:22.670> before<00:01:23.290> drilling<00:01:24.290> them<00:01:24.560> and

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
quick test fit before drilling them and

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.710 
quick test fit before drilling them and
screwing<00:01:25.250> them<00:01:25.490> into<00:01:25.520> place

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.950 

I<00:01:30.670> just<00:01:31.670> needed<00:01:31.820> to<00:01:32.030> drill<00:01:32.390> a<00:01:32.570> couple<00:01:32.720> of<00:01:32.900> holes

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
I just needed to drill a couple of holes

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:40.310 
I just needed to drill a couple of holes
for<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:33.980> screw

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.020 

I<00:01:40.520> chose<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.420> think<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.810> was<00:01:42.900> a<00:01:42.960> four<00:01:43.290> inch

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
I chose a I think it was a four inch

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.420 
I chose a I think it was a four inch
exterior<00:01:45.030> wood<00:01:45.240> screw<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:46.130> just<00:01:47.130> literally

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
exterior wood screw and just literally

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.820 
exterior wood screw and just literally
just<00:01:47.520> screw<00:01:47.970> them<00:01:48.090> straight<00:01:48.480> into<00:01:48.660> place

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.150 

that's<00:01:55.820> it<00:01:56.060> that's<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.750> parrot<00:01:57.170> propped<00:01:57.980> up

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
that's it that's the parrot propped up

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.780 
that's it that's the parrot propped up
and<00:01:58.480> those<00:01:59.480> legs<00:01:59.780> should<00:02:00.200> be<00:02:00.640> more<00:02:01.640> than

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
and those legs should be more than

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.880 
and those legs should be more than
adequate<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.300> keep<00:02:02.780> it<00:02:02.900> in<00:02:02.990> place<00:02:03.200> for<00:02:03.230> years

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
adequate to keep it in place for years

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:04.420 
adequate to keep it in place for years
to<00:02:04.070> come

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
to come

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.090 
to come
hopefully<00:02:05.170> in<00:02:06.170> my<00:02:06.320> case<00:02:06.590> it<00:02:06.770> was<00:02:06.800> a<00:02:06.890> case<00:02:07.070> of

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
hopefully in my case it was a case of

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.070 
hopefully in my case it was a case of
cleaning<00:02:07.640> it<00:02:07.760> because<00:02:07.910> it<00:02:08.180> was<00:02:08.270> a<00:02:08.330> bit<00:02:08.450> muddy

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
cleaning it because it was a bit muddy

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.520 
cleaning it because it was a bit muddy
these<00:02:09.920> are<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.550> areas<00:02:11.360> where<00:02:11.570> I<00:02:11.630> want<00:02:12.050> to<00:02:12.230> make

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
these are the areas where I want to make

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.910 
these are the areas where I want to make
pockets<00:02:13.340> for<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.630> mud<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:15.200> go<00:02:15.410> or<00:02:15.650> for<00:02:15.830> the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
pockets for the mud to go or for the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.550 
pockets for the mud to go or for the
soil<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.310> go<00:02:16.840> now<00:02:17.840> I'm<00:02:18.050> using<00:02:18.260> something

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
soil to go now I'm using something

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.830 
soil to go now I'm using something
called<00:02:18.830> a<00:02:19.070> weed<00:02:19.370> control<00:02:19.610> membrane<00:02:20.450> I'm<00:02:20.630> using

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
called a weed control membrane I'm using

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.240 
called a weed control membrane I'm using
the<00:02:21.140> thick<00:02:21.890> stuff<00:02:22.220> not<00:02:22.490> the<00:02:22.520> cheap<00:02:22.910> thin

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
the thick stuff not the cheap thin

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.860 
the thick stuff not the cheap thin
material<00:02:25.250> but<00:02:25.430> I'm<00:02:25.520> using<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.480> woven

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
material but I'm using the the woven

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.320 
material but I'm using the the woven
plastic<00:02:27.380> stuff<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:27.860> I<00:02:28.700> just<00:02:28.910> had<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.060> figure

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
plastic stuff and I just had to figure

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.780 
plastic stuff and I just had to figure
out<00:02:29.500> what<00:02:30.500> sort<00:02:30.710> of<00:02:30.800> size<00:02:31.040> I<00:02:31.250> needed<00:02:31.460> to<00:02:31.670> make

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
out what sort of size I needed to make

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.210 
out what sort of size I needed to make
the<00:02:31.910> pocket<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:32.480> then<00:02:32.600> I<00:02:32.840> would<00:02:33.410> cut<00:02:33.620> out<00:02:33.830> six

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
the pocket and then I would cut out six

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.610 
the pocket and then I would cut out six
identical<00:02:34.580> pieces<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:36.350> add<00:02:36.800> to<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.490> six<00:02:38.030> holes

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
identical pieces to add to the six holes

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.040 
identical pieces to add to the six holes
lose<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.830> staple<00:02:40.280> gun<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.610> staples<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.600> it

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
lose the staple gun and staples and it

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.170 
lose the staple gun and staples and it
literally<00:02:42.440> was<00:02:42.710> just<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.100> case<00:02:43.310> of<00:02:43.340> stapling

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
literally was just a case of stapling

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.990 
literally was just a case of stapling
the<00:02:44.330> weed<00:02:44.600> control<00:02:44.780> membrane<00:02:45.530> interface<00:02:46.460> to

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
the weed control membrane interface to

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.730 
the weed control membrane interface to
form<00:02:47.300> a<00:02:47.570> pocket

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.960 

so<00:02:54.580> there<00:02:54.730> we<00:02:54.820> have<00:02:54.850> finished<00:02:55.390> pocket<00:02:55.840> and

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
so there we have finished pocket and

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.550 
so there we have finished pocket and
held<00:02:57.970> in<00:02:58.150> place<00:02:58.180> with<00:02:58.390> staples<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.350> that's

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
held in place with staples and that's

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.430 
held in place with staples and that's
will<00:02:59.950> house<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.700> soil<00:03:01.390> in<00:03:01.630> that<00:03:02.140> one

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
will house the soil in that one

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.070 
will house the soil in that one
particular<00:03:02.770> pocket<00:03:03.550> then<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.450> just<00:03:04.690> needed<00:03:04.870> to

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
particular pocket then I just needed to

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.130 
particular pocket then I just needed to
repeat<00:03:05.380> it<00:03:05.530> six<00:03:05.830> times<00:03:06.240> so<00:03:07.240> that<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.690> whole

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
repeat it six times so that the whole

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.380 
repeat it six times so that the whole
pallet<00:03:08.530> was<00:03:08.710> covered<00:03:09.040> in<00:03:09.190> pockets<00:03:09.910> so<00:03:10.240> there

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
pallet was covered in pockets so there

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.920 
pallet was covered in pockets so there
we<00:03:10.480> have<00:03:10.660> six<00:03:11.410> individual<00:03:12.070> pockets<00:03:12.600> to<00:03:13.600> form

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
we have six individual pockets to form

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.570 
we have six individual pockets to form
the<00:03:14.320> upright<00:03:14.950> growing<00:03:15.700> room<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:18.010> vertical

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
the upright growing room the vertical

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.370 
the upright growing room the vertical
growing<00:03:18.910> room<00:03:19.090> then<00:03:19.660> it<00:03:19.810> was<00:03:19.900> just<00:03:20.080> a<00:03:20.170> case<00:03:20.320> of

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
growing room then it was just a case of

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:37.830 
growing room then it was just a case of
filling<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.340> pockets<00:03:21.730> with<00:03:21.940> soil

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.330 

we<00:03:38.840> have<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.140> finished<00:03:39.470> thing<00:03:39.530> filled<00:03:40.159> with

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
we have the finished thing filled with

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.149 
we have the finished thing filled with
soil<00:03:40.580> and<00:03:40.819> you<00:03:41.780> can<00:03:41.930> plant<00:03:42.200> in<00:03:42.379> there<00:03:42.590> whatever

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 
soil and you can plant in there whatever

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:49.839 
soil and you can plant in there whatever
you<00:03:43.400> want<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:48.470> there<00:03:48.769> we<00:03:48.890> go<00:03:48.920> that<00:03:49.370> was<00:03:49.400> just<00:03:49.730> a

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
you want so there we go that was just a

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.630 
you want so there we go that was just a
little<00:03:50.090> idea<00:03:50.569> how<00:03:51.260> to<00:03:51.319> turn<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:51.620> pallet<00:03:52.040> into<00:03:52.190> a

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
little idea how to turn a pallet into a

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.330 
little idea how to turn a pallet into a
little<00:03:52.970> planter<00:03:53.920> admittedly<00:03:54.920> it's<00:03:55.129> not<00:03:55.160> the

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
little planter admittedly it's not the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.580 
little planter admittedly it's not the
prettiest<00:03:55.760> thing<00:03:55.819> in<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.090> world<00:03:56.299> but<00:03:56.599> you

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
prettiest thing in the world but you

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.199 
prettiest thing in the world but you
know<00:03:57.769> might<00:03:57.950> be<00:03:57.980> useful<00:03:58.489> you<00:03:58.519> can<00:03:58.760> fill<00:03:59.060> it<00:03:59.150> up

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
know might be useful you can fill it up

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.089 
know might be useful you can fill it up
with<00:03:59.420> flowers<00:03:59.690> or<00:04:00.049> herbs<00:04:00.349> or<00:04:00.709> whatever<00:04:00.980> it

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
with flowers or herbs or whatever it

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.330 
with flowers or herbs or whatever it
whatever<00:04:01.400> takes<00:04:01.640> your<00:04:01.760> fancy<00:04:01.849> and<00:04:03.340> hopefully

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
whatever takes your fancy and hopefully

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.490 
whatever takes your fancy and hopefully
once<00:04:04.700> everything<00:04:05.180> rose<00:04:05.659> and<00:04:06.049> you<00:04:06.110> get<00:04:06.260> lots<00:04:06.349> of

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
once everything rose and you get lots of

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.900 
once everything rose and you get lots of
green<00:04:06.709> vegetation<00:04:06.890> it'll<00:04:07.459> be<00:04:07.549> a<00:04:07.579> little<00:04:07.819> bit

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
green vegetation it'll be a little bit

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.150 
green vegetation it'll be a little bit
of<00:04:08.000> a<00:04:08.060> grabbing<00:04:08.660> wall<00:04:08.840> at<00:04:09.680> least<00:04:09.829> that's<00:04:10.099> what

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
of a grabbing wall at least that's what

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.650 
of a grabbing wall at least that's what
I'm<00:04:10.370> sort<00:04:10.610> of<00:04:10.700> hoping<00:04:11.060> it's<00:04:11.329> going<00:04:11.480> to<00:04:11.569> be

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
I'm sort of hoping it's going to be

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.660 
I'm sort of hoping it's going to be
obviously<00:04:12.260> we'll<00:04:12.650> have<00:04:13.040> a<00:04:13.069> look<00:04:13.220> at<00:04:13.370> it<00:04:13.489> later

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
obviously we'll have a look at it later

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.300 
obviously we'll have a look at it later
on<00:04:13.910> in<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.180> season<00:04:14.390> and<00:04:15.039> we'll<00:04:16.039> see<00:04:16.160> how<00:04:16.220> we
