do we select which chest I don't know
anyways<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.380> believe<00:00:11.040> chest<00:00:11.370> protection<00:00:11.730> is<00:00:12.120> in

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450

anyways I believe chest protection is in
and<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.750> believe<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.259> works<00:00:13.440> by<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.740> following

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
and I believe it works by the following

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.599 
and I believe it works by the following
you<00:00:14.549> type<00:00:14.759> in<00:00:14.969> /t<00:00:15.299> p<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.859> not<00:00:17.039> child<00:00:17.340> porn

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
selected but you type in CP 2 and then

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.860 
selected but you type in CP 2 and then
you<00:00:58.649> do<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.399> then<00:00:59.879> there<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.719> if<00:01:00.780> you

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
you do that and then there so if you

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.329 
you do that and then there so if you
type<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.320> CP<00:01:01.710> 1<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.609> should<00:01:03.030> be<00:01:03.409> like<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.739> see

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
type in CP 1 it should be like that see

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.340 
type in CP 1 it should be like that see
that<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.760> what<00:01:05.909> happens<00:01:06.299> when<00:01:06.420> its<00:01:06.570> public<00:01:06.869> now

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
that so what happens when its public now

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.719 
that so what happens when its public now
I<00:01:07.380> don't<00:01:07.470> know<00:01:07.740> if<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.010> put<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> private<00:01:08.610> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
I don't know if you put a private and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.010 
I don't know if you put a private and
public<00:01:09.060> together<00:01:09.210> what<00:01:09.540> would<00:01:09.659> happen

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
public together what would happen

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.270 
public together what would happen
probably<00:01:10.530> nothing<00:01:10.680> good<00:01:11.420> but<00:01:12.890> yeah<00:01:13.890> that's<00:01:14.130> as

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
probably nothing good but yeah that's as

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.649 
probably nothing good but yeah that's as
simple<00:01:14.430> as<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.850> as<00:01:15.060> far<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.479> know<00:01:15.540> you

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
simple as that and as far as I know you

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.490 
simple as that and as far as I know you
can<00:01:15.869> do<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.110> CP<00:01:17.540> let's<00:01:18.540> try<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.780> for<00:01:19.229> players

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
can do the CP let's try this for players

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.899 
can do the CP let's try this for players
I<00:01:19.680> think<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:19.950> CP<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.030> can<00:01:21.240> do<00:01:21.770> sniper

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
I think it's CP for so you can do sniper

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.219 
I think it's CP for so you can do sniper
3<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.330> let's<00:01:25.170> do<00:01:25.820> our<00:01:26.820> no<00:01:27.150> space<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.780> think<00:01:28.140> it's

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
3 and let's do our no space I think it's

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.630 
3 and let's do our no space I think it's
like<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:30.680> 0<00:01:31.680> 0<00:01:32.220> 1<00:01:32.430> 2<00:01:32.670> 3<00:01:32.700> let's<00:01:33.479> try<00:01:33.689> that

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
like this that 0 0 1 2 3 let's try that

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.859 
like this that 0 0 1 2 3 let's try that
Aussie<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.850> then<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.090> believe<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.479> go<00:01:36.689> like

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
Aussie and then I believe you go like

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.950 
Aussie and then I believe you go like

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
then it's like boom you've crashed

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.620 
then it's like boom you've crashed
because<00:04:57.860> you<00:04:58.130> warped<00:04:58.460> 100<00:04:58.790> miles<00:04:58.970> away<00:04:59.270> and

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
because you warped 100 miles away and

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.620 
because you warped 100 miles away and
that's<00:04:59.960> what<00:05:00.110> happens<00:05:00.470> when<00:05:00.800> your<00:05:00.980> warp<00:05:01.250> in
