Richtofen actually cut open his brain
put<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:25.949> into<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> jar<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.910> now<00:00:27.150> we're<00:00:27.359> going<00:00:27.509> to

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
put it into a jar and now we're going to

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.460 
put it into a jar and now we're going to
make<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.249> quadrotor<00:00:29.249> out<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.269> max's<00:00:30.689> brain<00:00:31.140> and

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
make a quadrotor out of max's brain and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.630 
make a quadrotor out of max's brain and
a<00:00:31.560> couple<00:00:31.769> mechanic<00:00:32.189> parts<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.460> we're<00:00:32.550> going

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
a couple mechanic parts so we're going

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.620 
a couple mechanic parts so we're going
to<00:00:32.730> show<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.910> how<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.060> build<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.390> today

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
to show you how to build that today

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.180 
to show you how to build that today
first<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.260> all<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.470> see<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.710> brain<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.070> always

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
first of all you see the brain it always

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.550 
first of all you see the brain it always
spawns<00:00:35.520> at<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.760> spawn<00:00:35.970> area<00:00:36.320> second<00:00:37.320> piece<00:00:37.440> is

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
spawns at the spawn area second piece is

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.450 
spawns at the spawn area second piece is
going<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.739> be<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> rotors

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
going to be the rotors

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.220 
going to be the rotors
it<00:00:38.610> can<00:00:38.820> either<00:00:38.970> spawn<00:00:39.390> here<00:00:39.690> where<00:00:39.870> i<00:00:39.899> pick<00:00:40.199> it

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
it can either spawn here where i pick it

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.410 
it can either spawn here where i pick it
up<00:00:40.440> or<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.859> can<00:00:41.010> also<00:00:41.190> spawn<00:00:41.609> down<00:00:41.940> below<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
up or it can also spawn down below the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.569 
up or it can also spawn down below the
excavation<00:00:42.930> site<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.440> rotors<00:00:43.829> are<00:00:44.340> by<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
excavation site so the rotors are by the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.880 
excavation site so the rotors are by the
excavation<00:00:45.300> site<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.960> third<00:00:46.230> part<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.649> going

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
excavation site the third part is going

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.009 
excavation site the third part is going
to<00:00:47.039> be<00:00:47.129> kind<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.699> body<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.359> the<00:00:48.539> bog<00:00:48.750> rotor

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
to be kind of the body of the bog rotor

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:51.349 
to be kind of the body of the bog rotor
and<00:00:49.320> that's<00:00:49.500> going<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.769> be<00:00:50.039> down<00:00:50.789> by<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359 
and that's going to be down by the

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.150 
and that's going to be down by the
church<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.079> past<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.500> church<00:00:52.679> before<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.070> go

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
church so past the church before you go

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.189 
church so past the church before you go
into<00:00:53.309> generator<00:00:53.760> six<00:00:54.090> it's<00:00:54.510> actually<00:00:54.929> in<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
into generator six it's actually in the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.069 
into generator six it's actually in the
blue-ice<00:00:55.739> staffs<00:00:56.399> tunnel<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.510> dubstep<00:00:57.989> is

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
blue-ice staffs tunnel so dubstep is

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.150 
blue-ice staffs tunnel so dubstep is
going<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.260> be<00:00:58.320> laying<00:00:58.440> beside<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.829> right<00:00:58.949> there

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
going to be laying beside it right there

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.579 
going to be laying beside it right there
once<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.879> actually<00:01:00.120> get<00:01:00.539> all<00:01:00.780> three<00:01:01.079> parts

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
once you actually get all three parts

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.130 
once you actually get all three parts
we're<00:01:02.250> gonna<00:01:02.399> go<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:03.030> workbench<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.960> build

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
we're gonna go to a workbench and build

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.110 
we're gonna go to a workbench and build
it<00:01:04.290> just<00:01:04.320> like<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> normal<00:01:04.680> buildable<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.700> we

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
it just like a normal buildable and we

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.060 
it just like a normal buildable and we
went<00:01:06.300> to<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> actual<00:01:06.930> church<00:01:07.320> workbench<00:01:07.800> just

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
went to the actual church workbench just

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.530 
went to the actual church workbench just
because<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> closest<00:01:08.940> but<00:01:09.360> all<00:01:09.480> you

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
because it's the closest but all you

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.450 
because it's the closest but all you
have<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.750> do<00:01:09.900> again<00:01:10.440> whole<00:01:10.770> decks<00:01:11.010> just<00:01:11.159> like<00:01:11.430> a

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.770 
have to do again whole decks just like a
normal<00:01:11.579> buildable<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.180> once<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.479> build<00:01:12.630> it

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
normal buildable and once you build it

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:24.550 
normal buildable and once you build it
you're<00:01:12.869> gonna<00:01:12.960> hear<00:01:13.140> max's<00:01:13.500> say<00:01:13.650> this
