1,500 V - if it doesn't say V - they
don't<00:00:13.440> put<00:00:13.710> V<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.099> announce<00:00:14.639> just<00:00:14.990> that<00:00:15.990> be<00:00:16.139> gay

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
don't put V to announce just that be gay

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.310 
don't put V to announce just that be gay
but<00:00:16.859> anyways<00:00:18.650> to<00:00:19.650> sa<00:00:20.100> tens<00:00:20.430> dual<00:00:21.300> fours<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:22.289> I

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
but anyways to sa tens dual fours so I

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.019 
but anyways to sa tens dual fours so I
wash<00:00:22.619> down<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.920> one<00:00:23.220> ohm<00:00:24.500> and<00:00:25.820> the<00:00:26.820> box<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.539> um

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
wash down the one ohm and the box is um

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.209 
wash down the one ohm and the box is um
thing<00:00:30.029> let's<00:00:30.269> see<00:00:30.449> it's<00:00:30.599> about<00:00:30.720> 2.0<00:00:31.439> something

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.910 
cubes tuned down to 32 Hertz and it was

concerned about that and got the remote
knob<00:01:05.309> part<00:01:06.210> up<00:01:06.420> here<00:01:06.799> and<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.130> get<00:01:09.000> a

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
knob part up here and it's a get a

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.719 
knob part up here and it's a get a
attachment<00:01:10.049> method<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:10.650> just<00:01:11.040> straight

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
attachment method it's just straight

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.230 
attachment method it's just straight
into<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.240> freaking<00:01:12.799> arm<00:01:13.799> rest<00:01:14.130> but<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.520> does

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
into the freaking arm rest but it does

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.660 
into the freaking arm rest but it does
great<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:15.900> I'm<00:01:16.020> I'm<00:01:16.530> perfectly<00:01:16.979> happy<00:01:17.159> with<00:01:17.430> it
