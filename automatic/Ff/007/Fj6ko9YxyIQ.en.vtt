00:00:11.513 --> 00:00:14.451
 [PBB]: Oh, please poor Beggar Do you know who I am? 

00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:17.599
 I am a prince. Against me I'm surprised you're standing 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.688
 Did they send a dirty work horse to fight? Oh, how absurd. 

00:00:20.688 --> 00:00:23.320
 How can you do a Rap Battle? You only know two words! 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.496
 You are a joke! When you were a dog you had more brain! 

00:00:26.496 --> 00:00:29.191
 Spend less time with the foals and we will not think you're gay! 

00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:32.085
 Do you call this game a Rap Battle? Well, this is going to be fast 

00:00:32.085 --> 00:00:34.950
 But I will not leave until I show you a few new tricks. 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.145
 There's nothing big about you, silly. You do not leave anyone amazing. 

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:41.154
 Maybe that's why your garden is the only field you're plowing. 

00:00:41.154 --> 00:00:43.792
 I'm going to leave your eyes Deriving in circles at the end of this song. 

00:00:43.792 --> 00:00:46.998
 And I'll keep saying, "I do not know what's wrong!" 

00:00:49.872 --> 00:00:52.725
 [BM]: If you like to talk about a great game. You are very silly Eeyup! 

00:00:52.725 --> 00:00:55.747
 But everything you just said seems that you did not add. 

00:00:55.747 --> 00:00:58.783
 Now forgive me if I'm wrong. You already, I'm not good at math. 

00:00:58.783 --> 00:01:01.630
 But I do not need to know that 2 + 2 is pain in your ass. 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.676
 It may not be the brightest focus or the sharpest nail 

00:01:04.676 --> 00:01:07.690
 But you are so dense that people think we are delivering mail. 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.596
 You are a coward. A fool. You are not made for this game. 

00:01:10.596 --> 00:01:13.585
 Oh By the way, you have some dirt in your mane. 

00:01:13.946 --> 00:01:16.667
 They call you BlueBlood? I'm sure it's not the only blue one. 

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:19.490
 If a pony is a joke here, it's probably you. 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.493
 You have gone more out of your reach. Just pack your bags and go home. 

00:01:22.493 --> 00:01:25.478
 They call me "Big" for a reason: Very difficult to control one. 

00:01:25.478 --> 00:01:28.359
 [PBB]: You have been hit by many apples on your head, what a great fool. 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:31.507
 Go back to your Schmoopie Woopy Pie because you're about to be polite 

00:01:31.507 --> 00:01:34.486
 Very difficult to control one? Oh, do you think I'm afraid? 

00:01:34.486 --> 00:01:37.348
 You were tricked by your sister, a hen and a dictionary 

00:01:37.348 --> 00:01:40.337
 This is not a detour, pig, now have this land of your shelter! 

00:01:40.337 --> 00:01:43.319
 Because while you're stuck in the mud, I'm in the air! IN A BOAT! 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:46.327
 Go hold on Smarty Pants and cry to sleep, what a great idiot. 

00:01:46.327 --> 00:01:48.675
 Do you still think you can win? it will be that the answer will be ... 

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:49.415
 [BM]: NOPE! 

00:01:49.415 --> 00:01:52.433
 Every rose has its thorn? Well, you kid me 

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:55.047
 because I assure you that it is not any flower, prince, it is more like weeds 

00:01:55.047 --> 00:01:57.902
 I'll throw you like a rotten apple throw you in the rain 

00:01:57.902 --> 00:02:00.995
 You are not a prince, Blueblood, you are nothing but a real pain in big! 

00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:03.865
 Where is your charming attitude now? What happens? Are you afraid? 

00:02:03.865 --> 00:02:06.656
 Why do I leave you down like Rarity or some other mare? 

00:02:06.656 --> 00:02:09.861
 It's better to saddle and leave Before showing any damage 

00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:12.860
 So take out your real ass and get out of my farm. 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:37.734
