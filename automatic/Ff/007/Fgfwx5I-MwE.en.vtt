00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
 Whole days on all theater before Bernau there must be some 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.669
 Hamburg today in the question of whether that was actually the willingness to run 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:11.689
 which one can bring 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:17.640
 to flow with it 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.730
 in the duel knows of course that Pluta is in front of him and Blues already with yellow 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.730
 is warned 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.449
 we have to go from the back now 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:33.150
 Nintendo had huge luck 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.420
 practiced a week before 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.230
 Andrist 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.900
 so change 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.770
 Schulz comes our way it is a great opportunity to the motives 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.670
 in the 21 minutes 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.020
 because he changed 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.310
 then he could become dangerous in the Russian city 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.710
 but who only go new ways twice 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.040
 also Pierre 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.980
 the single should be like that 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.380
 that's the way it is 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.750
 Timo Schultz 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.750
 must be clear that they are 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.720
 but a standard situation from the home 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.360
 you start 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.400
 so it is a dash one to zero 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.400
 his colleague 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.090
 even if the creativity in the square was happy 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.090
 his limits 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.740
 at the latter Monet at every goal 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.600
 he lets himself celebrate his Pauli 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.600
 Mattias the 1 as a fifth 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.310
 Class free kick 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.310
 full of determination and playful 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:11.069
 not the results 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.069
 the brute force closer 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.819
 Super free kick and also proves and laid load 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:21.879
 the sentence guide 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.879
 here in the dkb-arena 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:28.609
 the former is that the one is not there anymore 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:31.579
 the announcement 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.579
 Matthias Lehmann 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.839
 Game is interrupted 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:41.169
 there is van Gaal 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:44.169
 in the guest block 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.459
 they practice 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.889
 in this duel 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:02:58.859
 traditionally 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.859
 "If stupidity 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:08.139
 not back to Holger Stanislawski are there 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:10.299
 to calm the fans 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.359
 30 injured about 50 arrests about the bitter record 

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:20.039
 the two games 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.849
 much was clear thank goodness the clock was still right 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.679
 one sets Matthias Steiner is 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:38.679
 that the small area is culture 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:43.809
 when the TOEFL areas become a plague in such a game 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:48.229
 then that's bitter 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.819
 she is harmed with that 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.539
 the own club 

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:58.539
 but the host 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.159
 and all this in a phase where stadium bans are being discussed anyway 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.820
 August with the now now a stadium ban that the Federal High Court 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:26.939
 I want that here 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:29.279
 or concrete participation 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:31.309
 a stadium ban proved 

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:32.749
 it is enough if you are free 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:35.749
 has become such a rampaging group 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.080
 at Hansa Rostock has this residue Enrico Kern comes after his 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.599
 Abdominal muscle injury 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:42.990
 who last game 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.990
 in August Blackstone is out 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.789
 last should 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.000
 because what is now so aggressively aligned he is currently the 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:03.700
 Admissibility of a Nissan Qashqai 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.099
 Party make the 13 0 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:07.860
 after a few possibilities 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.689
 Accent Sirte off 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:14.439
 Dennis Nachtwey the substitute with his third goal of the season for St Pauli 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.439
 Fanboy the Fürth Rostock 2 0 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.889
 Hansa Rostock had to open 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.889
 What goes on there to the point so it was wonderful in the back 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:35.879
 from Schöneberg 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:38.550
 SID Thüroff brings the ball 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.779
 Eberstadt the overview Ortenberg with its technical executor 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:45.199
 the qualities 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:48.389
 he does the 2 0 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:49.680
 St. Pauli 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.950
 and that is in the Rostock Bleekemolen Vogt 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:56.539
 bolt 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.879
 and they may be happy about this goal 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.800
 because actually is the left foot 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.800
 with 17 hits here with right class 

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:14.119
 the protection 

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:14.829
 with the inside
