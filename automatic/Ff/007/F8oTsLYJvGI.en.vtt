 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.070
 new episode of the sauna in the barbecue 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:56.490
 Today, there is something very simple 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.900
 Barbecue with ball sandwich exactly that 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.460
 goes incredibly fast and it 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.290
 incredibly easy for one thing 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.300
 only thing you need is one 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.480
 reasonable barbecue sauce a bit 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.640
 cheese meat and a baguette and around that 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.800
 Rounding out the whole thing comes down to the cash 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.450
 another beautiful horseradish 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.970
 smear cream on it with fresh 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.890
 herbs from our herb garden exactly 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.720
 and how the whole thing works 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.540
 everything still needs the I show you 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.830
 Now here at our board are now 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.780
 So all the things we do for ours 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.250
 barbecue meatballs need sandwich and 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.590
 The first catching man with the barbecue 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.690
 barbecue sauce you will find the recipe 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.940
 down in our channel under the 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.320
 category quickie because there you will find 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.360
 everything we always in ours 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.640
 Among other things, videos use there as well 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.520
 the recipe for our bold baguette 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.759
 then we have 500 grams behind 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.750
 minced salt and pepper a bit 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.410
 salad 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.229
 here we have disappeared parmesan one 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:55.560
 lime a little cream of horseradish and 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.740
 from the herb garden sorrel 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.350
 little thyme and oregano what we have now 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.240
 I'll show you that you are 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.740
 Our minced meat is in a stainless steel 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.210
 landed and now we will 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.460
 I refine everything here 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.430
 We are angry with that 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:15.780
 now with a knife pretty throughout 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.780
 cut fine strips and then comes 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.140
 this already with our minced meat 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:27.330
 Add a splash of lime juice to it 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:30.500
 pepper a little salt and a pinch 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.340
 so few worcester are like taste 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.319
 the whole thing is going to be neat now 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.300
 kneaded and then I show you how it is 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.800
 we continue our mincemeat 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.200
 knead well and take it now 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:45.150
 we take a part of it and shape it in 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:48.000
 the bare hand a few globules after 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.069
 a short time we have eight now 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.959
 our little woods shaped from the 500 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.620
 gram and the mincemeat now 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.069
 on the grill 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.709
 our gryllus preheated 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:03.200
 and now our meatballs are coming to her 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:04.790
 directly in open heat on things there 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.180
 They are now from all sides 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.180
 seared 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.920
 But let's see for our bildchen 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.840
 The balls grilled a nice 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.840
 now come in here in the shell 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.430
 if then all are in the shell pull 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.139
 we heat the shell for the direct heat and 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.989
 then we take our barbecue sauces 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:35.989
 the glass as it is and pour the 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:38.840
 bucket completely over it all should 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.669
 simmer now by itself 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.500
 the search still draws one of the taste 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:46.219
 even with the meat we reduce 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.319
 heat on small flame with it 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:49.280
 do not burn and see us then 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.530
 right back 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.230
 we come now to our horseradish 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.389
 cream since coming in on herbs like 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.340
 oregano and fresh thyme have that 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:07.459
 we ripped off when I am now 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:10.599
 Hack ours once again 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:15.220
 herbs are now added to the droughts 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.220
 then comes a splash of lime juice 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:27.520
 pepper as well as salt and two teaspoons 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.520
 cream horseradish 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.370
 the whole thing will be together now 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:39.250
 stir when the whole then such a 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.420
 consistency has wondered that is perfect 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.190
 Do not worry this is a bit 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.200
 acidic the stand is sour 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.910
 because the metten juice gives a slight 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.580
 acid from that is so wanted 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:51.280
 The sweetness of the barbecue pipes harmonizes 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.200
 Perfect with the acidity of the sway 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.920
 and the lime juice the majority 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.330
 note comes easily through everything perfectly 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.600
 and we'll go straight to one 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.460
 meatballs continue you see that ours 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.010
 barbecue sauce really nice 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.090
 reduced and which ones are like glass 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.160
 now they have one in between 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.630
 a little turned in the sauce that is 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.790
 an aroma that's awesome 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.430
 Now we have our parmesan here 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.480
 we just have it in rough 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.460
 pieces cut 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.990
 which is now strewn over it and above 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.370
 then the whole thing is still baked 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.300
 our on board are ready I have 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.500
 Here's a little bit of the cream 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:32.020
 village done there is still a bit 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:35.470
 more on it comes our lollo bionda 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:38.110
 it it is characterized in that 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:45.850
 is pretty big and therefore also at 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:48.479
 you slice very crisp then two 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.479
 our meatballs 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:59.930
 I would say half of that 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:02.210
 then baguette three of the hills team 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.169
 Let's meet something else before ours 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:08.599
 barbecue sauce above 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:10.879
 this is not all witchcraft 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:12.199
 we'll make you a plate now 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:15.560
 picture and then see us again 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:16.879
 To sum up, our sandwiches are back 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.580
 Eaten and once again has become 

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:23.870
 confirmed simple kitchen is the 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:26.900
 best the sourish note of the cream 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:29.300
 and is slightly bitter aroma of that 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.909
 salad harmonized perfectly with the sweet 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.349
 barbecue sauce yes these sweet barbecues 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:34.999
 is our together with the meat boy 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:36.770
 Beautifully shopped in your grill 

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:38.120
 not only works in a gas grill 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.589
 works great too on the 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.080
 weber for I have already often 

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:43.969
 Therefore today also the idea for 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.949
 recipe has everything wonderful 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:47.689
 connected also with the parmesan goes 

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:49.939
 certainly with gouda if you 

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:53.270
 No more Saturdays just fine 

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:56.419
 Just try it out yes and how 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.550
 always we would be happy about that though 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:00.490
 here at youtube I like it 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.139
 I like facebook or even here 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.360
 youtube and comment on that help us 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:06.800
 and so you continue with the stimulus 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.939
 he writes in when he has had the credit 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.979
 she also writes 

00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:13.069
 Of course we always try to approach us 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:17.349
 work and we'll see each other next 

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:17.349
