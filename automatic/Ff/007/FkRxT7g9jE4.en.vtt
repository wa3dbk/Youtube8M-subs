00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
what vanilla is there used to be a lot

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.330 
what vanilla is there used to be a lot
of<00:00:50.060> really<00:00:50.660> cool<00:00:50.900> pets<00:00:51.230> but<00:00:51.440> for<00:00:51.920> some<00:00:52.070> reason

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
of really cool pets but for some reason

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.340 
of really cool pets but for some reason
only<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:52.820> Alliance<00:00:53.210> could<00:00:53.390> get<00:00:53.540> them<00:00:53.690> why<00:00:53.960> I

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
only the Alliance could get them why I

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.660 
only the Alliance could get them why I
don't<00:00:55.010> know<00:00:55.100> that's<00:00:55.310> just<00:00:55.399> the<00:00:55.610> way<00:00:55.700> it<00:00:55.970> was

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
don't know that's just the way it was

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.610 
don't know that's just the way it was
but<00:00:58.670> eventually<00:00:59.300> they<00:00:59.720> changed<00:01:00.170> their<00:01:00.380> tune

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
but eventually they changed their tune

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.350 
but eventually they changed their tune
in<00:01:01.040> fact<00:01:01.309> let's<00:01:01.489> speed<00:01:01.700> this<00:01:01.730> up<00:01:01.940> a<00:01:02.030> little<00:01:02.120> bit

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
in fact let's speed this up a little bit

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.270 
in fact let's speed this up a little bit
while<00:01:02.510> I<00:01:02.540> talk<00:01:04.929> anyway<00:01:05.929> what<00:01:06.229> happened<00:01:06.619> is<00:01:06.770> you

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
while I talk anyway what happened is you

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.190 
while I talk anyway what happened is you
could<00:01:07.520> eventually<00:01:07.759> get<00:01:08.179> those<00:01:08.420> pets<00:01:08.749> and<00:01:09.049> then

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
could eventually get those pets and then

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.649 
could eventually get those pets and then
they<00:01:09.380> made<00:01:09.530> it<00:01:09.649> so<00:01:09.889> each<00:01:10.429> faction<00:01:10.909> could<00:01:11.450> have

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
they made it so each faction could have

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.389 
they made it so each faction could have
about<00:01:11.899> roughly<00:01:12.289> the<00:01:12.409> same<00:01:12.590> pets<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.159> no<00:01:13.249> one

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
about roughly the same pets and no one

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:14.770 
about roughly the same pets and no one
was<00:01:13.520> getting<00:01:13.609> screwed<00:01:14.030> on<00:01:14.299> a<00:01:14.329> pet<00:01:14.600> just

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
was getting screwed on a pet just

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.969 
was getting screwed on a pet just
because<00:01:14.990> you<00:01:15.380> were<00:01:15.469> part<00:01:15.679> of<00:01:15.709> a<00:01:15.799> certain

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
because you were part of a certain

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.709 
because you were part of a certain
faction<00:01:16.280> on<00:01:16.549> it<00:01:16.670> they<00:01:16.909> tried<00:01:17.149> to<00:01:17.179> balance<00:01:17.630> it

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:17.719 
faction on it they tried to balance it

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:19.690 
faction on it they tried to balance it
like<00:01:17.840> they<00:01:17.959> do<00:01:18.049> with<00:01:18.109> the<00:01:18.229> entire<00:01:18.469> game<00:01:18.770> this
