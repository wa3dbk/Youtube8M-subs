00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
I guess without really planning to this

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.210 
I guess without really planning to this
is<00:02:42.550> fast<00:02:42.910> becoming<00:02:43.300> my<00:02:43.569> daily<00:02:44.290> lizard<00:02:44.800> checked

I

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.040 

that's<00:04:06.580> what<00:04:06.850> try<00:04:07.210> not<00:04:07.390> to<00:04:07.420> handle<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:07.870> eggs

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
that's what try not to handle the eggs

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.830 
that's what try not to handle the eggs
too<00:04:08.410> often<00:04:08.830> because<00:04:09.190> I<00:04:09.640> am<00:04:10.060> a<00:04:10.090> clumsy<00:04:10.420> human

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
too often because I am a clumsy human

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.720 
too often because I am a clumsy human
being<00:04:13.500> even<00:04:14.500> if<00:04:14.620> they<00:04:14.770> get<00:04:14.890> jostled<00:04:15.220> a<00:04:15.490> little

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
being even if they get jostled a little

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.840 
being even if they get jostled a little
bit<00:04:15.880> they're<00:04:16.060> usually<00:04:16.270> okay<00:04:17.459> just<00:04:18.459> try<00:04:18.670> not<00:04:18.700> to

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
bit they're usually okay just try not to

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:50.700 
bit they're usually okay just try not to
let<00:04:18.970> it<00:04:19.090> happen<00:04:19.180> too<00:04:19.570> often

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.070 

you<00:04:51.310> can<00:04:51.490> probably<00:04:51.640> candle<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.300> eggs<00:04:52.450> too<00:04:52.840> and

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
you can probably candle the eggs too and

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:33.610 
you can probably candle the eggs too and
see<00:04:53.320> how<00:04:53.470> they<00:04:53.680> look

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.850 

I<00:05:33.710> also<00:05:34.310> keep<00:05:34.669> a<00:05:34.820> record<00:05:35.000> book<00:05:35.479> of<00:05:35.860> when

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
I also keep a record book of when

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.560 
I also keep a record book of when
everybody's<00:05:37.370> laid<00:05:37.610> eggs<00:05:37.820> even<00:05:38.180> if<00:05:38.270> they<00:05:38.419> just

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
everybody's laid eggs even if they just

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.120 
everybody's laid eggs even if they just
end<00:05:38.780> up<00:05:38.900> being<00:05:39.199> dud<00:05:39.470> eggs<00:05:41.590> just<00:05:42.590> a<00:05:42.710> good<00:05:42.860> idea

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
end up being dud eggs just a good idea

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.590 
end up being dud eggs just a good idea
to<00:05:43.310> get<00:05:43.430> in<00:05:43.550> the<00:05:43.610> habit<00:05:43.760> of<00:05:43.970> keeping<00:05:44.120> track<00:05:44.570> of

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
to get in the habit of keeping track of

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.180 
to get in the habit of keeping track of
that<00:05:45.190> so<00:05:46.190> she's<00:05:46.430> gonna<00:05:46.610> get<00:05:46.850> some<00:05:48.190> dusted

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
that so she's gonna get some dusted

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.520 
that so she's gonna get some dusted
roaches<00:05:49.610> tonight<00:05:49.940> if<00:05:50.240> she'll<00:05:50.389> take<00:05:50.570> them<00:05:51.790> and

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
roaches tonight if she'll take them and

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.080 
roaches tonight if she'll take them and
she'll<00:05:54.530> probably<00:05:54.740> eat<00:05:55.010> them<00:05:55.160> because<00:05:55.550> she's<00:05:56.060> a

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
she'll probably eat them because she's a

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:05.150 
she'll probably eat them because she's a
big<00:05:56.330> fatty
