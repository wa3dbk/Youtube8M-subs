00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.670
 sacchi nuncia virdis but it is still a 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.620
 milan that immediately scares inter 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.510
 so much so that the third row touches the head 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.969
 for zenga that outgoing and exceeded by 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.040
 ball watch the two in slow motion 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.289
 Interists are face to face but not yes 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.539
 they understand and the ball ends up in the bag 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.619
 come maybe he should have stayed in 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.600
 door 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.369
 the inter reaction is confused lindsay 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.869
 and it only produces this thread of 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.599
 cioci that in half inverted commits 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.269
 roosters and the Milan that plays better and 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.099
 trapattoni worries about trying to 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.350
 call his own but it's all useless 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.360
 colombo cross in area rejects the defense 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.710
 Inter and Donadoni captures the full 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.510
 crosspiece 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.649
 shortly after taxotti and gullit come down 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.219
 well but the Dutchman's conclusion 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.629
 wrong also the recovery inter ha le 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.219
 unclear ideas and proves it 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.079
 mandorlini when favored by a 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.300
 rebound is found only in front of roosters 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.910
 instead of pulling passes to altobelli in 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.680
 clear offside still makes itself 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.570
 dangerous milan with this turn of 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.820
 head to tell you recently entered that 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.559
 forces the zenga to fly on the finish 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.300
 the inter obstinately tries to 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.070
 get to the same highbelli gets free 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.220
 well but instead of trying to pull some 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.299
 mate and opportunity fades 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.840
 at the microphone we hear brown pizzul 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.400
 trapattoni and sacks and milan prevailed 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.400
 in this first time and we have it 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.939
 understood a lot even hit a stake 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.680
 perhaps he legitimized this advantage 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.180
 in the second half I would say he had the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.340
 merit of being able to control the tender well 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.350
 and have not had the credit are 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.610
 quantitatively to equalize a little 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.040
 how much they did in the first one 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.659
 time creating a beautiful goal ball e 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.210
 two cues from altobelli on the left 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.670
 who could not even give us this goal 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.100
 unfortunately for mandolins that moment has 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.750
 past the ball we will see if high well 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.540
 was offside less 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.399
 I believe that even while giving the love of a 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.740
 nice game at Milan I was wearing though 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.770
 definitely match this race 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.079
 arrigo sacchi will pass a merry Christmas e 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.920
 thanks also to the most unpredictable of the 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.990
 Santas ferre well would be unfair 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.460
 for irons and also not very generous in 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.070
 our comparisons I would say we have it 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.810
 past that this team wanted 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.140
 pass showed on the field the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.140
 own value
