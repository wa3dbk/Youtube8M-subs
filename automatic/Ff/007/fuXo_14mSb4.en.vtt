00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
face a little I used gum Tex I sprinkled

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.460

a little bit of gum Tex into my fondant
so<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.159> could<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.520> something<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.000> little

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
so that I could have something a little

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.999 
so that I could have something a little
more<00:01:18.240> pliable<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:19.049> work<00:01:19.200> with<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.770> it

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
more pliable to work with and it

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.310 
more pliable to work with and it
actually<00:01:20.189> worked<00:01:21.000> very<00:01:21.240> well<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.780> had<00:01:22.049> less

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
actually worked very well I had less

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.170 
actually worked very well I had less
cracking<00:01:22.860> than<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.130> normally<00:01:23.189> would<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:24.030> i

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
cracking than I normally would if i

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.170 
cracking than I normally would if i
tried<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.780> use<00:01:24.890> gum<00:01:25.890> paste<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.490> its<00:01:26.700> own<00:01:26.850> or

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
tried to use gum paste on its own or

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.700 
tried to use gum paste on its own or
even<00:01:27.210> fondant<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.020> its<00:01:28.200> own<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:29.750> we<00:01:30.750> treated<00:01:31.560> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
even fondant on its own so we treated a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.719 
even fondant on its own so we treated a
tear<00:01:32.009> drop<00:01:32.250> shape<00:01:32.820> for<00:01:33.090> his<00:01:33.240> body<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:34.729> two

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
pieces for his feet and i just used an

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.350 
pieces for his feet and i just used an
exacto<00:01:38.729> knife<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:40.250> make<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.430> indent<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:42.180> his

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.260 
exacto knife to make the indent for his
feet<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.930> my<00:01:43.710> end<00:01:43.950> gives<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.579> good<00:01:44.759> tip<00:01:45.000> where

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
feet and my end gives a good tip where

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.160 
feet and my end gives a good tip where
she<00:01:45.950> ever<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.250> lightly<00:01:47.460> dips<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.659> tips<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:49.020> her

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
she ever so lightly dips the tips of her

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.310 
she ever so lightly dips the tips of her
fingers<00:01:49.200> into<00:01:50.360> Crisco<00:01:51.360> or<00:01:51.630> shortening<00:01:52.110> and

fingers into Crisco or shortening and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.249 
fingers into Crisco or shortening and
then<00:01:53.130> smooth<00:01:53.549> out<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.149> feet<00:01:54.390> after<00:01:54.869> she<00:01:55.020> makes

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
then smooth out the feet after she makes

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.380 
then smooth out the feet after she makes
the<00:01:55.470> indents<00:01:55.829> that's<00:01:56.130> exactly<00:01:56.640> what<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.820> did<00:01:57.149> to
