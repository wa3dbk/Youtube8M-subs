the underground crimson it took me a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.450

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
fish it out I don't know the exact stats

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.880 
fish it out I don't know the exact stats
on<00:00:50.219> actually<00:00:50.760> getting<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.680> think<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.860> a

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
on actually getting it I think it is a

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.290 
on actually getting it I think it is a
pretty<00:00:53.190> rare<00:00:53.399> just<00:00:53.730> because<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.120> took<00:00:54.239> me

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
pretty rare just because it took me

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.810 
pretty rare just because it took me
quite<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.230> while<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.590> get<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.039> took<00:00:56.160> me<00:00:56.340> over<00:00:56.550> an

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
quite a while to get it took me over an

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.240 
quite a while to get it took me over an
hour<00:00:56.969> straight<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.719> fishing<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.230> get<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.129> so

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
hour straight to fishing to get it so

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.319 
hour straight to fishing to get it so
hopefully<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.640> guys<00:00:59.760> are<00:00:59.940> more<00:01:00.030> lucky<00:01:00.300> than

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
hopefully you guys are more lucky than

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.939 
hopefully you guys are more lucky than
that<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:01.140> if<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.320> happen<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.590> do<00:01:01.770> some

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
that but if you happen to do some

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.979 
that but if you happen to do some
fishing<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.460> get<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.940> lot<00:01:03.329> faster<00:01:03.629> than

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
fishing and you get it a lot faster than

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.859 
fishing and you get it a lot faster than
me<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> pretty<00:01:05.100> great<00:01:05.640> hard<00:01:06.360> load<00:01:06.600> weapon

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
me it is a pretty great hard load weapon

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.750 
me it is a pretty great hard load weapon
considering<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.650> can<00:01:07.830> start<00:01:08.159> fishing<00:01:08.520> in

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
considering you can start fishing in

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.149 
considering you can start fishing in
hard<00:01:08.970> mode<00:01:09.030> immediately<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.080> get<00:01:11.010> this

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
hard mode immediately and get this

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.710 
hard mode immediately and get this
weapon<00:01:11.549> instead<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.970> having<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.210> kill<00:01:12.360> bosses

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
weapon instead of having to kill bosses

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.480 
weapon instead of having to kill bosses
and<00:01:12.869> stuff<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.229> let's<00:01:13.409> just<00:01:13.590> take<00:01:14.220> some<00:01:14.400> hits

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
and stuff so let's just take some hits

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.800 
and stuff so let's just take some hits
on<00:01:14.670> some<00:01:14.820> dummies<00:01:15.180> here<00:01:15.330> as<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.509> can<00:01:15.630> see

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
on some dummies here as you can see

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.660 
on some dummies here as you can see
there<00:01:15.990> goes<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> icarus<00:01:16.619> stream<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.520> can

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
there goes the icarus stream and you can

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.490 
there goes the icarus stream and you can
see<00:01:17.880> it's<00:01:18.060> messing<00:01:18.570> them<00:01:18.630> up<00:01:18.750> pretty<00:01:19.229> darn

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
see it's messing them up pretty darn

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.460 
see it's messing them up pretty darn
good<00:01:19.740> there<00:01:20.299> the<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.810> course<00:01:21.990> if<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.290> stream

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
good there the of course if the stream

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.690 
good there the of course if the stream
is<00:01:22.530> gonna<00:01:22.619> actually<00:01:22.950> lower<00:01:23.100> their<00:01:23.310> defense

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
is gonna actually lower their defense

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.210 
is gonna actually lower their defense
also<00:01:23.939> which<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.509> cool<00:01:24.720> thing<00:01:24.869> about<00:01:24.900> it

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
also which is the cool thing about it

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.620 
also which is the cool thing about it
but<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.520> was<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> great<00:01:26.820> Arg<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.270> as<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.450> see

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
but that was a great Arg and as you see

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.190 
but that was a great Arg and as you see
it<00:01:27.720> actually<00:01:28.080> only<00:01:28.409> penetrates<00:01:29.119> 3<00:01:30.119> 6<00:01:30.299> 9<00:01:30.329> 12<00:01:31.820> no

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
it actually only penetrates 3 6 9 12 no

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.800 
it actually only penetrates 3 6 9 12 no
12<00:01:34.200> stacks<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.950> units

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
12 stacks of units

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.240 
12 stacks of units
whatever<00:01:36.140> that<00:01:36.229> makes<00:01:36.590> sense<00:01:36.860> that's<00:01:37.040> the

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
whatever that makes sense that's the

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.950 
whatever that makes sense that's the
most<00:01:37.399> I<00:01:37.549> ever<00:01:37.640> got<00:01:37.850> out<00:01:37.880> of<00:01:38.180> it<00:01:38.299> so<00:01:38.630> I<00:01:38.659> don't

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
most I ever got out of it so I don't

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.050 
most I ever got out of it so I don't
know<00:01:39.079> if<00:01:39.200> it<00:01:39.290> does<00:01:39.470> more<00:01:40.369> or<00:01:40.520> less<00:01:40.640> out<00:01:40.820> of<00:01:40.850> that

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
know if it does more or less out of that

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.749 
know if it does more or less out of that
