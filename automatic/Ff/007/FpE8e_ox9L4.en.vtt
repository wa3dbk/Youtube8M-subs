00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 in São Paulo now yes the judge whistles 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.030
 ball comes back to roll and returns to roll with 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.590
 another sense of the expression or the 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.540
 corinthians of an exit but nobody was 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.519
 for the game the nautical returns the ball 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.500
 How do you know common sense is a 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.140
 movement that already brings together over 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.880
 professional athletes in brazil and they 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.189
 are demanding improvements in 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.609
 calendar want less games want 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.429
 vacation of 30 days without interruption want 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.380
 30-day preseason also want 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.120
 more games for the teams only compete 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.010
 state championships for example at last 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.440
 common sense has made several 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.320
 manifestations and is in this movement 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.510
 without a fight is another one of them. 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.789
 here at the beginning of the game in pernambuco 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.960
 for Corinthians and Nautical is for the 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.250
 Corinthians players stay 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.340
 from here the nautical staff to 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.390
 stop right there 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:59.609
 although the game is only at stake now 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.430
 apparently the start will start 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.210
 worth way defender alison oil 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.689
 felipe massa that disposes felipe 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.990
 came with his head there but ran over 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:15.090
 played the real James on the ground and the referee 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.759
 marked the absence of the Corinthian defender 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:26.100
 what delicacy and subtlety and elegance of the 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:28.350
 nautical american football gave a 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.290
 ball and you 're seeing real James, right? 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.939
 It's kind of groggy, it would not be any 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.610
 news also here today the rodriguinho 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.770

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.520
 we passed the letters and the ball by 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.020
 cover slipped out 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.310
 only goal shot to the team 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.380
 Pernambuco 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.939
 here comes the high ball on the second crossbar 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.189
 Kleber 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.680
 He went up well and won high up there but the 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:57.000
 header went out alone is also on the ball 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:02.700
 Thrown out to the middle duck out 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.640
 the first big chance of the game 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.310
 in her plays of edenílson in the table 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.340
 with danilo here the effort at the intersection 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.320
 the duck searched for the left angle but 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.050
 missed the chance missed the chance 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.459
 corinthians left alexandra play with 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.459
 rodriguinho 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.190
 Daddy got in the middle of dribbling legs. 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.950
 and played back in the guilherme played pro 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.260
 duck again ralf ralf tried 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.850
 cover but sin for alessandro vai 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.560
 pro cross brought to the right foot 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.370
 that the good rolled in the entrance of the area to 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.530
 romaria turn the ball out 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.660
 arrived well the corinthians a good move 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.940
 d'alessandro on the left 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.500
 the ending of the romarinho is over 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.590
 rising too are you seeing there again the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.540
 romania in dominates geoff having closed the 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.000
 nautical danilo moves good ball 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.620
 for the duck and romarinho won romarinho 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.510
 both felipe corinthians player shot 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.370
 vacillating maikon milk rang the arrival of 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.959
 morales is messy corinthians 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.269
 morals brought to the left there comes the 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:07.019
 beat I prefer another cut filipe does 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:10.290
 A touch on the law ball knocks out 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.880
 Corinthians made a damn force to 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.390
 take a goal on that bid 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.549
 in the incredible failure of Felipe almost almost 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.380
 the nautical arrived and then the finish 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.810
 I missed the target 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.560
 at the best moment of the shipwreck 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.720
 best 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.170
 romarinho raising the ball to danilo 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.810
 ricardo berna makes the defense in search 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.790
 Morales goes to ralf beat 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.320
 crossed 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.320
 the goal 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:51.980
 the nautical derley and the mark of seven 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:55.870
 minutes second time fan party 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.780
 of the nautical the worst attack of the championship 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.250
 wins the best defense of the championship 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.250
 cross of morals she got to pick up 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.800
 on the tip of the kleber's boot, 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.590
 Felipe chance but did not take the chance 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.670
 the law that behind swerved to 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.350
 open the board 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:17.480
 the nautical 1 to 0 of law and 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.550
 Then I saw him there and tried to find him. Rodriguinho tried 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.620
 launch by romarinho straightened to the 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.790
 guilherme camilo heel shot 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:29.980
 Rolled out came 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:31.150
 and otitis is thinking one more that goes 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.250
 out 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.050
 but corinthians fan liked it 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.180
 see that it was a good play romarinho 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.370
 fixing the guilherme arriving the 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.260
 heel toe and the finishing of 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.180
 rodriguinho was identical the attacker did not 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.870
 push a kick in the post hair that 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.730
 whole thing 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.020
 ricardo berna is taking a card 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:51.130
 yellow and has been expelled 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.050
 The referee is expelled from the field. 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.260
 showed yellow 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:59.350
 he came back and continued to make wax 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:03.130
 the referee of a second yellow and ejected 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:07.800
 goalkeeper ricardo berna de campo is the 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.800
 elmo alves resende wedge 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.430
 the show two yellows and expelled the 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.590
 goalkeeper ricardo berna 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.000
 Bern applauded true after the 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:21.480
 yellow card 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.280
 milton no doubt with irony 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:27.270
 ended up receiving the second yellow and was 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:30.160
 kick out of the field goalkeeper ricardo berna 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.560
 who will try to talk and behind the goal 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.360
 with gleison ferreira milk, which is the 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.360
 additional referee after goal 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.230
 talk has nothing to do with it 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.960
 I arrived now, I did not pay much 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:50.230
 attention has nothing to do with this to that is 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.490
 the yellow card and soon after he pulled 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.770
 the second yellow he gave the yellow 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.840
 because the neighborhood was making wax and then 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:59.770
 when he's coming back to him 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.420
 recovery and gives a second yellow card and pulls 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.090
 red from the back pocket was exactly 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:07.090
 at that moment as Victor recorded 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:10.320
 that's the thing he took yellow're right 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.320
 making wax took yellow 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.710
 now he applauds the judge ironically 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.170
 because it received yellow 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.270
 I think it's correct lyon snow if it were 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.370
 just by the wax would I tell you that the 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.050
 habit and exaggerated but now 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:30.070
 very clear and victor brought information 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:32.770
 the image is confirm this is the irony that 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.350
 Bern's ironic behavior justifies 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.000
 the red card was well expelled and 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.169
 it comes out cursing kléber is not that 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.550
 participated in the bid there 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:41.620
 the judge gave lack we found 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.020
 attack was not missing them like china 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.090
 crepe from far there too ask why the 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.770
 kleber took the fight in diego 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.930
 Macedo brought by my expensive shot 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:53.729
 He preferred to roll a good ball for Rodriguinho. 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:57.039
 ahead and Romarinho got out 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:58.840
 Another good chance, Romarinho again. 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:00.669
 romario press calibrated in the leg 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.039
 who does not hit one in the goal 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:05.529
 Who is going to leave now is denilson vai? 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:07.689
 although with 21 between the tim that collapsed 

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:09.460
 with 35 only has four games for 

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:11.770
 corinthians 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.770
 so there comes the Chinese 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:21.699
 to sesau 41 comes the high ball in the area 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:24.430
 diverting guilherme espalma gina defender 

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:25.360
 from the nautical goalkeeper saving goal from 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.449
 draw 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.219
 In the head of the game you are in 

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:30.909
 to reformulate the cast for 

00:07:30.219 --> 00:07:32.229
 next year 

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:34.120
 Look the diego macedo crossed in the area 

00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:39.969
 Felipe has taken his place and left 

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:42.729
 romarinho cable shooting budget the dressing room I 

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:43.659
 I'll say it again, that explains a lot 

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:46.089
 thing 

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:49.629
 the completion of the romarinho as almost 

00:07:46.089 --> 00:07:52.110
 all he tried in the game explains 

00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:52.110
 a lot of things
