my<00:02:27.340> bottom<00:02:28.210> bundle<00:02:28.630> I<00:02:28.870> noticed<00:02:29.710> that<00:02:29.800> there

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
my bottom bundle I noticed that there

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.550 
my bottom bundle I noticed that there
was<00:02:30.100> a<00:02:30.130> gap<00:02:30.540> I'm<00:02:31.540> pretty<00:02:31.780> big<00:02:31.960> gap<00:02:32.200> in<00:02:32.440> between

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
was a gap I'm pretty big gap in between

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.990 
was a gap I'm pretty big gap in between
the<00:02:33.490> 24<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.540> 22<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.650> I<00:02:36.460> got<00:02:36.640> this<00:02:36.820> because

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
the 24 and the 22 and I got this because

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.820 
the 24 and the 22 and I got this because
I<00:02:37.240> measured<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.660> hair<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.050> this<00:02:38.170> bottom

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
I measured the hair and this bottom

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.440 
I measured the hair and this bottom
bundle<00:02:39.100> actually<00:02:39.580> measures<00:02:39.880> up<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.030> be<00:02:40.240> about

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
bundle actually measures up to be about

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.520 
bundle actually measures up to be about
26<00:02:40.870> 27

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
26 27

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.840 
26 27
so<00:02:42.010> let's<00:02:42.130> nice<00:02:42.280> take<00:02:42.460> it<00:02:42.550> a<00:02:42.580> little<00:02:42.700> bit

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
so let's nice take it a little bit

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.000 
so let's nice take it a little bit
longer<00:02:43.180> here<00:02:43.570> and<00:02:43.870> then<00:02:44.530> what<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.800> came<00:02:44.980> for

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
longer here and then what you came for

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.800 
longer here and then what you came for
you<00:02:45.370> kind<00:02:45.580> of<00:02:45.640> funky<00:02:45.970> get<00:02:46.120> more<00:02:46.300> bang<00:02:46.480> for<00:02:46.510> your

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
you kind of funky get more bang for your

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.920 
you kind of funky get more bang for your
buck<00:02:47.490> I'm<00:02:48.490> again<00:02:48.820> I<00:02:49.060> was<00:02:49.180> right<00:02:49.450> now<00:02:49.570> I'd<00:02:49.810> be

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
buck I'm again I was right now I'd be

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.420 
buck I'm again I was right now I'd be
like<00:02:49.960> the<00:02:50.290> air<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.500> like<00:02:50.710> it<00:02:50.890> more<00:02:51.040> than<00:02:51.100> when<00:02:51.340> I

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
like the air I like it more than when I

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.740 
like the air I like it more than when I
received<00:02:51.730> it

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
received it

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.780 
received it
oh<00:02:52.810> look<00:02:55.230> I'm<00:02:56.230> not<00:02:56.590> sure<00:02:56.830> again<00:02:57.280> if<00:02:57.460> the<00:02:57.580> air<00:02:57.760> is

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
oh look I'm not sure again if the air is

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.900 
oh look I'm not sure again if the air is
gonna<00:02:58.150> last<00:02:58.450> me<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:59.110> hear<00:02:59.830> of<00:02:59.950> six<00:03:00.190> months<00:03:00.460> I

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
gonna last me a hear of six months I

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.810 
gonna last me a hear of six months I
don't<00:03:01.540> think<00:03:01.720> it'll<00:03:01.840> last<00:03:01.990> that<00:03:02.320> long<00:03:02.820> just

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
don't think it'll last that long just

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.790 
don't think it'll last that long just
because<00:03:04.150> again<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.750> ends<00:03:05.080> do<00:03:05.260> sing<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.530> little

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
because again the ends do sing a little

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.250 
because again the ends do sing a little
bit<00:03:05.920> and<00:03:06.490> it<00:03:06.760> does<00:03:06.940> shed<00:03:08.760> not<00:03:09.760> excessively<00:03:10.450> but

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
bit and it does shed not excessively but

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.860 
bit and it does shed not excessively but
I<00:03:11.350> feel<00:03:11.560> like<00:03:11.680> when<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.040> hair<00:03:12.250> comes<00:03:12.550> out<00:03:12.870> they

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
I feel like when the hair comes out they

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.820 
I feel like when the hair comes out they
come<00:03:14.140> out<00:03:14.380> in<00:03:15.070> large<00:03:15.330> portions<00:03:16.330> like<00:03:16.870> more

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
come out in large portions like more

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.850 
come out in large portions like more
than<00:03:18.100> one<00:03:18.459> or<00:03:18.610> two<00:03:18.640> strands<00:03:19.120> come<00:03:19.360> out<00:03:19.540> when<00:03:19.870> it

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
than one or two strands come out when it

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.970 
than one or two strands come out when it
does<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.940> I<00:03:22.060> did<00:03:22.270> so<00:03:22.540> my<00:03:22.690> web<00:03:22.930> Sardo<00:03:23.709> that

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
does and I did so my web Sardo that

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.540 
does and I did so my web Sardo that
does<00:03:24.160> have<00:03:25.140> you<00:03:26.140> know<00:03:26.170> a<00:03:26.500> part<00:03:26.800> in<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:27.220> so

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
does have you know a part in it so

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.000 
does have you know a part in it so
probably<00:03:27.970> if<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.330> ever<00:03:28.570> took<00:03:28.720> this<00:03:28.900> apart<00:03:29.350> now<00:03:29.709> I

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
probably if I ever took this apart now I

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.220 
probably if I ever took this apart now I
would<00:03:30.640> definitely<00:03:31.090> go<00:03:31.209> ahead<00:03:31.239> and<00:03:31.780> sell<00:03:32.080> those

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
would definitely go ahead and sell those

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.360 
would definitely go ahead and sell those
webs<00:03:32.560> and<00:03:33.480> so<00:03:34.620> while<00:03:35.620> I<00:03:35.650> have<00:03:35.920> this<00:03:36.100> piece

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
webs and so while I have this piece

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.470 
webs and so while I have this piece
straight<00:03:36.670> and<00:03:36.820> I'm<00:03:36.910> just<00:03:37.030> going<00:03:37.209> to<00:03:37.300> show<00:03:37.420> you

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.240 
straight and I'm just going to show you
how<00:03:37.660> it<00:03:37.870> curls

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
how it curls

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.550 
how it curls
maybe<00:03:40.239> one<00:03:40.510> day<00:03:40.540> I'll<00:03:40.930> straighten<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.440> whole

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
maybe one day I'll straighten the whole

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.280 
maybe one day I'll straighten the whole
thing<00:03:41.800> just<00:03:42.010> to<00:03:42.190> see<00:03:42.340> how<00:03:42.489> it<00:03:42.670> looks<00:03:43.110> but<00:03:44.110> eyes

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
thing just to see how it looks but eyes

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.949 
thing just to see how it looks but eyes
are<00:03:44.470> very<00:03:44.590> not<00:03:44.860> really<00:03:45.130> like<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.430> deep<00:03:45.610> wave

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
are very not really like the deep wave

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.250 
are very not really like the deep wave
texture<00:03:46.959> that<00:03:47.140> it<00:03:47.290> is<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:49.630> it's<00:03:49.840> a<00:03:49.930> little<00:03:49.959> bit

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
texture that it is and it's a little bit

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.920 
texture that it is and it's a little bit
more<00:03:50.500> on<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:50.890> curly<00:03:51.220> side<00:03:51.430> then<00:03:51.820> and<00:03:52.180> I'm

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
more on the curly side then and I'm

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:05.850 
more on the curly side then and I'm
deeply<00:03:53.140> but<00:03:53.800> I<00:03:54.100> really<00:03:55.090> like<00:03:55.269> it

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:20.430 

I'm<00:04:06.860> just<00:04:07.040> gonna<00:04:07.250> show<00:04:07.550> you<00:04:07.580> how<00:04:07.970> it<00:04:08.120> curls

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.040 

and<00:04:21.440> that's<00:04:21.740> just<00:04:22.010> a<00:04:22.160> small<00:04:22.340> piece<00:04:23.050> it's

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
and that's just a small piece it's

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.580 
and that's just a small piece it's
really<00:04:24.290> pretty<00:04:24.500> bouncy<00:04:28.510> China<00:04:29.510> my<00:04:29.720> house

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
my natural hair just to help it blend a

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.090 
my natural hair just to help it blend a
little<00:05:04.670> bit<00:05:04.820> better<00:05:05.500> and<00:05:06.500> these<00:05:06.710> are<00:05:06.950> the

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
little bit better and these are the

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.360 
little bit better and these are the
curls<00:05:07.540> also<00:05:08.540> I'm<00:05:09.350> I<00:05:09.530> noticed<00:05:09.920> that<00:05:10.100> the

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
curls also I'm I noticed that the

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.840 
curls also I'm I noticed that the
pattern<00:05:10.910> in<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.830> color<00:05:12.830> doesn't<00:05:13.280> match<00:05:13.610> the

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
pattern in the color doesn't match the

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.390 
pattern in the color doesn't match the
hair<00:05:14.060> exactly<00:05:14.690> and<00:05:15.170> I<00:05:15.590> kind<00:05:15.830> of<00:05:15.920> bothers<00:05:16.250> me

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
hair exactly and I kind of bothers me

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.980 
hair exactly and I kind of bothers me
because<00:05:16.640> as<00:05:16.910> far<00:05:17.120> as<00:05:17.240> when<00:05:17.420> the<00:05:17.510> hair<00:05:17.690> is<00:05:17.810> all

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
because as far as when the hair is all

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.570 
because as far as when the hair is all
wet<00:05:18.020> and<00:05:18.380> normally<00:05:18.920> how<00:05:19.010> it<00:05:19.160> comes<00:05:19.370> together

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
wet and normally how it comes together

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.270 
wet and normally how it comes together
the<00:05:20.480> closure<00:05:20.900> doesn't<00:05:21.470> really<00:05:21.650> blend<00:05:21.920> you<00:05:22.130> can

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
the closure doesn't really blend you can

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.160 
the closure doesn't really blend you can
see<00:05:22.460> right<00:05:22.610> here<00:05:22.670> like<00:05:23.540> this<00:05:23.690> is<00:05:23.870> the<00:05:23.960> closure

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170 
see right here like this is the closure

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.700 
see right here like this is the closure
and<00:05:24.650> the<00:05:25.690> curling<00:05:26.690> wave<00:05:26.900> pattern<00:05:27.440> is<00:05:27.590> a<00:05:27.620> little

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
and the curling wave pattern is a little

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.580 
and the curling wave pattern is a little
bit<00:05:28.010> looser<00:05:28.400> and<00:05:28.760> the<00:05:29.210> actual<00:05:29.630> extensions<00:05:30.230> but

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
bit looser and the actual extensions but

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.030 
bit looser and the actual extensions but
it's<00:05:30.920> not<00:05:31.100> a<00:05:31.130> super<00:05:31.490> big<00:05:31.640> deal

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
it's not a super big deal

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:45.040 
it's not a super big deal
and<00:05:34.040> this<00:05:34.250> is<00:05:34.400> all<00:05:34.610> the<00:05:35.650> back<00:05:40.150> okay

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.500 

and<00:05:46.050> just<00:05:46.260> come<00:05:46.500> alone

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.640 

so<00:05:51.510> the<00:05:51.630> surprise<00:05:51.780> recommend<00:05:52.320> in<00:05:52.380> the<00:05:52.440> air<00:05:52.620> I

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
so the surprise recommend in the air I

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.520 
so the surprise recommend in the air I
would<00:05:52.830> recommend<00:05:53.460> it<00:05:53.610> and<00:05:54.320> before<00:05:55.320> I<00:05:55.350> had

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
would recommend it and before I had

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.930 
would recommend it and before I had
