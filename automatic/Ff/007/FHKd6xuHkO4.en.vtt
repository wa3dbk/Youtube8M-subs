00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.590
 in this practice data of the 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.619
 price of three products this case milk 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.200
 cheese and butter since 2002 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.210
 until the year 2009 and the proposed 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.079
 calculation of an index in this case 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.070
 composed of the price of products 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:29.560
 dairy products 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.930
 first we will calculate the index 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.630
 composed through the mean 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:38.140
 simple arithmetic for this we must 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.970
 previously calculate the simple indices 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.470
 of each of the products by 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:48.040
 separated first we will calculate 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.870
 for milk the simple index taking 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.040
 as a base period the first period the 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.040
 series of the year 2002 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:02.380
 for cheese and simple with the period 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.380
 base and for butter 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.490
 simple 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.010
 for periods 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.740
 to calculate on that simple milk 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.560
 we will calculate the quotient between the value 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.390
 of the series in each period between 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.970
 value of the series in the base period that 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:27.090
 in this case in the year 2002 fixing it 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.090
 with efe 4 and multiplying by 100 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.509
 to calculate that says cheese simple 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:38.659
 we will do the same thing will be equal to the quotient 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:41.869
 between the price of the cheese in each 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:47.450
 period divided by the price of cheese 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:50.209
 in the base period fixing it with efe 4 and 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.609
 multiplying by 100 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:54.259
 finally the simple index 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:56.840
 corresponding to the butter will be 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.990
 equal to the value of the series in each 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.220
 period between the value of the series of 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.290
 base period fixed with efe 4 and 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.570
 multiplied by 100 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.280
 once the simple index of 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.240
 the three products for the first 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.550
 period 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.760
 we can drag them for the rest of the 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.760
 series 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.689
 and we would have the table with the indexes 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.810
 simple of the three products by 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.810
 separated 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:32.599
 to calculate that compound by the 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.599
 simple arithmetic mean method 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.170
 what will we illuminate 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.709
 the price index of products 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.709
 Dairy will be calculated as the average 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:50.430
 arithmetic of the different indices 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:55.400
 simple for this we can use the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.400
 average function of the hexa we have equal 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.319
 we write the average function we open 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.689
 parenthesis 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.060
 and we mark the three values ​​of those that 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:07.760
 let's calculate your average 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.560
 The parentheses 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.500
 as expected for the base period 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.550
 2002 the simple index should always be valid 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.510
 100 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:21.270
 for the rest of the periods dragging the 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.850
 formula down 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.930
 we calculate this composite index as 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.859
 arithmetic mean of simple indices 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.680
 we can conclude therefore that average 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:37.530
 taking as reference the year 2002 in 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.219
 2005 the prices of the products 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:45.109
 dairy products increased by 11 3 percent 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:45.109
 with respect to the year 2002 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.219
 another proposed method for calculating 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:57.069
 compound or complex indices is the 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:58.930
 method of the mean adds simple tiba the 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:04.620
 media adds simple tiba and consists of 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:07.290
 create an aggregate variable 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.330
 which is will get as the sum of the 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.870
 prices of each of the products by 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.210
 separated 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.000
 that is to say 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:19.180
 the total price of milk products 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.820
 that butter will be equal to the price 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:26.400
 of milk more 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.430
 the price of cheese more 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.270
 the price of butter for the year 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.270
 2002 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.360
 calculating this sum for the rest of the 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.949
 period 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.280
 we will have a new series that 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:46.490
 we call aggregate as the sum of the 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.550
 prices of different products 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:52.849
 and the complex index of the average adds 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.300
 you go simple will be calculated as an index 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.300
 simple 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.880
 of the previous series the series added 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.169
 that is, be equal to the value of the series 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.349
 added 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:10.120
 between the value of the series degraded in 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:10.120
 the base period year 2002 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.770
 multiplied by 100 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.450
 and once written the formulas for the 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:23.050
 first period we can drag them to 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.050
 the rest of the period 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.490
 are two alternative methods for the 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.490
 calculation of complex indices
