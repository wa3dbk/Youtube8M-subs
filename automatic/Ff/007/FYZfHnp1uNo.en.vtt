00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.769
 sort of experiment this will be the first series 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.049
 these podcasts in these podcasts will not 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.299
 the video will be a lot of pictures in that 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.010
 the moment it was four years ago I still 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.060
 did not shoot the video and took a lot of pictures 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.640
 I hope you will like it and will 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.220
 interesting i will not talk about 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.529
 tourist attractions 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.320
 I will be more precise, but they will not be very many 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.360
 there will be a lot of photos of my impressions 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.329
 about this country it was one of the first 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.710
 trips abroad for a long time then 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.930
 I have left Siberia from the campus 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.300
 Novosibirsk travel and first 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.200
 my story will be about the city business in 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.200
 which we flew in 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.969
 and so we will begin so what did I see in the body 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.300
 we arrived late in the evening right away 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.969
 let's go outside I don't remember how it is 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.760
 called this area such maine bazaar 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.340
 there are many cheap hotels and many 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.990
 tourists and raw pack on such 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.549
 transit point for all visitors 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.700
 independent travelers immediately 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:18.490
 did they find the room a very small room 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.350
 in the attic for only 100 rubles out of 100 rupees 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.020
 at that time it was only 2 dollars 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.899
 that is, we flew with Danil he is 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.869
 on some videos from me but flew and 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:32.190
 collapsed to sleep and in the morning I saw what 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:37.170
 I will see you now 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.170
 I went out onto the roof of the hotel and saw the city 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:55.590
 thick smog hung over the city 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:59.460
 or waist kites are all very colorful 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:04.960
 dilapidated building curves 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:07.569
 everywhere the laundry is dried 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.660
 the roof we spent a lot of time with 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:13.120
 one side it was convenient for 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.540
 photography I had a telephoto I could 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.130
 zoom in on some scenes from above 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.670
 snatch some shots from the street 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.220
 of life 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.959
 and on the other hand the roof is calmer 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.670
 no stranglehold and commotion 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.860
 At first it was difficult for me 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.530
 taking pictures of people because 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.230
 Russia is not very welcome people 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.720
 react to the camera rather negatively 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.760
 but then it turned out that the Indians are very 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.630
 responds well and positively to 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.450
 Well then this camera is not yet known 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.940
 besides many rooftop hotels 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.290
 there are restaurants in which it was possible 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.100
 sit still 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.680
 for hours and watch the street life by 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.620
 the streets were wandering cows and a few 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.830
 tourists on the cows are still visible traces 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.470
 paints after the holiday holi when all 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.660
 india hindu population sprinkling friend 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.000
 friend very bright colors 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.670
 unfortunately we did not catch this holiday 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.670
 we caught only the colored footprints 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:21.770
 below the anthill just boils all the life 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.080
 constantly signaling motor rickshaw 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.950
 laundry travel agencies hotels 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.060
 and restaurants 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.650
 all the time bibicate noisy but sometimes 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.350
 we came down from the roof 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.670
 I walked the streets now I will show 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:42.080
 these photos I wandered around the street he did not 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.080
 felt quite safe 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.150
 sometimes I went to some yards in 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.269
 which time has stopped and it seemed 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.010
 what of the yard here is some kind of 15th century 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.980
 stand carts 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.580
 peasants sit on the ground and roast on 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.110
 bonfire 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.110
 some pies 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.830
 traffic on the major streets of the city 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.390
 crazy all honking 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:14.170
 overtake the rules of the road by 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:17.220
 in a big way no it is the most chaotic 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.220
 probably a city on the planet 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:32.130
 in general, we lived in this city only 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.130
 three days and left fees 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:49.979
 but 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:00.230
 on the second day we moved to another 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.100
 the hotel next door and rented quite 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:07.580
 decent room there was very clean 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:11.570
 It was a TV fan and the cost of on 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:15.220
 my 400 rubles and it made him 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.220
 moment about 8 dollars 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:44.810
 I must say that in fact there are new ones 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:47.669
 business districts business centers 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:50.130
 I just wanted to show you exactly this 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.090
 area this area is next to 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.540
 train station 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.940
 this is straight the very center of business and why here 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.700
 settle backpacker and because very 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.610
 convenient to go anywhere in any part 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:05.760
 countries by train in india is very developed 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:10.400
 railway almost the whole country 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.400
 covered by a network of railways 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:24.120
 and after three days we left 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.340
 in the mountains in the town called the bus 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:31.830
