device has been designed with two
integrated<00:00:32.500> curveball<00:00:33.100> factors<00:00:33.550> and<00:00:33.760> first

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
integrated curveball factors and first

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.390 
integrated curveball factors and first
around<00:00:34.239> the<00:00:34.360> front<00:00:34.800> see<00:00:35.800> flight<00:00:36.070> down<00:00:36.250> the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
around the front see flight down the

you<00:00:38.290> can<00:00:38.440> see<00:00:38.559> is<00:00:38.620> very<00:00:38.860> thin<00:00:39.129> device<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.690> they

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
you can see is very thin device and they

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.840 
you can see is very thin device and they
left<00:00:40.960> the<00:00:41.079> whole<00:00:41.260> overall<00:00:41.739> curve<00:00:42.070> across<00:00:42.700> the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
left the whole overall curve across the

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.240 
left the whole overall curve across the

the side here are integrated keys so we

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.229 
the side here are integrated keys so we
have<00:00:53.739> our<00:00:53.770> key<00:00:54.190> here<00:00:54.520> or<00:00:54.730> to<00:00:54.850> the<00:00:54.940> monitor

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
have our key here or to the monitor

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.479 
have our key here or to the monitor
program<00:00:55.449> to<00:00:55.899> camera<00:00:56.379> but<00:00:56.980> it<00:00:57.100> can<00:00:57.250> also<00:00:57.280> be

very slick and compelling also the new
platform<00:02:09.869> has<00:02:09.989> an<00:02:10.140> 800<00:02:10.530> megahertz<00:02:10.770> processor

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
platform has an 800 megahertz processor

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.790 
platform has an 800 megahertz processor
means<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.510> when<00:02:12.870> you're<00:02:13.020> open<00:02:13.290> for<00:02:13.319> example

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
means that when you're open for example

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.190 
means that when you're open for example
Facebook<00:02:13.980> here<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:15.000> speed<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.750> actual

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
Facebook here the speed that the actual

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.880 
Facebook here the speed that the actual
application<00:02:16.800> opens<00:02:17.130> is<00:02:17.430> very<00:02:17.700> fast<00:02:18.890> since

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
application opens is very fast since

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.030 
application opens is very fast since
similarly<00:02:20.670> if<00:02:20.850> I<00:02:21.030> show<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.480> email<00:02:21.959> then<00:02:22.860> you

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
similarly if I show you email then you

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.460 
similarly if I show you email then you
can<00:02:23.220> see<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.940> email<00:02:24.750> itself<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.350> very

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
can see that the email itself is very

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.740 
can see that the email itself is very
clear<00:02:27.260> ok<00:02:28.260> other<00:02:28.860> things<00:02:29.160> so<00:02:29.580> for<00:02:30.300> blackberry

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
clear ok other things so for blackberry

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.970 
clear ok other things so for blackberry
7<00:02:31.080> for<00:02:31.260> example<00:02:32.900> if<00:02:33.900> i<00:02:34.019> look<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.290> force<00:02:34.560> full

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
7 for example if i look to force full

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.820 
7 for example if i look to force full
square<00:02:35.340> then<00:02:35.940> full<00:02:36.239> square<00:02:36.569> is<00:02:36.830> integrated

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
square then full square is integrated

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.509 
square then full square is integrated
with<00:02:38.040> BBM<00:02:38.670> now<00:02:38.880> so<00:02:39.420> if<00:02:39.569> i<00:02:39.690> check<00:02:39.930> in<00:02:40.170> in<00:02:40.519> force

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
with BBM now so if i check in in force

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.699 
with BBM now so if i check in in force
for<00:02:41.850> square<00:02:42.299> so<00:02:42.540> for<00:02:42.690> example<00:02:42.750> i've<00:02:43.440> checked

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
for square so for example i've checked

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.759 
for square so for example i've checked
in<00:02:43.920> oil<00:02:44.250> into<00:02:45.049> after<00:02:46.049> where<00:02:46.260> we're<00:02:46.410> doing<00:02:46.620> the

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
in oil into after where we're doing the

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.680 
in oil into after where we're doing the
different<00:02:47.310> announcements<00:02:47.819> today<00:02:50.330> and<00:02:51.330> then

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
different announcements today and then

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.640 
different announcements today and then
if<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.900> go<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.140> my<00:02:53.030> bbm<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.269> can<00:02:55.170> see<00:02:55.320> that<00:02:55.530> it's

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
if I go to my bbm you can see that it's

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.500 
if I go to my bbm you can see that it's
