we<00:00:00.480> have<00:00:00.659> talked<00:00:00.989> now<00:00:01.230> of<00:00:01.550> crowdsourcing

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
we have talked now of crowdsourcing

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.150 
we have talked now of crowdsourcing
earthquake<00:00:03.510> warnings<00:00:03.990> and<00:00:04.230> that<00:00:04.740> if<00:00:04.859> they<00:00:04.980> can

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
earthquake warnings and that if they can

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.550 
earthquake warnings and that if they can
do<00:00:05.310> this<00:00:05.660> they're<00:00:06.660> gonna<00:00:06.750> try<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.080> bring<00:00:07.350> this

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
do this they're gonna try to bring this

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.370 
do this they're gonna try to bring this
out<00:00:07.799> here<00:00:08.010> for<00:00:08.189> people<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.519> use<00:00:09.019> now<00:00:10.019> they're

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
out here for people to use now they're

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.660 
out here for people to use now they're
seeing<00:00:10.559> their<00:00:10.710> sensors<00:00:11.130> inside<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.580> the

all about kidding there's critical

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.850 
all about kidding there's critical
moments<00:00:36.270> there's<00:00:36.480> warning<00:00:36.840> signs<00:00:37.079> before<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
moments there's warning signs before the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.229 
moments there's warning signs before the
quake<00:00:38.100> hits<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:39.680> they're<00:00:40.680> saying<00:00:41.239> finely

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
quake hits and they're saying finely

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.779 
quake hits and they're saying finely
tuned<00:00:42.540> scientific<00:00:43.610> instruments<00:00:44.610> such<00:00:44.760> as

tuned scientific instruments such as

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.680 
tuned scientific instruments such as
seismographs<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.760> that<00:00:47.760> technology<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:48.539> be

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
seismographs and that technology can be

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.920 
seismographs and that technology can be
used<00:00:48.989> by<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.200> USGS<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:52.309> incorporated<00:00:53.309> into

used by the USGS and incorporated into

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.810 
used by the USGS and incorporated into
an<00:00:54.930> application<00:00:55.379> similar<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.370> like<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.670> would

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
an application similar to like you would

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.990 
an application similar to like you would
see<00:00:57.000> with<00:00:57.300> GPS<00:00:57.840> or<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.170> fitness<00:00:58.770> tracker<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.699> a

see with GPS or a fitness tracker on a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.740 
see with GPS or a fitness tracker on a
smartphone<00:01:00.829> it<00:01:01.829> could<00:01:02.039> be<00:01:02.129> developed<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:03.600> give

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
smartphone it could be developed to give

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.719 
smartphone it could be developed to give
an<00:01:03.899> early<00:01:04.260> warning<00:01:04.589> for<00:01:05.040> these<00:01:05.159> quakes<00:01:05.430> and

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
an early warning for these quakes and

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.660 
an early warning for these quakes and
what<00:01:06.150> they<00:01:06.270> say<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:07.380> these<00:01:07.680> GPS<00:01:08.250> sensors

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
what they say is that these GPS sensors

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.109 
what they say is that these GPS sensors
can<00:01:08.820> identify<00:01:08.970> where<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.990> are<00:01:10.020> standing<00:01:10.409> and

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
can identify where you are standing and

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.649 
can identify where you are standing and
they<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.299> also<00:01:12.540> log<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.710> sudden<00:01:14.280> lurch<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.240> one

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
they can also log a sudden lurch in one

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.789 
they can also log a sudden lurch in one
direction<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:18.049> they're<00:01:19.049> saying<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.439> with

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
direction so they're saying that with

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.080 
direction so they're saying that with
that<00:01:20.040> if<00:01:20.880> there's<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.840> quake<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.640> people<00:01:23.640> shift

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
that if there's a quake and people shift

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.200 
that if there's a quake and people shift
off<00:01:24.619> into<00:01:25.619> one<00:01:25.860> direction<00:01:28.490> so<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.520> speak<00:01:29.939> that

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
off into one direction so to speak that

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.210 
off into one direction so to speak that
this<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.079> going<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.290> give<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:32.750> hint<00:01:34.040> to<00:01:35.040> other

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
this is going to give a hint to other

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.520 
this is going to give a hint to other
people<00:01:35.640> down<00:01:35.790> down<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.420> road<00:01:36.600> before<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
people down down the road before the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.300 
people down down the road before the
shaking<00:01:37.860> hits<00:01:38.520> them<00:01:39.500> so<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.829> thought<00:01:41.100> here

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
shaking hits them so it's a thought here

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.210 
shaking hits them so it's a thought here
there<00:01:44.310> are<00:01:44.490> earthquake<00:01:45.590> warning<00:01:46.590> systems<00:01:46.979> out

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
there are earthquake warning systems out

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.249 
there are earthquake warning systems out
there<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.520> they<00:01:47.850> have<00:01:48.470> but<00:01:49.880> you<00:01:50.880> know<00:01:51.259> quakes

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
there that they have but you know quakes

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.600 
there that they have but you know quakes
can<00:01:53.130> kind<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.369> creep<00:01:53.579> up<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:53.880> your<00:01:54.090> whenever

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
can kind of creep up on your whenever

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.190 
can kind of creep up on your whenever
and<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:57.270> guess<00:01:57.450> every<00:01:57.780> little<00:01:58.020> bit<00:01:58.140> of

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
and I guess every little bit of

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.179 
and I guess every little bit of
information<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.979> can<00:01:59.009> get<00:01:59.659> every<00:02:00.659> second

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
information you can get every second

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.580 
information you can get every second
