00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
another one let's try cube that's when I

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.899 
another one let's try cube that's when I
really<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.020> as<00:01:31.350> well<00:01:31.560> some<00:01:32.430> will<00:01:32.579> go<00:01:32.670> back<00:01:32.880> to

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
really like as well some will go back to

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.929 
really like as well some will go back to
my<00:01:33.180> home<00:01:33.420> screen<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.140> I'm<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> slob<00:01:35.369> from<00:01:35.729> page

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
my home screen and I'm a slob from page

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.510 
my home screen and I'm a slob from page
to<00:01:35.970> page<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.890> not<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.250> particular

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
to page and this is not the particular

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.730 
to page and this is not the particular
cube<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.210> like<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.990> think<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.380> one<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.710> I

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
cube that I like I think the one that I

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.039 
cube that I like I think the one that I
like<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.430> cube<00:01:41.729> outsides<00:01:42.479> when<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:42.930> get

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
like is the cube outsides when we get

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.670 
like is the cube outsides when we get
back<00:01:43.200> up<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.470> here<00:01:43.500> again<00:01:44.930> so<00:01:45.930> there's<00:01:46.290> cube

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
back up in here again so there's cube

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.249 
back up in here again so there's cube
outside<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.970> now<00:01:48.119> I'm<00:01:48.240> going<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.630> slide<00:01:48.899> from

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
outside so now I'm going to slide from

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.499 
outside so now I'm going to slide from
page<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.649> page<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.399> there<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.820> go<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.060> see<00:01:51.420> it

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
page to page and there you go you see it

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.300 
page to page and there you go you see it
kind<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.810> has<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.170> three-dimensional<00:01:53.070> feel

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
kind of has this three-dimensional feel

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.420 
kind of has this three-dimensional feel
for<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.420> it's<00:01:54.780> definitely<00:01:55.380> an<00:01:55.649> application

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
for it so it's definitely an application

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.100 
for it so it's definitely an application
that<00:01:56.460> i<00:01:56.670> personally<00:01:56.969> think<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.659> worth<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.990> two

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
that i personally think is worth the two

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.530 
that i personally think is worth the two
