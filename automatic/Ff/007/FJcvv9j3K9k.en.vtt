to the right and just on the desk is
where<00:00:19.529> we're<00:00:19.830> gonna<00:00:19.890> find<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.369> first<00:00:20.400> Intel

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
where we're gonna find the first Intel

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.009 
where we're gonna find the first Intel
of<00:00:21.480> three<00:00:24.769> the<00:00:25.769> second<00:00:26.099> Intel<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:27.019> basically

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
of three the second Intel is basically

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.580

something from graphic door now hey I'm

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.369 
something from graphic door now hey I'm
going<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.559> add<00:00:55.710> Ajo<00:00:56.120> anyway<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> back<00:00:58.140> left

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
going to add Ajo anyway on the back left

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.200 
going to add Ajo anyway on the back left
corner<00:00:58.680> there<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.730> where<00:00:59.910> we're<00:01:00.030> going<00:01:00.120> to

corner there is where we're going to
find<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.570> second<00:01:01.020> Intel<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.770> three<00:01:04.760> for<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
find the second Intel of three for the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.730 
find the second Intel of three for the
third<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.270> final<00:01:06.450> Intel<00:01:06.960> for<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.260> level<00:01:07.590> is

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
third and final Intel for this level is

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.770 
third and final Intel for this level is
a<00:01:07.770> bit<00:01:08.010> complicated<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.670> explain<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.630> is

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
a bit complicated to explain so this is

where we're going to come in we're going

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.260 
where we're going to come in we're going
to<00:01:10.890> come<00:01:11.070> down<00:01:11.189> then<00:01:11.400> Big<00:01:11.670> Sur<00:01:11.880> stairs<00:01:12.119> we're

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
to come down then Big Sur stairs we're

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.480 
to come down then Big Sur stairs we're
gonna<00:01:12.360> enter<00:01:12.570> into<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:12.990> open<00:01:13.470> area<00:01:13.680> with

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.240 
got no clear what they're doing if I
look<00:01:23.040> some<00:01:23.220> zombie<00:01:23.580> mode<00:01:23.790> for<00:01:24.000> error

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
look some zombie mode for error

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.530 
look some zombie mode for error
if<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.430> go<00:01:26.549> through<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:26.970> between<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.390> two

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
if you go through to it between the two

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.670 
if you go through to it between the two
rocks<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.869> can<00:01:28.020> go<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> different<00:01:28.350> way<00:01:28.650> like

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
rocks you can go a different way like

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.319 
rocks you can go a different way like
gun<00:01:28.979> upstairs<00:01:29.340> but<00:01:29.520> if<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.640> go<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:29.880> twin<00:01:30.090> city

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
gun upstairs but if you go for twin city

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.969 
gun upstairs but if you go for twin city
rocks<00:01:30.570> let's<00:01:30.990> look<00:01:31.110> at<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.320> bandstand<00:01:31.890> in
