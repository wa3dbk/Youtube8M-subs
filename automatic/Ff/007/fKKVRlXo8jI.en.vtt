00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
hey there guys it's random act 5 and in

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.350 
hey there guys it's random act 5 and in
today's<00:00:02.129> video<00:00:02.310> I'll<00:00:02.639> be<00:00:02.669> showing<00:00:02.850> you<00:00:03.120> my

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
today's video I'll be showing you my

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.840 
today's video I'll be showing you my
piston<00:00:03.929> drawbridge<00:00:04.410> security<00:00:04.890> system<00:00:05.250> so<00:00:05.730> if

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
piston drawbridge security system so if

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.639 
piston drawbridge security system so if
you<00:00:05.970> saw<00:00:06.120> this<00:00:06.270> video<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.629> while<00:00:06.899> ago<00:00:06.960> it<00:00:07.440> was

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
you saw this video a while ago it was

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.650 
you saw this video a while ago it was
with<00:00:07.890> hatches<00:00:08.400> but<00:00:08.610> now<00:00:08.730> there<00:00:08.910> are<00:00:08.940> Pistons<00:00:09.480> I

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
with hatches but now there are Pistons I

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.470 
with hatches but now there are Pistons I
can<00:00:10.170> make<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.440> circuit<00:00:10.860> much<00:00:11.040> more<00:00:11.340> as<00:00:11.610> you

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
can make the circuit much more as you

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.299 
can make the circuit much more as you
would<00:00:12.570> say<00:00:12.630> grief<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.320> proof<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:14.009> know<00:00:14.160> if

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
would say grief of proof you know if

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.770 
would say grief of proof you know if
they<00:00:14.400> place<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.730> redstone<00:00:14.940> torch<00:00:15.210> they<00:00:15.630> could

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
they place a redstone torch they could

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.630 
they place a redstone torch they could
easily<00:00:15.900> push<00:00:16.710> down<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:16.949> hatches<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.520> get

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
easily push down the hatches and get

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.390 
easily push down the hatches and get
past<00:00:17.910> but<00:00:18.779> now<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.439> can't<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.010> there's<00:00:20.160> lava

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
past but now you can't and there's lava

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.519 
past but now you can't and there's lava
and<00:00:20.730> if<00:00:21.359> you're<00:00:21.510> one<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.810> those<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
and if you're one of those on the

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.740 
and if you're one of those on the
protected<00:00:23.130> server<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.970> can't<00:00:24.240> place<00:00:24.510> any

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
glitch fridge door if you go I don't

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.830 
glitch fridge door if you go I don't
know<00:00:29.580> see<00:00:29.849> if<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.150> place<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.660> break

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
know see if you can place and break

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.200 
know see if you can place and break
really<00:00:31.170> quickly<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.769> it's<00:00:31.949> like<00:00:32.130> oh<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:33.180> know

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
really quickly and it's like oh you know

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.729 
really quickly and it's like oh you know
the<00:00:33.540> server<00:00:33.930> doesn't<00:00:34.170> realize<00:00:34.559> it'll

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
the server doesn't realize it'll

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.799 
the server doesn't realize it'll
something<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.190> don't<00:00:35.370> know<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:36.390> basically

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
something I don't know so basically

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.290 
something I don't know so basically
there<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.230> code<00:00:37.710> there<00:00:38.370> are<00:00:38.520> reset<00:00:38.940> buttons

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
there is a code there are reset buttons

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.510 
there is a code there are reset buttons
there<00:00:39.510> are<00:00:39.600> activation<00:00:40.290> buttons<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:41.340> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
there are activation buttons so the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.049 
there are activation buttons so the
password<00:00:42.890> 134<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.100> don't<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.550> do<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.789> any

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
password 134 you don't have to do in any

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.049 
password 134 you don't have to do in any
order<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.770> press<00:00:46.950> 1<00:00:47.280> 3<00:00:47.700> &amp;<00:00:47.850> 4

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
order you just have to press 1 3 &amp; 4

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.810 
order you just have to press 1 3 &amp; 4
when<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.570> any<00:00:48.780> order<00:00:49.020> except<00:00:49.770> number<00:00:50.430> 2<00:00:50.610> which

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
when in any order except number 2 which

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.459 
when in any order except number 2 which
is<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.090> wrong<00:00:51.270> code<00:00:51.539> then<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.260> press<00:00:52.410> that

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
is the wrong code then you press that

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.689 
is the wrong code then you press that
and<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.309> door<00:00:53.489> opens<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.180> hatch<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.600> the

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
and the door opens and the hatch and the

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.410 
and the door opens and the hatch and the
drawbridge<00:00:56.699> comes<00:00:56.969> out<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.420> there's<00:00:58.199> cake<00:00:59.420> so

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
drawbridge comes out and there's cake so

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.209 
drawbridge comes out and there's cake so
if<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.570> stand<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.109> doorway<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.190> I

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
if I stand in a doorway and like so I

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.149 
if I stand in a doorway and like so I
can<00:01:02.370> get<00:01:02.460> out<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:03.019> can<00:01:04.019> show<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.650> there

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
can get out I can show you that there

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.710 
can get out I can show you that there
were<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> Pistons<00:01:05.820> right<00:01:06.000> there<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.420> now<00:01:06.659> you

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
were the Pistons right there and now you

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.010 
were the Pistons right there and now you
can<00:01:06.900> get<00:01:07.020> out<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.200> whatever<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.979> want<00:01:08.189> and

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
can get out and whatever you want and

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.679 
can get out and whatever you want and
reset<00:01:10.020> buttons<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:11.130> what<00:01:11.340> these<00:01:11.490> are<00:01:11.760> our<00:01:12.240> RS

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
reset buttons so what these are our RS

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.260 
reset buttons so what these are our RS
nor<00:01:12.990> latch<00:01:13.049> a--'s<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:14.010> once<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.580> get<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> signal

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
nor latch a--'s so once you get a signal

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.499 
nor latch a--'s so once you get a signal
from<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.689> side<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.140> will<00:01:16.380> stay<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
from this side this will stay on and

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.350 
from this side this will stay on and
then<00:01:18.509> when<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.900> sit<00:01:19.259> down<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.500> reset<00:01:20.360> circuit

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
then when you sit down a reset circuit

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.690 
then when you sit down a reset circuit
when<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.689> turn<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.229> they<00:01:23.070> will<00:01:23.250> go<00:01:23.460> up

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
when you turn it on they will go up

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.760 
when you turn it on they will go up
underneath<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.630> RS<00:01:24.960> lower<00:01:25.259> latches<00:01:25.740> and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
underneath the RS lower latches and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.310 
underneath the RS lower latches and
revert<00:01:26.460> them<00:01:26.640> back<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.060> their<00:01:27.210> old<00:01:27.390> state<00:01:27.900> so

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
revert them back to their old state so

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.460 
revert them back to their old state so
they're<00:01:28.500> off<00:01:28.710> basically<00:01:29.780> so<00:01:30.780> as<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.020> see<00:01:31.170> here

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
they're off basically so as you see here

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.380 
they're off basically so as you see here
whether<00:01:31.829> repeaters<00:01:32.340> are<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.909> right<00:01:33.090> code

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
whether repeaters are is the right code

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.850 
whether repeaters are is the right code
you<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:33.930> change<00:01:34.110> them<00:01:34.290> around<00:01:34.409> with

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
you can just change them around with

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.249 
you can just change them around with
these<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.850> one's<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.240> wrong<00:01:36.450> number<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.079> when

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
these this one's a wrong number so when

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.560 
these this one's a wrong number so when
this<00:01:37.530> torch<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.369> whole<00:01:38.610> redstone

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
this torch is on this whole redstone

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.010 
this torch is on this whole redstone
circuit<00:01:39.780> stays<00:01:40.259> on<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.130> wrong<00:01:41.310> code

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
circuit stays on and it's the wrong code

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.990 
circuit stays on and it's the wrong code
this<00:01:43.020> RS<00:01:43.380> nor<00:01:43.560> latch<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:44.070> for<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.399> activation

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
this RS nor latch is for the activation

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.289 
this RS nor latch is for the activation

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
button on the and gate which is from the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.740 
button on the and gate which is from the
RS<00:01:49.020> nor<00:01:49.259> latch<00:01:49.340> circuit<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.520> when<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.540> one

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
RS nor latch circuit and when this one

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.300 
RS nor latch circuit and when this one
is<00:01:51.780> correct<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.530> line<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.860> be<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.100> and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
is correct to this line to be on and

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.710 
is correct to this line to be on and
then<00:01:53.430> when<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.640> press<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:53.880> button<00:01:54.270> this

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
then when you press that button this

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.990 
then when you press that button this
line<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.049> be<00:01:55.170> on<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:56.100> we'll<00:01:56.369> activate<00:01:56.759> this

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
line to be on so we'll activate this

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.749 
line to be on so we'll activate this
torch<00:01:57.390> red<00:01:58.140> stone<00:01:58.439> power<00:01:58.710> down<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.430> door

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
torch red stone power down to the door

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.300 
torch red stone power down to the door
which<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.210> here<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:01.469> Pistons<00:02:01.680> which<00:02:02.130> are

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
which is here and the Pistons which are

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.090 
which is here and the Pistons which are
here<00:02:02.600> so<00:02:03.600> basically<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.290> my<00:02:04.619> piston

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
here so basically that is my piston

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.869 
here so basically that is my piston
drawbridge<00:02:05.549> security<00:02:06.119> system<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:07.879> yeah

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
drawbridge security system and yeah

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.369 
drawbridge security system and yeah
that's<00:02:09.119> really<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.569> this<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.869> just<00:02:10.050> from<00:02:10.200> my

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
that's really it this is just from my

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.059 
that's really it this is just from my
redstone<00:02:10.679> knowledge<00:02:11.280> and

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
redstone knowledge and

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.369 
redstone knowledge and
CaptainSparklez<00:02:12.939> video<00:02:13.269> inspired<00:02:13.900> me<00:02:14.109> to<00:02:14.140> do

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
CaptainSparklez video inspired me to do

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.319 
CaptainSparklez video inspired me to do
this<00:02:14.560> as<00:02:14.799> his<00:02:15.069> suck<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.549> was<00:02:15.730> horribly

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
this as his suck it was horribly

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.479 
this as his suck it was horribly
horribly<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:17.230> mess<00:02:17.530> because<00:02:17.799> you<00:02:18.189> know<00:02:18.310> he

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
horribly a mess because you know he

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:19.890 
horribly a mess because you know he
isn't<00:02:18.579> as<00:02:18.879> good<00:02:18.999> as<00:02:19.060> registering<00:02:19.569> as<00:02:19.719> many

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
isn't as good as registering as many

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.069 
isn't as good as registering as many
other<00:02:20.079> people<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.790> I<00:02:21.819> thought<00:02:22.180> set<00:02:22.959> my

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
other people so I thought set my

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.470 
other people so I thought set my
challenge<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:23.920> make<00:02:24.310> it<00:02:24.459> smaller<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:24.879> I<00:02:25.299> did

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
challenge to make it smaller and I did

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.020 
challenge to make it smaller and I did
his<00:02:26.019> was<00:02:26.230> like<00:02:26.409> double<00:02:26.739> this<00:02:26.859> size<00:02:27.069> so<00:02:27.760> anyway

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
his was like double this size so anyway

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.819 
his was like double this size so anyway
guys<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.480> was<00:02:28.599> a<00:02:28.629> piston<00:02:29.260> drawbridge

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
guys that was a piston drawbridge

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.890 
guys that was a piston drawbridge
security<00:02:30.250> system<00:02:30.549> I<00:02:30.670> hoped<00:02:30.939> you<00:02:31.090> liked<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.659> and

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
security system I hoped you liked it and

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.800 
security system I hoped you liked it and
there's<00:02:32.739> really<00:02:32.950> it<00:02:33.129> guys<00:02:33.310> so<00:02:33.609> please<00:02:34.569> like
