structure<00:01:03.690> ginger<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.470> be<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.619> pain<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
structure ginger can be a pain in the

structure ginger can be a pain in the
bottom<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:07.640> peel<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.540> what<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.710> do<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.189> I

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
bottom to peel so what I like to do is I

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.320 
bottom to peel so what I like to do is I
use<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> knife<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.360> then<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.540> just<00:01:12.840> cut<00:01:13.110> off<00:01:13.310> the

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
use a knife and then I just cut off the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.240 
use a knife and then I just cut off the
minimal<00:01:15.330> amount<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:16.170> watching<00:01:17.130> your

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
minimal amount that I can watching your

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.480 
minimal amount that I can watching your
fingers<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.790> course<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:19.439> helps<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.920> get

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
fingers of course and that helps it get

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.749 
fingers of course and that helps it get
it<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> point<00:01:21.810> where<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.520> little<00:01:23.520> bit

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
it to a point where it's a little bit

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.510 
it to a point where it's a little bit
more<00:01:24.180> easy<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.540> manage<00:01:24.840> than<00:01:25.470> using<00:01:26.100> an<00:01:26.220> actual

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
more easy to manage than using an actual

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.960 
more easy to manage than using an actual
vegetable<00:01:27.470> you<00:01:28.470> can<00:01:28.500> tell<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.130> cut<00:01:29.790> up

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
vegetable you can tell that I cut up

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.490 
vegetable you can tell that I cut up
that<00:01:30.270> route<00:01:30.900> into<00:01:31.439> worker<00:01:32.310> bowls<00:01:33.500> sections

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
that route into worker bowls sections

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.830 
that route into worker bowls sections
and<00:01:34.829> then<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.850> just<00:01:36.329> wanted<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.630> show<00:01:36.810> you

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
really fast you know how I go about

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.770 
really fast you know how I go about
cutting<00:01:39.000> off<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:40.100> outside<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.360> ginger

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.490 
cutting off the outside of the ginger
which<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:47.299> so<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.600> lot<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.810> little<00:01:49.110> cuts

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500

so<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.190> one<00:02:08.369> would<00:02:08.520> be<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.640> great<00:02:08.940> one<00:02:09.390> either

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
so this one would be a great one either

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.580 
so this one would be a great one either
to<00:02:09.899> cut<00:02:10.080> up<00:02:10.170> in<00:02:10.350> cubes<00:02:10.770> for<00:02:11.610> chopped<00:02:12.150> ginger<00:02:12.990> or

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
to cut up in cubes for chopped ginger or

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.300 
to cut up in cubes for chopped ginger or
to<00:02:14.430> use<00:02:14.790> as<00:02:15.210> your<00:02:16.790> shredded<00:02:17.790> or<00:02:19.250> minced<00:02:20.250> ginger

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
to use as your shredded or minced ginger

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.480 
to use as your shredded or minced ginger
when<00:02:21.210> you<00:02:21.300> need<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.600> in<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.780> recipe

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.030 

okay<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:25.210> when<00:02:25.720> you're<00:02:25.870> done<00:02:26.110> with<00:02:26.170> all<00:02:26.560> your

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
okay so when you're done with all your

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.600 
okay so when you're done with all your
chopping<00:02:27.760> then<00:02:28.480> you've<00:02:28.870> got<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:30.190> ones<00:02:30.370> for

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
chopping then you've got the ones for

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.060 
chopping then you've got the ones for
the<00:02:30.730> green<00:02:30.940> smoothies<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.380> think<00:02:32.800> I<00:02:32.860> forgot

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
the green smoothies and I think I forgot

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.190 
the green smoothies and I think I forgot
to<00:02:33.280> mention<00:02:33.400> that<00:02:33.580> I<00:02:33.730> don't<00:02:34.000> really<00:02:34.570> notice

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
to mention that I don't really notice

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.380 
to mention that I don't really notice
the<00:02:35.530> difference<00:02:35.560> if<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.640> skin<00:02:36.910> is<00:02:37.060> off<00:02:37.210> the

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
the difference if the skin is off the

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.190 
the difference if the skin is off the
ginger<00:02:37.570> or<00:02:37.900> not<00:02:38.080> I<00:02:39.360> figured<00:02:40.360> it's<00:02:40.540> not<00:02:40.720> bad<00:02:41.170> for

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
ginger or not I figured it's not bad for

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.860 
ginger or not I figured it's not bad for
me<00:02:41.560> so<00:02:41.860> I<00:02:42.130> just<00:02:42.160> leave<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.550> on<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:43.630> makes

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
me so I just leave it on and that makes

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.100 
me so I just leave it on and that makes
it<00:02:44.020> easier<00:02:44.320> for<00:02:44.380> that<00:02:44.740> and<00:02:45.310> then<00:02:46.120> these<00:02:47.050> are

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
it easier for that and then these are

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.970 
it easier for that and then these are
peeled<00:02:48.100> ready<00:02:48.730> for<00:02:49.440> chopping<00:02:50.440> in<00:02:50.620> case<00:02:50.830> I

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
peeled ready for chopping in case I

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.980 
peeled ready for chopping in case I
needed<00:02:51.190> chopped<00:02:51.520> ginger<00:02:51.730> in<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.240> recipe<00:02:52.570> and

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
needed chopped ginger in a recipe and

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.760 
needed chopped ginger in a recipe and
then<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.800> last<00:02:53.980> ones<00:02:54.480> are<00:02:55.480> peeled<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.200> ready

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
then the last ones are peeled and ready

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.450 
then the last ones are peeled and ready
if<00:02:57.070> I<00:02:57.280> need<00:02:57.580> to<00:02:57.970> do<00:02:58.120> minced<00:02:58.720> ginger<00:02:59.460> or

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
if I need to do minced ginger or

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.120 
if I need to do minced ginger or
something<00:03:00.970> of<00:03:01.270> that<00:03:01.570> sort<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.380> then<00:03:02.770> I<00:03:02.830> just

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
something of that sort and then I just

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.190 
something of that sort and then I just
put<00:03:03.340> them<00:03:03.460> all<00:03:03.550> next<00:03:03.760> to<00:03:03.970> each<00:03:04.030> other<00:03:04.210> in<00:03:04.990> one

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
put them all next to each other in one

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.410

of these side pockets in my freezer and

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.630 
of these side pockets in my freezer and
