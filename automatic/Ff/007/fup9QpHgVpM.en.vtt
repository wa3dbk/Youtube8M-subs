00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
love it's about the power of love it's

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.990 
love it's about the power of love it's
about<00:02:09.000> using<00:02:09.330> frequencies<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:11.000> understand

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
about using frequencies to understand

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.490 
about using frequencies to understand
the<00:02:12.390> finer<00:02:12.690> vibrate

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the finer vibrate

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.230 
the finer vibrate
patient's<00:02:13.770> of<00:02:13.950> what's<00:02:14.130> going<00:02:14.310> on<00:02:14.550> in<00:02:14.760> life<00:02:14.970> and

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
patient's of what's going on in life and

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.940 
patient's of what's going on in life and
how<00:02:15.630> love<00:02:15.930> is<00:02:15.960> affecting<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.650> are<00:02:16.800> not

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
how love is affecting you are not

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.000 
how love is affecting you are not
affecting<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:19.110> how<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.620> relates<00:02:19.680> the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
affecting you and and how it relates the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.650 
affecting you and and how it relates the
mayan<00:02:20.220> calendar<00:02:20.310> too<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.150> i<00:02:21.180> ended<00:02:21.390> up<00:02:21.480> winning

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
mayan calendar too so i ended up winning

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.330 
mayan calendar too so i ended up winning
a<00:02:21.870> scholarship<00:02:22.080> with<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.620> bunch<00:02:22.770> of<00:02:22.860> scientists

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
a scholarship with a bunch of scientists

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.720 
a scholarship with a bunch of scientists
into<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.910> rainforest<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.900> research

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
into the rainforest to research

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.070 
into the rainforest to research
frequencies<00:02:26.730> but<00:02:27.270> like<00:02:27.450> Tesla<00:02:27.840> said

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
frequencies but like Tesla said

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.990 
frequencies but like Tesla said
basically<00:02:28.350> it's<00:02:28.890> just<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.220> space<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:29.820> the

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
basically it's just a space and the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.120 
basically it's just a space and the
frequency<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:31.530> wrote<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:31.860> book<00:02:32.010> about

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
frequency so I wrote a book about

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.040 
frequency so I wrote a book about
frequency<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.030> can<00:02:33.330> understand<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.870> little

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
frequency so you can understand a little

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.650 
frequency so you can understand a little
bit<00:02:34.230> more<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:35.610> basics<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.360> what<00:02:36.480> we're

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
bit more the basics of what we're

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.900 
bit more the basics of what we're
working<00:02:36.840> with<00:02:37.200> when<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:37.920> comes<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.340> vibration

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
working with when it comes to vibration

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.640 
working with when it comes to vibration
and<00:02:39.209> when<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.630> say<00:02:39.810> hey<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.230> person<00:02:40.500> has<00:02:40.620> a

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
and when you say hey that person has a

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.020 
and when you say hey that person has a
good<00:02:40.860> vibe<00:02:41.040> or<00:02:41.280> doesn't<00:02:41.550> have<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.700> good<00:02:41.850> vibe

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
good vibe or doesn't have a good vibe

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.540 
good vibe or doesn't have a good vibe
what<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:42.780> actually<00:02:43.320> means<00:02:43.550> scientifically

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
what that actually means scientifically

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.960 
what that actually means scientifically
and<00:02:44.760> in<00:02:45.360> your<00:02:45.480> life<00:02:45.660> anyway<00:02:46.320> so<00:02:47.010> I'll<00:02:47.670> link

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
and in your life anyway so I'll link

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.120 
and in your life anyway so I'll link
that<00:02:48.120> below<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.870> like<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.290> said<00:02:49.350> if<00:02:49.650> anybody<00:02:49.890> is

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
that below and like I said if anybody is

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.220 
that below and like I said if anybody is
strapped<00:02:50.580> financially<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.660> really

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
strapped financially and you really

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.870 
strapped financially and you really
really<00:02:52.650> would<00:02:52.860> like<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.160> read<00:02:53.310> my<00:02:53.459> book<00:02:53.640> I'll
