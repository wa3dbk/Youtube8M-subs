you<00:00:24.600> might<00:00:24.810> not<00:00:24.990> be<00:00:25.230> able<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.710> raise<00:00:25.980> on<00:00:26.310> a

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
you might not be able to raise on a

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.839 
you might not be able to raise on a
pound<00:00:26.640> barbell<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.720> could<00:00:27.930> lower<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.349> and

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
pound barbell but you could lower it and

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.250 
pound barbell but you could lower it and
watch<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:29.880> now<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.720> heavier<00:00:31.019> weight

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
watch it now it's a heavier weight

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.950 
watch it now it's a heavier weight
coming<00:00:31.590> down<00:00:31.710> here's<00:00:32.070> lowering<00:00:32.850> 95<00:00:33.510> pounds

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
coming down here's lowering 95 pounds

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.780 
coming down here's lowering 95 pounds
down<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:35.180> raising<00:00:36.180> 55<00:00:36.899> pounds<00:00:37.230> up<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:38.670> have

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
down and raising 55 pounds up so we have

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.850 
down and raising 55 pounds up so we have
a<00:00:38.820> system<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.629> gives<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.230> right<00:00:40.469> amount

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
a system that gives you the right amount

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.340 
a system that gives you the right amount
of<00:00:40.950> weight<00:00:41.160> training<00:00:41.579> both<00:00:42.300> raising<00:00:43.170> and

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
of weight training both raising and

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.979 
of weight training both raising and
lowering<00:00:43.969> its<00:00:44.969> not<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.210> weight<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.480> he<00:00:45.780> could

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
lowering its not a weight that he could

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.270 
lowering its not a weight that he could
raise<00:00:46.260> by<00:00:46.620> himself<00:00:47.090> so<00:00:48.090> he's<00:00:48.390> being<00:00:48.890> forced<00:00:49.890> to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
raise by himself so he's being forced to

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.770 
raise by himself so he's being forced to
resist<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.760> weight<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.149> way<00:00:51.270> down<00:00:51.480> and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
resist the weight on the way down and

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.590 
resist the weight on the way down and
the<00:00:52.440> body's<00:00:53.280> getting<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.879> benefit<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the body's getting the benefit of the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.369 
the body's getting the benefit of the
full<00:00:54.840> 95<00:00:55.410> pounds<00:00:55.949> right<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.850> would<00:00:57.840> rather<00:00:58.020> see

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
full 95 pounds right I would rather see

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.990 
full 95 pounds right I would rather see

around the block you think they're

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.590 
around the block you think they're
wasting<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.890> lot<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.040> their<00:01:14.220> time<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.700> think<00:01:15.330> to

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
wasting a lot of their time I think to

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.090 
wasting a lot of their time I think to
some<00:01:15.630> extent<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:16.950> like<00:01:17.570> saying<00:01:18.570> that

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
some extent that it's like saying that

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.620 
some extent that it's like saying that
carrots<00:01:20.100> are<00:01:20.189> good<00:01:20.250> for<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.790> eating<00:01:21.240> just

up<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.219> intensity<00:01:52.759> a<00:01:52.939> little<00:01:53.030> bit<00:01:53.359> then<00:01:53.630> you

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
up the intensity a little bit then you

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.539 
up the intensity a little bit then you
don't<00:01:53.990> have<00:01:54.049> to<00:01:54.229> do<00:01:54.319> it<00:01:54.439> as<00:01:54.560> frequently<00:01:54.979> when

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
don't have to do it as frequently when
