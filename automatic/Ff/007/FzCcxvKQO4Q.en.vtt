00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.580
 you have to do to get to live on 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.860
 your drawings and your art 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.890
 being a drawing professional is not 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.590
 easy is hard will involve a lot of effort 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:39.080
 for your part and you will have to overcome day to 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:41.540
 day but it is not impossible is real there 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.590
 people who live from drawing who lives 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:48.199
 making your dreams come true 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.739
 you'll see about ten years ago I was so 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.970
 lost as you can be now 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.160
 you may have finished your studies 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.890
 primary and do not know what to do with your 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.489
 life, you want to dedicate yourself to something that 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.890
 make happy and make you feel good 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.530
 do it advice 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.810
 You have two options to choose between your 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.800
 dreams or engage in a profession between 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.050
 quotes sure you decide or walk 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.140
 towards a stable and trouble-free future 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.909
 quotes again or you make your own 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.579
 future and bets for you 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.649
 let's imagine that you bet for you 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.789
 develop your talent for following that 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.300
 idea of eua 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:33.300
 I wish I knew how to draw so you risk 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.240
 how do you learn to draw well obviously 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.730
 I created the web to draw well 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.190
 dotcom to solve this problem 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.470
 that enhances your hobby or hobby is 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.330
 but also so you can start 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.670
 pose a future in which you 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.159
 work doing what you like 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.159
 but in addition to my help support and reinforcement 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.150
 there are three main alternatives 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.450
 let's see them 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.680
 fine arts illustration and the way of what 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.080
 I call the Juan Dove 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.870
 On the one hand we have beautiful arts are 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.289
 four years of studies and three thousand 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.330
 and five thousand euros for registration only if 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.350
 you do not live in a city that has a 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.560
 career of this type 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.830
 add transportation accommodation and 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.750
 materials that are not cheap I calculate 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.410
 to eye of good cubero that you will go away 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.600
 quietly about twelve thousand euros or more 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.730
 that offers fine arts gives you 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.980
 broad and varied knowledge in the 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.260
 field of the arts not only drawing 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.810
 you will get a global knowledge and 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.960
 extensive of many other subjects but 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.530
 from my point of view it's a long time and 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.530
 lost money 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.950
 the other option illustration lasts two years 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.780
 and the registration is practically free 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.240
 in any city ​​there is this cycle 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.200
 training and only the insurance of the 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.810
 student about seventy euros per year 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.300
 that offers illustration has some 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.760
 studies very focused on drawing and their 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.000
 professional outings that train for 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.470
 face the real industry 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.470
 let's say you are more like a 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.570
 professional and not just as an artist 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.020
 this was the option that I opted for 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.000
 given my circumstances in mallorca not 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.180
 there are beautiful arts and I could not afford 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.090
 pay a tuition so added to a 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.670
 four- year stay off the island 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.489
 so study this formative degree of 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.739
 illustration and attended classes 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.200
 particular of the best teacher of 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.950
 drawing that I have had in addition to a 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.849
 excelentísimo cartoonist and people 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.849
 Marcos Matos Mestre 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.970
 the last option is the way of juan 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.140
 I cook it, I eat it, I eat it 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.080
 a commitment to self-education 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.990
 look for a good teacher of drawing one 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.790
 good and invests all the money 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.880
 Fine arts in paying this teacher 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.170
 obviously and buy books 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.630
 videotutorials and train with the 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.500
 countless resources that exist in the 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:13.110
 network and draws like a beast for 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:18.480
 improve and learn fast 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:20.640
 this method I advise you yes or yes as 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.540
 complement of any of the others 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.550
 two previous options another thing that 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.530
 I want you to be clear is that the 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.240
 the moment of truth the diplomas and diplomas 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:35.640
 in this profession they are not worth anything 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.530
 you're good or you're not, nobody has 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.020
 never asked for an accreditation or a 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.110
 titling some like my way of 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.060
 work or do not like 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.030
 and one of the three options before 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.390
 mentioned is perfect they are only roads 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.250
 or possibilities that you have to choose 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.600
 I personally recommend that you choose 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.290
 some curriculum of the 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:01.710
 mentioned fine arts or illustration or 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:04.950
 someone else and you reinforce with classes of a 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.110
 good drawer of your city well 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.240
 books and videotutorials of course 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.980
 that those will always be within reach 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.290
 From your hand 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.930
 for my part in drawing well dot 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.910
 I want to do my bit and 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.270
 I want to train you from the bases of 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.900

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.480
 draw or reinforce your art if only 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.930
 you want to take it as a hobby 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.900
 I'll start with the basics 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:46.740
 perspective which I think is the basis 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.780
 of everything that will come after a 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.750
 artist who does not perfectly master the 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.370
 conical perspective to draw not worth 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.340
 nothing 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.729
 if you are in mallorca and you are interested 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.740
