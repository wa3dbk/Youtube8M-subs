00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.940 
can't block out distractions and you
can't<00:01:42.150> go<00:01:42.540> out<00:01:42.630> there<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.079> putting<00:01:43.590> winning

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
can't go out there and putting winning

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.130 
can't go out there and putting winning
product<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.610> table<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.420> think<00:01:45.810> that

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
product on the table so I think that

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.050 
product on the table so I think that
he'll<00:01:46.530> he'll<00:01:46.829> manage<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> situation<00:01:47.490> about

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
he'll he'll manage the situation about

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.870 
he'll he'll manage the situation about
the<00:01:48.119> best<00:01:48.570> as<00:01:48.869> possible<00:01:49.220> Mike<00:01:50.220> link<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> good

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
the best as possible Mike link is a good

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.450 
the best as possible Mike link is a good
coach<00:01:51.090> he<00:01:51.720> his<00:01:52.020> players<00:01:52.290> respect<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.950> him<00:01:53.070> and

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
coach he his players respect to him and

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.069 
coach he his players respect to him and
even<00:01:53.670> if<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.060> something<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.570> he<00:01:54.780> does<00:01:54.960> in

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
even if it's something that he does in

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.440 
even if it's something that he does in
favor<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.649> think<00:01:56.310> definitely<00:01:56.820> he's<00:01:57.240> going<00:01:57.390> to

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
favor I think definitely he's going to

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.940 
favor I think definitely he's going to
have<00:01:57.570> his<00:01:57.600> team<00:01:58.020> focused<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.560> ready<00:01:58.649> for<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
have his team focused and ready for the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.280 
have his team focused and ready for the
season<00:01:59.240> so<00:02:00.240> what<00:02:00.390> kind<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.659> story<00:02:00.899> lines<00:02:00.960> do

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
season so what kind of story lines do

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.780 
season so what kind of story lines do
you<00:02:01.350> think<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.740> expect<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.250> see<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.670> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
you think we can expect to see in the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.830 
you think we can expect to see in the
show<00:02:04.040> okay<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.070> think<00:02:05.850> one<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.329> story<00:02:06.600> lines

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
show okay I think one of the story lines

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.020 
show okay I think one of the story lines
of<00:02:07.049> course<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.860> return<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.250> Julio<00:02:08.729> Jones

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
of course is the return of Julio Jones

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.770 
of course is the return of Julio Jones

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780

defensive line and these guys are in

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.220 
defensive line and these guys are in
charge<00:02:58.769> of<00:02:59.160> getting<00:02:59.340> these<00:02:59.670> lines<00:03:00.030> in<00:03:00.450> tag

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
charge of getting these lines in tag

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.630 
charge of getting these lines in tag
getting<00:03:01.590> them<00:03:01.680> back<00:03:01.800> in<00:03:02.010> order<00:03:02.190> they<00:03:02.430> brought

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
getting them back in order they brought

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.820 
getting them back in order they brought
him<00:03:02.760> some<00:03:02.940> new<00:03:03.060> pieces<00:03:03.300> so<00:03:03.810> see<00:03:04.440> how<00:03:04.470> those

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
him some new pieces so see how those

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.410 
him some new pieces so see how those
lines<00:03:05.130> come<00:03:05.400> together<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.880> I<00:03:05.910> think<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.239> most

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
lines come together and I think the most

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.300 
lines come together and I think the most
concerning<00:03:07.170> is<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.410> offensive<00:03:07.860> line<00:03:08.010> of

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
concerning is the offensive line of

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.220 
concerning is the offensive line of
course<00:03:08.580> they<00:03:08.790> were<00:03:08.880> terrible<00:03:09.239> last<00:03:09.510> year<00:03:09.810> they

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
course they were terrible last year they

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.040 
course they were terrible last year they
gave<00:03:10.410> up<00:03:10.560> too<00:03:10.709> many<00:03:10.739> sacks<00:03:11.220> Matt<00:03:11.880> Ryan<00:03:12.180> was<00:03:12.810> the

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
gave up too many sacks Matt Ryan was the

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.320 
gave up too many sacks Matt Ryan was the
most<00:03:13.350> pressure<00:03:13.620> quarterbacks<00:03:14.160> in<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.340> NFL<00:03:14.400> so

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
most pressure quarterbacks in the NFL so

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330 
most pressure quarterbacks in the NFL so
definitely<00:03:15.720> going<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.170> be<00:03:16.260> keeping<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:16.650> lot<00:03:16.860> I

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
definitely going to be keeping a lot I

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.670 
definitely going to be keeping a lot I
on<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:17.970> offensive<00:03:18.329> line<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:19.170> see<00:03:19.380> how<00:03:19.530> it

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
on the offensive line to see how it

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.680 
on the offensive line to see how it
progresses<00:03:20.100> do<00:03:20.430> training<00:03:20.850> camp<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.390> if<00:03:21.540> they

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
progresses do training camp and if they

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.479 
progresses do training camp and if they
indeed<00:03:22.049> are<00:03:22.079> going<00:03:22.350> to<00:03:22.410> be<00:03:22.470> better<00:03:22.680> going<00:03:23.280> into

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
indeed are going to be better going into

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.240
