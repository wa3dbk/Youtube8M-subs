 information below and please god about

 attempts and then 16 names you have to 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.989
 subscribe if it were not 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.960
 let's start the first thing I'm going to 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.659
 to do is going to be taking some colors that 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.460
 activated with alcohol in a brown color 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.220
 dark and I'm going to start blurring the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.590
 Throughout the area of ​​wrinkles we are going to 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.259
 go creating wrinkle marks in front of the 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.600
 lateral area of the nose 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.759
 mouth to the side of the eyes I'm marking 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.729
 and blurring well let's create some 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.100
 wrinkles that are very real and that we're going 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.619
 to make the person create gestures 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:46.580
 wrinkle the face so that those wrinkles 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.580
 be much more adjusted to their features 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.560
 For a recent step, let's start 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.079
 create to mark the waters on the skin to 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.820
 that we are going to apply latex stretching well 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.039
 The skin is a specific text for 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.409
 wrinkles a finite stretch well the 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.390
 skin we apply the latex dry and what 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.050
 let go and create a wrinkle effect in 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.930
 the skin 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.790
 we are going to apply several layers of 34 layers 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.290
 depending on the area if I did not have that 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.910
 type of latex and other normal latex 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.099
 it also works for you and you have an effect 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:25.590
 pretty realistic with a little bit of 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.989
 blast also latex but more dense 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.420
 I will create the effects as if it were 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.280
 chin on the sides of the cheeks 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.140
 they would have fallen down and with silicone I'm going to 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.170
 create some breasts that add also 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.540
 hair we give the last touches of latex 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.930
 also in the neck and in areas like 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.930
 the eyebrow 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.820
 You can seal everything with loose powder 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.470
 to magnify the latex and I'm going to 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.120
 start creating to color 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.830
 uniform everything with the color of the skin 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.530
 of the person especially to the areas 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.650
 dignified subject as more than something 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.930
 extra a prosthesis let's also to 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.640
 intensify the wrinkles that we have frame 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.140
 previously blurred and I'm also going 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.030
 to darken first with brown and then 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.030
 he pondered the warts that I raised 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.840
 with the dotting effect we are going to create 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.980
 also as if they were little things 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.390
 little spots on the face simply 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.209
 Apply the product a little in a brush 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.659
 have the heavy synthetic hard and 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:43.840
 we make them fall on little points too 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:45.849
 with a texture sponge I will create 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.530
 an effect as if it were beard in the 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.909
 beard area and I'm going to apply a 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.690
 I'm going to apply a little mustache 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.060
 adjusting the second applied and 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.739
 adjusting it as I want and then both 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.900
 eyebrows like in this same mustache I'm going 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.239
 to apply a blank color to give 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.159
 gray hair that the same thing I will do in all 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.319
 hair and I will also use the 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.090
 effect of creating a more and out species 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.799
 of entrances using the same base the 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.780
 color of the skin and applying it to 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.909
 lateral from the front to the 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.950
 hair we also got some extra 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:16.600
 hair in any of the areas that we are going 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.750
 to apply a couple of layers of latex with 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.400
 a bit of contour in some areas 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.020
 from the fingers of the hand to 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.150
 create a bit of aging and 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.600
 also the dotted polka dot and up 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.600
 unesco 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:52.070

00:04:52.070 --> 00:05:01.240
 nothing happened to the channel of his grandson and 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.240
