things like that and trying to steer
Godzilla<00:02:37.850> different<00:02:38.150> directions<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:39.140> know<00:02:39.260> I

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
Godzilla different directions you know I

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.780 
Godzilla different directions you know I
understand<00:02:39.740> she<00:02:39.860> was<00:02:39.980> very<00:02:40.100> popular<00:02:40.310> as<00:02:40.610> well

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
understand she was very popular as well

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.620 
understand she was very popular as well
but<00:02:41.060> i<00:02:41.120> just<00:02:41.630> don't<00:02:41.930> feel<00:02:43.330> she<00:02:44.330> would<00:02:44.450> make<00:02:44.570> a

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
but i just don't feel she would make a

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.540 
but i just don't feel she would make a
strong<00:02:44.900> candidate<00:02:45.410> but<00:02:45.950> i<00:02:46.010> know<00:02:46.280> some<00:02:46.460> other

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
strong candidate but i know some other

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.770 
strong candidate but i know some other
people<00:02:46.820> might<00:02:46.940> feel<00:02:47.060> differently<00:02:47.420> i<00:02:47.480> really

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
people might feel differently i really

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.630 
people might feel differently i really
think<00:02:47.900> I'll<00:02:48.050> gotta<00:02:48.260> buy<00:02:48.830> accurate<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.370> Kurata

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
think I'll gotta buy accurate a Kurata

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.810 
think I'll gotta buy accurate a Kurata
or<00:02:50.350> if<00:02:51.350> Raymond<00:02:51.710> Burr<00:02:51.860> were<00:02:52.130> still<00:02:52.370> around<00:02:52.460> or

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
or if Raymond Burr were still around or

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.240 
or if Raymond Burr were still around or
somebody<00:02:53.210> could<00:02:53.300> re<00:02:53.570> be<00:02:53.810> recast<00:02:54.200> as<00:02:54.560> Steve

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
somebody could re be recast as Steve

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.180 
somebody could re be recast as Steve
Martin<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:55.910> really<00:02:56.330> think<00:02:56.570> that<00:02:56.770> that<00:02:57.770> that

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
Martin I really think that that that

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.560 
Martin I really think that that that
would<00:02:58.400> have<00:02:58.520> been<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:58.670> pretty<00:02:58.940> good<00:02:59.180> tool<00:02:59.480> to

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
would have been a pretty good tool to

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.840 
would have been a pretty good tool to
use<00:02:59.720> to<00:02:59.840> like<00:03:00.320> if<00:03:00.500> they<00:03:00.680> if<00:03:00.980> they<00:03:01.340> hadn't<00:03:01.760> gone

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
use to like if they if they hadn't gone

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.160 
use to like if they if they hadn't gone
the<00:03:02.060> route<00:03:02.210> of<00:03:02.270> like<00:03:02.540> Aaron<00:03:02.900> taylor-johnson

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
the route of like Aaron taylor-johnson

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.070 
the route of like Aaron taylor-johnson
and<00:03:03.890> Bryan<00:03:04.070> Cranston<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:05.660> know<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.900> whole

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
and Bryan Cranston you know the whole

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.510 
and Bryan Cranston you know the whole
reporter<00:03:06.530> thing<00:03:06.710> probably<00:03:07.040> would<00:03:07.280> play<00:03:07.460> it

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
reporter thing probably would play it

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.100 
reporter thing probably would play it
out<00:03:07.640> but<00:03:08.180> you<00:03:08.300> know<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.480> whole<00:03:08.660> reporter

out but you know the whole reporter

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.480 
out but you know the whole reporter
thing<00:03:09.260> was<00:03:09.380> very<00:03:09.620> very<00:03:09.860> popular<00:03:10.130> in<00:03:10.370> the

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
thing was very very popular in the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.830 
thing was very very popular in the
Godzilla<00:03:10.880> movies<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.270> they've<00:03:11.390> done<00:03:11.600> that<00:03:11.660> a

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
Godzilla movies and they've done that a

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.230 
Godzilla movies and they've done that a
number<00:03:12.080> of<00:03:12.230> times<00:03:12.350> always<00:03:13.280> having<00:03:13.700> a<00:03:13.760> reporter

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
number of times always having a reporter

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.470 
number of times always having a reporter
somehow<00:03:14.660> involved<00:03:15.440> with<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.760> whole<00:03:16.910> Godzilla

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
somehow involved with the whole Godzilla

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.570 
somehow involved with the whole Godzilla
either<00:03:17.750> investigation<00:03:18.530> military<00:03:19.100> operation

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
either investigation military operation

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.100 
either investigation military operation
whatever<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:19.910> case<00:03:20.060> may<00:03:20.210> be<00:03:20.240> but<00:03:20.510> I<00:03:21.020> think

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
whatever the case may be but I think

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.020 
whatever the case may be but I think
those<00:03:21.740> would<00:03:21.890> be<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.100> two<00:03:22.250> characters<00:03:22.850> I

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
those would be the two characters I

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.140 
those would be the two characters I
would<00:03:23.420> bring<00:03:23.600> over<00:03:24.280> definitely<00:03:25.280> oh<00:03:25.310> gotta<00:03:25.640> be

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
would bring over definitely oh gotta be

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.440 
would bring over definitely oh gotta be
especially<00:03:26.420> with<00:03:26.690> his<00:03:26.810> relationship<00:03:27.410> with

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
especially with his relationship with

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.940 
especially with his relationship with
Serizawa<00:03:29.450> and<00:03:29.690> then<00:03:30.170> Steve<00:03:30.440> Martin<00:03:30.830> because

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
Serizawa and then Steve Martin because

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.650 
Serizawa and then Steve Martin because
you<00:03:31.490> know<00:03:31.580> I<00:03:31.610> think<00:03:31.700> Raymond<00:03:32.300> burden

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
you know I think Raymond burden

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.970 
you know I think Raymond burden
excellent<00:03:33.260> job<00:03:33.470> especially<00:03:34.250> in<00:03:34.580> the<00:03:34.640> 54<00:03:35.240> movie

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
excellent job especially in the 54 movie

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.960 
excellent job especially in the 54 movie

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
considering that half the time he was

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.480 
considering that half the time he was
not<00:03:38.240> in<00:03:38.420> front<00:03:38.630> of<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.840> characters<00:03:39.380> that<00:03:40.160> he

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
not in front of the characters that he

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.740 
not in front of the characters that he
was<00:03:40.730> supposed<00:03:41.210> to<00:03:41.330> be<00:03:41.450> in<00:03:41.570> a<00:03:41.660> relationship
