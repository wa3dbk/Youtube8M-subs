Wernick<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.719> Hoffman<00:00:46.260> first<00:00:46.829> came<00:00:47.430> upon<00:00:47.579> a

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
Wernick and Hoffman first came upon a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.799 
Wernick and Hoffman first came upon a
child<00:00:48.750> with<00:00:49.050> small<00:00:49.559> muscle<00:00:49.860> atrophy

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
child with small muscle atrophy

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.549 
child with small muscle atrophy
interesting<00:00:51.809> enough<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.079> was<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.230> three<00:00:52.440> or

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
interesting enough it was a three or

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.400 
interesting enough it was a three or
four<00:00:52.770> year<00:00:52.920> old<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.550> they<00:00:53.699> they

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
four year old and so they they

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.860 
four year old and so they they
identified<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.500> as<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.820> no<00:00:56.820> mustard<00:00:57.210> Aziz

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
identified it as a no mustard Aziz

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.360 
identified it as a no mustard Aziz
but<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.289> was<00:00:58.410> different<00:00:58.739> than<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.160> other

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
but it was different than the other

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.880 
but it was different than the other
neurosurgeons<00:01:00.090> at<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.930> time<00:01:01.140> Dechaine<00:01:01.590> had

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
neurosurgeons at that time Dechaine had

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.380 
neurosurgeons at that time Dechaine had
just<00:01:02.129> identified<00:01:02.520> Duchene<00:01:03.359> muscular

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
just identified Duchene muscular

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.359 
just identified Duchene muscular
dystrophy<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.409> was<00:01:04.530> clearly<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.979> disease

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
dystrophy and that was clearly a disease

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.730 
dystrophy and that was clearly a disease
of<00:01:05.400> muscles<00:01:06.110> but<00:01:07.110> when<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.260> looked<00:01:07.500> at<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
of muscles but when I looked at the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.490 
of muscles but when I looked at the
child<00:01:07.979> with<00:01:08.600> what<00:01:09.600> they<00:01:09.780> called<00:01:10.049> worded

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
child with what they called worded

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.990 
child with what they called worded
Kaufman<00:01:10.890> disease<00:01:11.130> we<00:01:11.310> would<00:01:11.460> now<00:01:11.610> know<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.850> as

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
Kaufman disease we would now know it as

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.980 
Kaufman disease we would now know it as
SMA<00:01:12.390> -<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:13.470> miss<00:01:13.979> Reid<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.250> history<00:01:14.580> that

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
SMA - but miss Reid in history that

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.010 
SMA - but miss Reid in history that
test<00:01:15.500> to<00:01:15.680> our<00:01:15.799> babies<00:01:16.100> but<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.270> when<00:01:17.930> they

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
test to our babies but the when they

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.969 
test to our babies but the when they
looked<00:01:18.229> at<00:01:18.350> they<00:01:18.440> said<00:01:18.590> here<00:01:18.799> there's

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
looked at they said here there's

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:19.990 
looked at they said here there's
something<00:01:19.100> funny<00:01:19.430> about<00:01:19.490> this<00:01:19.760> there's

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
something funny about this there's

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.140 
something funny about this there's
muscle<00:01:20.270> atrophy<00:01:21.310> but<00:01:22.310> it's<00:01:22.460> caused<00:01:22.850> by

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
muscle atrophy but it's caused by

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.850 
muscle atrophy but it's caused by
something<00:01:23.390> in<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.630> spine<00:01:24.050> and<00:01:24.440> that's<00:01:24.680> where

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
something in the spine and that's where

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.590 
something in the spine and that's where
the<00:01:24.950> word<00:01:25.100> spinal<00:01:25.700> muscular<00:01:25.880> actually<00:01:26.390> came

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
the word spinal muscular actually came

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.510 
the word spinal muscular actually came
from<00:01:26.630> so<00:01:27.080> that<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.560> problem<00:01:27.979> is<00:01:28.070> in<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:28.310> motor

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
from so that the problem is in the motor

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.789 
from so that the problem is in the motor
neuron<00:01:28.850> but<00:01:29.810> because<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.170> motor<00:01:30.350> neuron<00:01:30.619> is

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
neuron but because the motor neuron is

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.620 
neuron but because the motor neuron is
not<00:01:31.009> there<00:01:31.280> were<00:01:31.610> not<00:01:31.790> functioning<00:01:32.030> normal

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
not there were not functioning normal

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.499 
not there were not functioning normal
way<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:33.440> message<00:01:33.800> never<00:01:34.009> runs<00:01:34.369> down<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.850> wire

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
way the message never runs down the wire

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.780 
way the message never runs down the wire
and<00:01:36.110> so<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:36.560> muscles<00:01:37.100> are<00:01:37.190> connected<00:01:37.460> then

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
and so the muscles are connected then

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.580 
and so the muscles are connected then
why<00:01:37.970> are<00:01:38.030> never<00:01:38.330> fired<00:01:38.690> and<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:39.440> as<00:01:39.560> a

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
why are never fired and so as a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.499 
why are never fired and so as a
consequence<00:01:40.040> they<00:01:40.280> eventually<00:01:40.700> shrink<00:01:41.240> down

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
consequence they eventually shrink down

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:42.820 
consequence they eventually shrink down
because<00:01:41.930> they're<00:01:42.020> not<00:01:42.110> being<00:01:42.320> used<00:01:42.380> in<00:01:42.770> the

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
because they're not being used in the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.380 
because they're not being used in the
muscles<00:01:43.100> not<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.550> body's<00:01:43.880> not<00:01:44.030> gonna<00:01:44.149> keep

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
muscles not the body's not gonna keep

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.200 
muscles not the body's not gonna keep
something<00:01:44.659> going<00:01:45.050> there<00:01:45.800> isn't<00:01:46.250> contributing

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
something going there isn't contributing

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.139 
something going there isn't contributing
anyway<00:01:47.450> and<00:01:48.289> so<00:01:48.440> this<00:01:48.590> process<00:01:48.860> here<00:01:49.310> this<00:01:49.970> is

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
anyway and so this process here this is

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.529 
anyway and so this process here this is
this<00:01:50.450> is<00:01:50.600> an<00:01:50.720> example<00:01:50.990> of<00:01:51.289> the<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:52.539> didn't

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
this is an example of the the didn't

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.180 
this is an example of the the didn't
show<00:01:53.690> up<00:01:53.810> in<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:53.990> corner<00:01:54.530> well<00:01:54.679> but<00:01:54.860> we<00:01:54.950> have

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
show up in the corner well but we have

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.450 
show up in the corner well but we have
the<00:01:55.789> the<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.539> wire<00:01:57.020> that<00:01:57.229> comes<00:01:57.380> through<00:01:57.679> it's

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
the the the wire that comes through it's

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.400 
the the the wire that comes through it's
kind<00:01:58.670> of<00:01:58.729> beady<00:01:58.970> in<00:01:59.509> this<00:01:59.810> particular<00:02:00.200> stain

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
of the two movement so we have a problem

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.879 
of the two movement so we have a problem
with<00:03:39.599> the<00:03:39.720> kids<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:40.139> that<00:03:40.260> they<00:03:40.409> have<00:03:40.620> both

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
with the kids in that they have both

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.599 
with the kids in that they have both
weakness<00:03:41.579> and<00:03:41.930> hypertrophy<00:03:43.340> at<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.430> same

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
weakness and hypertrophy at the same

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:45.770 
weakness and hypertrophy at the same
time<00:03:44.790> in<00:03:44.909> the<00:03:44.970> old<00:03:45.090> days<00:03:45.239> before<00:03:45.389> we<00:03:45.659> had

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
time in the old days before we had

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.780 
time in the old days before we had
genetic<00:03:45.959> testing<00:03:46.560> we<00:03:47.159> would<00:03:47.310> actually<00:03:47.459> use

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
genetic testing we would actually use

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.089 
genetic testing we would actually use
that<00:03:48.000> muscle<00:03:48.180> every<00:03:48.420> privacy<00:03:49.260> feature<00:03:49.739> to

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
that muscle every privacy feature to

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:51.830 
that muscle every privacy feature to
make<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.459> diagnosis<00:03:51.000> thankfully<00:03:51.629> we<00:03:51.750> don't

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
make the diagnosis thankfully we don't

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.860 
make the diagnosis thankfully we don't
have<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:52.109> do<00:03:52.260> it<00:03:52.290> very<00:03:52.440> often<00:03:52.650> anymore<00:03:53.720> but<00:03:54.720> it

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
have to do it very often anymore but it

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.900 
have to do it very often anymore but it
also<00:03:55.019> means<00:03:55.349> that<00:03:55.650> our<00:03:55.739> kids<00:03:55.980> are<00:03:56.220> sensitive

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
also means that our kids are sensitive

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.300 
also means that our kids are sensitive
to<00:03:57.150> disuse<00:03:57.989> because<00:03:58.290> just<00:03:58.650> like<00:03:58.829> if<00:03:59.040> you<00:03:59.129> take

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
to disuse because just like if you take

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.250 
to disuse because just like if you take
the<00:03:59.489> giant<00:03:59.639> muscle<00:04:00.000> beach<00:04:00.180> I<00:04:00.510> came<00:04:00.959> from<00:04:01.019> LA

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
the giant muscle beach I came from LA

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.500 
the giant muscle beach I came from LA
and<00:04:02.099> we<00:04:02.280> used<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.519> go<00:04:02.639> to<00:04:02.669> Muscle<00:04:03.090> Beach<00:04:03.120> guys

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
and we used to go to Muscle Beach guys

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.500 
and we used to go to Muscle Beach guys
and<00:04:03.810> they<00:04:03.870> were<00:04:03.930> weird<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:05.099> they<00:04:05.790> funky<00:04:06.419> and

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
and they were weird and they funky and

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.670 
and they were weird and they funky and
iron<00:04:06.629> and<00:04:06.989> they<00:04:07.139> don't<00:04:07.319> have<00:04:07.409> this<00:04:07.530> little

iron and they don't have this little

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.470 
iron and they don't have this little
notebook<00:04:07.980> about<00:04:08.310> exactly<00:04:08.760> how<00:04:09.090> much<00:04:09.239> they

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
notebook about exactly how much they

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.210 
notebook about exactly how much they
could<00:04:09.540> pump<00:04:09.810> and<00:04:10.470> if<00:04:10.560> they<00:04:10.680> don't<00:04:10.980> do

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
could pump and if they don't do

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.729 
could pump and if they don't do
something<00:04:11.250> on<00:04:11.760> Mondays<00:04:12.150> we're<00:04:12.870> always<00:04:13.440> good

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
something on Mondays we're always good

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.319 
something on Mondays we're always good
take<00:04:13.919> them<00:04:14.190> to<00:04:14.280> get<00:04:14.430> back<00:04:14.579> because<00:04:14.940> they<00:04:15.090> lose

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
take them to get back because they lose

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.839 
take them to get back because they lose
their<00:04:15.659> power<00:04:16.280> incredibly<00:04:17.280> quickly<00:04:17.639> because

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
their power incredibly quickly because

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.610 
their power incredibly quickly because
they're<00:04:17.970> so<00:04:18.120> a<00:04:18.150> virtual<00:04:18.479> feeding<00:04:18.989> our<00:04:19.590> kids

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
they're so a virtual feeding our kids

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.259 
they're so a virtual feeding our kids
with<00:04:19.919> Estimator<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.430> same<00:04:20.609> way<00:04:20.789> their

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
with Estimator the same way their

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.240 
with Estimator the same way their
hypertrophy<00:04:21.989> inside<00:04:22.440> this<00:04:22.680> muscle<00:04:23.099> that's

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
hypertrophy inside this muscle that's

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.760 
hypertrophy inside this muscle that's
atrophy<00:04:23.760> and<00:04:24.060> so<00:04:24.720> there<00:04:24.900> are<00:04:24.930> very<00:04:25.199> sensitive

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
atrophy and so there are very sensitive

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.830 
atrophy and so there are very sensitive
to<00:04:25.979> disuse<00:04:26.789> if<00:04:27.090> they<00:04:27.270> get<00:04:27.720> a<00:04:27.750> cold<00:04:28.020> if<00:04:28.830> they<00:04:29.130> are

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
to disuse if they get a cold if they are

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.070 
to disuse if they get a cold if they are
sick<00:04:30.840> they<00:04:31.110> lose<00:04:31.830> power<00:04:31.940> faster<00:04:32.940> than<00:04:33.570> I<00:04:33.930> would

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
sick they lose power faster than I would

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.910 
sick they lose power faster than I would
define<00:04:34.650> the

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
in the first place and so I don't have

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
the same capacity lose in two days if I

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.060 
the same capacity lose in two days if I
