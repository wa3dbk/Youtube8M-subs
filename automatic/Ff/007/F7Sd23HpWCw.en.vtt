00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.869
 The galaxy s got four mini so 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.850
 I hardly expected 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:16.250
 Herr folien on it, that one immediately 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.250

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:57.759
 nothing in the pack then 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:01.970
 I will this time the film making from 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.259
 actually quite nice from London 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.340
 We think we only had the dark ones 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:10.850
 bright version seen 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:12.830
 Well, first unpack this here 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.920
 Plastic films at HTC are somehow 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.920
 nice but good is also a foil 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:31.800
 This polycarbonate back cover is not 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.800
 so good for the fingernails 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.730
 I'll put that in 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.810
 then static that just ne 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:55.010

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:59.030

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:03.530

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:06.830
 display good old samsung sound now 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.830
 I'm curious how the thing 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.210
 looks like when it's now he invites 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.440
 here's the bus screen but now you can 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.380
 you already set something here 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.920
 language and so on you know 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:22.250
 further on we are wlan 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.430
 outside, of course, also not true 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:30.100
 end user agreement and that many 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.100
 dialogues that you have to confirm here 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.160
 skip probably comes 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.370
 just over here a bit here he 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:42.380
 maybe the google account should be 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:48.110
 not everything read now 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:52.070
 of course not really 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:55.810
 personalize top box oh there is 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.810
 50 GB memory also not bad 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:04.240
 new and since it is already the 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.470
 the first time it actually starts up 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.560
 very fluid we go to the times 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:13.540
 setting or the familiar tab menu 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:18.040
 that we already at the galaxy s 4 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.480
 so it has started up 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.579
 then let's go to the test 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:25.000
 maybe it will take a fortnight 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:28.030
 but then we know how it works 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.200
 on the duration in everyday life sleeps beats 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:36.090

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.090
 is the galaxy s 4 million 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.750
