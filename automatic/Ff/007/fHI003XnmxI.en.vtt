 ah 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.470
 hello and welcome to the second part of 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.280
 the series of the memory speaks to them or mega 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.530
 gameplay 32 with the b jetix series before 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.770
 to start if they did not see my first video 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:34.370
 but before seeing this and said this 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:37.520
 Let's start Jetix was born in 2004 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.650
 replacing fox who had series and 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.570
 some were for sabers and others that 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.879
 they were a great shit I also had 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.760
 good blocks like power generation 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.070
 rangers that were passable but not enough 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.339
 shit on photos signatures that in 2009 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.949
 ended jetix and now it's disney xd that 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:57.470
 the truth is a great shit but good 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.870
 now I will show you some series that 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.089
 rescue and that in my opinion they put 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.110
 name to jetix without counting those that 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:08.640
 repeated the fox kid 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.030
 number one and I two rabbits and a panga 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.030
 doing karate 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.310
 number 2 the ninja turtles first and 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.530
 third season a good 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.340
 modernization of turtles girls 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.479
 classic 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.320
 number 3 power rangers animal fury 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:30.710
 power rangers with animal instinct 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.800
 number 4 the super cyber squad monkeys 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.240
 hyper strength already apart from the name of 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.960
 long a series that I recommend seeing 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.390
 number 5 with a river with is definitely a 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.040
 of the great series that gave jetix and 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.110
 what you have to see before dying 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:54.710
 number 6 dave the barbarian rei chavos 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:57.850
 number 7 and lemon 0 3 does not compare to 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:02.820

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:06.540

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.610
 power of gems 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.330
 number 10 and I disgusting technology but 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.110
 entertaining 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.350
 number 11 mega man n the warrior I do not 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:25.010
 like the game but the series is passable 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.050
 number 12 the magical godfathers good 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.960
 series that has been highlighted more in 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.860
 nickelodeon 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.080
 number 13 power rangers spr power 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.800
 police rangers who locked up the 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.730
 bad on some cards 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.950
 number 14 generation power rangers without 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.770
 doubt one of the best blocks I gave 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:51.190
 jetix since it gave classic power rangers 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.410
 number 15 power rangers wild force 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.750
 what I liked most about this season 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.130
 It was when all the 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:03.450
 referents but good series 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.010
 number 16 sonic x the famous notice of 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.909
 dry 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.410
 number 17 the secret show nor do I know what 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:15.030
 what do they do 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.850
 and number 18 wolverine and the x-men a 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.210
 series that you have to see good in 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.460
 Jetix conclusion never came to be like 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.010
 fox ki since he gave few series for 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.070
 sabers and now with this improvement went to 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.900
 the good fuck that would be the video see 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.930
 the third and last part where 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.210
 I will criticize disney xd and subscribe if 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.310
 they liked the video and if it's not worth a 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:42.200
 reggaeton sorry fuck your 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.200
