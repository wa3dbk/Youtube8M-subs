00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:10.950
 so people i had asked someone if i am 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.000
 a video could be how to do this geotag 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.199
 01 bluetooth headset for the playstation 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.779
 joins and I'll do it now 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:25.080
 a little video and that is about 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:26.699
 this headset here yes i am there can 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.529
 Get started right away and show how to do it 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:44.129
 that addresses where it really is not 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:01:07.970
 a lot to draw there but then want 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:01:07.970
 we're fine 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:17.759
 to connect the headset 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:19.790
 let's go I know so far it sees 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.990
 a bit bad all good 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:31.670
 similar here on peripheral device 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:33.640
 settings and want at the moment 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.700
 I'm just confused 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:45.080
 Manage bluetooth devices 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:47.420
 therefore it is already registered 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:51.080
 not registered would be pressed on 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.799
 Register new device and stop now 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:59.350
 on the headset the button in the middle 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:04.009
 here you will be able to handle the easy for 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:07.899
 about 56 seconds, the light is green 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.899
 and blue alternately blinks 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:26.990
 the show effect looks like now 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.000
 you see it blinks alternately green and 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.740
 blue 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.950
 then we press in the playstation 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:43.270
 start menu scan and then he will 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:43.270
 now, too, should at least find 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.120
 still 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.880
 Well, so I assume that is 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.950
 problem with that is that I have it 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.650
 already I will just people for 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.650
 delete you all right 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.090
 germany is deleted the councils 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.500
 want to manage a device 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:24.850
 so never hold your moment of registration 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:27.010
 the middle button pressed down until 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:33.190
 switch the headset green and blue 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:35.680
 flashes then press yes I want 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:40.390
 A new device scans states as known 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.870
 he should now, too 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.640
 Find 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.180
 now there are the first bluetooth 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.030
 this is the ps3 ex number one 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.290
 we confirm with iks wait shortly then 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.600
 come this password 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.570
 which by default was four times 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.500
 press the zero specified options 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.660
 start press ok registration is running 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.459
 Registration successfully 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.610
 control lamp now only lights up 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:12.370
 blue uplink you and now we can 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.459
 go to audiogerÃ¤t settings and 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.830
 could it be here as an input device 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:22.360
 Use and take output device when 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:24.640
 We only keep the tone through the language 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:29.470
 the other players only agree about that 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:32.950
 headset nights yes people then I would 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.669
