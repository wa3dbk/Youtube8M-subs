think<00:03:32.390> we<00:03:32.480> have<00:03:32.630> NDA<00:03:33.020> yet<00:03:34.090> just<00:03:35.090> added<00:03:35.390> it

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
think we have NDA yet just added it

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.000 
think we have NDA yet just added it
right<00:03:35.660> there<00:03:35.840> and<00:03:35.930> so<00:03:36.050> I'd<00:03:36.290> rather<00:03:36.530> have<00:03:36.800> that

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
right there and so I'd rather have that

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.790 
right there and so I'd rather have that
right<00:03:37.190> down<00:03:37.459> here<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:38.630> then<00:03:39.230> put<00:03:39.500> that<00:03:39.530> one

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
right down here and then put that one

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.720 
right down here and then put that one
over<00:03:40.010> here<00:03:40.310> so<00:03:40.760> on<00:03:40.940> grid<00:03:41.810> we<00:03:41.989> saw<00:03:42.580> linear<00:03:43.580> and

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
over here so on grid we saw linear and

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.550 
over here so on grid we saw linear and
wave<00:03:43.970> are<00:03:44.270> kind<00:03:44.510> of<00:03:44.600> the<00:03:44.690> same<00:03:44.930> in<00:03:45.110> that<00:03:45.380> it

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
wave are kind of the same in that it

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.280 
wave are kind of the same in that it
shows<00:03:45.590> you<00:03:46.160> know<00:03:46.250> a<00:03:46.459> PDF<00:03:47.090> coming<00:03:47.480> in<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:47.930> then

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
shows you know a PDF coming in and then

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.610 
shows you know a PDF coming in and then
the<00:03:48.470> old<00:03:48.680> ones<00:03:48.950> going<00:03:49.220> out<00:03:49.459> and<00:03:50.200> this<00:03:51.200> one<00:03:51.380> it

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
the old ones going out and this one it

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.380 
the old ones going out and this one it
has<00:03:51.800> a<00:03:51.830> strip<00:03:52.160> at<00:03:52.280> the<00:03:52.340> bottom<00:03:52.670> for<00:03:52.820> linear<00:03:53.150> and

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
has a strip at the bottom for linear and

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.210 
has a strip at the bottom for linear and
what's<00:03:53.959> also<00:03:54.110> interesting<00:03:54.260> about<00:03:54.709> linear<00:03:55.160> is

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
what's also interesting about linear is

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.170 
what's also interesting about linear is
that<00:03:55.370> you<00:03:55.430> can<00:03:55.550> put<00:03:55.700> a<00:03:55.730> little<00:03:55.910> bit<00:03:56.060> of

kind of fun after you choose a layout
let's<00:04:29.000> try<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.330> click<00:04:30.020> through<00:04:30.170> I<00:04:30.260> kind<00:04:30.530> of

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
let's try the click through I kind of

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.950 
let's try the click through I kind of
like<00:04:30.710> that<00:04:30.860> one<00:04:33.820> you<00:04:34.820> can<00:04:35.000> choose<00:04:35.240> a<00:04:35.300> different

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
like that one you can choose a different

like that one you can choose a different
visual<00:04:36.350> theme<00:04:36.680> these<00:04:37.370> are<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.640> same<00:04:37.850> visual

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090

layouts so you can bounce back and forth
like<00:04:41.780> for<00:04:42.080> example<00:04:42.470> if<00:04:42.650> we<00:04:43.220> look<00:04:43.400> at<00:04:43.550> the

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
like for example if we look at the

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.420 
like for example if we look at the
spring<00:04:44.000> visual<00:04:44.660> theme<00:04:44.990> but<00:04:45.980> they<00:04:46.130> click

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
spring visual theme but they click

spring visual theme but they click
through<00:04:46.640> layout<00:04:47.120> you<00:04:47.360> could<00:04:47.510> also<00:04:47.630> look<00:04:47.870> at

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
through layout you could also look at

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.020 
through layout you could also look at
the<00:04:48.110> spring<00:04:48.380> visual<00:04:48.860> theme<00:04:49.190> with<00:04:49.700> the<00:04:49.820> grid

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
the spring visual theme with the grid

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.740 
the spring visual theme with the grid
layout<00:04:53.560> but<00:04:54.560> didn't<00:04:54.920> remember<00:04:55.130> it<00:04:55.419> let's<00:04:56.419> come
