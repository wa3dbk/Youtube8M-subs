00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
straight and your arms just down to your

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.049 
straight and your arms just down to your
sides<00:00:43.320> with<00:00:43.469> or<00:00:43.710> without<00:00:43.800> your<00:00:44.129> weights<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.969> as

sides with or without your weights so as

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.910 
sides with or without your weights so as
we<00:00:45.180> inhale<00:00:45.539> will<00:00:45.870> lower<00:00:46.079> down<00:00:46.170> straight<00:00:46.890> down

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
we inhale will lower down straight down

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.069 
we inhale will lower down straight down
into<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.370> lunge<00:00:47.579> exhale<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.750> push<00:00:48.930> right

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
into that lunge exhale to push right

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.779 
into that lunge exhale to push right
back<00:00:49.289> up<00:00:49.469> that's<00:00:49.770> all<00:00:49.950> there<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.640> I

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
back up that's all there is to it I

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.490 
back up that's all there is to it I
really<00:00:51.390> like<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:51.719> lunge<00:00:52.020> with<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.320> ball

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
really like this lunge with the ball

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.799 
really like this lunge with the ball
because<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.640> lunges<00:00:53.940> are<00:00:54.059> one<00:00:54.270> thing<00:00:54.539> that

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
because the lunges are one thing that

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.180 
because the lunges are one thing that
people<00:00:54.930> tend<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.440> kind<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.770> mess<00:00:55.920> up<00:00:55.949> their

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
people tend to kind of mess up their

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.529 
people tend to kind of mess up their
form<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.550> little<00:00:56.730> bit<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.180> see<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.390> lot<00:00:57.510> of

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
form a little bit you see a lot of

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.990 
form a little bit you see a lot of
leaning<00:00:58.020> forward<00:00:58.399> especially<00:00:59.399> into<00:00:59.879> your

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
leaning forward especially into your

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000 
leaning forward especially into your
forward<00:01:00.359> leg<00:01:00.539> but<00:01:00.989> when<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.260> use<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.710> ball

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
forward leg but when you use this ball

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.429 
forward leg but when you use this ball
you're<00:01:02.640> forced<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.270> stand<00:01:03.629> up<00:01:03.780> really<00:01:04.199> tall

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
you're forced to stand up really tall

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.830 
you're forced to stand up really tall
and<00:01:04.799> really<00:01:05.250> use<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.460> great<00:01:05.790> form<00:01:06.180> for<00:01:06.720> your

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
and really use a great form for your

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.320 
and really use a great form for your
whole<00:01:07.080> exercise<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.310> think<00:01:08.700> you'll<00:01:08.820> feel<00:01:09.060> this

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
whole exercise I think you'll feel this

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.090 
whole exercise I think you'll feel this
one<00:01:09.600> much<00:01:10.080> more<00:01:10.409> than<00:01:10.619> if<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.799> were<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.979> do

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
one much more than if you were to do

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.010 
one much more than if you were to do
lunges<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.420> floor<00:01:12.659> without<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
lunges just on the floor without the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.420 
lunges just on the floor without the
ball<00:01:13.229> I'm<00:01:13.590> going<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.799> go<00:01:13.890> ahead<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.189> switch
