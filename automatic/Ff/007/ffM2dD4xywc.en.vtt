it<00:00:32.040> up<00:00:32.160> make<00:00:32.790> sure<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.120> your<00:00:33.270> device<00:00:33.390> is

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
it up make sure that your device is

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.290 
it up make sure that your device is
recognized<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.460> supported<00:00:36.120> and

it will retrieve the information to

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.970 
it will retrieve the information to
generate<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.450> jailbreak<00:00:39.899> data<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.829> will

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
generate the jailbreak data so you will

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.160 
generate the jailbreak data so you will
see<00:00:41.160> your<00:00:41.250> device<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.750> lower<00:00:42.930> right<00:00:43.140> hand

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.420 
times and just going to be waiting for
the<00:00:48.510> reboot<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.350> don't<00:00:49.620> touch<00:00:49.890> your<00:00:50.100> device

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
the reboot so don't touch your device

the reboot so don't touch your device
until<00:00:51.180> we<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.780> inject<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.379> jailbreak

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
until we have to inject the jailbreak

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.880 
until we have to inject the jailbreak
data<00:00:53.010> which<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> little<00:00:53.969> bit<00:00:54.090> later<00:00:54.270> on<00:00:54.890> so

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
data which is a little bit later on so

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.770
