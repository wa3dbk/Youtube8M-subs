00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.830
 hello everyone with you the background of the planets and today 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.510
 mortal kombat x game review 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.830
 It was a long time ago that everything was new 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.680
 decided to review it 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.630
 In general, I will tell everything in detail about the game and about 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.060
 pros and cons of what you like 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:27.090
 that you liked the game enough 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.949
 popular here and let's click fight well 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.990
 First you can say it and plus and 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.199
 minus the fact that we choose three at once 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.210
 I do not know the player right away when you first start 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.579
 I somehow did not like it but I will play 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.799
 I basically got used to it and 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.780
 I did not like to play three characters 

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:46.889
 since they can be constantly changed now 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.719
 I'll show you how this is done 

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:50.489
 talk about svaypah that is management 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.139
 slides it is of course very stupid 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.530
 actually played especially 

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:59.670
 mortal kombat on cedia think not at all 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.289
 like to the management here so this 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.719
 huge minus what control with 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.369
 wipes it is generally stupid just really 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.930
 inconvenient to manage especially when 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.079
 appears some kind of battalion commander or 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.609
 supeudar this shows where you want 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:15.500
 make your would just do not have time it 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:19.049
 It does not because it is uncomfortable here 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:23.640
 So we won in short but now I'll show you 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.460
 how the general character changes I don’t know how 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.400
 it all looks 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.760
 so on us here we add all sorts 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.460
 there are these additions there any weapons but 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.470
 I don't know exactly what to add here 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:45.140
 I'll show you just the gameplay itself 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:50.680
 Here, as if all the form of maps improve nudity 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.680
 some thing to add ok 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.250
 as for the graphics the graphics here in 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.230
 principle is normal but is it possible like that 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.930
 better by using special files i'm still 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.550
 I don’t know exactly, but I think they did 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.840
 such a thing that you can improve the graphics 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.310
 as still in some places 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.709
 blurry textures they are very nice 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.170
 looks 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:18.800
 it was possible in principle to texture the character 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:23.180
 do better think nothing lagged and 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.750
 so fine so basically the graphics 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.620
 looks even very nice 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:36.280
 that's the only thing that did not like in 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:38.320
 the game is your control at all 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.000
 inconvenient management 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.610
 here is such a toy 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.220
 there is still possible to show but add 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.910
 can by the way does add weapons 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.590
 various 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.180
 as far as I understand, let us now 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.510
 let's see what the hell is the shop 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.549
 loan that there is 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.430
 card sets and but this card set can 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:05.530
 choose let's buy possess buy 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.400
 vodka drank some cards that is 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.379
 characters characters quite a lot 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.849
 I think Mortal Kombat was the third 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:17.709
 more who played a series of this 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.569
 the famous game still seems to me 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:24.480
 mortal kombat on cedia 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.480
 cool than the droid that came out 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.300
 So 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.690
 let's write a man 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.690
 so and 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.580
 and here by the way there is a multiplayer 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:45.230
 multi-player something really from 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:49.400
 This is also a huge plus test rider 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.920
 so what it is I need the most such 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.739
 common favorite character seems to me 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:04:00.920
 generally cool which is electric 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:07.430
 they always played like this the war faction 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:11.780
 wide she is like this so 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:16.070
 Well, let 's choose the war faction 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.959
 Steps from but there is a kind of multiplayer 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.859
 now try to play show how 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.859
 multiplayer looks 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:35.950
 so bout city ​​let's hit fast battle 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.950
 Well, let's 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.610
 But from these svaypom from what it will be 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.200
 so stupid for the truth that is stupid who 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.540
 faster this will be its fake 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.260
 right here won some moron 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.760
 seriously there are some sort of combo 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.710
 There is but clearly not noticed there only 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.490
 offers where to click then after 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.080
 how fast will you quickly swipe right 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.660
 then everything will also appear right now 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.730
 quickly appeared and disappeared like this 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.280
 you need to have time to make a pancake as this 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:12.260
 uncomfortable at all when down or up 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.800
 it appears already so hrenachim market 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.120
 otherwise 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:21.790
 and who faster damn svaypat won here 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:25.750
 on the other serious and in principle 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:28.360
 look at it is interesting even 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:33.289
 but it is also interesting to play 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:35.029
 despite the fact that the management here 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.699
 Here is such an interesting toy in 

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:39.710
 in principle there is nothing to show here 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.990
