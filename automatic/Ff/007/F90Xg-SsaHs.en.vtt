00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.799
 hi friends how are we good at this 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.369
 I bring you the video of how 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:15.410
 make our custom carrier for 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:17.270
 here to change the legend of 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.250
 our operator previously already 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.650
 I brought the video to change our 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.169
 carrier and in this video well I told them 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.669
 that they would make me good if I wanted 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.039
 someone who made them some logo 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:31.400
 that they sent it to me inbox and that 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.930
 I was glad to do them, no no 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.760
 No message came through the inbox all 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.470
 put them here in the comments on 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.270
 the comments boxes and by 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.330
 example this person thanked him for 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.490
 the video you can make a logo that says and 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.070
 I leave you systems with the logo of the 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.750
 apple for fa and but hey tell me what 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.700
 letter did not tell me what color does not tell me 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.920
 nothing and good so I can not do 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.090
 nothing practically everyone gave me what 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.860
 he himself does not tell me they do not give me 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.690
 many specifications tell me I want to 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.000
 this logo I want the other but I do not have 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.860
 idea that then whatever the logo 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.810
 that you ask so good 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.780
 I bring here the little tutorial for 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.939
 make our own logos and good what 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.740
 only thing that we have to do, I do this 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.060
 with photoshop but you can occupy the 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.149
 program that you like the most 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.509
 and that suits ok ok we need 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:20.119
 open a new document width 140 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.030
 pixels and high 40 pixels 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.539
 ok well I will re-arrange them wide 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.080
 140 pixels and high 40 pixels is going to 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:31.939
 leave a small rectangle more or less 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.679
 of this size and we want to do it 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.929
 bigger because we're half blind or 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:38.360
 simply for comfort we are going 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.399
 looking for we can put the letters and 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.220
 drawings that we want but that 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.709
 do not get out of this little box ok 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.899
 if you want to put some fund then 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:50.030
 is going to see the background on your iphone or that 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.479
 I prefer it just like this 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:58.390
 transparent white and good I nothing more 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:02.770
 I'm going to put on we're going to put software 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.350
 here we are going to do it fast trying to 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.700
 do not take long nothing more than I'm going to 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.180
 up a little bit 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.849
 to see here I think 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.709
 let's go back to do it I will not try 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.760
 to hurry letters to do it faster and 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.709
 concise possible to do this little 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.060
 tutorial will not change practically 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.640
 nothing nothing else we are going to put another 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.680
 image here aso week here we are going to 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:33.719
 add the shadow 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:36.150
 here the normal and we are adjusting ok 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:40.379
 this is already optional what boys already 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.390
 if you want this to see how it is 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.700
 there to go putting the things that 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.939
 you like it most is completely 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.459
 optional ok to me I just like it 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:52.980
 add some kind of shadows here 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.709
 I would like to see what it looks like but 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.049
 simply with the shadow is more than 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.599
 enough I'm going to upload a little 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.579
 image seems perfect to me and now 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.230
 I'll add an image Abrashi me 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.799
 I'm going to add the group image and they're 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.189
 for example this is nothing but that is very 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:13.590
 I'm going to be smaller here 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:18.930
 I think it will be perfect 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.980
 being very big and seeing there is not 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.599
 now more than I think I 'm not staying 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.970
 square I 'm left with a kind of 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:27.000
 rectangle now yes 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:31.410
 there we have the image we give the intro 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.950
 and then I think that there is 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.920
 it's nothing else for the tutorial I do not see it 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.290
 nothing serious so good guys 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.550
 well this would be our image I'm going to 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.380
 make the image a little bit smaller 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.480
 so that it does not look pixelated here and the 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.000
 can see more clearly and make pixels 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.590
 This is how our good image will look 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.340
 Well, that's how I liked it 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.540
 this is me like that and I like you as 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.750
 I repeat again if you want 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.010
 change you move design or what 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.420
 you want if you are about 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.209
 experts in photoshop because here is 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:09.190
 they can show me the truth because they barely 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:13.280
 the basics do not believe that I am bitch a 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.290
 not good photoshop master we're going 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.650
 and to leave nothing but now I 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.009
 I separated a lot for guy 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.650
 I think so now that the name 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:26.800
 let's put we give file save 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.630

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.550
 folder that you want or I want it 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.960
 if you want to leave on the desktop I 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.490

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:42.009
