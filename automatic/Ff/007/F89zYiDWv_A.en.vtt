00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
in the beginning and I my strategy I've

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.069 
in the beginning and I my strategy I've

learned is to run up and grab them as
soon<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:01.980> possible<00:01:02.550> because<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.910> get<00:01:03.059> stuff

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
like this crossbow which one shot anyone

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.580 
like this crossbow which one shot anyone
and<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:06.510> will<00:01:06.659> break<00:01:06.840> by<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.200> way<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.409> have

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
and it will break by the way you have

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.340 
and it will break by the way you have
these<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.250> three<00:01:08.520> layers<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.880> ice<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:10.020> may

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
these like three layers of ice to may

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.490 
these like three layers of ice to may
have<00:01:10.439> already<00:01:10.590> noticed<00:01:10.710> by<00:01:11.220> now<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.580> you

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
have already noticed by now and you

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.880 
have already noticed by now and you
pretty<00:01:13.500> much<00:01:13.590> need<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.070> break<00:01:14.369> other<00:01:14.549> people

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
pretty much need to break other people

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.230 
pretty much need to break other people
break<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.009> ice<00:01:17.040> underneath<00:01:17.369> other<00:01:17.909> people

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
break the ice underneath other people

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.719 
break the ice underneath other people
and<00:01:18.479> they'll<00:01:18.960> fall<00:01:19.170> down<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.500> die<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.610> get

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
and they'll fall down and die so you get

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.120 
and they'll fall down and die so you get
points<00:01:20.939> for<00:01:21.090> breaking<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.479> ice<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.130> that's

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
points for breaking the ice and that's

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.649 
points for breaking the ice and that's
kind<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.340> how<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.490> coming<00:01:23.820> that's<00:01:24.540> how<00:01:24.630> you

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
kind of how you coming that's how you

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.570 
kind of how you coming that's how you
can<00:01:24.900> kind<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.140> keep<00:01:25.590> score<00:01:26.040> but<00:01:26.189> score<00:01:26.430> doesn't

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
can kind of keep score but score doesn't

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.390

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
will get a point in whoever gets to 10

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.310 
will get a point in whoever gets to 10
points<00:01:34.170> will<00:01:34.920> win<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:36.360> overall<00:01:36.869> thing<00:01:37.170> I

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
points will win the the overall thing I

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.499 
points will win the the overall thing I
guess<00:01:37.500> right<00:01:38.369> now<00:01:38.430> mister<00:01:39.000> how<00:01:39.150> much<00:01:39.299> people

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
guess right now mister how much people

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.980 
guess right now mister how much people
might<00:01:39.960> grow<00:01:40.259> an<00:01:40.350> axis<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.100> those<00:01:41.280> axes

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
might grow an axis this those axes

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.630 
might grow an axis this those axes
horizontally<00:01:42.990> like<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.320> whenever<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.369> never

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
horizontally like that whenever I never

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.490 
horizontally like that whenever I never
seen<00:01:45.149> anyone<00:01:45.360> throwing<00:01:45.630> anything<00:01:45.899> horizontal

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
seen anyone throwing anything horizontal

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.760 
seen anyone throwing anything horizontal
well<00:01:47.189> either<00:01:47.640> way<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.939> works<00:01:48.119> haha<00:01:48.780> feel<00:01:49.619> like

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
well either way it works haha feel like

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.469 
well either way it works haha feel like
that<00:01:49.979> would<00:01:50.070> make<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.310> do<00:01:51.060> some<00:01:51.270> kind<00:01:51.420> of

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
that would make it do some kind of

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.280 
that would make it do some kind of
boomerang

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
boomerang

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.740

guns for now I'm actually having a lot

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.470 
guns for now I'm actually having a lot
of<00:03:04.750> fun<00:03:04.989> even<00:03:05.320> if<00:03:05.709> this<00:03:06.280> all<00:03:06.489> is<00:03:06.670> if<00:03:06.910> this<00:03:07.239> was

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
of fun even if this all is if this was

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.930 
of fun even if this all is if this was
all<00:03:07.660> this<00:03:07.870> game<00:03:08.080> was<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.830> be<00:03:09.010> fine<00:03:09.220> this<00:03:09.430> this

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
all this game was that be fine this this

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.940 
all this game was that be fine this this
is<00:03:10.120> probably<00:03:10.330> more<00:03:10.570> of<00:03:10.690> a<00:03:10.870> closer<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.799> like<00:03:11.920> a

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
is probably more of a closer to like a

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.460 
is probably more of a closer to like a
counter<00:03:12.340> strike<00:03:12.549> or<00:03:13.140> something<00:03:14.140> like<00:03:14.410> that

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
counter strike or something like that

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.880 
counter strike or something like that
Sal<00:03:14.890> shooter<00:03:15.570> just<00:03:16.570> from<00:03:16.810> playing<00:03:17.140> around<00:03:17.620> and

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
Sal shooter just from playing around and

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.670 
Sal shooter just from playing around and
watching<00:03:18.900> watching<00:03:19.900> what<00:03:20.200> else<00:03:20.320> you<00:03:20.440> can<00:03:20.590> do

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
watching watching what else you can do

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.530 
watching watching what else you can do
in<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:20.830> game

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.839 

very<00:03:24.230> fast<00:03:24.530> paced<00:03:25.010> first-person<00:03:25.640> shooter<00:03:27.849> but

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
very fast paced first-person shooter but

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.360 
very fast paced first-person shooter but
yeah<00:03:29.030> it<00:03:29.150> does<00:03:29.329> most<00:03:29.989> closely<00:03:30.560> remind<00:03:30.829> me<00:03:30.950> of<00:03:31.069> a

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
yeah it does most closely remind me of a

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.230 
yeah it does most closely remind me of a
half<00:03:32.090> life<00:03:32.329> in<00:03:32.599> terms<00:03:32.840> of

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
half life in terms of

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.120 
half life in terms of
the<00:03:34.720> silliness<00:03:35.110> of<00:03:35.380> it<00:03:35.500> right<00:03:35.650> now<00:03:35.800> you<00:03:35.860> know

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
the silliness of it right now you know

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.950 
the silliness of it right now you know
this<00:03:36.610> is<00:03:36.760> not<00:03:36.880> a<00:03:37.110> man<00:03:38.110> not<00:03:38.770> a<00:03:38.830> custom<00:03:39.340> level<00:03:39.960> but

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
this is not a man not a custom level but

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.570 
this is not a man not a custom level but
this<00:03:41.140> does<00:03:41.380> remind<00:03:41.710> me<00:03:41.860> of<00:03:41.950> those<00:03:42.190> custom

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
this does remind me of those custom

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.810 
this does remind me of those custom
levels<00:03:42.880> in<00:03:43.000> half-life<00:03:44.340> about<00:03:45.340> half<00:03:45.460> off<00:03:45.610> of<00:03:45.760> me

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
levels in half-life about half off of me

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.410 
levels in half-life about half off of me
yeah<00:03:46.030> that's<00:03:46.810> perfect<00:03:47.760> whatever<00:03:48.760> have<00:03:49.210> like
