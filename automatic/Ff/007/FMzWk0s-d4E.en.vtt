and<00:00:09.030> if<00:00:09.360> you<00:00:09.480> notice<00:00:09.809> unlike<00:00:10.379> the<00:00:10.559> smokestack

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
and if you notice unlike the smokestack

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.360 
and if you notice unlike the smokestack
there's<00:00:11.610> not<00:00:11.760> a<00:00:11.790> liner<00:00:12.090> in<00:00:12.270> this<00:00:12.389> one<00:00:13.190> so<00:00:14.190> it's

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
there's not a liner in this one so it's

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.060 
there's not a liner in this one so it's
just<00:00:14.490> an<00:00:15.120> open<00:00:15.300> inner<00:00:15.680> let's<00:00:16.680> talk<00:00:16.830> about<00:00:16.950> I

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
just an open inner let's talk about I

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.769 
just an open inner let's talk about I
almost<00:00:17.580> only<00:00:17.910> go<00:00:18.060> back<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.360> smoke<00:00:18.599> sock

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
almost only go back to the smoke sock

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.540 
almost only go back to the smoke sock
just<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.020> moment<00:00:19.290> we're<00:00:19.950> looking<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.369> while

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
just a moment we're looking that while

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.990 
just a moment we're looking that while
ago<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:21.210> know<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:22.520> lot<00:00:23.520> of<00:00:23.580> people<00:00:23.789> want<00:00:23.910> to

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
ago you know the lot of people want to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.179 
ago you know the lot of people want to
keep<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.420> keep<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.779> smokestack<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:26.010> big

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
keep the keep the smokestack the big

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.890 
keep the keep the smokestack the big
stack<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.640> make<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> lighthouse<00:00:27.570> out<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.840> it

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
stack and make a lighthouse out of it

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.630 
stack and make a lighthouse out of it
and<00:00:27.990> those<00:00:28.050> kind<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.350> things<00:00:28.590> but<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.490> big

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
and those kind of things but the big

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.400 
and those kind of things but the big
theory<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.300> it's<00:00:30.539> not<00:00:30.720> stable<00:00:31.170> enough<00:00:31.230> to

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
theory is that it's not stable enough to

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.320 
theory is that it's not stable enough to
believe<00:00:31.980> standing<00:00:32.430> around<00:00:32.580> other<00:00:32.879> structures

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.330 
believe standing around other structures

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.840 
believe standing around other structures
is<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.629> no<00:00:33.900> it's<00:00:34.080> not<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.949> main<00:00:35.370> reason<00:00:35.400> is

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
is it no it's not and the main reason is

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.610 
is it no it's not and the main reason is
it's<00:00:36.480> because<00:00:36.690> it's<00:00:36.840> an<00:00:36.930> old<00:00:37.079> stack<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.530> it's

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
it's because it's an old stack and it's

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.860 
it's because it's an old stack and it's
tall<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.850> do<00:00:38.940> get<00:00:39.059> hurricanes<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.570> every

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
tall and you do get hurricanes and every

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.920 
tall and you do get hurricanes and every
once<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.200> while<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.790> it<00:00:41.790> could<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.329> mean<00:00:42.600> it's

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
once in a while and it could I mean it's

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.750 
once in a while and it could I mean it's
an<00:00:43.020> old<00:00:43.110> stack<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.710> concrete<00:00:44.280> does<00:00:44.460> get<00:00:44.610> old

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
an old stack and concrete does get old

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.510 
an old stack and concrete does get old
does<00:00:44.940> crack<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.920> if<00:00:46.920> they<00:00:47.070> did<00:00:47.219> leave<00:00:47.370> before

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
does crack and if they did leave before

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.400 
does crack and if they did leave before
lighthouse<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.090> they<00:00:48.149> build<00:00:48.360> around<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.780> and

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
lighthouse and they build around it and

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.170 
lighthouse and they build around it and
it<00:00:49.530> failed<00:00:49.770> it's<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.039> big<00:00:50.190> liability<00:00:50.520> nobody

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
it failed it's a big liability nobody

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.970 
it failed it's a big liability nobody
nobody<00:00:51.660> would<00:00:51.750> insure<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.140> with<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.410> oh<00:00:52.559> no<00:00:52.950> I

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
nobody would insure it with it oh no I

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.920 
nobody would insure it with it oh no I
don't<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.579> wouldn't<00:00:53.789> see<00:00:53.969> anybody<00:00:54.149> insuring<00:00:54.780> it

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
don't I wouldn't see anybody insuring it

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.660 
don't I wouldn't see anybody insuring it
so<00:00:55.350> it'd<00:00:55.469> be<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.620> big<00:00:55.829> liability<00:00:56.399> on<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
so it'd be a big liability on the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.779 
so it'd be a big liability on the
developer<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:58.199> would<00:00:58.410> be<00:00:58.579> not<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.670> his

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
developer and it it would be not to his

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.400 
developer and it it would be not to his
benefit<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.210> leave<00:01:00.360> it<00:01:00.510> yeah<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:00.989> know<00:01:01.170> that

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
benefit to leave it yeah I know that

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.779 
benefit to leave it yeah I know that
you've<00:01:01.559> heard<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.949> couple<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.309> times

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
West the smokestacks moving to West and

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.920 
West the smokestacks moving to West and
so<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.740> big<00:01:16.920> boiler<00:01:17.220> house<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.720> river

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
so is the big boiler house so the river

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.410 
so is the big boiler house so the river
is<00:01:19.170> very<00:01:19.350> safe<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:20.549> remember<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:21.000> guy<00:01:21.210> by<00:01:21.390> the
