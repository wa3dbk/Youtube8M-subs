00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.039
 Today we will talk about interesting 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:22.560
 the device is both a camera and a tablet 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.019

 camera hard to talk about the device 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.670
 which is unusual for us but okay 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.469

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.100
 lcd 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.750
 above we see the shutter release button 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:52.050
 turn off and on the left side 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.449

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.270
 by the way there is a way out and winter and on the right 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.520
 the faces we see holes under the cord connector 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.290
 under usb to charge for computer 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.020

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:27.900
 now it is the usual cars also have 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.630
 manual mode in manual mode as well as 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.700
 The principle of any DSLR is software

 shutter priority and fully manual 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.920
 mode and parameter setting is similar to 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.369
 here are the usual mirror rings 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.369
 lens 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:56.050

 gyroscopic geomagnetic sensor 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.540
 sensor okay about technical 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.700
