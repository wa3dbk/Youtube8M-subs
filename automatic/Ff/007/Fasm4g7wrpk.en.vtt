 analog however in the film industry 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.990
 things are a little different 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.820
 several prominent directors believe that 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.980
 it is too early to send the film to the dump 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.630

 they formed lapitsky council which 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.670
 will keep the kodak company on 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.410
 afloat this will be expressed in contracts for 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.180
 supply of studios a certain 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.550
 film volume over several 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.590

 above directors are interested 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.940
 or love for a warm tube film 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.280
 unequivocally hard to say but the words 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.289
 martin scorcese by the heat of speaking in 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.480
 support of this company will be all 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.100
 did think that the latter is more likely 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.140
 can anyone think about 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.210

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.159

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.590

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.390
 of course not stated skorzeny besides 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.430

 so for now you shouldn't write off 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.710
 celluloid and canvas protection 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.200

 phone 8 besides adding so 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.579
 required update functionality 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.259
 also slightly combed the viper in view of 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.090
 microsoft recommendations that were 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.490
 released with the windows update

 managed to transplant neurons into the brain of mice 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.770
 grown from reprogrammed them 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.900
 skin cells this fact is notable itself 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.060
 by itself but more interesting is that 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.159
 transplanted neurons have proven their 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.259
 long-term stability after 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.000
 half a year after the operation they became full 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.810

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.280
 rodent brain 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.380
 researchers say that so 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.150
 favorable results allowed more 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.850
 one step closer to successful treatment 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.790

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.470
 Parkinson in the future, doctors will be able to remove 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.540
 non-working neurons and replace them 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.650
