00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.740
 what you do a way how we're going to 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.340
 find leaks here in the booster 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.220
 we can not this 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.119
 we can apply an injection machine 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.050
 of smoke ok let's use the smoke machine 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.869
 we are here at school 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.570
 testing the braking system put 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.070
 that has a lot of oil fluids like that 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.949
 that we are going to use this machine 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:40.690
 of smoke to insert here in the 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:43.839
 Main vacuum intake cavity 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.000
 engine and we're going to insert the machine 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.430
 smoke in the booster that's to see if the 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.220
 booster has some internal diaphragm 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.980
 broken or leagues where the cylinder goes 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.140
 master things like that since this one is 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.600
 presenting a lot of oil leakage and 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.359
 we want to see if there is a problem apart 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.379
 from that leak in the booster so let's go 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.979
 to insert the smoke you are going 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.979
 okay 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.740
 quickly there you can see the exit 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.159
 smoke 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.929
 okay 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.929
 in the mere mere half 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.830
 and they say they know 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.110
 I know that this this booster has to 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.670
 replace or remove the cylinder 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.220
 teacher and change the stamps that are 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.290
 behind him 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.130
 the most common most common usually 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.110
 do here is replace the guys booster 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.940
 and already replace the booster can be 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.170
 get the seal or the order that you carry 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.610
 after the master cylinder that is like that 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.570
 of fast you can find leaks 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.060
 at 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.950
 in the booster either in one more car 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.090
 new that is electronic injection 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.729
 that is causing a poor mix 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.410
 which is causing a poor mix 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.370
 for which you can not find 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.990
 the problem can also be a booster 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.300
 clicking in this case a booster that 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.890
 is providing extra air to 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.210
 lindsay and so 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.380
 the computer can 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:30.800
 when calculating the filters so we're 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.640
 here at school his fellow fabian 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.500
 again the vehicle 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.740
 with some small flaws also that 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.950
 was released in exhausted that you a 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.570
 escape like we are doing here 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.440
 practices of how you can make a 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:52.610
 machine how many ways so for 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.180
 you liked me sixth recent video and 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.689
 they liked him 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.689
 God
