 much and next was the movie of the

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.260
 change of scene leaves peter parker 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.659

 hello youtube friends how are you waiting 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.170
 that good, let's start as you know 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.210
 fellow Fernando works he gave them the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.460
 regrettable news that the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.410
 amazing spider-man cres that all 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.720
 they thought it was going to be done but not 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.540
 due to the low audience that the 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.550
 amazing spider-man 2 fernando trapillo 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.310
 we were investigating if there was a 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.530
 trailer of the amazing spider-man 3 and if 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.930
 we found one that lasted a minute with 2 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.090
 seconds but the trailer already told them 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.280
 fernando track everything seems to be that 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.680
 the movie will continue for the actor 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.870
 Andrew Garfield since not between peta va 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.300
 well spiderman and everyone preferred to 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.370
 actor tobey madrid the original movie 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.310
 from spiderman who came up to the third 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.290
 part could not continue the fourth part 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.120
 that everyone expected to see but does not have 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.580
 to see that the film has not had 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.650
 success because as everyone knows so that 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.140
 a film have another part has to 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.060
 succeed the previous but good this 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.640
 it's different that everyone has ever 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.670
 they asked why spiderman did not come out 4 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.010
 what were his reasons that happened good 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.510
 the answer is because the actors no longer 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.939
 they wanted to cooperate the signature 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.220
 of the movie and so spiderman does not 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:10.019
 can do if the characters are going 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.980
 I will mention some who wanted to go 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:16.680
 like aunt my good stack mary jane jj 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.049
 jameson and then just spiderman 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.810
 and the new characters but good the 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.000
 amazing spider-man 3 was canceled not by 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.579
 lack of characters but because of the low 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.739
 good audience friends this has been all 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.319
