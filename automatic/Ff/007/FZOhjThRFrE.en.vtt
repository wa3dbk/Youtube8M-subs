and<00:01:57.110> I<00:01:57.770> believe<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.640> things<00:01:58.850> are<00:01:59.090> in<00:01:59.240> good

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450

and I believe the things are in good
shape<00:01:59.950> but<00:02:00.950> if<00:02:01.190> there<00:02:01.580> is<00:02:01.730> one<00:02:02.000> percent<00:02:02.420> which

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
shape but if there is one percent which

what<00:02:05.570> ninety<00:02:05.960> nine<00:02:06.170> percent<00:02:06.410> we<00:02:06.770> have<00:02:06.890> done

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
what ninety nine percent we have done
