00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.299 

just<00:00:10.400> realize<00:00:10.730> that<00:00:11.000> with<00:00:11.180> this<00:00:11.740> straight<00:00:12.740> and

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
just realize that with this straight and

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.119 
just realize that with this straight and
fitting<00:00:13.790> this<00:00:14.719> is<00:00:14.900> not<00:00:15.080> going<00:00:15.200> to<00:00:15.290> bolt<00:00:15.500> up<00:00:15.680> the

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:16.129 
fitting this is not going to bolt up the

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.790 
fitting this is not going to bolt up the
I was<00:00:16.309> set<00:00:16.490> up<00:00:16.910> it's<00:00:17.779> just<00:00:18.019> not<00:00:18.199> possible<00:00:18.380> it

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
I was set up it's just not possible it

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.729 
I was set up it's just not possible it
hits<00:00:18.980> right<00:00:19.789> here<00:00:20.119> and<00:00:20.960> the<00:00:21.079> holes<00:00:21.289> don't<00:00:21.500> here

00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:21.739 
hits right here and the holes don't here

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:23.470 
hits right here and the holes don't here
line<00:00:21.919> up

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
line up

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.590 
line up
all<00:00:23.960> right<00:00:24.050> well<00:00:24.230> I<00:00:24.260> fix<00:00:24.560> my<00:00:24.680> problem<00:00:25.160> I<00:00:25.600> ended

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
all right well I fix my problem I ended

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.990 
all right well I fix my problem I ended
up<00:00:26.660> getting<00:00:26.810> a<00:00:27.250> minor<00:00:28.250> degree<00:00:28.460> instead<00:00:28.730> of<00:00:28.940> the

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
up getting a minor degree instead of the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.720 
up getting a minor degree instead of the
straight<00:00:29.300> and<00:00:29.510> fitting<00:00:29.810> so<00:00:30.650> now<00:00:30.770> I<00:00:30.800> have<00:00:31.070> total

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
straight and fitting so now I have total

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.210 
straight and fitting so now I have total
of<00:00:31.820> two<00:00:33.880> 90-degree<00:00:34.880> end<00:00:35.240> fittings<00:00:35.570> and

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
of two 90-degree end fittings and

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:52.330 
of two 90-degree end fittings and
hopefully<00:00:37.220> this<00:00:37.370> time<00:00:37.580> it'll<00:00:38.120> work

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:01:29.620 

you

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.090 

I<00:01:29.659> will<00:01:30.620> now<00:01:30.800> that<00:01:30.860> the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
I will now that the

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.969 
I will now that the
is<00:01:33.310> installed<00:01:33.790> and<00:01:34.090> functional<00:01:34.930> check<00:01:35.860> you

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
is installed and functional check you

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.700 
is installed and functional check you
don't<00:01:36.130> have<00:01:36.220> any<00:01:36.369> fuel<00:01:36.640> leaks<00:01:37.380> maybe<00:01:38.380> did<00:01:38.680> a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
don't have any fuel leaks maybe did a

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.940 
don't have any fuel leaks maybe did a
boost<00:01:38.979> li<00:01:39.159> test<00:01:39.750> see<00:01:40.750> there's<00:01:41.080> no<00:01:41.259> air<00:01:41.650> leaks

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
bring the operating temperature to a you

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.330 
bring the operating temperature to a you
know<00:01:58.960> level<00:01:59.320> so<00:01:59.560> you<00:01:59.619> your<00:01:59.950> car<00:02:00.130> is<00:02:00.220> pretty

know level so you your car is pretty

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.240 
know level so you your car is pretty
much<00:02:00.490> warmed<00:02:00.880> up<00:02:01.080> after<00:02:02.080> you<00:02:02.200> do<00:02:02.380> that<00:02:02.409> you

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
much warmed up after you do that you

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.300 
much warmed up after you do that you

we<00:02:38.350> I<00:02:38.380> advise<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:38.920> you<00:02:39.280> put<00:02:39.489> a<00:02:39.519> zip<00:02:39.790> tie<00:02:39.970> on

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
we I advise that you put a zip tie on

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.090 
we I advise that you put a zip tie on
there<00:02:40.390> because<00:02:40.570> with<00:02:41.260> boost<00:02:41.500> pressures<00:02:41.920> they

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
there because with boost pressures they

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.220 
there because with boost pressures they
may<00:02:42.250> pop<00:02:42.489> off<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:43.030> was<00:02:43.930> told<00:02:44.170> by<00:02:44.440> a<00:02:44.470> fellow

starts i was the reading and it says

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.270 
starts i was the reading and it says
that<00:03:42.519> it<00:03:42.910> happens<00:03:43.269> because<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:44.440> fuel

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
that it happens because the fuel

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.160 
that it happens because the fuel

correctly but apparently many have had
that<00:03:56.440> problem<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:56.920> I<00:03:56.980> guess<00:03:57.190> that's<00:03:58.000> just<00:03:58.060> one
