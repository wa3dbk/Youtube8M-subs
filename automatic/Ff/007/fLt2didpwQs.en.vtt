 the sony nwz zx1 have found that it 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.549
 a mp3 player of a proud price 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:18.080
 from 699 euros has a good reason 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:20.119
 because the player is not just scary 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.279
 a lot of know-how because of music 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.330

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.369

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.990

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.270

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.420

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.860
 Talk songs even more beautiful 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.480
 give up 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.920
 how can you see what's going to walk around 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.230
 We have a flight here 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.960
 Of course, gold is for the best 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.269
 sounds micro usb connection to for 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.430
 power transmission, of course, everything calculus 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.879
 then just welcome it here 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.640
 make a bracelet of what we had 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.719
 Nice leather kfc we can just do it 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.879
 connect with other devices 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.740
 here is a speaker in it always 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.450
 probably never use her downstairs 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.020
 let's see nwz x1 means the device 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.509
 of course we have the side 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.549
 possibility immediately the last next 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.799
 to select song and player break bunny 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.770
 catwalk always immediately and on and 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.000
 switch off scan on the plus minus 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.320
 Taste if I prefer accordingly 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.970
 the volume you see here with the 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.520
 Master same and we can still 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.390
 generally also music and games yet 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.659
 change times 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.659
 patience 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.689
 we have a customized android 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:40.759
 surface shape sony for the zdx 1 and 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.960
 I'm not connected at the top but it 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.969
 that suits me nicely that it can 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.090
 are split and if you are with the 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.649
 possibility here of wireless bluetooth us 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.270
 From other possibilities join us 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.740
 So in itself it's like a mp4 player 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.869
 You can say my things, so to speak 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.270
 for then but with high resolution audio 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:03.200
 and really a bit of a problem 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.750
 they can be played by fmc 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.479
 lpcm and administration immediately there is that 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.950
 Not everything we integrate without a camera 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.349
 without piece of city third actually only 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.030
 designed for audi or we can 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.709
 also play if you want but me 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.900
 I do not really have that for then 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.970
 thought and in no case so 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.810
 Spend a lot of money and what they too 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:30.319
 even with very short traders the nbz 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.640
 zx1 can set up here with dsc HX9V 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.120
 I can demonstrate agree now 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.900
 because the headphones of course have us 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.480
 was definitely 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.120
 if your music is here to hear 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.120
 and to see how it sounds and
