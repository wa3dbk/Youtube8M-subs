manually<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.630> set<00:01:48.959> that<00:01:49.139> on<00:01:49.319> count<00:01:49.679> on<00:01:49.859> camera

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
manually I set that on count on camera

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:52.160 
manually I set that on count on camera
then<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.789> decide<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.209> how<00:01:51.359> much<00:01:51.569> the<00:01:51.749> flash<00:01:51.990> is

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
then I decide on how much the flash is

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.379 
then I decide on how much the flash is
going<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.409> play<00:01:52.590> its<00:01:52.740> part<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:53.279> this<00:01:53.759> case<00:01:54.029> I'm

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:54.389 
going to play its part in this case I'm

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:56.660 
going to play its part in this case I'm
using<00:01:54.779> it<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.200> either<00:01:55.289> minus<00:01:56.189> or<00:01:56.310> third<00:01:56.490> or

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
using it to either minus or third or

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.370 
using it to either minus or third or
minus<00:01:56.909> two-thirds<00:01:57.420> otherwise<00:01:58.079> it's<00:01:58.229> going<00:01:58.319> to

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
minus two-thirds otherwise it's going to

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.109 
minus two-thirds otherwise it's going to
pop<00:01:58.590> out<00:01:58.770> quite<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> lot<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.189> light<00:01:59.399> but<00:01:59.880> it<00:01:59.969> is

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
pop out quite a lot of light but it is

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.179 
pop out quite a lot of light but it is
on<00:02:00.359> t<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.810> TTL<00:02:01.259> mode<00:02:01.469> on<00:02:01.679> the<00:02:01.770> back<00:02:01.920> here

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
on t on TTL mode on the back here

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.889 
on t on TTL mode on the back here
another<00:02:02.789> thing<00:02:03.060> most<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.450> shots<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.719> you've

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
another thing most of shots that you've

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.349 
another thing most of shots that you've
just<00:02:04.049> seen<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.409> wanted<00:02:04.770> more<00:02:04.979> flash<00:02:05.279> a<00:02:05.359> dramatic

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:06.359 
just seen I wanted more flash a dramatic

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.389 
just seen I wanted more flash a dramatic
flash<00:02:06.569> we're<00:02:07.200> at<00:02:07.319> kind<00:02:07.499> of<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.709> N<00:02:07.889> at<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.250> end

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
flash we're at kind of the N at the end

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.320 
flash we're at kind of the N at the end
of<00:02:08.490> the<00:02:08.550> day<00:02:08.700> but<00:02:08.880> there's<00:02:09.000> still<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.149> lot<00:02:09.300> of

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
of the day but there's still a lot of

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.960 
of the day but there's still a lot of
light<00:02:09.630> around<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.590> I'm<00:02:10.709> having<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.039> use<00:02:11.130> a<00:02:11.520> much

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
light around so I'm having to use a much

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.390 
light around so I'm having to use a much
faster<00:02:12.390> shutter<00:02:12.750> speed<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.650> get<00:02:13.770> my<00:02:14.040> aperture

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
faster shutter speed to get my aperture

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.160 
faster shutter speed to get my aperture
down<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.209> I've<00:02:15.330> got<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.569> put<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.810> speed<00:02:16.080> the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
down so I've got to put the speed the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.230 
down so I've got to put the speed the
speed<00:02:16.200> light<00:02:16.560> onto<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:17.099> high<00:02:17.490> speed<00:02:17.730> sync<00:02:18.030> here

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
speed light onto a high speed sync here

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.480 
speed light onto a high speed sync here
otherwise<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:19.380> wouldn't<00:02:19.680> kind<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.040> give<00:02:20.400> us

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
otherwise it wouldn't kind of give us

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.740 
otherwise it wouldn't kind of give us
the<00:02:20.580> power<00:02:20.790> we'd<00:02:21.150> actually<00:02:21.330> drop

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
the power we'd actually drop

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.410 
the power we'd actually drop
automatically<00:02:22.709> because<00:02:23.280> I'm<00:02:23.370> on<00:02:23.489> T<00:02:23.730> in<00:02:23.970> TTL

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
automatically because I'm on T in TTL

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.789 
automatically because I'm on T in TTL
adapter<00:02:24.720> on<00:02:24.810> here<00:02:24.989> it<00:02:25.260> would<00:02:25.470> change<00:02:25.709> my

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
adapter on here it would change my

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.590 
adapter on here it would change my
shutter<00:02:26.549> speed<00:02:26.849> down<00:02:26.879> to<00:02:27.030> 200<00:02:27.540> all<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.659> time

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
shutter speed down to 200 all the time

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.930 
shutter speed down to 200 all the time
so<00:02:28.720> just<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.710> little<00:02:29.800> bit<00:02:30.010> confusing<00:02:30.400> there<00:02:30.640> but

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
so just a little bit confusing there but

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.130 
so just a little bit confusing there but
I<00:02:30.970> got<00:02:31.120> into<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.420> off-camera<00:02:31.720> flash<00:02:31.900> stuff<00:02:32.050> at

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
I got into the off-camera flash stuff at

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.720 
I got into the off-camera flash stuff at
the<00:02:32.230> end<00:02:32.350> but<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:32.710> know<00:02:33.160> you<00:02:33.490> know<00:02:33.580> what<00:02:33.700> I

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
the end but you know you know what I

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.700 
the end but you know you know what I
mean<00:02:33.880> just<00:02:34.080> decide<00:02:35.080> on<00:02:35.110> how<00:02:35.350> much<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.620> want

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
mean just decide on how much you want

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.110 
mean just decide on how much you want
flash<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.100> play<00:02:36.220> in<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.370> part<00:02:36.610> as<00:02:36.820> a<00:02:36.880> rule<00:02:37.090> of

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
flash to play in the part as a rule of

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.580 
flash to play in the part as a rule of
thumb<00:02:37.240> if<00:02:37.510> we<00:02:37.570> want<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:37.900> go<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.260> dominate

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
thumb if we want it to go a dominate

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.750 
thumb if we want it to go a dominate
it's<00:02:38.740> going<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:38.920> be<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.010> stop<00:02:39.280> more<00:02:39.520> than<00:02:39.670> the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
it's going to be a stop more than the

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.170 
it's going to be a stop more than the
ambient<00:02:40.570> light<00:02:40.780> source<00:02:41.080> as<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.040> maximum<00:02:42.790> before

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
ambient light source as a maximum before

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.300 
ambient light source as a maximum before
it<00:02:43.240> starts<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.570> really<00:02:43.900> kind<00:02:44.140> of<00:02:44.200> take<00:02:44.620> over

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
it starts to really kind of take over

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.890 
it starts to really kind of take over
the<00:02:45.490> whole<00:02:45.640> scene<00:02:45.850> especially<00:02:46.240> if<00:02:46.720> you're<00:02:46.870> on

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
the whole scene especially if you're on

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.990 
the whole scene especially if you're on
location<00:02:47.530> like<00:02:47.710> we<00:02:47.860> are<00:02:47.980> here<00:02:48.190> we<00:02:48.640> might<00:02:48.820> have

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
location like we are here we might have

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.370 
location like we are here we might have
two<00:02:49.240> or<00:02:49.360> three<00:02:49.390> of<00:02:49.660> these<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.930> do<00:02:50.080> two

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
two or three of these to do two

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.760 
two or three of these to do two
different<00:02:50.830> jobs<00:02:51.780> one<00:02:52.780> is<00:02:52.930> usually<00:02:53.170> used<00:02:53.650> to

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
different jobs one is usually used to

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.490 
different jobs one is usually used to
either<00:02:54.330> create<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.450> light<00:02:55.630> on<00:02:55.870> subject<00:02:56.410> the

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
either create the light on subject the

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.350 
either create the light on subject the
keep<00:02:56.710> the<00:02:56.740> key<00:02:56.980> light<00:02:57.160> or<00:02:57.490> to<00:02:57.760> act<00:02:57.910> as<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.090> fill

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
keep the key light or to act as a fill

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.000 
keep the key light or to act as a fill
so<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:58.990> could<00:02:59.080> actually<00:02:59.140> give<00:02:59.500> us<00:02:59.590> a<00:02:59.650> nice<00:02:59.770> kind

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
so it could actually give us a nice kind

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.240 
so it could actually give us a nice kind
of<00:03:00.100> fill<00:03:00.480> across<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.720> whole<00:03:01.870> body<00:03:02.080> to<00:03:02.410> lift

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
of fill across the whole body to lift

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.710 
of fill across the whole body to lift
either<00:03:03.430> at<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.760> shadow<00:03:03.940> information<00:03:04.390> we

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
either at the shadow information we

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.820 
either at the shadow information we
could<00:03:04.840> also<00:03:04.990> use<00:03:05.320> one<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.500> these<00:03:05.620> perhaps

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
could also use one of these perhaps

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.400 
could also use one of these perhaps
off-camera<00:03:06.640> again<00:03:07.360> as<00:03:07.600> a<00:03:07.660> hair<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:08.050> hair<00:03:08.230> light

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
that's the traveler rate a simple

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.330 
that's the traveler rate a simple

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340
