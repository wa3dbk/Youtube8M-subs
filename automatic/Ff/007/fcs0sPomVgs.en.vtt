00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 good of all and here we are where 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.150
 we leave the previous sand of the monk dps 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.059
 here we can see how in my work the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.759
 magician he gets to strain a polis murcia 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.259
 to my healer without any plan since then 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.139
 can not put any pressure on me 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.210
 On the contrary, I leave him stuck in a 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.640
 sweep of tender is at that time 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.680
 when his healer takes him behind 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.170
 the column scared of our peaks of 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.060
 damage took advantage and made the kick 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.710
 flying that you can appreciate without angle 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.279
 and affecting the priest who is 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.780
 bending the corner perfect execution 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.910
 here at normal speed gives more vertigo 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.460
 still as you see after the pole 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.140
 murcia I apply sweep the incapacitated and 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.790
 it just takes me to take it, I run 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.960
 behind the healer in turn since he does not 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.820
 wait is the change of objective to 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.160
 a large meters and keep in vÃ©lez 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.289
 this movement allows to scare what 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.239
 enough to the magician to be like 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.730
 a cyclone of my senator and this 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.770
 allow to position perfectly in the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.140
 column that we are working 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.170
 the magician after leaving the two 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.980
 cyclones pulls icy veins and me using 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.290
 the spine 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.620
 I'm still out of your line of sight denying 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.050
 so it happens offensive here as soon as 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.210
 I see I apply paralysis to him with luck 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.250
 start a long chain of yield 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.870
 followed by my partner as you see the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.910
 cyclone extend and you have a few seconds 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.860
 so that it goes to him as soon as the 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.450
 drs you see my healer applies another 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.550
 cycle in full while I put the 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.050
 habitual pressure on the senator remember 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.880
 that a good positioning leads to 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.350
 better pressures on the enemy a 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.030
 good position means good 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.650
 pressure as you see the magician follows 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.720
 trying polymorphic that my healer 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.640
 evade changing shape this makes 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.890
 the magician among a chain now of cc 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.149
 disoriented by my druid and 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.149
 paralysis on my part 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.050
 here I see that my savior is going to go 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.090
 behind a column and freed him from 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.350
 boost pressures by applying touches of 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.350
 karma in the magician once again 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.689
 my healer gets to cycle in the 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.459
 magician I want priest goes invisible but 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:18.060
 my healer is pending and helps me 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.060
 to hunt it 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.580
 here he again applied paralysis to the magician 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.140
 to deny it more in bps if it fits that 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.760
 cyclone has been encouraged among others 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.650
 things to the liberation of my healer 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.260
 thanks to the touch of karma to heal us 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.030
 that has allowed him to dedicate himself to the cc 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.160
 My goal is to reduce the manna of the 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.590
 healer since when he barely has mana 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.660
 it will be impossible for you to cure your magician that 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.340
 receives large amounts of damage when 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.060
 change towards him and here happens the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.410
 disaster 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.690
 my healer moves incorrectly 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.150
 towards the priest without any objective 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.130
 what it costs us a complete fear to 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.420
 both when it's too late to 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.400
 Realize that you start drinking 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.160
 moment when I'm going to do the and 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.870
 prevents the action subsequently starts 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.730
 a hymn of hope that cut him off 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.040
 half although he has already achieved his 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.220
 purpose of partially filled 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.220
 manna 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.930
 here as you see my druid is in a 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.370
 polymorphic complete detail in which 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.110
 did not repair and once again the no 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.760
 communication of not knowing if it has 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.260
 trinquet or if you can handle the situation 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.260
 it's not playing a trick 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.430
 here he throws a flying kick with the 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.470
 order to stop at the priest but not 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.120
 reached the difference of the previous time 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.010
 I am not aware that I lived until 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.569
 50% and still fighting this 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.099
 side of the columns here I did the 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.360
 magician with which I can not move it 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.800
 that I use the copy to be able to fly 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.510
 towards the priest and cover me behind 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.220
 that column and gain some time to your 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.600
 Once I approach the area where he leaves my 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.430
 healer for the last time in poli murcia 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.959
 this time we are in a bind but 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.730
 we managed to get out thanks to my healer 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.319
 takes the form of a tree and begins a 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.300
 powerful healing in turn that he performed 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.500
 a touch of karma and in this way he avoided 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.310
 a damage that would probably have 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.310
 meaning to my death 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.569
 here you see the repetition again where 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.280
 my healer comes running in shape 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.690
 feline with an instant cyclone that the 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.790
 magician to see the situation is removed with 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.770
 trinquet as this has been all guys and 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.270
 see you in the next one that will be the 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.380
 last installment of these arenas with the 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.380
 monk see you soon
