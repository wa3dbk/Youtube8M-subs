bad<00:00:33.370> but<00:00:33.700> I<00:00:33.910> just<00:00:34.480> loved<00:00:34.750> it<00:00:34.930> the<00:00:35.110> fact<00:00:35.290> that<00:00:35.380> I

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
bad but I just loved it the fact that I

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.050 
bad but I just loved it the fact that I
shaped<00:00:35.800> it<00:00:36.070> was<00:00:36.160> just<00:00:36.370> the<00:00:36.489> best<00:00:36.640> thing<00:00:36.790> ever

you know whatever squad I'm getting so I

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.260 
you know whatever squad I'm getting so I
can<00:01:09.290> tweak<00:01:10.070> you<00:01:10.580> know<00:01:10.700> little<00:01:10.940> things<00:01:11.060> here

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
can tweak you know little things here

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.500 
can tweak you know little things here
and<00:01:11.360> there<00:01:11.479> to<00:01:11.870> make<00:01:12.200> a<00:01:12.229> guy<00:01:12.500> that's<00:01:12.830> what<00:01:13.510> yeah

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
and there to make a guy that's what yeah

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.030 
and there to make a guy that's what yeah
you<00:01:14.570> know<00:01:14.660> my<00:01:14.840> general<00:01:15.200> size<00:01:15.380> shortboard<00:01:15.890> is

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
you know my general size shortboard is

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.700 
you know my general size shortboard is
probably<00:01:16.729> six<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:17.120> six<00:01:17.990> -<00:01:18.140> no<00:01:18.170> ha

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
probably six to six - no ha

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.609 
probably six to six - no ha
just<00:01:18.920> over<00:01:19.160> 1919<00:01:19.880> in<00:01:20.000> four<00:01:20.570> -<00:01:20.659> why<00:01:20.810> -<00:01:21.470> and<00:01:21.560> a

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
just over 1919 in four - why - and a

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.859 
just over 1919 in four - why - and a
hostak<00:01:22.070> sometimes<00:01:22.520> I<00:01:22.670> got<00:01:22.850> a<00:01:22.880> little<00:01:23.000> over<00:01:23.360> two

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
hostak sometimes I got a little over two

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:25.600 
hostak sometimes I got a little over two
and<00:01:24.020> five-eighths<00:01:24.410> and<00:01:24.710> just<00:01:24.890> you<00:01:25.220> know<00:01:25.250> shave

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
and five-eighths and just you know shave

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.920 
and five-eighths and just you know shave
it<00:01:25.759> down<00:01:25.880> a<00:01:25.940> little<00:01:26.060> bit<00:01:26.180> on<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.360> rails<00:01:26.540> but

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
it down a little bit on the rails but

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.420 
it down a little bit on the rails but
for<00:01:27.680> the<00:01:27.740> most<00:01:27.890> part<00:01:27.979> those<00:01:28.250> are<00:01:28.280> my

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
for the most part those are my

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:43.220 
for the most part those are my
dimensions

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.830 

yeah<00:01:44.230> I<00:01:44.260> think<00:01:44.440> the<00:01:44.710> shorter<00:01:45.010> boards<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:46.720> know

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
yeah I think the shorter boards you know

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.360 
yeah I think the shorter boards you know
so<00:01:47.290> many<00:01:47.440> of<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.560> guys<00:01:47.650> are<00:01:47.890> trying<00:01:47.980> to<00:01:48.190> knock

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
so many of the guys are trying to knock

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.980 
so many of the guys are trying to knock
a<00:01:48.580> lead<00:01:48.760> and<00:01:48.970> everyone's<00:01:49.420> getting<00:01:49.540> shorter

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
a lead and everyone's getting shorter

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.720 
a lead and everyone's getting shorter
you<00:01:50.350> know<00:01:50.500> for<00:01:50.710> myself<00:01:50.830> I<00:01:51.130> can't<00:01:51.340> really<00:01:51.490> go<00:01:51.670> to

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
you know for myself I can't really go to

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.540 
you know for myself I can't really go to
too<00:01:52.270> much<00:01:52.300> smaller<00:01:52.750> roles<00:01:53.050> you<00:01:53.770> know<00:01:53.890> I<00:01:53.920> end<00:01:54.340> up

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
too much smaller roles you know I end up

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.970 
too much smaller roles you know I end up
losing<00:01:55.420> paddle<00:01:55.900> power<00:01:56.050> and<00:01:56.410> things<00:01:56.620> like<00:01:56.740> that

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
losing paddle power and things like that

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.710 
losing paddle power and things like that
but<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.730> smallest<00:01:58.000> board<00:01:58.330> I'll<00:01:58.480> probably

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
but the smallest board I'll probably

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.990 
but the smallest board I'll probably
ride<00:01:58.990> is<00:01:59.230> about<00:01:59.890> a<00:02:00.100> 510<00:02:00.730> or<00:02:00.760> 511<00:02:02.610> about<00:02:03.610> 3<00:02:03.820> or<00:02:03.880> 4

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
ride is about a 510 or 511 about 3 or 4

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.660 
ride is about a 510 or 511 about 3 or 4
years<00:02:04.330> ago<00:02:04.510> I<00:02:04.840> was<00:02:05.140> really<00:02:05.500> solvent<00:02:06.100> Fixman<00:02:06.520> I

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
years ago I was really solvent Fixman I

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.700 
years ago I was really solvent Fixman I
just<00:02:06.940> found<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:07.390> you<00:02:07.510> know<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:07.750> future<00:02:08.320> fins

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
just found that you know the future fins

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.980 
just found that you know the future fins
were<00:02:08.950> really<00:02:09.880> easy<00:02:10.090> for<00:02:10.300> me<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:10.450> travel<00:02:10.720> with

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
were really easy for me to travel with

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.110 
were really easy for me to travel with
and<00:02:11.200> at<00:02:12.070> the<00:02:12.220> same<00:02:12.370> time<00:02:12.610> they<00:02:12.790> were<00:02:12.850> giving<00:02:13.060> me

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
and at the same time they were giving me

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.940 
and at the same time they were giving me
