00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.950 
actually visualize how this is all
doubled<00:01:13.830> as<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.790> slowly<00:01:15.120> do<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.660> and<00:01:15.870> you're

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
doubled as I slowly do this and you're

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.730 
doubled as I slowly do this and you're
looking<00:01:16.110> at<00:01:16.470> it

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
looking at it

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.500 
looking at it
you<00:01:16.980> can<00:01:17.130> see<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.490> everything's<00:01:17.940> doubled<00:01:18.360> in

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
you can see that everything's doubled in

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.630

so<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.230> beauty<00:01:19.560> that's<00:01:19.740> not<00:01:19.980> is<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.400> can't

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
so the beauty that's not is it can't

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.700 
so the beauty that's not is it can't
slip<00:01:21.060> when<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.360> pull<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.750> tight<00:01:21.960> because<00:01:22.500> it

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
slip when you pull it tight because it

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.850 
slip when you pull it tight because it
works<00:01:22.950> towards<00:01:23.430> itself<00:01:23.760> to<00:01:23.940> tighten<00:01:24.360> okay<00:01:25.080> so

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
works towards itself to tighten okay so

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.990 
works towards itself to tighten okay so
what<00:01:25.980> I'm<00:01:26.070> gonna<00:01:26.190> do<00:01:26.370> is<00:01:26.490> I'm<00:01:26.580> gonna<00:01:26.640> pull<00:01:26.910> it

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pull it

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.120 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pull it
down<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> little<00:01:27.540> smaller<00:01:27.870> and<00:01:28.260> one<00:01:28.980> of<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
down a little smaller and one of the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.520 
down a little smaller and one of the
keys<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.430> tying<00:01:30.090> any<00:01:30.390> knot<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:31.050> you<00:01:31.260> really

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
keys that tying any knot is you really

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.440 
keys that tying any knot is you really
should<00:01:31.770> wet<00:01:32.010> this<00:01:32.220> area<00:01:32.670> when<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.000> cinch<00:01:33.300> it

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
should wet this area when you cinch it

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.600 
should wet this area when you cinch it
down<00:01:33.480> because<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.590> monofilament<00:01:35.250> which

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
down because this is monofilament which

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.360 
down because this is monofilament which
is<00:01:35.730> a<00:01:35.760> form<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.240> plastic<00:01:36.480> can<00:01:37.440> create<00:01:37.770> heat<00:01:38.160> and

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
is a form of plastic can create heat and

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.640 
is a form of plastic can create heat and
burn<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.330> weaken<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.660> line<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.410> I'm<00:01:40.500> gonna
