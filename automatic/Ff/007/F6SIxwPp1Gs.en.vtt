00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.829
 can pick up the remnants of 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.160
 Ink because I love it, I think it's too much

 just because you paint because they fell 10 not 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.260
 she was painted this wood has 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.489
 50 100 150 years 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.510
 then this whole process she received 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.840
 So what do we do to people? 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.789

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.940
 it can and has several layers 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.640
 color ink 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.250

 that you can get crazier than you 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.670
 Come in and you said the paraná that catches 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.560
 this way from there to you the little houses 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.540
 ready suddenly can also its 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.119
 everything is set up in this way that 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.220
 leaves a totally clean act is very 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.439
 modern and contemporary already many are 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.820
 this is a totally sustainable product 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.830
 if we do not use the wood we could 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.270
 becomes law could then be burned to 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.759
 people use a new resource to people 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.110
 wood that has been used does the 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.030
 its use must be the same 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.220
 another important detail are the feet 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.650
 species there are some colors in the case and 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.750
 if he is showing black he is 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.729
 then it has a thread one 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.530
 screws that transport agents to 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.570
 people loose it that will be mounted to 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.430
 decrease the volume is getting there 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.890
 simply you screw that same 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.680
 is ready to use made easy 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.170
 practical agility agility a talk of 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.939
 Finishing houses with a different varnish 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.770
 is in fact a special varnish and 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.360
 right organizes water-based 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.340
 a resin that leaves the wood more 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.920
 then this does not 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.659
 originality of the demolition 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.399
 then we can see that the 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.409
 also elegant set set 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.569
 modern despite having made a wood 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.830
 demolition but it is a super product 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.840
 modern super cozy 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.500
 the network to any place the relic that 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.150
 really bad 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.570
 it's a work of art because so nobody 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.210
 will have a table as is and is it is unique 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.210
 I like it because you can have it at the table. 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.420
 in your house because it can be your yes and 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.420
