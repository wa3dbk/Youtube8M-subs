00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.130
 not so much is not so much the means 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.710
 at the time so it was 14 years old 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.800
 up close we were still at school 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.779
 so we had very limited means 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.720
 to do this we had asked our 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.100
 parents to bring us what and so we 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.680
 we had very little material 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.810
 we fish with small throws in the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.400
 carnivore and detectors we had 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.560
 basic which was not that expensive 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.530
 we slept on the floor with a whole 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.400
 small summer steamed down what it was 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.820
 so impatient to be able to discover 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.750
 those times in winter that all this 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.879
 they said we did not care 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.769
 what good winter certainly is not 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.960
 necessarily easy at the water's edge 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:55.500
 very harsh weather conditions 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.940
 can have strong frosts but it's 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.429
 still super nice to 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.100
 wake up in the morning to see the thaw of 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.390
 see the mist on the water the banks are 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.620
 much less frequented by 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.620
 fishermen also so that's a lot 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.020
 calmer we have more chance of 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.040
 to cross animals from the birds on 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.840
 some bodies of water there are some 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.090
 reception points of populations 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.759
 birds 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.009
 it's very nice to watch the sunsets 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.990
 winter sun are very 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.460
 interesting too that's all it's 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.229
 atmosphere there in fact that I'm looking for 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.979
 also towards nature and that is 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.659
 completely dead 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.189
 we found that magic what because 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.250
 it was moments that few people 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.960
 today can live because there is 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.310
 a lot of people who live in town or 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.439
 things like that and kiki did not see 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.590
 what's around and if these 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.820
 moments there it was that allowed us to 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.450
 the winter to really get away from it all 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.299
 but is not that fishing who who was 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.360
 which was important in this is the 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.360
 all the animals we start the 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.909
 nature changed over the seasons 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.610
 that's all we liked because there 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.680
 really had a big silence and 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.680
 it was really really magical
