00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
If you do not eat meat, you can not be a healthy person ?!

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Most scientists answer this question confidently.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In professional sport does not recognize a vegetarian diet

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Workouts become harder, if not to eat meat

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Body recovers more slowly

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Is it really?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Hands thin. Not enough ligament

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This meat (about hands of Denis)

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Dill, parsley, pasta (Voevoda talks about his hands) XD

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
In this fight fought current world champion in arm wrestling Denis Tsiplenkov

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Which eat meat

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And three-time world champion in arm wrestling Alexey Voevoda

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Which became a vegetarian 4 years ago

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The victory went to meat eaters

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
In this battle vegetarian Alexey Voevoda lost

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But he did not armwrestler

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
More than 10 years ago he became a bobsledder

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
His victories refuted the theory of nutrition

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
On the bobsleigh track athlete experiences an overload to 8 G

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Almost like a fighter pilot

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Scientists believe that vegetarians can not withstand such loads

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The biggest problem with congestion - problems with blood vessels

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The sharp drop of blood. Blood drain from his head. Surging to the legs with strong overload. This is the most difficult. You see nothing and lose consciousness.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Durability vessels ... Vascular wall is composed of collagen. Collagen is a protein. The strength of vessels determined by the proper digestion of proteins.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
But Alexey, who a few years to give up meat

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
He not only did not lose consciousness on the bobsleigh track

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, he defeated all challengers

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
He became a double Olympic champion

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I saved for the Olympics the peak of his physical form

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I was able to do it. I am able to withstand heavy overload

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
5 years ago in his diet was high in protein

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
He started to eat differently when he read the book "Theory of adequate type of food" Academician Ugolev

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
This book has been written about the benefits of plant-based diet

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
For the sake of the experiment Alexey 3 months did not eat meat

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I liked the feeling of the body. I realized that such saturation that such ease in the body. Figured out how to sleep for 3-4 hours without meditation and yoga.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Now in his diet large portions of vegetable salads, burritos with black beans, vegetables, fruits and a lot of fresh juices

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
He doesn't want to eat as before

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
There is a fact - the meat is harmful, protein is harmful.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
I believe that nothing is irreplaceable

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Our body produces absolutely everything

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
All that we need
