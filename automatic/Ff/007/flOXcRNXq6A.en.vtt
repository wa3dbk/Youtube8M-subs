00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.920
 for this craft we will need a 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.750
 piece of ribbon 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.180
 an empty bottle 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.330
 and colored rice 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.270
 in the previous video I showed you how 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.210
 we can paint it in different colors and 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.980
 in a very simple way 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.009
 here in the description I leave you the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:34.010
 link if you like to go to the video and see 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:37.230
 how is that it looks good now we are going to 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.660
 also need a roll of paper like 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.030
 this one we roll it is a leaf the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.670
 We make roll so that it fits in 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.630
 our bottle and we're also going to do 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.250
 a nice one like this 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.250
 what is the bottom 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:59.160
 I stayed at the size of what the roll is 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.160
 and then we're going to paste it 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.570
 with so much duct tape 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.330
 so that it does not move and be fixed 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.090
 A) Yes 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:14.420
 and well let's proceed then now 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:18.210
 to fill with our rice the bottle 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.760
 we are going to empty approximately 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.700
 two tablespoons of rice of these large 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.810
 of each color let's start with the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.380
 red color 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.979
 let's empty them what are the two 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.979
 spoonfuls 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.430
 and well there it is already falling in the background 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.430
 our rice 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.260
 is staying here in comfortable living 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.420
 now 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.230
 we go with the next color that we are going to 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.230
 put it yellow 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.349
 and we drink perfectly this measure 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.500
 look, it's been completely full 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:35.580
 our bottle now we're just going to 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.580
 put the plug 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.810
 If we can not improvise plug Read 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.520
 someone else and fix it with glue 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.150
 now with our ribbon 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.140
 the only thing we're going to do is we're going to 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.200
 fold it in half 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.220
 and we are going to cut 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.220
 thus 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.890
 to make it look better 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.470
 now we go 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:11.740
 to put it in the middle and we're just going 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.740
 to tie a knot here in this part 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.459
 We speak 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.120
 and we return 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.420
 make another knot so that we are left 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.420
 fixed 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.220
 and we're accommodating it at the same time 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.910
 and good look here has already been our 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.600
 fully decorated bottle 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:47.840
 very pretty if we want we can put 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.090
 some some sticker some message like 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.080
 this 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.750
 A) Yes 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.270
 but it would cover us a little bit what is the 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.400
 view of the colors of the rice that is what 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.810
 that really looks but good if 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.940
 we want we can add sela with tantito 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.330
 Adhesive tape that brings adhesive 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.770
 from both sides we can put you here in 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.670
 this part 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.530
 and we can put it like that 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.720
 and since it is already the person's choice to 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.609
 that we give him power to take it away 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.790
 so that it looks a little bit more or 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.390
 just flip it 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.390
 A) Yes 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.870
 and good friends, I hope there will be 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.840

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.590
