going<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.730> show<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.180> some<00:00:48.450> different<00:00:48.870> ways

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
going to show you is some different ways

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.660 
going to show you is some different ways
to<00:00:49.260> grid<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> field<00:00:49.890> we'll<00:00:50.129> start<00:00:50.370> off<00:00:50.460> with<00:00:50.489> a

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
to grid the field we'll start off with a

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.600 
to grid the field we'll start off with a
basic<00:00:50.940> cross<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:52.050> gives<00:00:52.350> players<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:53.010> basic

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
basic cross this gives players a basic

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.670 
basic cross this gives players a basic
spatial<00:00:53.940> arrangement<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.870> four<00:00:55.379> different

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
spatial arrangement of four different

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.979 
spatial arrangement of four different
sectors<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.940> next<00:00:57.239> one<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.629> split<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
sectors the next one is you split the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.020 
sectors the next one is you split the
field<00:00:58.170> up<00:00:58.379> into<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> attacking<00:00:59.100> middle<00:00:59.820> and

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
field up into the attacking middle and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.389 
field up into the attacking middle and
defensive<00:01:00.539> third<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.930> field<00:01:01.109> all<00:01:01.410> broken

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
defensive third of the field all broken

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.210 
defensive third of the field all broken
down<00:01:02.430> into<00:01:03.000> smaller<00:01:03.930> squares<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.860> make<00:01:05.010> that

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
down into smaller squares to make that

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.179 
down into smaller squares to make that
grid<00:01:05.610> four<00:01:05.850> spatial<00:01:06.950> location<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
grid four spatial location for the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.890 
grid four spatial location for the
players<00:01:08.430> here<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> square<00:01:09.720> that

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
players here you have a square that

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.899 
players here you have a square that
split<00:01:10.260> up<00:01:10.380> into<00:01:10.560> one<00:01:10.890> two<00:01:11.159> three<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.640> four

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
split up into one two three and four

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.870 
split up into one two three and four
squares<00:01:12.330> with<00:01:12.900> high<00:01:13.200> medium<00:01:13.799> low<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.760> could

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
squares with high medium low you could

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.640 
squares with high medium low you could
see<00:01:15.090> how<00:01:15.240> that's<00:01:15.450> all<00:01:15.630> formed<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.110> triangles

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
see how that's all formed in triangles

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.810 
see how that's all formed in triangles
so<00:01:16.770> if<00:01:16.860> you're<00:01:16.979> gonna<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.280> three<00:01:17.490> players

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
so if you're gonna have three players

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.090 
so if you're gonna have three players
you<00:01:18.030> could<00:01:18.180> say<00:01:18.450> three<00:01:19.320> L<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.890> they<00:01:19.979> would

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
you could say three L and they would

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.340 
you could say three L and they would
make<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.310> first<00:01:20.700> triangle<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.630> L<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
make a first triangle in the L and the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.859 
make a first triangle in the L and the
three<00:01:22.619> square<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.790> mix<00:01:24.060> up<00:01:24.210> all<00:01:24.420> your

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
three square and you can mix up all your

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.440 
three square and you can mix up all your
different<00:01:25.170> patterns<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.680> calls<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.820> this

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
different patterns and calls in this

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.749 
different patterns and calls in this
it's<00:01:27.720> just<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.049> basic<00:01:28.320> rectangle<00:01:28.680> field<00:01:29.369> split

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
it's just a basic rectangle field split

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.690 
it's just a basic rectangle field split
up<00:01:29.850> into<00:01:30.090> six<00:01:30.600> equal<00:01:30.750> parts<00:01:31.470> again<00:01:32.159> all<00:01:32.369> four

the field and in this next slide you
actually<00:01:38.729> see<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.090> small<00:01:39.210> sided<00:01:39.630> game

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
actually see it's a small sided game

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.690 
actually see it's a small sided game

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.940 
next you see a warm-up exercise in a
square<00:01:54.360> with<00:01:54.630> one<00:01:54.899> cone<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.350> middle<00:01:55.409> and

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
square with one cone in the middle and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.550 
square with one cone in the middle and
players<00:01:56.460> have<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.060> work<00:01:57.210> on<00:01:57.390> their

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
players have to work on their

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.590 
players have to work on their
concentration<00:01:58.560> in<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.939> beginning<00:02:00.299> for<00:02:00.540> a

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
concentration in the beginning for a

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.270 
concentration in the beginning for a
warm-up<00:02:01.020> where<00:02:01.560> they're<00:02:01.710> asked<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.130> do

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
warm-up where they're asked to do

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.709 
warm-up where they're asked to do
several<00:02:02.670> different<00:02:02.969> tasks<00:02:03.390> we<00:02:03.509> could

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
several different tasks we could

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.569 
several different tasks we could
actually<00:02:03.810> create<00:02:04.200> overloads<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.130> it

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
actually create overloads and it

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.280 
actually create overloads and it
requires<00:02:05.969> extreme<00:02:06.479> amount<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.780> focus<00:02:07.020> and

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
requires extreme amount of focus and

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.960 
requires extreme amount of focus and
concentration<00:02:07.890> as<00:02:08.190> they<00:02:08.459> work<00:02:08.789> and

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
concentration as they work and

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.690 
concentration as they work and
synchronize<00:02:09.629> movements<00:02:10.319> together<00:02:10.670> with<00:02:11.670> a

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
synchronize movements together with a

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.890 
synchronize movements together with a
partner<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.510> simulate<00:02:14.150> their<00:02:15.150> actual<00:02:15.540> team

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
partner to simulate their actual team

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.420 
partner to simulate their actual team
movements<00:02:16.410> in<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.560> game<00:02:16.770> because<00:02:17.010> team

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
movements in a game because team

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.369 
movements in a game because team
movements<00:02:17.910> are<00:02:18.030> coordinated<00:02:18.390> movements<00:02:19.260> so

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
movements are coordinated movements so

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.270 
movements are coordinated movements so
all<00:02:19.590> these<00:02:19.739> warmups<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.370> done<00:02:21.110> motion<00:02:22.280> this

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
all these warmups is done motion this

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.309 
all these warmups is done motion this
next<00:02:23.879> drill<00:02:24.060> right<00:02:24.270> here<00:02:24.540> is<00:02:24.750> synchronized

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
next drill right here is synchronized

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.920 
next drill right here is synchronized
motion<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:25.860> use<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.190> cones<00:02:26.520> for<00:02:26.940> spatial

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
motion you use the cones for spatial

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.339 
motion you use the cones for spatial
cueing<00:02:28.500> so<00:02:29.099> the<00:02:29.610> players<00:02:30.540> know<00:02:30.780> exactly<00:02:31.170> where

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
cueing so the players know exactly where

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.839 
cueing so the players know exactly where
they<00:02:31.470> are<00:02:31.590> on<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.800> field<00:02:32.040> with<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.670> right
