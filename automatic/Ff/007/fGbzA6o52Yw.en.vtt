00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
something that the WWE figures really

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.749

in real life overall it's a good looking
figure<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.490> think<00:02:00.329> it's<00:02:00.479> an<00:02:00.570> upgrade<00:02:00.990> over<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
figure I think it's an upgrade over the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.010 
figure I think it's an upgrade over the
jack<00:02:01.500> specific<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.790> doesn't<00:02:03.210> feel<00:02:03.450> cheap<00:02:03.509> when

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
jack specific it doesn't feel cheap when

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.560 
jack specific it doesn't feel cheap when
you<00:02:04.110> take<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.380> out<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.619> packaging<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.570> it

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
you take it out of the packaging and it
