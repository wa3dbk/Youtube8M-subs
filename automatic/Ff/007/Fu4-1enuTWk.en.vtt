how<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.049> make<00:00:04.350> a<00:00:04.380> pickoff<00:00:05.009> throw<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.400> second

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
how to make a pickoff throw to second

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.870 
how to make a pickoff throw to second
base<00:00:05.960> and<00:00:06.960> we've<00:00:07.140> got<00:00:07.350> Johnny<00:00:07.649> Cueto<00:00:08.250> from<00:00:08.760> the

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
base and we've got Johnny Cueto from the

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.440 
base and we've got Johnny Cueto from the
Cincinnati<00:00:09.090> Reds<00:00:09.920> picking<00:00:10.920> off<00:00:11.099> here<00:00:11.550> and

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
Cincinnati Reds picking off here and

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.419 
Cincinnati Reds picking off here and
we're<00:00:12.990> gonna<00:00:13.049> key<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.559> on<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:13.889> back<00:00:14.130> right

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
we're gonna key in on that back right

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.730 
we're gonna key in on that back right
heel<00:00:14.849> because<00:00:15.690> he's<00:00:15.900> gonna<00:00:16.049> do<00:00:16.289> what<00:00:16.470> we<00:00:16.560> call

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
heel because he's gonna do what we call

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.210 
heel because he's gonna do what we call
a<00:00:16.800> reverse<00:00:17.190> pivot<00:00:17.640> jump<00:00:18.539> turn<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.170> he's<00:00:20.100> going

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
a reverse pivot jump turn and he's going

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.880 
a reverse pivot jump turn and he's going
to<00:00:20.310> turn<00:00:20.520> glove<00:00:20.939> side<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.660> throw<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.590> pickoff

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
to turn glove side and throw the pickoff

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.370 
to turn glove side and throw the pickoff
throw<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.580> second<00:00:24.029> base<00:00:24.140> and<00:00:25.140> we're<00:00:25.289> gonna

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
throw to second base and we're gonna

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.160 
throw to second base and we're gonna
play<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.800> in<00:00:25.980> slow<00:00:26.010> motion<00:00:26.720> so<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:27.990> see

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
play this in slow motion so you can see

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.290 
play this in slow motion so you can see
his<00:00:28.320> mechanics

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
his mechanics

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.490 
his mechanics
ideally<00:00:30.300> Cueto<00:00:30.599> would<00:00:30.779> be<00:00:30.900> looking<00:00:31.080> at<00:00:31.320> home

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
ideally Cueto would be looking at home

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.910 
ideally Cueto would be looking at home
plate<00:00:32.570> but<00:00:33.570> he's<00:00:33.750> not<00:00:33.989> he's<00:00:34.410> looking<00:00:34.710> at<00:00:34.800> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
plate but he's not he's looking at the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.549 
plate but he's not he's looking at the
runner<00:00:35.130> he<00:00:35.969> does<00:00:36.239> pick<00:00:36.660> up<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.020> right<00:00:37.320> leg

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
runner he does pick up that right leg

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.229 
runner he does pick up that right leg
and<00:00:37.890> turn<00:00:39.110> 180<00:00:40.110> degrees<00:00:40.579> to<00:00:41.579> make<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.910> pickoff

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
and turn 180 degrees to make the pickoff

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.020 
and turn 180 degrees to make the pickoff
throw<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.899> I'm<00:00:43.710> pausing<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.280> here<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.760> can

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
throw and I'm pausing it here so you can

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.420 
throw and I'm pausing it here so you can
see<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:45.660> very<00:00:45.870> important<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.710> he

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
see that it's very important that he

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.270 
see that it's very important that he
clear<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:48.059> left<00:00:48.360> shoulder<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:49.280> left

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
clear that left shoulder that left

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.270 
clear that left shoulder that left
shoulder<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.960> left<00:00:52.199> foot<00:00:52.559> should<00:00:53.219> be

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
shoulder and that left foot should be

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.119 
shoulder and that left foot should be
pointed<00:00:53.699> directly<00:00:53.820> towards<00:00:54.539> second<00:00:54.960> base<00:00:55.129> and

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
pointed directly towards second base and

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.760 
pointed directly towards second base and
he<00:00:56.190> doesn't<00:00:56.699> get<00:00:56.940> full<00:00:57.270> clearance<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:58.649> the

he doesn't get full clearance with the
left<00:00:58.949> foot<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.430> leg<00:00:59.760> he's<00:01:00.300> pointed<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.750> little

left foot and leg he's pointed a little
bit<00:01:01.079> towards<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> right-field<00:01:01.710> side<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:02.969> he

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
bit towards the right-field side but he

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.520 
bit towards the right-field side but he
does<00:01:03.210> clear<00:01:03.510> out<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.690> left<00:01:03.989> shoulder<00:01:04.080> pretty

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
does clear out that left shoulder pretty

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.179 
does clear out that left shoulder pretty
well<00:01:04.820> enabling<00:01:05.820> him<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.119> get<00:01:06.930> fully<00:01:07.260> turned<00:01:07.650> to

well enabling him to get fully turned to

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.980 
well enabling him to get fully turned to
make<00:01:08.369> an<00:01:08.520> effective<00:01:08.970> throw<00:01:09.590> to<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> bag<00:01:10.939> and

make an effective throw to the bag and

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.200 
make an effective throw to the bag and

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
the bag Cueto and the Reds do a good job

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.609 
the bag Cueto and the Reds do a good job
of<00:01:17.820> stalling<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.540> Mets<00:01:18.750> running<00:01:19.020> game<00:01:19.320> in

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
perfectly and is in danger of perhaps

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.099

throwing the ball to the right-field
side<00:02:21.469> in<00:02:22.069> addition<00:02:22.430> by<00:02:22.909> staring<00:02:23.420> at<00:02:23.510> the

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:23.689 
side in addition by staring at the

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.660 
side in addition by staring at the
runner<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.170> then<00:02:24.290> throwing<00:02:24.650> there<00:02:25.010> the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
runner and then throwing there the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.880 
runner and then throwing there the
runner<00:02:25.909> is<00:02:26.209> less<00:02:26.930> apt<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.379> get<00:02:27.500> comfortable

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
runner is less apt to get comfortable

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.399 
runner is less apt to get comfortable

and<00:02:37.430> you<00:02:37.519> can<00:02:37.639> see<00:02:37.760> it's<00:02:37.879> a<00:02:37.939> close<00:02:38.180> play<00:02:38.450> but

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:38.719 
and you can see it's a close play but
