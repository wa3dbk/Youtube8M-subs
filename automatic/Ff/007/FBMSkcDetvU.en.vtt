and clean and red no smelly's so we're

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.349 
and clean and red no smelly's so we're
all<00:00:21.630> set<00:00:21.960> except<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.730> had<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.850> change<00:00:24.000> over

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
those two little levers change over the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.689 
those two little levers change over the
park<00:00:27.480> switch<00:00:27.840> it's<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.830> different<00:00:29.250> connector
