hey<00:00:13.760> everybody<00:00:14.330> today<00:00:14.570> we're<00:00:15.380> actually<00:00:15.530> going

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 
hey everybody today we're actually going

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.460 
hey everybody today we're actually going
to<00:00:16.160> start<00:00:16.490> introducing<00:00:17.110> right-hand<00:00:18.110> rhythm

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
to start introducing right-hand rhythm

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.760 
to start introducing right-hand rhythm
to<00:00:18.920> the<00:00:19.040> chords<00:00:19.460> that<00:00:19.730> we've<00:00:19.880> already<00:00:20.060> learned

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
to the chords that we've already learned

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.530 
to the chords that we've already learned
before<00:00:21.770> we<00:00:21.890> actually<00:00:22.279> try<00:00:22.490> to<00:00:22.520> use<00:00:22.700> right-hand

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540 
before we actually try to use right-hand

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.870 
before we actually try to use right-hand
rhythm<00:00:24.140> with<00:00:24.560> chords<00:00:24.980> we're<00:00:25.550> going<00:00:25.670> to<00:00:25.730> first

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
rhythm with chords we're going to first

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.760 
rhythm with chords we're going to first
concentrate<00:00:26.420> on<00:00:26.450> what<00:00:26.840> right-hand<00:00:27.470> rhythm

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
concentrate on what right-hand rhythm

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.580 
concentrate on what right-hand rhythm
really<00:00:28.040> is<00:00:28.250> and<00:00:28.610> just<00:00:29.329> do<00:00:29.540> it<00:00:29.720> with<00:00:29.869> muted

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
really is and just do it with muted

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.140 
really is and just do it with muted
strings<00:00:30.919> we're<00:00:31.220> not<00:00:31.340> going<00:00:31.490> to<00:00:31.520> have<00:00:31.669> any<00:00:31.910> kind

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
strings we're not going to have any kind

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.979 
strings we're not going to have any kind
of<00:00:34.030> chords<00:00:35.030> going<00:00:35.210> and<00:00:35.510> stuff<00:00:35.660> we<00:00:35.810> don't<00:00:35.900> want

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
of chords going and stuff we don't want

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.060 
of chords going and stuff we don't want
to<00:00:36.170> have<00:00:36.260> to<00:00:36.320> think<00:00:36.380> about<00:00:36.620> two<00:00:36.739> things<00:00:36.890> at

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
to have to think about two things at

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.800 
to have to think about two things at
once<00:00:37.250> yet<00:00:37.460> I<00:00:37.640> always<00:00:38.030> really<00:00:38.270> want<00:00:38.540> you<00:00:38.600> to<00:00:38.690> get

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
once yet I always really want you to get

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.139 
once yet I always really want you to get
the<00:00:38.900> concept<00:00:39.320> of<00:00:39.380> what's<00:00:39.560> going<00:00:40.100> on<00:00:40.400> when<00:00:41.060> you

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
the concept of what's going on when you

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.410 
the concept of what's going on when you
see<00:00:41.360> people<00:00:41.690> playing<00:00:42.590> more<00:00:43.250> like<00:00:43.460> it's<00:00:44.180> more

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
see people playing more like it's more

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.150 
see people playing more like it's more
of<00:00:44.450> a<00:00:44.570> strumming<00:00:45.080> rhythm<00:00:45.650> style<00:00:45.950> it's<00:00:46.130> not

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
of a strumming rhythm style it's not

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.830 
of a strumming rhythm style it's not
like<00:00:46.370> a<00:00:46.400> percussive<00:00:46.820> there's<00:00:47.420> different

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
like a percussive there's different

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.420 
like a percussive there's different
types<00:00:48.020> of<00:00:48.230> rhythm<00:00:48.830> that<00:00:48.860> you<00:00:49.070> can<00:00:49.220> do<00:00:49.280> in<00:00:49.370> the

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
types of rhythm that you can do in the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.020 
types of rhythm that you can do in the
right<00:00:49.580> hand<00:00:49.820> but<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.000> most<00:00:50.240> basic<00:00:50.750> and<00:00:50.960> most

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
right hand but the most basic and most

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.760 
right hand but the most basic and most
routinely<00:00:53.030> used<00:00:53.420> in<00:00:53.720> all<00:00:53.900> styles<00:00:54.260> of<00:00:54.320> music<00:00:54.380> is

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
routinely used in all styles of music is

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.370 
routinely used in all styles of music is
just<00:00:54.950> a<00:00:55.040> strumming<00:00:55.460> style<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:56.140> it's<00:00:57.140> all

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
just a strumming style and it's all

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.890 
just a strumming style and it's all
about<00:00:57.620> momentum<00:00:58.220> so<00:00:58.600> let's<00:00:59.600> get<00:00:59.750> to<00:00:59.870> the

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
about momentum so let's get to the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.580 
about momentum so let's get to the
lesson<00:01:00.140> you'll<00:01:00.440> see<00:01:00.560> what<00:01:00.680> I<00:01:00.740> mean<00:01:02.530> okay<00:01:03.530> so

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
lesson you'll see what I mean okay so

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.350 
lesson you'll see what I mean okay so
this<00:01:03.920> whole<00:01:04.189> lesson<00:01:04.400> is<00:01:04.640> going<00:01:04.729> to<00:01:04.790> be<00:01:04.970> really

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
this whole lesson is going to be really

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.760 
this whole lesson is going to be really
just<00:01:05.540> concentrating<00:01:06.170> on<00:01:06.259> the<00:01:06.350> right<00:01:06.530> hand

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
just concentrating on the right hand

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.300 
just concentrating on the right hand
down<00:01:06.920> here<00:01:07.189> so<00:01:08.380> what<00:01:09.380> I'm<00:01:09.500> doing<00:01:09.890> in<00:01:10.009> the<00:01:10.100> left

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
down here so what I'm doing in the left

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.100 
down here so what I'm doing in the left
hand<00:01:10.640> while<00:01:11.060> I'm<00:01:11.270> going<00:01:11.659> to<00:01:11.720> be<00:01:11.810> doing<00:01:12.020> these

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
hand while I'm going to be doing these

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.170 
hand while I'm going to be doing these
exercises<00:01:12.560> is<00:01:12.860> I'm<00:01:13.130> basically<00:01:13.549> taking<00:01:13.850> my

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
exercises is I'm basically taking my

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.380 
exercises is I'm basically taking my
fingers<00:01:14.659> and<00:01:14.930> I'm<00:01:15.470> just<00:01:15.909> really<00:01:16.909> lightly

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
fingers and I'm just really lightly

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.180 
fingers and I'm just really lightly
laying<00:01:17.870> them<00:01:18.110> down<00:01:18.290> on<00:01:18.440> the<00:01:18.530> string<00:01:18.770> so<00:01:18.920> I<00:01:18.980> all

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
laying them down on the string so I all

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.399 
laying them down on the string so I all
fold<00:01:19.490> them<00:01:19.640> together<00:01:19.810> so<00:01:20.810> it<00:01:20.900> creates<00:01:21.230> like<00:01:21.380> a

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
fold them together so it creates like a

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.969 
fold them together so it creates like a
like<00:01:22.280> a<00:01:22.310> muted<00:01:22.850> sound<00:01:23.120> here's<00:01:24.050> the<00:01:24.260> open<00:01:24.590> sound

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
like a muted sound here's the open sound

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.580 
like a muted sound here's the open sound
and<00:01:26.130> slowly<00:01:26.700> lower<00:01:26.939> your<00:01:27.119> fingers<00:01:27.500> so<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
and slowly lower your fingers so the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.740 
and slowly lower your fingers so the
autonomy<00:01:29.009> if<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.250> push<00:01:29.400> too<00:01:29.549> hard<00:01:29.580> you<00:01:30.509> start

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
autonomy if you push too hard you start

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.870 
autonomy if you push too hard you start
getting<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.350> know<00:01:31.439> crazy<00:01:32.040> notes<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.729> stuff

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
getting you know crazy notes and stuff

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.210 
getting you know crazy notes and stuff
so<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.060> try<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:33.990> make<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.350> just<00:01:34.530> very

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
so just try to make you just very

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.440 
so just try to make you just very
percussive<00:01:36.149> sounding<00:01:36.799> all<00:01:37.799> right<00:01:38.030> now<00:01:39.030> let's

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
percussive sounding all right now let's

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.300 
percussive sounding all right now let's
concentrate<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.930> what's<00:01:40.110> going<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:40.500> when

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
concentrate on what's going on when

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.340 
concentrate on what's going on when
you're<00:01:41.520> doing<00:01:41.850> rhythm<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.899> right<00:01:43.080> hand

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
you're doing rhythm in the right hand

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.969 
you're doing rhythm in the right hand
these<00:01:43.530> basic<00:01:44.009> strumming<00:01:44.369> patterns<00:01:45.979> basically

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
these basic strumming patterns basically

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.070 
these basic strumming patterns basically
everybody<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.610> doing<00:01:47.789> a<00:01:48.240> lot<00:01:48.539> of<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.810> same

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
everybody is doing a lot of the same

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.520 
everybody is doing a lot of the same
thing<00:01:50.090> most<00:01:51.090> strumming<00:01:51.570> patterns<00:01:51.990> are<00:01:52.170> in

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
thing most strumming patterns are in

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.260 
thing most strumming patterns are in
just<00:01:52.890> or<00:01:53.100> what<00:01:53.280> are<00:01:53.399> called<00:01:53.430> eighth<00:01:53.850> note

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
just or what are called eighth note

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.520 
just or what are called eighth note
feels<00:01:54.659> now<00:01:55.649> what<00:01:56.580> is<00:01:56.670> an<00:01:56.789> eighth<00:01:56.909> note<00:01:56.939> well

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
feels now what is an eighth note well

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.080 
feels now what is an eighth note well
here's<00:01:58.530> what<00:01:58.679> it<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.890> if<00:01:59.009> we<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.340> four<00:01:59.729> beats

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
here's what it is if we have four beats

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.359 
here's what it is if we have four beats
and<00:02:00.450> then<00:02:01.170> measure<00:02:01.440> in<00:02:01.710> music<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.280> that's

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
and then measure in music and that's

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.490 
and then measure in music and that's
you've<00:02:03.060> ever<00:02:03.300> heard<00:02:03.450> somebody<00:02:03.630> get<00:02:03.840> one<00:02:03.869> two

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
you've ever heard somebody get one two

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.990 
you've ever heard somebody get one two
three<00:02:05.100> four<00:02:05.549> one<00:02:06.090> two<00:02:06.569> three<00:02:06.869> four<00:02:08.000> what

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
three four one two three four what

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.100 
three four one two three four what
they're<00:02:09.149> doing<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.569> they're<00:02:09.690> just<00:02:09.899> calling

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
they're doing is they're just calling

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.050 
they're doing is they're just calling
out<00:02:10.410> measures<00:02:10.890> there's<00:02:11.250> four<00:02:11.640> B's<00:02:11.850> four

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
out measures there's four B's four

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.880 
out measures there's four B's four
measure<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.540> then<00:02:12.630> it<00:02:12.750> starts<00:02:13.049> over<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.440> new

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
measure and then it starts over to a new

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.800 
measure and then it starts over to a new
measure<00:02:14.130> with<00:02:14.790> another<00:02:15.060> four<00:02:15.360> beats<00:02:15.569> and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
measure with another four beats and

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.120 
measure with another four beats and
they're<00:02:16.260> just<00:02:16.700> numbering<00:02:17.700> each<00:02:17.940> beat<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:19.319> now

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
they're just numbering each beat so now

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.970 
they're just numbering each beat so now
if<00:02:20.459> notes<00:02:20.850> fall<00:02:21.209> directly<00:02:21.840> on<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.230> beat<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:22.650> if

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
if notes fall directly on the beat so if

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.940 
if notes fall directly on the beat so if
I<00:02:23.130> were<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.400> go<00:02:23.549> one<00:02:24.230> two<00:02:25.230> three<00:02:26.510> four<00:02:27.950> those

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
I were to go one two three four those

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.569 
I were to go one two three four those
are<00:02:29.250> called<00:02:29.700> quarter<00:02:30.239> notes<00:02:30.709> every<00:02:31.709> time<00:02:31.980> you

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
are called quarter notes every time you

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.640 
are called quarter notes every time you
play<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:33.180> note<00:02:33.570> directly<00:02:33.900> on<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.260> beat<00:02:34.440> and

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
play a note directly on the beat and

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.380 
play a note directly on the beat and
therefore<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:35.820> rhythm<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.239> we're

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
therefore and this rhythm that we're

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.900 
therefore and this rhythm that we're
working<00:02:36.510> on<00:02:36.780> right<00:02:37.019> now<00:02:37.350> at<00:02:37.650> least<00:02:37.910> they're

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
working on right now at least they're

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.830 
working on right now at least they're
called<00:02:39.390> quarter<00:02:39.989> notes<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:41.269> you<00:02:42.269> see<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.630> I

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
called quarter notes and you see that I

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.390 
called quarter notes and you see that I
did<00:02:43.109> them<00:02:43.230> with<00:02:43.350> all<00:02:43.620> downstrokes

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
did them with all downstrokes

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.840 
did them with all downstrokes
I<00:02:44.549> always<00:02:44.940> strum<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.390> strings<00:02:45.420> down<00:02:46.220> now<00:02:47.220> that

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
I always strum the strings down now that

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.520 
I always strum the strings down now that
is<00:02:48.060> also<00:02:48.239> referred<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.690> in<00:02:48.900> music<00:02:49.200> as<00:02:49.320> being

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
is also referred to in music as being

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.400 
is also referred to in music as being
the<00:02:49.709> downbeat<00:02:50.400> whenever<00:02:51.269> you<00:02:51.570> actually<00:02:51.780> hear

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
the downbeat whenever you actually hear

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.449 
the downbeat whenever you actually hear
the<00:02:52.920> number<00:02:53.370> called<00:02:53.820> out<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.690> play

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
the number called out you play

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.000 
the number called out you play
that<00:02:56.459> as<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.760> downbeat<00:02:57.239> now<00:02:58.049> we<00:02:58.530> also<00:02:58.709> have

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
that as the downbeat now we also have

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.789 
that as the downbeat now we also have
space<00:02:59.340> in<00:02:59.579> between<00:02:59.820> the<00:03:00.180> numbers<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:01.290> we<00:03:01.590> can

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
space in between the numbers that we can

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.990 
space in between the numbers that we can
fill<00:03:02.250> in<00:03:02.430> another<00:03:02.940> note<00:03:03.180> in<00:03:03.390> there<00:03:04.340> we<00:03:05.340> you

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
fill in another note in there we you

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.849 
fill in another note in there we you
know<00:03:06.120> we<00:03:06.359> actually<00:03:06.480> have<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.840> lot<00:03:07.470> more<00:03:07.680> space

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
know we actually have a lot more space

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.170 
know we actually have a lot more space
than<00:03:07.890> that<00:03:08.130> we<00:03:08.220> can<00:03:08.250> put<00:03:08.489> more<00:03:08.700> than<00:03:08.790> one<00:03:08.850> note

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
than that we can put more than one note

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.270 
than that we can put more than one note
in<00:03:09.329> there<00:03:09.480> but<00:03:09.720> what<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:10.890> called<00:03:11.100> is

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
in there but what that is called is

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.099 
in there but what that is called is
dividing<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.000> beat<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.450> can<00:03:12.630> divide<00:03:12.900> the

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
dividing the beat you can divide the

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.229 
dividing the beat you can divide the
beat<00:03:13.260> into<00:03:13.590> two<00:03:13.769> notes<00:03:14.100> divided<00:03:14.730> into<00:03:14.970> three

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
beat into two notes divided into three

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.920 
beat into two notes divided into three
notes<00:03:15.510> four<00:03:15.959> notes<00:03:16.200> or<00:03:17.010> whatever<00:03:17.130> but<00:03:18.120> if<00:03:18.390> we

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
notes four notes or whatever but if we

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.759 
notes four notes or whatever but if we
were<00:03:19.079> to<00:03:19.109> do<00:03:19.380> this<00:03:19.680> if<00:03:19.980> we<00:03:20.190> go<00:03:20.510> one<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:22.190> two<00:03:23.630> and

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
were to do this if we go one and two and

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.740 
were to do this if we go one and two and
three<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:26.700> four<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:29.209> now<00:03:30.209> you'll<00:03:30.359> see<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:30.569> I

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
three and four and now you'll see that I

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.339 
three and four and now you'll see that I
put<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:31.109> and<00:03:31.290> in<00:03:31.769> between<00:03:32.220> each<00:03:32.639> number<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.349> I

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
put it and in between each number and I

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.920 
put it and in between each number and I
played<00:03:34.830> an<00:03:35.040> upstroke<00:03:35.489> so<00:03:36.360> I<00:03:36.390> hit<00:03:36.659> it<00:03:36.690> on<00:03:36.870> the

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
played an upstroke so I hit it on the

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.830 
played an upstroke so I hit it on the
way<00:03:37.019> back<00:03:37.319> up<00:03:37.379> as<00:03:37.830> well<00:03:38.099> as<00:03:38.370> going<00:03:39.209> down

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
way back up as well as going down

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.280 
way back up as well as going down
now<00:03:40.230> that<00:03:41.360> upstroke<00:03:42.360> that<00:03:42.540> happens<00:03:42.840> on<00:03:43.020> the

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
now that upstroke that happens on the

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.900 
now that upstroke that happens on the
end<00:03:43.560> is<00:03:44.220> called<00:03:44.849> the<00:03:45.060> upbeat<00:03:45.450> in<00:03:45.690> music<00:03:46.319> so<00:03:47.190> it

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
end is called the upbeat in music so it

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.070 
end is called the upbeat in music so it
kind<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.180> works<00:03:48.360> out<00:03:48.510> we're<00:03:48.660> doing<00:03:48.720> a<00:03:48.870> down

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
kind of works out we're doing a down

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.430 
kind of works out we're doing a down
stroke<00:03:49.380> on<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.590> downbeat<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:50.190> an<00:03:50.730> upbeat<00:03:51.440> I

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
stroke on the downbeat and an upbeat I

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.370 
stroke on the downbeat and an upbeat I
mean<00:03:52.980> an<00:03:53.099> upstroke<00:03:53.400> on<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.760> upbeat<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.380> that

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
mean an upstroke on the upbeat and that

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.620 
mean an upstroke on the upbeat and that
is<00:03:55.650> really<00:03:56.340> what<00:03:56.670> people<00:03:56.700> are<00:03:57.090> doing<00:03:57.269> they're

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
is really what people are doing they're

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.229 
is really what people are doing they're
doing<00:03:57.660> a<00:03:57.930> consistent<00:03:58.650> pattern<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:59.370> that<00:03:59.640> when

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
doing a consistent pattern of that when

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.300 
doing a consistent pattern of that when
they're<00:04:00.390> doing<00:04:00.540> strumming<00:04:01.080> so<00:04:01.620> let<00:04:02.160> me

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
they're doing strumming so let me

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.520 
they're doing strumming so let me
explain<00:04:02.580> if<00:04:02.910> I<00:04:03.060> just<00:04:03.300> did<00:04:03.569> four<00:04:03.959> beats<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:04.410> I

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
explain if I just did four beats and I

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.790 
explain if I just did four beats and I
went<00:04:04.769> one<00:04:05.550> and<00:04:06.260> two<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.650> three<00:04:08.459> and<00:04:09.180> four<00:04:09.989> and

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
went one and two and three and four and

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.740 
went one and two and three and four and
now<00:04:11.640> real<00:04:11.910> quick<00:04:12.090> I<00:04:12.209> don't<00:04:12.360> know<00:04:12.420> if<00:04:12.510> you<00:04:12.600> see

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
now real quick I don't know if you see

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.240 
now real quick I don't know if you see
but<00:04:12.959> I'm<00:04:13.260> trying<00:04:13.530> to<00:04:13.620> keep<00:04:13.769> my<00:04:13.890> wrist

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.629 
relatively loose this style of music you
actually<00:04:17.609> are<00:04:17.729> using<00:04:17.970> your<00:04:18.209> elbow<00:04:18.570> some<00:04:18.900> not

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
actually are using your elbow some not

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.879 
actually are using your elbow some not
huge<00:04:20.639> you<00:04:21.269> basically<00:04:21.690> want<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:22.019> control<00:04:22.440> it<00:04:22.680> to

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
huge you basically want to control it to

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.770 
huge you basically want to control it to
just<00:04:23.520> pass<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:24.000> strings<00:04:24.330> on<00:04:24.450> each<00:04:24.570> side<00:04:24.750> you

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
just pass the strings on each side you

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.510 
just pass the strings on each side you
don't<00:04:25.080> want<00:04:25.229> to<00:04:25.320> be<00:04:25.410> just<00:04:25.620> doing<00:04:25.830> a<00:04:25.919> huge<00:04:26.250> thing

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
don't want to be just doing a huge thing

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.030 
don't want to be just doing a huge thing
but<00:04:27.300> but<00:04:27.870> you<00:04:28.050> need<00:04:28.260> to<00:04:28.380> keep<00:04:28.530> your<00:04:28.740> wrist<00:04:28.919> nice

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
but but you need to keep your wrist nice

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.740 
but but you need to keep your wrist nice
and<00:04:29.100> loose<00:04:29.340> so<00:04:29.370> you<00:04:29.610> can<00:04:29.729> just<00:04:29.850> like<00:04:30.000> graze<00:04:30.389> the

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
and loose so you can just like graze the

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.530 
and loose so you can just like graze the
strings<00:04:31.110> okay<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.970> more<00:04:33.150> you<00:04:33.240> do<00:04:33.360> it<00:04:33.389> the<00:04:33.479> more

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
strings okay the more you do it the more

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.909 
strings okay the more you do it the more
control<00:04:34.139> you're<00:04:34.260> going<00:04:34.380> to<00:04:34.440> kind<00:04:34.620> of<00:04:34.650> get<00:04:34.800> and

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
control you're going to kind of get and

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.400 
control you're going to kind of get and
just<00:04:35.040> hit<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.280> strings<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.790> right<00:04:35.970> angle<00:04:36.450> but

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
just hit the strings the right angle but

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.379 
just hit the strings the right angle but
when<00:04:38.100> we're<00:04:38.220> looking<00:04:38.460> at<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.669> rhythm<00:04:38.970> here<00:04:39.240> if

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
when we're looking at the rhythm here if

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.770 
when we're looking at the rhythm here if
you<00:04:40.229> play<00:04:40.530> all<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:41.310> down<00:04:41.490> beats<00:04:41.790> and<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.630> up

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
you play all the down beats and the up

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.750 
you play all the down beats and the up
beats<00:04:43.050> you<00:04:43.680> have<00:04:43.890> what's<00:04:44.190> called<00:04:44.370> an<00:04:44.580> eighth

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
beats you have what's called an eighth

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.659 
beats you have what's called an eighth
note<00:04:44.820> rhythm<00:04:46.100> it's<00:04:47.100> called<00:04:47.280> an<00:04:47.430> eighth<00:04:47.640> note

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
note rhythm it's called an eighth note

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:48.830 
note rhythm it's called an eighth note
rhythm<00:04:48.150> because<00:04:48.300> there's<00:04:48.450> really<00:04:48.539> eight

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
rhythm because there's really eight

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.230 
rhythm because there's really eight
notes<00:04:49.169> now<00:04:49.440> in<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:50.070> measure<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:50.550> set<00:04:50.760> up<00:04:50.910> one

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
notes now in the measure and set up one

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.460 
notes now in the measure and set up one
two<00:04:51.900> three<00:04:52.860> four<00:04:53.550> we<00:04:53.820> get<00:04:54.000> one<00:04:54.419> and<00:04:54.690> two<00:04:55.229> and

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
two three four we get one and two and

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.510 
two three four we get one and two and
three<00:04:56.160> and<00:04:56.370> four<00:04:56.430> and<00:04:57.240> one<00:04:57.630> and<00:04:58.050> two<00:04:58.169> and<00:04:58.830> three

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
three and four and one and two and three

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.659 
three and four and one and two and three
and<00:04:59.729> four<00:04:59.789> and<00:05:00.330> so<00:05:01.190> that<00:05:02.190> is<00:05:02.340> an<00:05:02.460> eighth<00:05:02.640> note

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
and four and so that is an eighth note

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.610 
and four and so that is an eighth note
rhythm<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:03.419> now<00:05:03.870> when<00:05:04.050> you<00:05:04.169> see<00:05:04.380> people

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
rhythm and now when you see people

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.940 
rhythm and now when you see people
strumming<00:05:05.280> in<00:05:06.229> popular<00:05:07.229> music<00:05:07.590> or<00:05:07.680> whatever

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
strumming in popular music or whatever

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.430 
strumming in popular music or whatever
um<00:05:08.180> that's<00:05:09.180> usually<00:05:09.780> what<00:05:09.960> they're<00:05:10.110> doing

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
um that's usually what they're doing

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.070 
um that's usually what they're doing
they're<00:05:10.830> keeping<00:05:11.280> a<00:05:11.400> consistent<00:05:11.960> when<00:05:12.960> we

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
they're keeping a consistent when we

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.690 
they're keeping a consistent when we
talked<00:05:13.320> about<00:05:13.440> in<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:13.889> intro<00:05:14.220> that<00:05:14.250> it's<00:05:14.520> all

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
talked about in the intro that it's all

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.570 
talked about in the intro that it's all
about<00:05:15.000> momentum<00:05:15.419> and<00:05:15.840> that's<00:05:16.590> all<00:05:16.830> it<00:05:16.979> is<00:05:17.160> you

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
about momentum and that's all it is you

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.969 
about momentum and that's all it is you
have<00:05:17.820> to<00:05:18.000> keep<00:05:18.300> this<00:05:18.510> consistent<00:05:19.080> momentum

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
have to keep this consistent momentum

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.529 
have to keep this consistent momentum
just<00:05:20.160> like<00:05:20.370> if<00:05:20.760> you<00:05:20.850> ever<00:05:21.030> seen<00:05:21.240> one<00:05:21.389> of<00:05:21.419> those

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
just like if you ever seen one of those

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:23.540 
just like if you ever seen one of those
old<00:05:21.780> metronomes<00:05:22.410> that<00:05:22.620> just<00:05:22.770> go<00:05:22.889> tick<00:05:23.130> tock

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
old metronomes that just go tick tock

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.150 
old metronomes that just go tick tock
tick<00:05:23.940> tock<00:05:23.970> you<00:05:24.870> want<00:05:25.169> to<00:05:25.530> be<00:05:25.650> able<00:05:25.770> to<00:05:25.950> keep

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
tick tock you want to be able to keep

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.129 
tick tock you want to be able to keep
this<00:05:26.370> very<00:05:26.700> consistent<00:05:27.510> momentum<00:05:27.960> in<00:05:28.050> your

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
this very consistent momentum in your

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.870 
this very consistent momentum in your
hand<00:05:28.320> because<00:05:28.560> that<00:05:28.740> is<00:05:28.889> what<00:05:29.100> gives<00:05:29.430> you<00:05:29.639> your

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
hand because that is what gives you your

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.840 
hand because that is what gives you your
rhythm<00:05:30.300> so<00:05:31.289> in<00:05:31.620> the<00:05:31.860> beginning<00:05:31.979> I<00:05:32.370> want<00:05:32.639> you<00:05:32.729> to

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
rhythm so in the beginning I want you to

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.210 
rhythm so in the beginning I want you to
just<00:05:33.030> do<00:05:33.150> that<00:05:33.360> I<00:05:33.510> want<00:05:33.810> you<00:05:33.930> to<00:05:33.990> go<00:05:34.169> one<00:05:34.889> and

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
just do that I want you to go one and

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.680 
just do that I want you to go one and
two<00:05:36.030> and<00:05:36.330> three<00:05:36.960> and<00:05:37.500> four<00:05:38.039> and<00:05:38.669> one<00:05:39.000> and<00:05:39.570> two

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
two and three and four and one and two

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.159 
two and three and four and one and two
three<00:05:41.090> kind<00:05:42.090> of<00:05:42.150> sounds<00:05:42.360> like<00:05:42.389> a<00:05:42.510> train<00:05:42.840> after

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
three kind of sounds like a train after

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.340 
three kind of sounds like a train after
a<00:05:43.200> while<00:05:43.350> three<00:05:44.220> and<00:05:44.460> four<00:05:44.910> it<00:05:45.090> and<00:05:45.270> that<00:05:46.050> is

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
a while three and four it and that is

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.190 
a while three and four it and that is
the<00:05:46.560> feel<00:05:46.889> when<00:05:47.669> you're<00:05:47.820> doing<00:05:48.150> a<00:05:48.390> right<00:05:48.960> hand

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
the feel when you're doing a right hand

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.219 
the feel when you're doing a right hand
rhythm<00:05:49.470> now<00:05:50.099> that<00:05:50.340> will<00:05:50.550> never<00:05:50.820> change<00:05:51.229> no

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
rhythm now that will never change no

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:53.540 
rhythm now that will never change no
matter<00:05:52.470> what<00:05:52.830> pattern

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
matter what pattern

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.490 
matter what pattern
we're<00:05:53.789> going<00:05:53.910> to<00:05:54.000> do<00:05:54.180> we're<00:05:54.870> always<00:05:55.080> going<00:05:55.440> to

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
we're going to do we're always going to

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.790 
we're going to do we're always going to
try<00:05:55.740> to<00:05:55.849> consistently<00:05:56.849> be<00:05:56.940> doing<00:05:57.479> this<00:05:58.020> up<00:05:58.530> and

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
try to consistently be doing this up and

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.460 
try to consistently be doing this up and
down<00:05:59.210> so<00:06:00.210> get<00:06:00.449> used<00:06:00.690> to<00:06:00.810> that<00:06:00.960> feel<00:06:01.229> first

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
down so get used to that feel first

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.309 
down so get used to that feel first
hitting<00:06:01.919> the<00:06:02.039> string<00:06:02.340> every<00:06:02.970> single<00:06:03.389> time<00:06:03.599> one

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 
hitting the string every single time one

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:07.339

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:55.409 
start introducing different rhythmic

start introducing different rhythmic
patterns<00:06:55.860> and<00:06:56.129> how<00:06:57.120> they<00:06:57.150> mix<00:06:57.630> it<00:06:57.750> up<00:06:57.870> and<00:06:58.050> how

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
patterns and how they mix it up and how

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.959 
patterns and how they mix it up and how
they<00:06:58.259> make<00:06:58.409> rhythms<00:06:58.770> sound<00:06:59.009> different<00:06:59.430> even

00:06:59.959 --> 00:06:59.969 
they make rhythms sound different even

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:02.600 
they make rhythms sound different even
though<00:07:00.360> the<00:07:01.110> motion<00:07:01.560> is<00:07:01.710> always<00:07:02.250> the<00:07:02.400> same

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610 
though the motion is always the same

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.860 
though the motion is always the same
okay<00:07:03.360> so<00:07:04.139> stay<00:07:04.650> tuned
