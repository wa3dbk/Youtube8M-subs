00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.700
 how is the ship made 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.510
 so a few basic ingredients are first of all water 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.409
 I would like to cook what you have to stop yes that is 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:18.999
 make glucose syrup as a plasticizer Wednesday to get in shape and then watch 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:19.560
 what's going on 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.369
 yes exactly as the ad 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:22.720
 the flavor 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.789
 why are we doing that here 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.140
 and the color bike 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.519
 speed dating 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.519
 my mother always says that coloring is very bad for it 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:34.920
 he is actually you should not be right because dyes are crazy 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.010
 test 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.560
 And its absolutely safe but it is very good to have a lot of strength EPD no 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.630
 it is not good to eat a lot of strength but you will naturally end up like me 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.030
 am a little residential project 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.410
 I don't think I can stop 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.410
 well so that's how it was preferred 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.870
 the Spaniard makes 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.940
 there goes the fall of a balcony 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.940
 and there we must made 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.790
 20,000 candy canes 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.600
 and four or five from the rotation 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.930
 here i have bandicoot everything you see a lot of steam comes out 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.860
 and this becomes one i love to stir the pan in the pan 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.470
 you have to do with two hands 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.320
 picking and garden plants 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.220
 and I want to make it work later I think 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.220
 in research 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.370
 striking is back he said 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.370
 a pity then 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.090
 the Taliban 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.670
 we had hoped for a victory 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.050
 here becomes the goalkeeper 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.500
 and it happens 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.500
 other banks make the service 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.019
 be released here 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.189
 bite on a piece of wood 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.189
 and they are still warm 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.650
 both upstream clubs come in through the and digitenne room so show 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:50.219
 the dye becomes 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.609
 paste the colors pink through the paste 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:01.609
 now we actually do it too 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:02.989
 different slices 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.409
 and that is more than consecutive 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:06.679
 this as German 

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:09.679
 those clubs no longer occupy click here on the table 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:15.429
 the oxygen inside of the home but in this case the 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:17.919
 rainbow school the rainbow candy canes 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.919
 so make that scary out of it 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:28.280
 it turns my work to get it up 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.039
 when you reach the super combinÃ© 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:32.779
 well enough 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:35.779
 yes there I am succeed cars 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:40.759
 this is the outside 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:42.389
 in addition to that can come in 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.389
 He is calling 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.249
 a fixed value 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:57.219
 a giant 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:58.909
 it is very beautiful 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:59.879
 the front street 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.279
 there I want those very big ones that was made and that will be 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:04.520
 prepared to 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.520
 drawn on medium flights 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:36.219
 how we made beautiful for it 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:38.990
 what the biggest 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.189
 everything 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:43.189
 from uden volkel where it found the best 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.270
 but the best is yet to come
