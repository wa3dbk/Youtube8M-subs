00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
it felt fantastic I didn't think of it

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.749 
it felt fantastic I didn't think of it
for<00:04:32.349> anything<00:04:32.590> other<00:04:33.069> than<00:04:33.250> my<00:04:33.460> under<00:04:33.729> eye

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:48.219 
didn't mind it but when I compared it to

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:51.950

the clay to PO decline about the

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.260 
the clay to PO decline about the
coverage<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.289> opaqueness<00:04:53.860> of<00:04:54.370> it<00:04:54.669> and<00:04:54.909> yet

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
coverage the opaqueness of it and yet

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.300 
coverage the opaqueness of it and yet
the<00:04:55.569> very<00:04:55.870> very<00:04:56.259> sort<00:04:56.560> of<00:04:56.620> light<00:04:56.919> creamy

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
the very very sort of light creamy

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.089 
the very very sort of light creamy
consistency<00:04:57.819> it<00:04:58.479> almost<00:04:59.199> made<00:04:59.500> the<00:04:59.530> hourglass

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
consistency it almost made the hourglass

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.790 
consistency it almost made the hourglass
look<00:05:00.460> a<00:05:00.669> little<00:05:00.879> bit<00:05:01.090> ashy<00:05:01.330> so<00:05:02.229> my<00:05:02.500> one<00:05:02.770> eye

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
look a little bit ashy so my one eye

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.830 
look a little bit ashy so my one eye
looks<00:05:03.219> really<00:05:03.550> really<00:05:03.759> quite<00:05:04.000> right<00:05:04.360> the

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
looks really really quite right the

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.540 
looks really really quite right the
other<00:05:05.020> one<00:05:05.259> it<00:05:05.469> still<00:05:05.740> had<00:05:05.889> coverage<00:05:06.280> but<00:05:06.490> it

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
other one it still had coverage but it

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.029 
other one it still had coverage but it
tended<00:05:07.060> to<00:05:07.180> look<00:05:07.330> at<00:05:07.449> I<00:05:07.810> needed<00:05:08.169> a<00:05:08.379> sheer<00:05:08.830> and

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
tended to look at I needed a sheer and

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.850 
tended to look at I needed a sheer and
maybe<00:05:09.520> that's<00:05:09.819> because<00:05:10.300> there's<00:05:11.080> just<00:05:11.259> a<00:05:11.530> tiny

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
maybe that's because there's just a tiny

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.850 
maybe that's because there's just a tiny
hint<00:05:12.219> of<00:05:12.400> pink<00:05:12.729> to<00:05:13.120> counteract<00:05:13.680> some<00:05:14.680> of<00:05:14.770> the

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
hint of pink to counteract some of the

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.300 
hint of pink to counteract some of the
discoloration<00:05:15.729> then<00:05:16.449> then<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:17.319> hourglass

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
discoloration then then the hourglass

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.290 
discoloration then then the hourglass
which<00:05:18.580> is<00:05:18.729> sort<00:05:18.940> of<00:05:18.969> straight<00:05:19.449> out<00:05:19.690> kind<00:05:20.229> of<00:05:20.349> a

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
which is sort of straight out kind of a

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.350 
which is sort of straight out kind of a
yellow<00:05:22.529> sort<00:05:23.529> of<00:05:23.669> BG<00:05:24.669> thing<00:05:24.909> that<00:05:25.060> I<00:05:25.090> really

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
yellow sort of BG thing that I really

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.550 
yellow sort of BG thing that I really
actually<00:05:25.659> like<00:05:26.020> so<00:05:26.680> um

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
actually like so um

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.760 
actually like so um
the<00:05:29.070> coverage<00:05:29.400> was<00:05:29.540> the<00:05:30.540> major<00:05:30.990> thing<00:05:31.380> I<00:05:31.530> could

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
the coverage was the major thing I could

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.010 
the coverage was the major thing I could
tell<00:05:32.160> the<00:05:33.000> difference<00:05:33.030> the<00:05:33.480> hourglass<00:05:33.840> is

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
tell the difference the hourglass is

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.590 
tell the difference the hourglass is
still<00:05:34.230> really<00:05:34.440> nice<00:05:34.680> and<00:05:35.610> it's<00:05:36.030> pretty<00:05:36.210> close

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
still really nice and it's pretty close

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.120 
still really nice and it's pretty close
to<00:05:36.900> it<00:05:36.930> I<00:05:37.200> would<00:05:37.380> definitely<00:05:37.470> have<00:05:37.860> to<00:05:38.010> say

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
to it I would definitely have to say

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.200 
to it I would definitely have to say
it's<00:05:38.280> not<00:05:38.370> like<00:05:38.520> you're<00:05:38.639> going<00:05:38.730> to<00:05:38.820> be<00:05:38.880> wasting

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
it's not like you're going to be wasting

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.000 
it's not like you're going to be wasting
your<00:05:39.270> money<00:05:39.419> if<00:05:39.630> you<00:05:39.780> do<00:05:39.990> the<00:05:40.320> hourglass<00:05:40.830> now

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
your money if you do the hourglass now

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.040 
your money if you do the hourglass now
for<00:05:41.190> some<00:05:41.370> people<00:05:41.639> $37<00:05:42.630> would<00:05:42.870> ask

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
for some people $37 would ask

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.930 
for some people $37 would ask
40-something<00:05:43.860> it's<00:05:44.190> still<00:05:44.400> too<00:05:44.550> much<00:05:44.700> for

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
40-something it's still too much for

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.610 
40-something it's still too much for
concealer<00:05:45.419> and<00:05:45.540> I<00:05:45.600> totally<00:05:45.960> totally<00:05:46.590> totally

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620
