is doing here so see the nose crowns up

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.350 
is doing here so see the nose crowns up
real<00:00:11.010> quick<00:00:11.630> so<00:00:12.630> go<00:00:12.870> ahead<00:00:13.019> start<00:00:14.360> pushing

real quick so go ahead start pushing
down<00:00:15.509> on<00:00:15.660> get<00:00:16.560> x<00:00:16.830> rays<00:00:17.130> x<00:00:17.550> up<00:00:17.820> for<00:00:19.039> goodness

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:36.470 

like<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:23.910> push<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.449> gets<00:00:25.439> really<00:00:25.920> tidy

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.490 

camera

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
camera

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.640 
camera
alright<00:00:39.220> so<00:00:39.490> as<00:00:39.640> I<00:00:39.790> comes<00:00:40.300> why<00:00:40.720> dad<00:00:41.110> and<00:00:41.500> it

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
alright so as I comes why dad and it

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.290 
alright so as I comes why dad and it
comes<00:00:41.890> into<00:00:42.250> it<00:00:42.370> really<00:00:42.580> does<00:00:42.730> that<00:00:42.850> I<00:00:43.090> think

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
comes into it really does that I think

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.540 
comes into it really does that I think
it<00:00:43.360> has<00:00:43.420> a<00:00:43.510> flat<00:00:44.190> notice<00:00:45.190> they<00:00:45.310> probably

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
it has a flat notice they probably

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.460 
it has a flat notice they probably
doesn't<00:00:45.940> reach<00:00:46.150> out<00:00:46.390> to<00:00:46.600> get<00:00:46.720> ridges<00:00:46.900> out<00:00:47.260> up

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
doesn't reach out to get ridges out up

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.950 
doesn't reach out to get ridges out up
here<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.910> it's<00:00:49.090> kind<00:00:49.390> of<00:00:49.420> flattened<00:00:49.870> and

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
here and it's kind of flattened and

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.760 
here and it's kind of flattened and
bolted<00:00:50.410> right<00:00:50.440> and<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:53.170> it's<00:00:53.320> good<00:00:53.500> to<00:00:53.530> have

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
bolted right and so it's good to have

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.960 
bolted right and so it's good to have
your<00:00:54.010> your<00:00:54.820> drawing<00:00:55.210> out<00:00:56.460> see<00:00:57.460> what's<00:00:57.610> going

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
your your drawing out see what's going

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:04.829 
your your drawing out see what's going
on<00:01:01.559> go<00:01:02.559> ahead<00:01:02.739> push<00:01:03.040> these<00:01:03.220> back<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:04.690> because

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
on go ahead push these back just because

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.070 
on go ahead push these back just because
we<00:01:04.869> just<00:01:05.140> looked<00:01:05.350> at<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:05.650> draw<00:01:05.830> I<00:01:06.869> know<00:01:07.869> these

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
we just looked at the draw I know these

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.370 
we just looked at the draw I know these
kind<00:01:08.380> of<00:01:09.180> pull<00:01:10.180> these<00:01:10.360> way<00:01:10.690> out<00:01:13.140> spread<00:01:14.140> it<00:01:14.259> out

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
kind of pull these way out spread it out

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:24.830 
kind of pull these way out spread it out
a<00:01:14.440> little<00:01:14.590> bit<00:01:21.420> probably<00:01:22.420> he<00:01:22.600> went<00:01:23.350> make<00:01:23.890> that

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
a little bit probably he went make that

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:40.440 
a little bit probably he went make that
eyebrow

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.469

it's nice and flat ok we'll we'll start

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.999 
it's nice and flat ok we'll we'll start
splitting<00:01:44.780> it<00:01:44.930> more<00:01:45.110> and<00:01:45.290> more<00:01:45.350> but<00:01:45.710> for<00:01:45.890> now

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
splitting it more and more but for now

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.980 
splitting it more and more but for now
that's<00:01:46.220> pretty<00:01:46.520> good<00:01:48.820> and<00:01:49.820> we<00:01:49.970> know<00:01:50.090> those

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
that's pretty good and we know those

00:01:50.990 --> 00:02:01.370 
that's pretty good and we know those
really<00:01:51.350> bulges<00:01:51.950> in<00:01:51.979> here

the

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.250 

so<00:03:56.340> it's<00:03:56.430> like<00:03:56.610> a<00:03:56.760> shady<00:03:57.660> will<00:03:57.900> turn<00:03:58.080> off<00:03:58.170> the

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
so it's like a shady will turn off the

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.570 
so it's like a shady will turn off the
x-ray

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.510 

start<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:05.750> shape<00:04:06.620> up<00:04:06.830> into<00:04:07.130> a<00:04:07.160> kind<00:04:07.370> of<00:04:07.460> a

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
start the shape up into a kind of a

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.970 
start the shape up into a kind of a
rough<00:04:07.760> those<00:04:08.480> again<00:04:08.990> it<00:04:09.080> needs<00:04:09.200> a<00:04:09.380> big<00:04:09.560> flare

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
rough those again it needs a big flare

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.180 
rough those again it needs a big flare
up<00:04:10.160> here<00:04:10.460> cap<00:04:11.060> push<00:04:11.360> this<00:04:11.510> way<00:04:11.720> back<00:04:11.990> so<00:04:12.980> let's

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
up here cap push this way back so let's

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.070 
up here cap push this way back so let's
look<00:04:13.370> at<00:04:13.550> our<00:04:13.580> drawing<00:04:14.000> again<00:04:15.400> and<00:04:16.930> suck<00:04:17.930> his

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
look at our drawing again and suck his

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.280 
look at our drawing again and suck his
nose<00:04:18.320> pointed<00:04:19.010> more<00:04:19.459> upward<00:04:19.880> instead<00:04:20.750> of<00:04:21.049> flat

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
nose pointed more upward instead of flat

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.570 
nose pointed more upward instead of flat
down<00:04:22.270> so<00:04:23.270> there's<00:04:23.690> all<00:04:23.810> kinds<00:04:24.140> of<00:04:24.200> little

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
down so there's all kinds of little

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.070 
down so there's all kinds of little
nuances<00:04:25.580> but<00:04:25.790> i<00:04:25.850> think<00:04:26.120> the<00:04:26.270> proportions<00:04:26.870> are

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
nuances but i think the proportions are

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.450 
nuances but i think the proportions are
five<00:04:27.380> we're<00:04:27.680> going<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.830> go<00:04:27.920> ahead<00:04:28.040> and<00:04:28.160> start

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
five we're going to go ahead and start

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.760 
five we're going to go ahead and start
punching<00:04:29.000> the<00:04:29.120> dough's<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:29.600> the<00:04:30.230> nostril

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
punching the dough's and the nostril

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.020 
punching the dough's and the nostril
here<00:04:30.980> it<00:04:31.970> looks<00:04:32.240> pretty<00:04:32.570> good<00:04:33.880> turn<00:04:34.880> off<00:04:35.000> the

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
here it looks pretty good turn off the

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.880 
here it looks pretty good turn off the
camera<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.690> have<00:04:36.380> a<00:04:36.410> lot<00:04:36.770> of<00:04:37.570> work<00:04:38.570> did<00:04:38.780> to<00:04:39.710> do

camera I have a lot of work did to do
wrong<00:04:40.130> the<00:04:40.310> proportions<00:04:40.940> of<00:04:41.060> it<00:04:41.210> we'll<00:04:41.390> go

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
wrong the proportions of it we'll go

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.760 
wrong the proportions of it we'll go
ahead<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:41.810> let's<00:04:41.990> just<00:04:42.050> go<00:04:42.320> ahead<00:04:42.350> and<00:04:42.530> start
