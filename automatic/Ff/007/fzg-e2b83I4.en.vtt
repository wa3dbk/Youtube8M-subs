if you look closely at the side of the

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:12.960 
if you look closely at the side of the
phone<00:01:11.440> you'll<00:01:11.979> notice<00:01:12.220> that<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.460> back<00:01:12.670> side

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
phone you'll notice that the back side

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.910 
phone you'll notice that the back side
is<00:01:13.090> actually<00:01:13.270> more<00:01:13.780> curved<00:01:14.200> than<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.619> front

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
is actually more curved than the front

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.980 
is actually more curved than the front
and<00:01:15.190> the<00:01:15.549> curve<00:01:15.759> is<00:01:15.909> emphasized<00:01:16.570> in<00:01:16.899> the

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
and the curve is emphasized in the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.170 
and the curve is emphasized in the
middle<00:01:17.290> making<00:01:17.830> it<00:01:17.920> look<00:01:18.040> even<00:01:18.610> slimmer<00:01:18.790> and

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
middle making it look even slimmer and

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.260 
middle making it look even slimmer and
more<00:01:19.600> sophisticated<00:01:20.220> plus<00:01:21.220> this<00:01:21.759> pattern

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
more sophisticated plus this pattern

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.450 
more sophisticated plus this pattern
back<00:01:22.479> side<00:01:22.780> appears<00:01:23.080> different<00:01:23.679> depending<00:01:24.369> on

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
back side appears different depending on

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.820 
back side appears different depending on
how<00:01:24.759> the<00:01:24.820> light<00:01:25.119> is<00:01:25.360> reflecting<00:01:25.960> curves

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
how the light is reflecting curves

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.919 
how the light is reflecting curves
pretty<00:01:27.159> awesome<00:01:27.610> I<00:01:27.759> really<00:01:27.789> like<00:01:28.210> it<00:01:28.390> a<00:01:28.479> lot<00:01:28.630> it

pretty awesome I really like it a lot it

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:30.510 
pretty awesome I really like it a lot it
feels<00:01:29.200> really<00:01:29.560> cool<00:01:29.740> in<00:01:29.920> your<00:01:30.039> hand

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
I mean it's neat I mean even just

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:32.639 
I mean it's neat I mean even just
holding<00:01:31.720> it<00:01:31.899> up<00:01:31.960> to<00:01:31.990> your<00:01:32.140> head<00:01:32.259> you<00:01:32.440> know<00:01:32.530> it

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
holding it up to your head you know it

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:34.139 
holding it up to your head you know it
actually<00:01:32.890> kind<00:01:33.039> of<00:01:33.070> goes<00:01:33.220> around<00:01:33.429> your<00:01:34.000> head

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
actually kind of goes around your head

actually kind of goes around your head
like<00:01:34.179> you<00:01:34.479> would<00:01:34.600> expect<00:01:34.690> a<00:01:35.110> phone<00:01:35.409> to<00:01:35.590> do

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
like you would expect a phone to do

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.249 
like you would expect a phone to do
these<00:01:36.100> days<00:01:36.429> curved<00:01:37.030> screens<00:01:37.539> are<00:01:37.780> showing<00:01:38.140> up

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
these days curved screens are showing up

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.520 
these days curved screens are showing up
all<00:01:38.470> over<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.950> place<00:01:39.039> even<00:01:39.610> on<00:01:39.909> TVs<00:01:40.390> but<00:01:41.200> why

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
all over the place even on TVs but why

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.859 
all over the place even on TVs but why
the<00:01:41.590> curve<00:01:42.130> there's<00:01:42.759> also<00:01:43.000> less<00:01:43.390> reflection

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
the curve there's also less reflection

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.139 
the curve there's also less reflection
so<00:01:44.560> you<00:01:44.619> should<00:01:44.920> have<00:01:45.130> a<00:01:45.159> clearer<00:01:45.550> picture<00:01:45.580> as

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
so you should have a clearer picture as

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.990 
so you should have a clearer picture as
well<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:46.720> that<00:01:47.440> only<00:01:47.830> does<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:48.429> curve<00:01:48.610> feel

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
well and that only does the curve feel

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.550 
well and that only does the curve feel
better<00:01:49.330> when<00:01:49.630> you're<00:01:49.750> talking<00:01:50.200> to<00:01:50.289> someone

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
better when you're talking to someone

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.429 
better when you're talking to someone
the<00:01:51.100> design<00:01:51.490> fits<00:01:51.880> your<00:01:52.149> face<00:01:52.420> better<00:01:52.780> as<00:01:53.049> the

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
the design fits your face better as the

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.660 
the design fits your face better as the
phone<00:01:53.649> comes<00:01:53.950> closer<00:01:54.340> to<00:01:54.700> your<00:01:55.000> mouth<00:01:56.670> another

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
phone comes closer to your mouth another
