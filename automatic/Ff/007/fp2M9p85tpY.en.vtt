00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.310
 3er it is much cooler to the point 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.019
 noticeable the clearer driver 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.300
 orientation of the cockpit one 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.190
 rediscovered bmw virtue that 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.780
 Space in the fund has become the a4 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.910
 not changed by the facelift 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.850
 nevertheless, one sits just as usual 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.739
 comfortable in the new 3er there is behind, though 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.490
 a little more space than before but unfortunately 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.950
 not as comfortable as ever 4 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.320
 both go with a two-liter turbo 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.950
 direct injection into the race of the four 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.080

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.990
 sprint from 0 to 100 is in 6.9 seconds 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:05.510
 ticked off the consumption is 6.8 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:08.690
 liter super the engines bring 245 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.360
 ps and 250 km h on the road 61 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.100
 seconds for the centennial mark and 6.3 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.660
 liter consumption on the pure 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:21.410
 datasheet sid munich a bit 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:22.040
 better from the new 3er works somehow 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.990
 blurred 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.910
 100% accuracy 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.540
 spontaneous feedback earlier wear the 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.610
 he does not have 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.500
 But it does not change that the bmw 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.570
 attentive to fast turns 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.119
 deflects and looks sensitive conduct 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.360
 lets the a4 does not quite succeed 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.420
 Well 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.470
 In addition, the very tightly tuned the 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.220
 uneven ground directly to the driver 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.260
 further than the 3 of the audi a4 with 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.119
 front-wheel drive and multitronic costs in 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.670
 the cheapest equipment variant e 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:55.729
 traction 37 1350 euro for the bmw 328 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.920
 with automatic are at least 39 1660 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.179
 to advise euro 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.610
 but who is the better now? 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.200
 middle class premium bavaria really 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.210
 you can say that only after 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.070
 exact dotted comparison test 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.700
 Currently, Munich's nose seems light 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.700
 to have in front
