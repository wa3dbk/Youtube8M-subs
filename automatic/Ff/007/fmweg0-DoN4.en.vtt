 Great 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.199
 centif hopes to take for now 

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:12.569
 it's great for the health of the star 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:15.569
 a little over three hours of racing 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:20.550
 the attack 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.159
 by other sites 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:26.159
 it's a shame the most aggressive club bass saxon 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.319
 wow here 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:33.010
 the aquatic space which is hektik rising one of the black walls 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.430
 it's sad col de bast year 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.430
 under the influence of wall street 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.420
 banks versus the colts mocked if the night is only a step 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.880
 alfresco 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.680
 What do you think 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.680
 little circuit 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.829
 I do not read there 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.210
 like to beat up 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.690
 here is a little bit of sun group laptops 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.300
 I think it's gone like a whirlwind 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.300
 we even saw that I have a lot of points is 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.630
 to the street near the col de sencours where I think it's the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.830
 pic of the south 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.760
 bides the order 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.760
 I have medicare 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.170
 not a word 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.610
 this time it's a little bit of slack 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.650
 I think that 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.950
 I walk a little too fast 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.950
 the two Spaniards I had doubled downhill 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.290
 kim slander 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.170
 if he missed the passes because I believe like 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.170
 orders to his victims 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.190
 of the pellet but 37 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.190

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.840
 the sun 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.840

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.899
 in this descent I have between them 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:14.329
 a half hour 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:15.809
 help 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:18.119

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.680

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.680
 m 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.079
 it's not the one we believe 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.109
 if he stayed half an hour or surimi involved 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.109
 he takes himself for proof 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.619
 The dynamic 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:48.529
 create a little 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:51.529
 and therefore the most intact 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:54.889
 the cliff part 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.179

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:06.929

 in relation to the franc 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.929
 the optical usher credit 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:15.789
 the passage times 

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:19.259

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.259

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:25.499
