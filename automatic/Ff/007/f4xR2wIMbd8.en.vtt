DC the media blitz obviously the first
thing<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.869> see<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.289> graphic<00:00:16.680> had<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.789> put

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
thing you see is the graphic had to put

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.290 
thing you see is the graphic had to put
a<00:00:17.970> lady<00:00:18.150> in<00:00:18.330> there<00:00:18.619> she's<00:00:19.619> dead<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.910> demon

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
and she lives inside the board through

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.630 
and she lives inside the board through
the<00:00:23.220> whole<00:00:23.369> series<00:00:27.949> it's<00:00:28.949> got<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.249> new<00:00:29.369> tips

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
the whole series it's got the new tips

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.759 
the whole series it's got the new tips
up<00:00:29.880> technology<00:00:30.570> which<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.140> basically<00:00:31.650> a

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
up technology which is basically a

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.760 
up technology which is basically a
shortened<00:00:32.490> nose<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.420> tail<00:00:33.630> but<00:00:33.870> it's<00:00:34.620> got<00:00:34.740> a

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
shortened nose and tail but it's got a

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.280 
shortened nose and tail but it's got a
really<00:00:34.950> quick<00:00:35.250> radius<00:00:35.880> which<00:00:36.510> allows<00:00:36.780> and

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
really quick radius which allows and

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.530 
really quick radius which allows and
compensates<00:00:37.920> for<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.700> longer<00:00:39.120> running

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
compensates for the longer running

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.560 
compensates for the longer running
length<00:00:39.870> throughout<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> whole<00:00:40.680> board<00:00:44.570> we

might<00:00:45.750> see<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.320> pro<00:00:46.560> someday<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.610> might

wonder what board is that guy writing
most<00:00:51.510> likely<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.020> most<00:00:52.260> cases<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.970> pro<00:00:53.970> is

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
most likely in most cases that pro is

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.790 
most likely in most cases that pro is
riding<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.750> board<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.200> you<00:00:55.290> can't<00:00:55.560> get<00:00:55.740> your

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
riding a board that you can't get your

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.370 
riding a board that you can't get your
hands<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:56.280> because<00:00:56.910> he's<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.540> pro<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.170> that's

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
hands on because he's a pro and that's

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.660 
hands on because he's a pro and that's
just<00:00:58.560> how<00:00:58.830> the<00:00:58.890> world<00:00:58.950> works<00:00:59.340> they<00:00:59.580> have

so we basically set out to design the

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.890 
so we basically set out to design the
most<00:01:28.150> versatile<00:01:28.840> snowboard<00:01:29.470> on<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:30.370> market

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.020 
most versatile snowboard on the market
that<00:01:31.900> is<00:01:32.050> something<00:01:32.320> I<00:01:32.410> really<00:01:32.590> feel<00:01:32.920> like<00:01:33.030> we

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
that is something I really feel like we

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.260 
that is something I really feel like we
accomplished<00:01:34.600> with<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.140> new<00:01:35.260> media<00:01:35.590> blitz
