00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
tall and thin at the top so butt back

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.200 
tall and thin at the top so butt back
chest<00:01:42.030> down<00:01:42.799> push<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> heel<00:01:44.340> squeeze<00:01:44.909> your

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
chest down push to the heel squeeze your

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.999 
chest down push to the heel squeeze your
butt<00:01:45.390> cheeks<00:01:45.420> nice<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.320> tall<00:01:46.500> thin<00:01:46.799> at<00:01:46.950> the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
butt cheeks nice and tall thin at the

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.310 
butt cheeks nice and tall thin at the
top<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.880> again<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.360> got<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.570> keep<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:48.990> pulled

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
top so again you got to keep this pulled

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.719 
top so again you got to keep this pulled
in<00:01:49.500> if<00:01:49.619> you're<00:01:49.770> not<00:01:49.799> strong<00:01:50.250> with<00:01:50.399> your<00:01:50.549> upper

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
in if you're not strong with your upper

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.850 
in if you're not strong with your upper
back<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:50.939> you're<00:01:51.210> lazy<00:01:51.390> with<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.930> as<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.110> come

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
back and you're lazy with it as you come

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.950 
back and you're lazy with it as you come
down<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.460> kettlebell<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.210> going<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.810> move

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
down the kettlebell is going to move

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.990 
down the kettlebell is going to move
around<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.710> got<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.950> row<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.460> nice<00:01:56.729> and

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
around so you got to row it in nice and

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.490 
around so you got to row it in nice and
tight<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.329> keep<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.659> upper<00:01:57.899> back<00:01:58.020> strong

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
tight and keep that upper back strong

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.560 
tight and keep that upper back strong
and<00:01:58.799> that's<00:01:59.280> going<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.610> prevent<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.060> lot<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.329> the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
and that's going to prevent a lot of the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.959 
and that's going to prevent a lot of the
rounding<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.290> happens<00:02:01.799> when<00:02:02.610> we<00:02:02.729> do<00:02:02.939> this

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
rounding that happens when we do this

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.520 
rounding that happens when we do this
movement<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:03.899> pulling<00:02:04.829> in<00:02:04.950> strong<00:02:05.280> but<00:02:06.090> back

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
movement so pulling in strong but back

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.320 
movement so pulling in strong but back
coming<00:02:07.530> back<00:02:07.680> up<00:02:07.920> squeezing<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.700> glutes<00:02:09.030> nice

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
coming back up squeezing the glutes nice

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.070 
coming back up squeezing the glutes nice
and<00:02:09.599> tall<00:02:09.780> thin<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.890> that's<00:02:11.430> pretty

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
and tall thin so that's pretty

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.230 
and tall thin so that's pretty
 again<00:02:12.650> it's<00:02:12.800> really<00:02:13.310> straightforward

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
 again it's really straightforward

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.630 
 again it's really straightforward
exercise<00:02:14.870> as<00:02:15.620> long<00:02:15.890> as<00:02:16.040> you're<00:02:16.160> focusing<00:02:16.520> on

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
exercise as long as you're focusing on

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.460 
exercise as long as you're focusing on
keeping<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.060> pulled<00:02:17.420> in<00:02:17.540> nice<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.020> tight<00:02:18.050> as

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
keeping that pulled in nice and tight as

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.790 
keeping that pulled in nice and tight as
you're<00:02:19.310> doing<00:02:19.460> that<00:02:19.640> hip<00:02:20.000> hinge<00:02:20.270> then<00:02:20.930> you

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
you're doing that hip hinge then you

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.130 
you're doing that hip hinge then you
really<00:02:22.160> can't<00:02:22.400> do<00:02:22.610> it<00:02:22.640> wrong<00:02:22.970> so<00:02:23.630> again

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
really can't do it wrong so again

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.900 
really can't do it wrong so again
something<00:02:24.440> else<00:02:24.680> that<00:02:24.950> will<00:02:25.070> help<00:02:25.250> with<00:02:25.730> this

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
something else that will help with this

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.850 
something else that will help with this
movement<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:26.600> want<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.170> make<00:02:27.290> sure<00:02:27.320> that

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
movement you want to make sure that

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.970 
movement you want to make sure that
you're<00:02:28.010> not<00:02:28.250> just<00:02:29.030> leaning<00:02:29.810> forward<00:02:30.560> with<00:02:30.590> it

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
you're not just leaning forward with it

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.830 
you're not just leaning forward with it
and<00:02:31.070> hinging<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:32.240> want<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.450> make<00:02:32.540> sure<00:02:32.570> that

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
and hinging you want to make sure that

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.690 
and hinging you want to make sure that
you're<00:02:33.050> actually<00:02:33.440> pushing<00:02:33.830> your<00:02:34.220> butt<00:02:34.400> back
