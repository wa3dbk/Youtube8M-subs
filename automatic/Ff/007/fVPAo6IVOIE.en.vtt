 stolen by a nuclear warhead expert 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:14.359
 Yesterday from reliable sources we learned 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:17.130
 that she arrived on american soil 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.949

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.359
 smoking debris 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.019
 the task is very difficult 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:25.609

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.839

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:44.729

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:45.769

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.410
 teacher of the year I am not using weapons 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.760
 so put on artisanal explosives 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.600
 which I made my own 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 but no no no this is such a joke 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.560
 we should not underestimate it 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.710
 man and did not provide a gift 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.049

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:13.950

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.950

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.800

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.710
 Tymoshenko's palette 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.440
 This year he said that he could not stand 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.510
 Prosperous body armor

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.470

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.470
 his body 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.210
 here it should take time to find out 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.150
 where women haven't painted it already 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.900

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.060

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.060
