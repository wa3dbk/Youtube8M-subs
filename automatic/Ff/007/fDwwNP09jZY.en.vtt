the way that that's gonna Express and
manifest<00:00:31.280> itself<00:00:31.610> in<00:00:31.789> the<00:00:31.820> game<00:00:32.029> and<00:00:32.300> there

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
manifest itself in the game and there

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.090

will<00:00:32.480> affect<00:00:33.110> that<00:00:33.350> that's<00:00:33.530> gonna<00:00:33.650> have<00:00:33.920> on

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
will affect that that's gonna have on

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.920 
will affect that that's gonna have on
the<00:00:34.370> chief<00:00:34.610> and<00:00:34.910> his<00:00:35.090> relationship<00:00:35.750> with

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
the chief and his relationship with

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.530 
the chief and his relationship with
Cortana<00:00:36.430> is<00:00:37.430> gonna<00:00:37.610> be<00:00:37.730> pretty<00:00:37.850> significant

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
Cortana is gonna be pretty significant

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.240 
Cortana is gonna be pretty significant
she<00:00:38.930> is<00:00:39.050> dealing<00:00:39.320> with<00:00:39.530> her<00:00:39.890> her<00:00:40.190> own

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
she is dealing with her her own

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.299 
she is dealing with her her own
mortality<00:00:40.940> and<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:41.540> I<00:00:41.570> think<00:00:42.040> some<00:00:43.040> of<00:00:43.070> that

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
mortality and so I think some of that

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.400 
mortality and so I think some of that
maybe<00:00:43.580> makes<00:00:43.910> her<00:00:44.059> a<00:00:44.090> little<00:00:44.239> more<00:00:44.510> selfish<00:00:44.960> so

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
maybe makes her a little more selfish so

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.320 
maybe makes her a little more selfish so
one<00:00:45.590> just<00:00:45.620> be<00:00:45.890> in<00:00:46.040> a<00:00:46.280> sort<00:00:46.430> of<00:00:46.550> side<00:00:46.760> story<00:00:47.150> or

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
one just be in a sort of side story or

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.180 
one just be in a sort of side story or
an<00:00:47.449> incident<00:00:47.780> that<00:00:48.470> would<00:00:48.559> be<00:00:48.680> quarter<00:00:49.070> the

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
an incident that would be quarter the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.590 
an incident that would be quarter the
bigger<00:00:49.430> events<00:00:49.850> that<00:00:50.000> are<00:00:50.059> happening<00:00:50.150> in<00:00:50.510> the

really understand what it means for

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.530 
really understand what it means for
really<00:02:11.950> his<00:02:12.100> closest<00:02:12.610> friend<00:02:12.880> and<00:02:13.000> Ally<00:02:13.360> and

whatever that relationship is which I

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.550 
whatever that relationship is which I
think<00:02:15.820> neither<00:02:16.510> of<00:02:16.750> them<00:02:16.900> could<00:02:17.110> characterize

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
think neither of them could characterize

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.670 
think neither of them could characterize
easily<00:02:18.420> except<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.540> say<00:02:19.720> that<00:02:19.930> they've<00:02:20.260> been

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
easily except to say that they've been

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.160 
easily except to say that they've been
the<00:02:20.830> closest<00:02:21.220> partners<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.870> either<00:02:23.080> of

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
the closest partners that either of

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.800 
the closest partners that either of
experience

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.700 

ever<00:02:30.180> she's<00:02:31.180> also<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:31.510> digital<00:02:31.960> character<00:02:32.170> and

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
ever she's also a digital character and

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.400 
ever she's also a digital character and
so<00:02:33.190> when<00:02:33.370> faced<00:02:33.730> with<00:02:33.880> sort<00:02:34.240> of<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.450> very<00:02:34.960> human

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
so when faced with sort of a very human

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.800 
so when faced with sort of a very human
condition<00:02:35.920> which<00:02:36.130> is<00:02:36.280> mortality<00:02:37.030> right<00:02:37.570> how

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810
