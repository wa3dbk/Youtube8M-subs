00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.920 
course you won't beat this game in a day
because<00:00:26.760> there<00:00:27.119> are<00:00:27.210> all<00:00:27.359> these<00:00:27.689> new<00:00:27.900> things

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
because there are all these new things

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.439 
because there are all these new things
that<00:00:28.320> appear<00:00:28.619> every<00:00:29.189> day<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.970> game<00:00:30.150> knows

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
that appear every day and the game knows

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.120 
that appear every day and the game knows
what<00:00:30.689> time<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.199> because<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.890> games

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
what time it is because of the games

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.910 
what time it is because of the games
virtual<00:00:32.550> clock<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.809> every<00:00:34.260> day<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.440> can<00:00:34.739> come

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
virtual clock so every day you can come

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.709 
virtual clock so every day you can come
to<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.160> store<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.700> see<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.969> new<00:00:36.149> things<00:00:36.450> there

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719

and<00:00:36.899> buy<00:00:37.260> them<00:00:37.530> with<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> money<00:00:38.129> you've<00:00:38.340> made

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
and buy them with the money you've made

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.190 
and buy them with the money you've made
to<00:00:38.969> bring<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.270> home<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.719> then<00:00:39.899> your<00:00:40.050> home

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
to bring it home and then your home

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.650 
to bring it home and then your home
looks<00:00:40.410> nicer<00:00:40.710> there's<00:00:41.610> way<00:00:41.969> more<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.570> than

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
looks nicer there's way more to it than

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.799 
looks nicer there's way more to it than
that<00:00:42.719> but<00:00:43.230> that's<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.010> basic<00:00:44.190> explanation

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
that but that's the basic explanation

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.450 
that but that's the basic explanation
there<00:00:45.809> are<00:00:46.050> changes<00:00:46.500> from<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> gamecube<00:00:47.219> game

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
there are changes from the gamecube game

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.459 
there are changes from the gamecube game
we<00:00:47.910> have<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.210> cylinder<00:00:48.870> looking<00:00:49.230> world

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
we have this cylinder looking world

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.920 
we have this cylinder looking world
instead<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> overhead<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:51.149> looks<00:00:51.539> weird

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
instead of the overhead it looks weird

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.139 
instead of the overhead it looks weird
but<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:52.469> obviously<00:00:52.980> take<00:00:53.340> advantage<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
but it's obviously take advantage of the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.299 
but it's obviously take advantage of the
dual<00:00:54.420> screen<00:00:54.780> gimmick<00:00:55.260> because<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.070> top

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
dual screen gimmick because the top

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.160 
dual screen gimmick because the top
screen<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:56.850> sky<00:00:57.420> where<00:00:57.840> balloon

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
screen is just sky where balloon

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.619 
screen is just sky where balloon
sometimes<00:00:58.620> fly<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.579> new<00:00:59.969> year<00:01:00.210> we<00:01:00.510> see

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
sometimes fly and that new year we see

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.860 
sometimes fly and that new year we see
fireworks<00:01:01.129> but<00:01:02.129> why<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.609> heck<00:01:03.120> does<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.629> wii

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
fireworks but why the heck does the wii

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.710 
fireworks but why the heck does the wii
version<00:01:04.080> also<00:01:04.470> cylinder<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:05.970> one<00:01:06.270> screen

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
version also cylinder it's on one screen

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.740 
version also cylinder it's on one screen
and<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.619> 3ds<00:01:07.950> version<00:01:08.040> will<00:01:08.760> probably<00:01:09.570> keep

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
and the 3ds version will probably keep

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.510 
and the 3ds version will probably keep
everything<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.380> top<00:01:10.650> screen<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.400> look
