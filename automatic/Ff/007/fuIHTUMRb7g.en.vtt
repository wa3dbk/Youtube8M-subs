and game Bynum school at 12 I don't

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.369 
and game Bynum school at 12 I don't
remember<00:00:59.760> what<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.120> rebounds<00:01:00.629> were<00:01:00.780> but<00:01:01.050> once

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
that he's been added to the Lakers

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.670 
that he's been added to the Lakers
roster<00:01:33.180> seeing<00:01:33.570> where<00:01:33.750> he<00:01:33.900> gives<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.439> team

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
and night out and I think it's pretty

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.249 
and night out and I think it's pretty
safe<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.090> say<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.750> guys<00:01:39.930> pretty

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
safe to say that the guys pretty

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.469 
safe to say that the guys pretty
overrated<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.979> if<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.820> don't<00:01:42.030> want<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.360> go

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
overrated and if you don't want to go

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.440 
overrated and if you don't want to go
with<00:01:42.689> Dwight<00:01:42.930> Howard<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.619> strong<00:01:44.430> second<00:01:45.149> at

with Dwight Howard a strong second at

I'm gonna have to go with Blake Griffin
on<00:03:34.940> this<00:03:35.180> one<00:03:35.389> I<00:03:35.600> know<00:03:36.200> what<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.560> saying<00:03:36.829> but

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
on this one I know what you saying but

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.460 
on this one I know what you saying but
he<00:03:37.100> dunks<00:03:37.489> on<00:03:37.700> everyone<00:03:38.569> and<00:03:38.810> that's<00:03:39.319> the

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
he dunks on everyone and that's the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.800 
he dunks on everyone and that's the
reason<00:03:39.769> why<00:03:39.950> I'm<00:03:40.760> saying<00:03:41.000> his<00:03:41.090> offensive<00:03:41.780> game

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
reason why I'm saying his offensive game

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.650 
reason why I'm saying his offensive game
isn't<00:03:42.470> as<00:03:42.590> polished<00:03:43.010> as<00:03:43.400> it<00:03:44.150> could<00:03:44.420> be

isn't as polished as it could be

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.410 
isn't as polished as it could be
compared<00:03:45.620> to<00:03:45.859> other<00:03:46.069> young<00:03:46.579> power<00:03:46.790> force<00:03:47.209> like

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
compared to other young power force like

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.040 
compared to other young power force like

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
Kevin Love who don't get as much to

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.640 
Kevin Love who don't get as much to
shine<00:03:51.180> as<00:03:51.390> them<00:03:51.630> because<00:03:52.230> they<00:03:52.320> don't<00:03:52.500> have

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
shine as them because they don't have

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.560 
shine as them because they don't have
the<00:03:52.800> athletic<00:03:53.610> ability<00:03:53.730> at<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.330> plate

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
the athletic ability at the plate

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.750
