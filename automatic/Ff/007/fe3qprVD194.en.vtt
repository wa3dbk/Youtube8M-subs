 my perfect base needs a 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:44.190
 primer then I will apply a primer 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:48.920

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.909

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:26.820
 from the center of ananda blend on the sides of the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:30.210

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.840
 super soft brush with a powder 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.570

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.010

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.130
 blush which gives a blushing effect there 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.010
