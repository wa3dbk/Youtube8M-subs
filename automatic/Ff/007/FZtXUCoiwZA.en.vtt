00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
just because I didn't have the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.090 
just because I didn't have the
opportunity<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.930> swatch<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.680> two<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.070> see

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
opportunity to swatch the two to see

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.819 
opportunity to swatch the two to see
like<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.789> really<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.090> much<00:01:00.239> darker<00:01:00.870> but<00:01:01.559> I

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
like is it really that much darker but I

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.349 
like is it really that much darker but I
have<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> feeling<00:01:02.489> once<00:01:02.730> it's<00:01:02.879> available<00:01:03.059> in

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
have a feeling once it's available in

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.840 
have a feeling once it's available in
stores<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.870> will<00:01:04.019> probably<00:01:04.379> buy<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.159> one<00:01:05.400> also

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
stores I will probably buy that one also

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.510 
stores I will probably buy that one also
because<00:01:06.650> let's<00:01:07.650> say<00:01:07.740> say<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.070> have<00:01:08.340> no

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
because let's say say I have no

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.510 
because let's say say I have no
self-control<00:01:09.049> so<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.229> packaging<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.070> just

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
self-control so the packaging is just

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.950 
self-control so the packaging is just
like<00:01:11.760> all<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.119> their<00:01:12.270> ambient<00:01:12.750> lighting

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
like all of their ambient lighting

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.260 
like all of their ambient lighting
products<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.400> wanted<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.790> say<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.240> was

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
products and I wanted to say it was

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.149 
products and I wanted to say it was
fifty<00:01:15.840> dollars<00:01:16.140> maybe<00:01:16.560> fifty<00:01:16.979> two<00:01:17.130> dollars

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
fifty dollars maybe fifty two dollars

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.510 
fifty dollars maybe fifty two dollars
which<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.270> quite<00:01:18.630> pricey<00:01:19.110> for<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.680> bronzer<00:01:20.310> if

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
which is quite pricey for a bronzer if

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.090 
which is quite pricey for a bronzer if
you<00:01:20.640> ask<00:01:20.850> me<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:21.960> hourglass<00:01:22.530> which<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.070> a

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
you ask me but it's hourglass which is a

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.870 
you ask me but it's hourglass which is a
very<00:01:23.340> prestigious<00:01:23.970> brand<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.950> hope<00:01:26.610> that

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
very prestigious brand and I hope that

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.480 
very prestigious brand and I hope that
it's<00:01:27.030> worth<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.689> guess<00:01:27.900> we'll<00:01:28.140> see<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:29.250> my

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
it's worth it I guess we'll see so my

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.069 
it's worth it I guess we'll see so my
first<00:01:29.759> impressions<00:01:30.270> without<00:01:30.540> putting<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.930> on

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
first impressions without putting it on

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.620 
first impressions without putting it on
my<00:01:31.229> cheeks<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.460> very<00:01:32.759> very<00:01:33.150> pretty

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
my cheeks is that it is very very pretty

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.770 
my cheeks is that it is very very pretty
so<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.439> has<00:01:34.650> like<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.100> bronze<00:01:35.430> color<00:01:35.780> swirled

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
so it has like the bronze color swirled

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.990 
so it has like the bronze color swirled
in<00:01:37.049> with<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.409> ambient<00:01:37.770> light<00:01:38.100> powder<00:01:38.610> which

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
in with the ambient light powder which

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.399 
in with the ambient light powder which
is<00:01:39.030> what<00:01:39.390> all<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.570> their<00:01:39.810> ambient<00:01:40.229> lighting

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
is what all of their ambient lighting

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.950 
is what all of their ambient lighting
products<00:01:41.009> look<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.600> and<00:01:42.600> then<00:01:42.810> when<00:01:42.930> I

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
products look like and then when I

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.469 
products look like and then when I
swatch<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.680> my<00:01:43.890> finger<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.729> looks<00:01:45.090> like

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
swatch it on my finger it looks like

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.590 
swatch it on my finger it looks like
this<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:46.079> looks<00:01:46.700> slightly<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:47.970> orange

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
this so it looks slightly on the orange

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600 
this so it looks slightly on the orange
side<00:01:48.780> which<00:01:49.409> kind<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.950> turned<00:01:50.250> me<00:01:50.399> off<00:01:50.430> a

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
side which kind of turned me off a

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.270 
side which kind of turned me off a
little<00:01:51.030> bit<00:01:51.320> and<00:01:52.320> another<00:01:52.619> thing<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.189> I'm

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
little bit and another thing that I'm

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.760 
little bit and another thing that I'm
kind<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.149> skeptical<00:01:54.570> about<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.140> there<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.560> like

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
kind of skeptical about is there is like

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.959 
kind of skeptical about is there is like
