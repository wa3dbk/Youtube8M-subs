00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.940 
it that way is it I mean it's not like
my<00:01:23.580> bees<00:01:23.909> get<00:01:24.150> some<00:01:24.360> sort<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.659> emblem<00:01:25.290> title<00:01:25.799> or

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
my bees get some sort of emblem title or

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.010 
my bees get some sort of emblem title or
anything<00:01:26.520> else<00:01:26.759> case<00:01:26.939> as<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.119> couple<00:01:27.509> kills<00:01:27.810> and

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
anything else case as a couple kills and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.870 
anything else case as a couple kills and
an<00:01:28.110> EMP<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.040> really<00:01:29.310> don't<00:01:29.430> think<00:01:29.579> you

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
an EMP so I really don't think you

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.310 
an EMP so I really don't think you
should<00:01:29.909> adjust<00:01:30.150> your<00:01:30.479> gameplay<00:01:30.900> adjust<00:01:31.200> to

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
should adjust your gameplay adjust to

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.260 
should adjust your gameplay adjust to
get<00:01:31.470> one<00:01:31.740> especially<00:01:32.369> because<00:01:32.850> even<00:01:33.150> why

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
get one especially because even why

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.330 
get one especially because even why
campaign<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.990> won't<00:01:34.259> be<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.439> easy<00:01:34.710> part<00:01:35.130> it

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
campaign it won't be that easy part it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.580 
campaign it won't be that easy part it
in<00:01:35.729> my<00:01:35.850> opinion<00:01:36.150> if<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.720> want<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.049> get<00:01:37.170> an<00:01:37.320> MOA

in my opinion if you want to get an MOA
be<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.220> like<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.520> rush<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.939> should<00:01:39.150> never

focus<00:02:00.840> too<00:02:01.170> much<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.649> because<00:02:02.310> in<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.549> long

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
focus too much on it because in the long

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.810 
focus too much on it because in the long
run<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:03.090> will<00:02:03.149> be<00:02:03.360> very<00:02:03.780> frustrating<00:02:04.430> so<00:02:05.430> now

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
run it will be very frustrating so now

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.089 
run it will be very frustrating so now
that<00:02:05.850> we<00:02:06.119> cover<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.740> psychological<00:02:07.740> part<00:02:07.770> of

don't want to

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.009 
don't want to
your<00:02:14.159> game<00:02:14.340> sell<00:02:14.610> too<00:02:14.760> much<00:02:14.940> there<00:02:15.750> are<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.870> few

your game sell too much there are a few
things<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.620> should<00:02:16.800> take<00:02:16.980> into

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
things that you should take into

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.130 
things that you should take into
consideration<00:02:18.030> most<00:02:18.599> importantly

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
consideration most importantly

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.960 
consideration most importantly
especially<00:02:19.950> if<00:02:20.040> you're<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.220> rusher<00:02:20.730> you

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
especially if you're a rusher you

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.430 
especially if you're a rusher you
probably<00:02:21.209> won't<00:02:21.540> use<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.959> specialist

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
probably won't use the specialist

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.710 
probably won't use the specialist
package<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:23.370> is<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.610> very<00:02:23.819> solid<00:02:24.150> choice<00:02:24.360> even

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
package it is a very solid choice even

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.809

when<00:02:24.900> you're<00:02:25.049> not<00:02:25.110> going<00:02:25.500> for<00:02:25.650> mo<00:02:25.920> abs<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:26.730> it

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
when you're not going for mo abs so it

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.850

won't<00:02:27.060> be<00:02:27.209> that<00:02:27.239> bad<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.780> use<00:02:27.959> it<00:02:28.170> actually

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
won't be that bad to use it actually

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.770
