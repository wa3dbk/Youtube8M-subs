this is the one that we got off that we

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.310 
this is the one that we got off that we
haven't<00:00:26.400> actually<00:00:26.580> touched<00:00:27.060> yet<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.110> can

see the opening for the window is quite
large<00:00:32.540> when<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.690> take<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.200> garnish<00:00:34.890> piece

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.180 
and put on there are still quite a large
opening<00:00:39.300> there<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.199> have<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.559> trim<00:00:40.920> out

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
opening there that you have to trim out

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.479 
opening there that you have to trim out
with<00:00:41.970> a<00:00:42.000> wiper<00:00:42.500> which<00:00:43.500> if<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.980> can<00:00:44.129> avoid<00:00:44.280> that

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
with a wiper which if you can avoid that

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.850 
with a wiper which if you can avoid that
it<00:00:45.269> would<00:00:45.570> make<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.900> car<00:00:46.080> look<00:00:46.199> a<00:00:46.260> lot<00:00:46.470> better

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
it would make the car look a lot better

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.890 
it would make the car look a lot better

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
so what I'll come up with is fabricating

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.690 
so what I'll come up with is fabricating
a<00:00:53.480> fiberglass<00:00:54.480> window<00:00:54.930> channel<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
pebble channel inserts right up inside

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.170 
pebble channel inserts right up inside
and<00:01:00.690> disappears<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:02.309> peaceful<00:01:02.850> lights<00:01:03.030> you

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.359 
edge of that it makes a nice sanding
tool<00:02:03.549> and<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.600> way<00:02:04.720> we<00:02:04.869> use<00:02:05.140> that<00:02:05.710> as<00:02:05.950> finally

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
tool and the way we use that as finally

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.759 
tool and the way we use that as finally
sticking<00:02:06.880> it<00:02:06.970> on<00:02:07.119> into<00:02:07.539> the<00:02:07.659> door<00:02:07.869> work<00:02:08.050> we<00:02:08.530> can

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
sticking it on into the door work we can

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.320 
sticking it on into the door work we can
actually<00:02:09.660> sand<00:02:10.660> that<00:02:11.019> feet<00:02:11.410> flush<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.970> medal

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
actually sand that feet flush the medal

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.380 
actually sand that feet flush the medal
on<00:02:13.420> this<00:02:13.720> is<00:02:14.519> fairly<00:02:15.519> sturdy<00:02:15.819> so<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.299> would

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
on this is fairly sturdy so it would

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.199 
on this is fairly sturdy so it would
like<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.750> keep<00:02:16.959> a<00:02:17.080> nice<00:02:17.260> flat<00:02:17.620> finish<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:19.060> can
