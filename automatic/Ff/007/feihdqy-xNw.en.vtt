00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello everyone i'm berwick zen and behold 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.759
 who are ready sooner or later I will put 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.440
 apostles 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.750
 we know that I wanted to talk about a 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.599
 po of various arguments omone teheran noi 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.219
 then I am reflecting on one thing 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.619
 since I arrived at this 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.390
 conclusion we say recently I want 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.220
 share it with you to know what 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.180
 he thought of the etc etcetera 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.580
 etc 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.390
 then very often I see articles 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.789
 post or even things said with respect to 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.340
 different categories or visa of 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.890
 a recent post about a manager 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.809
 who had insulted his employee 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.180
 saying for the game so sterile and 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.980
 so it was a little bit one 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.739
 question of a milly minimum of a thousand 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.870
 quotation marks on the fact that he had 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.750
 mostly blame that person because 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.129
 she was a woman and had not been sympathetic 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.960
 with another woman 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.219
 I often see this as well 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.719
 when it comes to characters and afro 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.239
 descendants who for example support 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.550
 things of the league and things like that 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.710
 I initially thought it was 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.320
 normal that a person belonging to 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.360
 a discriminated category should not 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.900
 discriminate in turn other categories 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.520
 then I thought that was not how the 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.950
 my reasoning was wrong and therefore 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.200
 I thought it could happen now 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.090
 I came to the conclusion that 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.460
 according to me think that a person 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.350
 within my semi category 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.299
 discriminate for that category 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.799
 I know that maybe I'm a little kripke that 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.630
 ha maybe i am not clear enough 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.759
 you are right to expect me from that 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.979
 person regardless of behavior 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.150
 different in my opinion in part is one 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.490
 discrimination 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.520
 I'll give you an example if a woman for 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.329
 example uses a sexist attack in the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.100
 my comparisons 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.649
 according to me it is not right to give 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.930
 mostly blame that person alone 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.009
 as a woman because she perpetrates we say 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.630
 of the wrong things 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.310
 I think it's a bit discriminatory 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.110
 because I think a thought applies 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.759
 that in itself is discriminated against or 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.009
 consider a person only based on 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.990
 that category you 're black in the air 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.540
 necessarily one who fights for rights 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.520
 civilians or consider that that 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.079
 person only as a member of 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.300
 that category has already done 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.899
 certain achievements or have 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.450
 understood the importance 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.220
 and sensitized for other topics but 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.319
 I think this comes from one 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.239
 stereotype turn is that is one 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.129
 person then if we consider for 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.049
 example a woman we fight against it 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.540
 stereotype of the woman who must not 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.280
 becoming a mother is what he wants 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.989
 etcetera etc. we fight for that 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.879
 then we can't ask for it 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.340
 example to another woman to have 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.799
 certain behaviors because how 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.900
 we know machismo for example not 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.299
 it is that not only men do not have it 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.530
 that we consider all men 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.079
 chauvinists because there is male chauvinism 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.810
 there is patriarchy are of thoughts are 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:49.030
 of the ways in which they have been adopted are 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.799
 been educated to people in society 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.470
 and therefore in my opinion in certain subjects 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.959
 I don't think it's so absurd to think 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.519
 that many people saw for sure 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.920
 subjects their category was 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.810
 discriminated against we say we are lined up 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.159
 in a thousand quotes and maybe even a 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.980
 unconscious level on the part 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:08.079
 of the torturer in order to have gods 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.760
 earnings or for a thousand others 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.870
 reasons it seems to me something so 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.430
 impossible 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.379
 I'll give you a good example if for 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.180
 example a group of friends one makes one 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.769
 I say enough with a racist dome 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.760
 this joke is a little out of place 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.889
 etc. etc. 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.629
 it was part of the pain in the ass and this 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.190
 it also happens in society if one says 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.780
 sorry this thing is not between good 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:31.720
 maximum is labeled as 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:33.129
 pain in the ass therefore within a 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.049
 group does n't seem like that to me 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.829
 impossible for a person to say 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.199
 sorry 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.599
 to me it is not well and is simply co 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:42.609
 follow the group on one side I understand and 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.709
 I, too, remain a little bad for 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.510
 someone like you is in the house 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.459
 whistling does a bit like that 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.290
 so it's normal that you say cabbage you are 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.359
 in my same category because you do 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.079
 something bad for your own 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.909
 category 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.739
 however on the other side I understand that the 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:01.479
 discrimination is a thought pattern 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:03.699
 and is not tied to physicality then in 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:05.590
 consider that person who has 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:07.389
 understood the reasonings determined and 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.129
 so if he has deviated from a thought 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:11.109
 how can that be discriminatory? 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.970
 only in terms of wind a body 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:15.220
 feminine and therefore of scream and yes 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.349
 dismissed and condemned the patriarchy e 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.540
 things like that or it is 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.310
 black and therefore with damage 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.530
 discrimination in turn according 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.070
 me is a bit serious about it at the same 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.290
 way 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.300
 as you obviously said, hear 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.760
 disappointed if a representative of his 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.570
 same category hurts the 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.950
 own category 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.380
 but if we bring them there 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.360
 we fight against the desperate or 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.150
 that the woman must do so the gays must 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.190
 so the son must do so then 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.100
 we must also understand that that woman 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.960
 may be reflected in some other one 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.060
 something that is not good for us 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.730
 reverse old cards on the other side 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.920
 or don't fight on the right side 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.960
 and let's say but take the side of the 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.840
 winning because he doesn't give a damn 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.530
 fuck because he wants to win easy or things 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.720
 of this type 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.700
 I know that maybe I was unclear and 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.250
 you are right so if something is not there 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.540
 it is clear they are free and they are 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.220
 extremely available to answer you in 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.960
 comments so we clarify a little 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.220
 things if maybe I expressed myself badly 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.260
 very likely 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.480
 let me know what you think why 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.990
 I honestly didn't arrive right away 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.520
 to this this reasoning indeed 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.730
 I don't remember a scandal of scandal 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.350
 even that in high school is neither 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.620
 superior I had known a friend of 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:31.920
 a friend who was Jewish and was Nazi the 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:35.190
 I said veil, but I think about it 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.450
 but now perhaps I can understand to see 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.420
 I don't agree with the canteen 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.970
 absolutely this deployment though 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.160
 I understand it is so much to frame it in one 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.450
 less superficial manner bo let me 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.980
 know what you think 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.980
 we talk quietly together 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.740
