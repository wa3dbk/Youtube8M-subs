but<00:02:30.930> now<00:02:31.590> still<00:02:31.890> in<00:02:31.980> this<00:02:32.070> game<00:02:32.130> too<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.580> they

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
but now still in this game too and they

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.860 
but now still in this game too and they
still<00:02:32.790> kind<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:32.970> have<00:02:33.090> decimated<00:02:33.360> even<00:02:33.780> though

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
still kind of have decimated even though

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.210 
still kind of have decimated even though
they<00:02:33.959> see<00:02:34.200> make<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.500> scream<00:02:34.709> any<00:02:34.860> time<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.130> get
