00:00:05.298 --> 00:00:07.881
(somber music)

00:00:15.544 --> 00:00:17.211
- My diagnosis was a

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:23.872
filtrative astrocytoma

00:00:23.872 --> 00:00:25.872
brain tumor, inoperable.

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:35.707
It was suggested that I
stop the chemotherapy.

00:00:35.707 --> 00:00:40.235
It was too difficult and my
body wasn't reacting the way

00:00:40.235 --> 00:00:41.991
we had hoped to it.

00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:45.908
We did my MRI, and we
found significant growth.

00:00:48.907 --> 00:00:51.275
My doctor then classified it as

00:00:51.275 --> 00:00:54.247
a very aggressive astrocytoma.

00:00:54.247 --> 00:00:58.987
I listened to all the things
that hospice could bring me

00:00:58.987 --> 00:01:01.654
and it was just this "ah" moment

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:05.576
because everything that
I wanted in my life,

00:01:05.576 --> 00:01:09.267
for the rest of my life,
whatever that might be,

00:01:09.267 --> 00:01:11.100
were that memories and

00:01:12.795 --> 00:01:14.795
the pain free happiness.

00:01:16.815 --> 00:01:19.647
The things that I wanted to
be able to enjoy in my life,

00:01:19.647 --> 00:01:22.783
all of those things
have come with hospice.

00:01:22.783 --> 00:01:25.797
And I have been blessed with
the most amazing team of people

00:01:25.797 --> 00:01:27.280
that get that.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.678
I have such supportive people
in my nurse and my doctor.

00:01:31.678 --> 00:01:34.643
People that have just
the most wonderful view.

00:01:34.643 --> 00:01:38.367
I have a very wonderful
volunteer that comes to see me.

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:41.034
Rebecca is my massage therapist.

00:01:42.207 --> 00:01:43.963
I mean, I just got it all.

00:01:43.963 --> 00:01:47.314
You know, it's like, sit
back and I can have this

00:01:47.314 --> 00:01:49.814
wonderful final months of life

00:01:51.562 --> 00:01:53.422
with all of these resources.

00:01:53.422 --> 00:01:56.014
The reality is, I'm probably
going to have a few months

00:01:56.014 --> 00:01:59.681
of pain free existence,
make great memories,

00:02:01.167 --> 00:02:06.147
and time with my children,
time with the people I love,

00:02:06.147 --> 00:02:10.255
and the people that are supporting hospice

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:13.792
are allowing me to have that time.

00:02:13.792 --> 00:02:17.641
In my gut, in what I see,

00:02:17.641 --> 00:02:19.740
this is my last summer

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.648
and I just really want it
to be the best summer ever

00:02:22.648 --> 00:02:23.898
for everybody.
