the button here which is going to switch
through<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.719> different<00:01:26.109> modes<00:01:26.289> and<00:01:26.709> then

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:27.249 
through the different modes and then

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:29.279 
through the different modes and then
you'll<00:01:27.459> be<00:01:27.520> able<00:01:27.609> to<00:01:27.999> save<00:01:28.329> whichever<00:01:28.810> setting

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
you'll be able to save whichever setting

you'll be able to save whichever setting
you<00:01:29.409> want<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:29.770> on<00:01:29.889> that<00:01:30.100> and<00:01:30.310> quickly<00:01:30.759> go<00:01:30.939> back

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
you want to on that and quickly go back

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.779 
you want to on that and quickly go back
to<00:01:31.450> it<00:01:31.659> it's<00:01:32.560> constructed<00:01:33.189> from<00:01:33.369> a<00:01:33.549> narrow

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
to it it's constructed from a narrow

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.839 
to it it's constructed from a narrow
grade<00:01:34.149> aluminum<00:01:34.749> alloy<00:01:35.679> so<00:01:35.920> it's<00:01:36.039> going<00:01:36.249> to<00:01:36.310> be

00:01:36.839 --> 00:01:36.849 
grade aluminum alloy so it's going to be

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:39.660 
grade aluminum alloy so it's going to be
a<00:01:36.880> really<00:01:37.779> light<00:01:38.139> weight<00:01:38.279> for<00:01:39.279> a<00:01:39.310> flashlight

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
a really light weight for a flashlight

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.269 
a really light weight for a flashlight
this<00:01:40.060> big<00:01:40.329> with<00:01:40.569> as<00:01:40.779> many<00:01:41.200> lumens<00:01:41.740> as<00:01:41.889> it<00:01:42.069> does

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:42.279 
this big with as many lumens as it does

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:45.389 
this big with as many lumens as it does
it's<00:01:42.639> going<00:01:42.849> to<00:01:42.939> be<00:01:43.060> extremely<00:01:43.450> durable<00:01:44.399> you

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
it's going to be extremely durable you

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.279 
it's going to be extremely durable you
you're<00:01:46.029> not<00:01:46.209> going<00:01:46.389> to<00:01:46.450> really<00:01:46.599> be<00:01:46.959> able<00:01:46.990> to

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
you're not going to really be able to

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:48.659 
you're not going to really be able to
break<00:01:47.529> this<00:01:47.709> at<00:01:47.889> all<00:01:48.009> so<00:01:48.189> it's<00:01:48.310> going<00:01:48.459> to<00:01:48.520> be<00:01:48.639> a

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:48.669 
break this at all so it's going to be a

sides you can kind of see here I have a

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.729 
sides you can kind of see here I have a
scope<00:02:37.620> on<00:02:37.829> this<00:02:38.040> so<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:39.049> ideally<00:02:40.049> I<00:02:40.290> would<00:02:40.409> not

scope on this so I ideally I would not

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.490 
scope on this so I ideally I would not
want<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.040> top<00:02:41.280> mount<00:02:41.549> because<00:02:41.849> that<00:02:42.150> would

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
want to top mount because that would

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.170 
want to top mount because that would

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.190 
switch the modes on it you always have
the<00:03:11.970> option<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.450> buying<00:03:12.629> some<00:03:12.959> kind<00:03:13.139> of

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
the option of buying some kind of

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.839 
the option of buying some kind of
pressure<00:03:13.409> switch<00:03:13.920> which<00:03:14.220> is<00:03:14.370> going<00:03:14.519> to<00:03:14.579> give

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
pressure switch which is going to give

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.699 
pressure switch which is going to give
you<00:03:15.000> an<00:03:15.090> easier<00:03:15.480> connection<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.349> the<00:03:16.500> light

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
you an easier connection to the light

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.470 
you an easier connection to the light
and<00:03:16.739> be<00:03:17.129> able<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.519> handle<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:18.060> little<00:03:18.239> bit

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
and be able to handle it a little bit

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.240 
and be able to handle it a little bit
better<00:03:18.629> about<00:03:19.049> switching<00:03:19.560> through<00:03:19.829> the<00:03:20.010> modes

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
better about switching through the modes

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.400 
better about switching through the modes
so<00:03:20.639> you<00:03:21.090> always<00:03:21.299> have<00:03:21.599> that<00:03:21.629> option<00:03:21.989> i

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
so you always have that option i

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.430 
so you always have that option i
definitely<00:03:22.799> recommend<00:03:22.919> it<00:03:23.459> for<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.440> tactical

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
definitely recommend it for a tactical

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.319 
definitely recommend it for a tactical
use<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.769> pressure<00:03:26.160> switch<00:03:26.459> is<00:03:26.609> definitely

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
use a pressure switch is definitely

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.360 
use a pressure switch is definitely
helpful<00:03:27.629> but<00:03:28.049> i<00:03:28.290> just<00:03:28.799> wanted<00:03:29.099> to<00:03:29.190> quickly

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370
