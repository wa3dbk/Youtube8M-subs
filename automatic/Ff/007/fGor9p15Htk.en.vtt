on<00:00:53.350> size<00:00:53.680> but<00:00:54.129> it's<00:00:54.519> waterproof<00:00:55.359> so<00:00:55.870> that

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
on size but it's waterproof so that

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.930 
on size but it's waterproof so that

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
size although the s4 is a little bit

you<00:02:21.079> can<00:02:21.230> see<00:02:21.500> here<00:02:21.829> it<00:02:21.980> extends<00:02:22.760> beyond<00:02:23.060> the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
you can see here it extends beyond the

you can see here it extends beyond the
normal<00:02:23.870> s4<00:02:24.319> it's<00:02:24.769> a<00:02:24.829> little<00:02:24.890> bit<00:02:25.040> more<00:02:25.280> wider

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
normal s4 it's a little bit more wider

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.240 
normal s4 it's a little bit more wider
not<00:02:26.390> by<00:02:26.629> much<00:02:26.870> but<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:27.230> little<00:02:27.290> bit<00:02:27.650> but<00:02:28.129> it's

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
not by much but a little bit but it's

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.890 
not by much but a little bit but it's
definitely<00:02:28.400> a<00:02:28.610> little<00:02:28.700> bit<00:02:28.909> taller<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.720> I've

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
definitely a little bit taller and I've

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.759 
definitely a little bit taller and I've
got<00:02:30.079> my<00:02:30.230> finger<00:02:30.680> holding<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.430> base<00:02:31.610> down

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
got my finger holding the base down

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.199 
got my finger holding the base down
let's<00:02:33.769> take<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:33.980> look<00:02:34.190> at<00:02:34.310> why<00:02:34.489> it<00:02:34.549> probably<00:02:35.090> is

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
let's take a look at why it probably is

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.289 
let's take a look at why it probably is
a<00:02:35.239> little<00:02:35.450> bit<00:02:35.540> taller<00:02:35.569> what<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:37.549> Samsung

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
a little bit taller what the Samsung

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.300 
a little bit taller what the Samsung
folks<00:02:38.569> have<00:02:38.720> done<00:02:38.750> is<00:02:39.109> they<00:02:39.290> made<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.799> active

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
folks have done is they made the active

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.280 
folks have done is they made the active
so<00:02:40.549> that<00:02:40.730> can<00:02:40.879> take<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.299> little<00:02:41.450> bit<00:02:41.659> more<00:02:41.840> abuse

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
so that can take a little bit more abuse

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.789 
so that can take a little bit more abuse
than<00:02:42.319> the<00:02:42.680> plain<00:02:43.340> Jane<00:02:44.049> samsung<00:02:45.049> galaxy<00:02:45.440> s4

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.289 
about the same the difference is is like
I<00:03:45.530> said<00:03:45.739> as<00:03:45.829> reinforcements<00:03:46.790> here<00:03:46.940> to<00:03:47.180> the

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
I said as reinforcements here to the

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.509 
I said as reinforcements here to the
edges<00:03:47.690> hopefully<00:03:48.440> if<00:03:48.590> this<00:03:48.769> does<00:03:49.010> get<00:03:49.220> dropped

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
edges hopefully if this does get dropped

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.900 
edges hopefully if this does get dropped
it<00:03:49.819> will<00:03:50.150> hit<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:51.019> heavier<00:03:52.010> edges<00:03:52.340> first<00:03:52.579> I

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
it will hit the heavier edges first I

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.089 
it will hit the heavier edges first I
think<00:03:53.239> that's<00:03:53.359> kind<00:03:53.629> of<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.810> idea<00:03:53.840> here<00:03:54.440> so

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
think that's kind of the idea here so

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:56.920 
think that's kind of the idea here so
you<00:03:55.760> can<00:03:55.909> see<00:03:55.940> here<00:03:56.299> one<00:03:56.569> other<00:03:56.750> major

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
you can see here one other major

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.099 
you can see here one other major

and<00:04:06.739> protected<00:04:07.669> from<00:04:08.030> water<00:04:08.299> so<00:04:08.659> it's<00:04:08.810> got<00:04:08.959> a

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.559

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
little bit of a little gasket on it so

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.619 
little bit of a little gasket on it so
you<00:04:11.690> can<00:04:11.810> put<00:04:11.959> that<00:04:12.040> in<00:04:13.040> there<00:04:13.669> and<00:04:13.819> then<00:04:14.449> you

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
you can put that in there and then you

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.779 
you can put that in there and then you
should<00:04:14.840> be<00:04:14.959> able<00:04:15.019> to<00:04:15.199> dunk<00:04:15.470> it<00:04:15.680> in<00:04:15.859> water<00:04:15.889> which

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
about a meter or so so you want to it's

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.969 
about a meter or so so you want to it's
not<00:04:32.660> something<00:04:32.930> you<00:04:32.960> want<00:04:33.080> to<00:04:33.199> dunk<00:04:33.410> for<00:04:33.770> long

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979

not something you want to dunk for long
periods<00:04:34.009> of<00:04:34.460> time<00:04:34.639> in<00:04:35.289> deep<00:04:36.289> water<00:04:36.770> but<00:04:37.190> it's

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
periods of time in deep water but it's

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.600 
periods of time in deep water but it's
good<00:04:37.639> if<00:04:38.419> you're<00:04:38.600> getting<00:04:38.750> splashed<00:04:39.139> upon<00:04:39.610> and

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
good if you're getting splashed upon and

good if you're getting splashed upon and
I<00:04:41.060> like<00:04:41.270> circus<00:04:41.720> stuff<00:04:41.960> when<00:04:42.110> we<00:04:42.139> dumped<00:04:42.560> it

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650

into a base of water and it seemed

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.950 
into a base of water and it seemed

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.010 
pretty comfortable that if it does get

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.310 
pretty comfortable that if it does get
dropped<00:07:07.340> it's<00:07:08.300> going<00:07:08.480> to<00:07:08.570> hopefully<00:07:08.750> survive

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:09.320 
dropped it's going to hopefully survive

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.870 
dropped it's going to hopefully survive
and<00:07:09.740> we'll<00:07:10.280> be<00:07:10.430> in<00:07:10.610> good<00:07:11.380> good<00:07:12.380> hands<00:07:12.740> so<00:07:13.100> I'll

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:13.880 
and we'll be in good good hands so I'll

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.670 
and we'll be in good good hands so I'll
let<00:07:14.090> you<00:07:14.210> know<00:07:14.270> when<00:07:14.510> we<00:07:14.570> find<00:07:14.870> out<00:07:15.110> if<00:07:15.290> we<00:07:15.440> drop

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 
let you know when we find out if we drop

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.130 
let you know when we find out if we drop
it<00:07:15.920> and<00:07:16.010> break<00:07:16.310> it<00:07:16.340> and<00:07:16.550> it<00:07:17.210> does<00:07:17.570> not<00:07:17.690> hold<00:07:17.930> up

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:18.140 
it and break it and it does not hold up

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.450 
it and break it and it does not hold up
i<00:07:18.290> guess<00:07:18.440> that<00:07:18.680> can<00:07:18.830> be<00:07:18.890> a<00:07:18.980> whole<00:07:19.130> nother<00:07:19.280> video

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:19.460 
i guess that can be a whole nother video

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.430 
i guess that can be a whole nother video
