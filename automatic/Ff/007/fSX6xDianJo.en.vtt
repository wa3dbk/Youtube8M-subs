incipient phases of construction we're

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.629 
incipient phases of construction we're
finishing<00:00:13.469> blasting<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.280> we<00:00:14.400> start

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
finishing blasting and we start

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.720

after<00:00:27.390> there<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:28.740> are<00:00:28.800> blasted<00:00:29.369> with<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> lean

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
after there we are blasted with a lean

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.490 
after there we are blasted with a lean
mixture<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.439> water<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:33.500> concrete
