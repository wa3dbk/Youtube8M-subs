of like blend it around still you can
put<00:03:11.209> more<00:03:11.360> color<00:03:11.660> back<00:03:11.930> into<00:03:12.349> it<00:03:12.500> if<00:03:12.590> you<00:03:12.620> like

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.360 

anything<00:03:17.480> you<00:03:17.660> want<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:17.959> do<00:03:18.170> it<00:03:18.500> hasn't<00:03:19.220> hurt

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
anything you want to do it hasn't hurt

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.640 
anything you want to do it hasn't hurt
it<00:03:19.520> at<00:03:19.640> all<00:03:19.819> in<00:03:20.569> fact<00:03:20.840> I've<00:03:21.140> set<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.530> on<00:03:21.620> fire

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
it at all in fact I've set it on fire

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.330 
it at all in fact I've set it on fire
about<00:03:22.160> four<00:03:22.610> times<00:03:22.910> before<00:03:23.410> just<00:03:24.410> to<00:03:24.590> see<00:03:24.830> what

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
about four times before just to see what

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.850 
about four times before just to see what
would<00:03:25.489> happen<00:03:25.550> with<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.209> reaction<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:27.140> I

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
would happen with the reaction and I

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.130 
would happen with the reaction and I
think<00:03:28.130> that<00:03:28.220> each<00:03:28.370> time<00:03:28.640> it<00:03:28.819> just<00:03:28.940> gives<00:03:29.140> even

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
think that each time it just gives even

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.920 
think that each time it just gives even
more<00:03:30.410> abstract<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:31.370> cooler<00:03:31.580> and<00:03:31.930> remember

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
more abstract and cooler and remember

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.600 
more abstract and cooler and remember
after<00:03:33.050> you're<00:03:33.319> done<00:03:33.470> you<00:03:33.709> can<00:03:33.830> still<00:03:34.130> take<00:03:34.370> and

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
after you're done you can still take and

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.140 
after you're done you can still take and
paint<00:03:35.390> on<00:03:35.569> this<00:03:35.799> or<00:03:36.799> draw<00:03:37.130> pictures<00:03:37.280> on<00:03:37.790> it<00:03:38.000> or

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
paint on this or draw pictures on it or

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.940 
paint on this or draw pictures on it or
whatever<00:03:38.360> you<00:03:38.569> want<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:39.140> just<00:03:39.200> use<00:03:39.620> this<00:03:39.769> as

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
whatever you want and just use this as

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.840 
whatever you want and just use this as
your<00:03:40.069> background<00:03:41.230> whatever<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:42.530> do<00:03:42.739> be<00:03:43.549> safe

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
your background whatever you do be safe

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.050 
your background whatever you do be safe
and<00:03:44.319> just<00:03:45.319> have<00:03:45.500> fun
