00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.490

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
think it would make East worth no more

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.180 
think it would make East worth no more
interesting<00:06:03.810> because<00:06:03.900> gambling<00:06:04.530> makes

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190

have you ever gone on one of these free

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.310 
have you ever gone on one of these free
sites<00:06:17.940> to<00:06:18.150> play<00:06:18.300> poker<00:06:18.570> like<00:06:18.690> it's<00:06:18.990> absolutely

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
free no money involved people just go on

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.700 
free no money involved people just go on
all<00:06:21.210> in<00:06:21.300> every<00:06:21.480> hand<00:06:21.690> that's<00:06:21.960> not<00:06:22.110> poker<00:06:22.380> right

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
all in every hand that's not poker right

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.270 
all in every hand that's not poker right
and<00:06:23.040> so<00:06:23.730> I<00:06:24.030> think<00:06:24.600> that<00:06:25.260> if<00:06:25.620> we<00:06:25.650> were<00:06:25.950> to<00:06:26.070> have

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.140 
and so I think that if we were to have
some<00:06:27.060> sort<00:06:27.330> of<00:06:27.540> e<00:06:28.220> fantasy<00:06:29.220> sport<00:06:29.700> League<00:06:29.970> I
