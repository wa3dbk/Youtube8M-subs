promised that I will show you on how to

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.749 
promised that I will show you on how to
how<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:06.930> get<00:00:07.200> your<00:00:07.319> Java<00:00:07.589> compiler<00:00:08.870> set<00:00:09.870> up

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:10.759 
how to get your Java compiler set up

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.360 
how to get your Java compiler set up
inside<00:00:11.759> Windows<00:00:12.059> 7<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.769> then<00:00:13.769> this<00:00:13.889> tool<00:00:14.190> will

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
inside Windows 7 and then this tool will

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.189 
inside Windows 7 and then this tool will
go<00:00:14.519> about<00:00:14.730> doing<00:00:15.059> exactly<00:00:15.389> that<00:00:15.480> but<00:00:15.929> since

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
go about doing exactly that but since

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.240 
go about doing exactly that but since
this<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.529> continuation<00:00:16.890> from<00:00:17.160> the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
this is the continuation from the

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.950 
this is the continuation from the
earlier<00:00:17.460> tutorial<00:00:17.910> first<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.600> foremost

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
earlier tutorial first and foremost

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.170 
earlier tutorial first and foremost
important<00:00:19.380> thing<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.890> have<00:00:20.460> your<00:00:20.609> JDK

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
important thing is to have your JDK

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.519 
important thing is to have your JDK
installed<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.960> Java<00:00:22.170> development

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
installed that is the Java development

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.439 
installed that is the Java development
kit<00:00:22.710> installed<00:00:23.220> properly<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.060> must<00:00:24.330> have

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
kit installed properly so you must have

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.269 
kit installed properly so you must have
seen<00:00:24.630> how<00:00:24.840> in<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.439> onion<00:00:25.650> D<00:00:25.769> toriel<00:00:26.099> we

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
seen how in the onion D toriel we

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.870 
seen how in the onion D toriel we
googled<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.359> correct<00:00:27.810> JDK<00:00:28.199> for<00:00:28.830> our<00:00:29.279> PC<00:00:29.699> like

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
googled the correct JDK for our PC like

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.359 
googled the correct JDK for our PC like
mine<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.449> Windows<00:00:30.869> 7<00:00:31.170> 64<00:00:31.560> bit<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.340> I

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
mine is a Windows 7 64 bit so I

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.750 
mine is a Windows 7 64 bit so I
basically<00:00:33.000> downloaded<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.870> JDK<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.760> later

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
basically downloaded the JDK and later

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.389 
basically downloaded the JDK and later
subsequently<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.739> installed<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.010> my<00:00:38.190> C

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
subsequently I installed it in my C

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.760 
subsequently I installed it in my C
Drive<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.910> can<00:00:39.420> see<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.840> JDK<00:00:40.320> as<00:00:40.440> well<00:00:40.620> as

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
Drive so you can see the JDK as well as

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.160 
Drive so you can see the JDK as well as
the<00:00:40.950> car<00:00:41.250> contained<00:00:41.850> JRE<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
the car contained JRE that is the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.229 
the car contained JRE that is the
runtime<00:00:43.469> environment<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.129> Java<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.879> all

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
runtime environment for Java is all

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.600 
runtime environment for Java is all
there<00:00:45.539> inside<00:00:46.140> my<00:00:46.350> program<00:00:47.100> files<00:00:47.309> inside

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
there inside my program files inside

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.060 
there inside my program files inside
shower<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.210> once<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.660> have<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.200> properly

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
shower so once you have this properly

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.100 
shower so once you have this properly
installed<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.520> mean<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.850> have<00:00:51.110> downloaded

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
installed I mean you have downloaded

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.709 
installed I mean you have downloaded
this<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.590> then<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:53.039> installed<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.640> by<00:00:54.030> doing

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
this and then like installed it by doing

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.900 
this and then like installed it by doing
the<00:00:55.079> steps<00:00:55.559> which<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.920> have<00:00:56.039> shown<00:00:56.309> me<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.789> do

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
the steps which you have shown me we do

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.599 
the steps which you have shown me we do
now<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.480> can<00:00:57.840> go<00:00:58.079> ahead<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.500> set<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
now you can go ahead and set the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.069 
now you can go ahead and set the
compiler<00:01:00.000> going<00:01:00.329> how<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.539> do<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.930> is

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
compiler going how you do that is

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.959 
compiler going how you do that is
something<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.469> will<00:01:01.530> show<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.739> exactly<00:01:02.129> right

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
something I will show you exactly right

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.570 
something I will show you exactly right
now<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.690> once<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.080> are<00:01:04.199> here<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.979> will<00:01:05.430> just

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
now so once you are here I will just

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.670 
now so once you are here I will just
wood<00:01:05.760> from<00:01:05.970> start<00:01:06.240> once<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.170> have<00:01:07.409> installed

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
wood from start once you have installed

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.190 
wood from start once you have installed
just<00:01:08.549> go<00:01:08.700> install<00:01:09.479> Java<00:01:09.720> development<00:01:10.049> kit

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
just go install Java development kit

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.899 
just go install Java development kit
just<00:01:10.619> go<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.799> your<00:01:10.890> C<00:01:11.070> Drive<00:01:11.250> go<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.549> Program

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
just go to your C Drive go to Program

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.450 
just go to your C Drive go to Program
Files<00:01:11.939> go<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.930> Java<00:01:13.200> inside<00:01:13.950> Java<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.340> will

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
Files go to Java inside Java you will

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.310 
Files go to Java inside Java you will
have<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.909> Java<00:01:15.240> development<00:01:15.570> kit<00:01:15.750> like<00:01:16.110> you

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
have the Java development kit like you

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.289 
have the Java development kit like you
have<00:01:16.530> here<00:01:16.799> -<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.549> one<00:01:17.670> point<00:01:17.850> some<00:01:17.970> version

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
have here - the one point some version

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.130 
have here - the one point some version
so<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:19.049> go<00:01:19.170> inside<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.650> go<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.490> bin<00:01:21.140> inside

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
so just go inside it go to bin inside

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.469 
so just go inside it go to bin inside
bin<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.560> will<00:01:22.740> be<00:01:22.920> having<00:01:23.130> Java<00:01:23.759> C<00:01:24.119> that

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
bin you will be having Java C that

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.749 
bin you will be having Java C that
stands<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:24.930> Java<00:01:25.110> compiler<00:01:25.549> just<00:01:26.549> right

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
stands for Java compiler just right

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.810 
stands for Java compiler just right
click<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.119> go<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.689> properties<00:01:28.820> this

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
click on it go to properties this

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.460 
click on it go to properties this
basically<00:01:30.180> helps<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.570> track<00:01:30.840> down<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.229> path

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
basically helps you track down the path

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.910 
basically helps you track down the path
so<00:01:31.829> if<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.100> go<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:33.600> variable<00:01:34.530> definition

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
so if you go to the variable definition

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.370 
so if you go to the variable definition
we<00:01:35.009> sees<00:01:35.250> location<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.390> have<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> path<00:01:37.079> for

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
we sees location you have the path for

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.319 
we sees location you have the path for
the<00:01:37.530> Java<00:01:37.710> compiler<00:01:37.950> just<00:01:38.700> select<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.119> press

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
the Java compiler just select it press

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.399 
the Java compiler just select it press
ctrl<00:01:40.110> C<00:01:40.290> shortcut<00:01:40.770> for<00:01:40.920> copy<00:01:41.130> click<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.030> ok

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
ctrl C shortcut for copy click on ok

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.660 
ctrl C shortcut for copy click on ok
basically<00:01:43.409> now<00:01:43.829> we<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:44.100> copied<00:01:44.399> down<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
basically now we have copied down the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.260 
basically now we have copied down the
path<00:01:44.850> for<00:01:45.060> Java<00:01:45.240> compiler<00:01:46.670> go<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.970> start

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
path for Java compiler go to the start

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.330

environmental variables are at the

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.710 
environmental variables are at the
bottom<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.549> screen<00:02:49.760> just<00:02:49.910> click<00:02:50.030> on<00:02:50.330> that<00:02:50.360> you

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
bottom the screen just click on that you

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.509 
bottom the screen just click on that you
need<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:51.019> add<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.410> variable<00:02:51.799> you<00:02:52.040> need<00:02:52.190> to<00:02:52.370> add

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
need to add the variable you need to add

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.240 
need to add the variable you need to add
Java<00:02:52.790> compiler<00:02:53.170> so<00:02:54.170> that<00:02:54.410> variable<00:02:54.860> you<00:02:55.040> can

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
Java compiler so that variable you can

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.820 
Java compiler so that variable you can
see<00:02:55.400> is<00:02:55.549> not<00:02:55.730> here<00:02:56.030> so<00:02:57.580> you<00:02:58.580> can<00:02:58.880> you<00:02:59.750> know

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
see is not here so you can you know

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.839 
see is not here so you can you know
create<00:03:00.830> a<00:03:00.860> new<00:03:01.040> variable<00:03:01.220> for<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.670> Java

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
create a new variable for the Java

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.430 
create a new variable for the Java
compiler<00:03:02.060> so<00:03:02.450> you<00:03:02.540> can<00:03:02.660> just<00:03:02.810> create<00:03:03.200> a<00:03:03.290> new

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
compiler so you can just create a new

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.430 
compiler so you can just create a new
variable<00:03:04.099> you<00:03:04.430> can<00:03:04.610> call<00:03:04.970> it<00:03:05.120> path<00:03:05.360> capital<00:03:06.049> ta

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
variable you can call it path capital ta

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.789 
variable you can call it path capital ta
th<00:03:06.769> and<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.580> variable<00:03:07.910> value<00:03:08.180> will<00:03:08.299> be<00:03:08.450> the

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
th and the variable value will be the

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.140 
th and the variable value will be the
location<00:03:09.799> of<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.099> Java<00:03:10.310> compiler<00:03:10.580> so<00:03:10.940> you<00:03:11.000> can

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
location of the Java compiler so you can

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.330 
location of the Java compiler so you can
just<00:03:11.299> copy<00:03:11.660> keys<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.170> just<00:03:12.650> click<00:03:12.769> on<00:03:12.890> ok<00:03:13.130> and

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
just copy keys and just click on ok and

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.180 
just copy keys and just click on ok and
click<00:03:13.790> on<00:03:13.910> OK<00:03:14.150> again<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.599> now<00:03:15.470> when<00:03:15.650> you<00:03:15.769> click

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
click on OK again and now when you click

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.400 
click on OK again and now when you click
on<00:03:16.280> in<00:03:16.430> variables<00:03:17.120> you<00:03:17.600> will<00:03:17.720> see<00:03:17.870> that<00:03:18.079> your

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
on in variables you will see that your

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.880 
on in variables you will see that your
path<00:03:18.739> has<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:23.180> have<00:03:23.299> your<00:03:23.420> path<00:03:23.630> inside<00:03:24.590> the

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
path has you have your path inside the

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.130 
path has you have your path inside the
environment<00:03:25.850> variable<00:03:26.150> so<00:03:26.329> basically<00:03:26.930> your

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
environment variable so basically your

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.349 
environment variable so basically your
path<00:03:27.380> has<00:03:27.410> been<00:03:27.620> path<00:03:28.489> for<00:03:28.730> Java<00:03:28.910> compiler<00:03:29.209> has

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
path has been path for Java compiler has

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:30.759 
path has been path for Java compiler has
now<00:03:29.630> been<00:03:29.840> registered<00:03:30.170> so<00:03:30.290> you<00:03:30.380> don't<00:03:30.590> need<00:03:30.680> to

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
now been registered so you don't need to

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.680 
now been registered so you don't need to
worry<00:03:30.920> anymore<00:03:31.040> so<00:03:31.819> once<00:03:32.000> you<00:03:32.150> do<00:03:32.269> once<00:03:32.600> we

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
worry anymore so once you do once we

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.340 
worry anymore so once you do once we
have<00:03:32.810> done<00:03:32.959> that<00:03:33.019> simply<00:03:34.870> you<00:03:35.870> need<00:03:35.989> to<00:03:36.140> do<00:03:36.230> the

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
have done that simply you need to do the

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.539 
have done that simply you need to do the
same<00:03:36.500> things<00:03:36.709> which<00:03:36.829> I<00:03:36.950> was<00:03:37.100> telling<00:03:37.459> you
