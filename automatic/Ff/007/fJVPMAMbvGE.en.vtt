00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.099
 Hello friends with you now on 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.839
 this is the 38th edition of the master category for all 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.850
 the tanks heading in which i'm trying 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.369
 get a mark of class master on 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.050
 technique which name you specify in 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.880
 comments before you start 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.680
 today's release I want to draw your 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.050
 attention to what is in the description of this 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.720
 The video has a list of tanks that already 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.579
 a mark of class has been received except for master 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.800
 that even in this reference list for 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.660
 Relevant videos are therefore expensive. 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.059
 my viewers before leaving 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.070
 a comment with the name of the tank make sure 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.050
 that this tank is not on this list 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.149
 but if you still write a tank 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.010
 who was already unfortunately Santa Claus 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.660
 you for the new year will not give anything and 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.789
 then do not say that I do not 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.440
 warned well then now let's 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.360
 start the official part and in 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.730
 today's video we will talk about one thing 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.609
 of my favorite tanks on level 7 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.800
 namely about the German heavy tank tiger 1 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.690
 it is very interesting and cool 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.030
 even though he trade 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.100
 may very rarely but it is historical 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.600
 and beautiful but also to begin with, let me 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.439
 talk a little about technical 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.600
 characteristics 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.270
 and then we discuss how to use the game. 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.920
 in battles and so the dynamics of our feline 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.630
 quite heavy for a heavy tank 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.460
 maximum speed forward 40 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.530
 kilometers per hour is recruited with a small 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.200
 slides mostly the same tiger rides with 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.970
 speed of 30 35 kilometers per hour from 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.890
 unpleasant can be noted not high 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.869
 maximum reverse speed total 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.270
 only 12 kilometers per hour and low 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.340
 turning speed in place of 26 degrees in 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.500
 second medium and light tanks can 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.790
 easily whirl our Germans so 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.890
 be very careful 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.509
 As for booking, as I have already 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.640
 said earlier to talk on a tiger 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.380
 rarely it turns out in the forehead of the body thickness 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.259
 armor is 100 millimeters by 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.299
 the sides and aft 82 of the towerâ€™s forehead also 100 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.490
 millimeters but its main part 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.170
 this mask is a weapon that has a different 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.060
 booking center 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.100
 breaks more difficult and periodically 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.079
 keeps hitting attack until the eighth 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.780
 level but i wouldn't say that on the tiger 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.549
 can 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.799
 and tank turret because even 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.479
 classmates you easily struck if 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.910
 not head on into a huge commander 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.890
 the turret in general, our German is not so much about 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.260
 armor how much about the size of the strength points 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.209
 which he has one and a half thousand 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.160
 and plus to everything he has great 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.989
 the instrument that actually allows 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.630
 effectively exchanging it we 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.430
 Now let's talk so tiger gun 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.160
 has 203 millimeters breaking through 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.050
 armor-piercing projectile 237 subcaliber 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.250
 one-time damage to these shells is 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.530
 240 units 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.320
 accuracy of the gun is very good spread on 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.019
 100 meters 034 and here is the information 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.690
 often wait for it is 2.7 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.800
 seconds but the main feature of this weapon is 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.810
 his rate of fire 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.730
 recharge with rammer will take 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.100
 only six seconds and that means that 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.420
 due to the supply of points of strength you can 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.400
 not just shoot any 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.680
 classmate but also some tanks 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.510
 level eight for the word armored 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.920
 nines tiger by the way also represents 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.350
 very serious danger 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.120
 again because of its dpm as for 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.010
 vertical alignment angles then go down 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.530
 guns in principle not bad at 7 degrees 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.120
 and rises by only 13 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.280
 some cases may deliver 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.989
 a certain discomfort there is another 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.970
 a parameter which can be unaccustomed 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.100
 cause inconvenience namely speed 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.410
 rotation of the tower which is only 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.930
 only 18 degrees per second what for 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.880
 heavy tank of course very little on 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.560
 This instrument of all, and it now remains 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.860
 remember about such an important parameter 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.360
 as a review of tigers, it is 380 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.700
 meters that for a tank of the seventh level 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.890
 I highly recommend strengthening it. 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.180
 coated optics and so with 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.730
 characteristics seem to be sorted out 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.680
 If you sum up a little, you can 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.570
 say that the tiger is a shed without 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.910
 outstanding booking but with 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.890
 a large margin of strength points he has 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.350
 quite good dynamics for heavy 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.420
 tank's excellent guns and excellent visibility 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.730
 what else is needed for the happiness of tanks 7 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.950
 level well now let's talk about 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.400
 how can a tiger manifest itself in 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.680
 battles 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.600
 if you are at the top of the list for example 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.549
 how I in this fight which took place on 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.140
 Stalingrad map itself in it to me 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.329
 managed to get a mark of class master 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.370
 you can basically do all that 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:08.200
 your heart is worth it and fear 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.940
 only enemy artillery such 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.670
 tiger conditions just feel 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.380
 fine 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.060
 you can press the direction of pre 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.190
 by shooting my opponent on 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.049
 distance can be protected on the contrary 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.389
 correctly use a huge stock 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.310
 tank strength change when in 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.410
 this is a necessity and try not to 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.110
 allow yourself to medium and light tanks 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.180
 enemy further if you fall into 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.889
 the middle of the list in a battle with tanks of the eighth 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.139
 level then here you can act 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.790
 fairly effective of course first 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.410
 minutes to attack better not to 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.450
 because at the eighth level already 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.580
 Tales that begin to appear for the 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.500
 can take php and art 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.360
 It becomes much better and meaner 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.430
 start a fight with Allied support 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.930
 second line gun tiger excellent 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.300
 show yourself to medium and long 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.220
 distances therefore causing damage to 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.050
 you should have no problems with it 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.790
 try to keep strength points 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.770
 Further when the time comes active 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.110
 actions they will very much come in handy 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.000
 during such activities whether 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.580
 attack or defense of any direction 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.990
 a large margin of safety of the tank will allow 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.030
 you not only shoot with 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.010
 the adversary is his advantage but also at the right 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.410
 moment for example get a shot instead 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.540
 covering his ally 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.190
 top tank you help save the barrel 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.229
 which can later be very much 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.030
 useful and do not say what you need always 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.250
 take damage instead of anyone here 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.870
 all of course depends on the situation and you 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.150
 they themselves must understand when necessary 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.990
 cover the ally and when to do it 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.419
 better not worth 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.890
 but as for the battles with nines then 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.960
 such conditions as on any other 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.210
 tank who turned on her list 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.280
 try not to die in the first minutes of the battle 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.710
 support allies from the second line 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.050
 you can even try long distances 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.000
 guns it saves you points 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.460
 strength try to survive until decoupling 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.190
 battlefield and then already take any 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.669
 active in my opinion precisely 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.070
 tiger 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.479
 of all heavy tanks level 7 is better 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.850
 all feel in battles with 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.979
 eights and nines are a great weapon 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.510
 allows you to normally do damage for 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.789
 due to the large number of points of strength 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.630
 German will live a little longer than him 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:04.760
 classmates 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.100
 and in some cases you can dedicate 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.690
 thanks to a good overview and being 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.520
 in the top of the list as I said a little 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.160
 previously you can do whatever your heart desires 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.270
 including getting the master tiger 1 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.830
 very cool tanchik if you are us 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.380
 not yet skated for any reason 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.150
 then be sure to try me stand in 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.800
 hangar from time immemorial and I 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.660
 periodically with pleasure on it 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.160
 rolling out this time to get 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.440
 sign of the class master and me 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.600
 it took seven fights well and on this on 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.130
 today everything with you was now on before 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.020
 than leave comments do not forget 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.020
 peek at the list of new meetings
