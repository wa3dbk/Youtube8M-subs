00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.120
 I have to say 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.910
 Welcome to the second guide of never 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.670
 surrender this time we will see how to use 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.350
 to evelyn in the jungle the first thing I have 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.840
 What to say is that this is a guide to 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.520
 berlin to from I know your skills are 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.160
 of ap but to me it is how best it has 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.800
 always worked now let's see the 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.989
 runes what we are going to put is in the 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.200
 marks and in the fifth essences attack 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.050
 in the magic resistance glyphs and in 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.760
 the physical defense stamps the explanation 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.470
 This is quite simple and that is 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.449
 we will have ample attack to remove 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.480
 enough life when we start and 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.210
 also we will hold well 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.210
 in the masters we are going to put these 21 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.520
 points in offensive and these 9 in defense 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.290
 and this is more of the same as what I've 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.079
 said in the rules we will get attack 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.329
 of surplus and defense to endure in 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.310
 As for the objects we will buy for 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.800
 start the cloth armor and 5 potions 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.790
 briefly explaining this character 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.140
 basically we have to know that your 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.180
 passive does that when we are 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.580
 invisible gives us a lot of feedback from 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.440
 Well this is important because 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.330
 principle if for whatever the delmi is 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.100
 infatuated with blue we can regenerate 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.990
 with our passive evidently not 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.880
 as much as with blue but it will serve us and 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.350
 in led game we will almost not have 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.899
 problems to regenerate our mana 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.789
 so we will no longer depend on blue in the 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.100
 order of skills will be this one 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.440
 basically we will always go up 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.170
 we can our dome of hatred for 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.869
 to be able to form the beast later in the 2 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.570
 we will go up desolation and in the 4 frenzy 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.580
 dark we will give priority as I said to 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.780
 the pure hate and the second priority to 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.780
 climb will be desolation 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.420
 we start with blue as you know me 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.490
 I like to make a first big that 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.410
 or fast because it's almost never going to 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.420
 wait what is important about this gun that or 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.580
 It is not in itself to kill them but to spend 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.800
 flash and step a hand to one of 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.440
 the allied lines so they can 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.050
 master the line as soon as possible 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.600
 I'm going to give some tips to rank with 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.920
 evelyn this character is one of the 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.350
 best gun that I am for your 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.310
 invisibility since it is usually 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.410
 often buy green wards and not purple 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.420
 a very important advice is to try 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.550
 always put on the back of the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.310
 enemy to have more chances of 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.680
 prevent him from fleeing 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.840
 later we will buy the boots of 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.540
 speed that will help us to pursue 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.400
 the enemy and that he does not actually flee when 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.709
 try to run away it will be time to burst 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.180
 the q button on the keyboard to give you 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.459
 the barbs while trying to escape 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.750
 in the event that an ally has 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.390
 warned that they have put a guard 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.049
 purple then we will look for another way 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.049
 to redeem 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.129
 to finish the line objects that 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.709
 we will follow it will be the next one first the 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.719
 restless bluff that evolution we will make of 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.420
 the cloth armor will help us 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:10.689
 train faster in jungle and therefore 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.230
 redeem more times and also give us something 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:16.000
 of armor attack and life robbery 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.400
 second that we are going to buy are the 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.959
 speed boots that will help us to 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.480
 move as quickly as possible by the 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.219
 map you can put also the boots of 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.409
 mobility that will help us move 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:29.079
 all over the map even with much greater 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:31.030
 speed in my case I prefer those of 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.230
 quickly because we can chase the 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.510
 enemy if he flees 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.120
 The third thing we are going to buy is the 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.459
 trinity force that will serve us for 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.989
 give us a devastating first blow that 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.610
 above all we will notice at the end of 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.300
 the game when we have the team 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.460
 full 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.920
 The fourth thing we are going to buy is the 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.960
 bloodthirsty will help us to give us 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.020
 above all greater attack and that our 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.000
 continuity combination remove even more and 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.400
 especially also to recover from 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.680
 lifetime 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.170
 from here the rest I leave it in 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.209
 your choice depending on the equipment 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.989
 enemy you must do the most offensive thing if 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.040
 you want or if you paint very badly defensive 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.530
 I recommend the infinite edge for 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.590
 combine it with the trinity and the blade 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.690
 to give us armor penetration but 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.669
 I have ever since for example 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.310
 the mesh of thorns when one of carrie 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.910
 I was very quarreled or a guardian of 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.130
 angel to relive 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.800
 and this is all I hope you have been 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.060
 useful is here you have learned something if 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.550
 Do you have any doubt what has been 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.770
 commented below and one last advice very 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.930
 important never give up at minute 20 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.930
 because even the most lost game is 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.220
 removable and you know for more guides 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.220
