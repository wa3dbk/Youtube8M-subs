00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.620
 after 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.599
 then the first time we could start 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.740

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.840
 not really started we just started 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.970
 the quest since it's done 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.289
 naturally 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.449
 I climbed a little bit the microphone sound 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:30.710

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.710

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.809
 said so the wildlife had been looking on the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.480
 matane port actually was not there 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.480
 down here she is here here is here we talk 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.629
 maybe that's a sparrow set 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.760
 day 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:56.210
 so go see the web and who is hungry 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:01:00.270

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:03.000
 ours ainkawa given to kate promised is 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.369
 no carrot he gives us a 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.939
 quest my prince another day then 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.000
 then go see this and saluted room the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.000
 bone 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:27.049
 she's there hop order a pizza threw 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.340
 what I do not have very fast this piece 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.020
 because I'm fed up with quests that 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.979
 I plant you on the 2.8 to banon to 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.610
 the time we take everything and so we 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.409
 will go get all this and go 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.540
 we will avoid being attacked a little 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.240
 painful I received several comments 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.979
 like that on the old videos of me 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.680
 to say to cut when I do a fight 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.680
 with store I do not think to do it since 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.360
 you also need to love 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.280
 video and that I also love it so in 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.009
 I do not like too many cuts 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.780
 not to cut that I like to see a 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.860
 natural video actually if it's too much 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.390
 seriously and do not know it's good but 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.739
 that's not good enough it's a 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.420
 little bit nil so it's not difficult to 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.870
 vis - à - vis them we do not do that I do 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:20.410
 anyway so here it is a little 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.519
 a little bit nil so we go where 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.019
 so someone already has me a little bit 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.090
 explained the quest so it's a little bit more 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:30.320
 quick than usual at home I 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.900
 hope so then you have to pick up a whole 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.570
 trick of the deal saw nantes 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.660
 the opinion of the midi machin bidule freight 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.020
 so we will all 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.250
 search and we are here in fact 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.780
 because I did not find the order 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.190
 there but it's to see that I have 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.300
 forgot stuff so did it apply 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:53.560
 on this map there and click there 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.150
 on it so we have all the air 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.260
 more than to recover a paw of 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.970
 furniture so for that we have to go there 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.640
 down so I went back I got 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.280
 looking too much and I hope to find 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.200
 So here we are ozap in 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.670
 do what I ask someone he 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.170
 told me that these same paths because in 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.500
 the maj so we will try to do this 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.170
 path 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.930
 so here we are at the place 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:22.810
 where is requested for a sentence attic 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:24.070
 from eight to eighteen years old mailing and 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.790
 actually applies the plateau of the very 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.770
 okay that's it it's strictly 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:35.620
 nothing but it's for the quest so here it is 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:37.050
 I managed to 88 updated that's it 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.890
 bring everything back to these rooms 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.240
 so I took a short break before 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.220
 come back then to explain to you how 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.620
 come here you just have to be the 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.320
 way or who leads you German to 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.290
 that I believe but in fact for a moment you 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.209
 go oust who rules towards this island so 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.320
 this is not too complicated to 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.970
 understand I can explain it to you as 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.920
 it's what it takes too long his 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.090
 but you follow sous marois and you 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.920
 will arrive at since I managed to his 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.120
 and that a lot of people succeeded me 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.090
 went to take the zap 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.890
 I will try to take the time that 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.570
 I am the cutoff actually for that 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.010
 me it will be left for after for the 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.840
 next videos 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.670
 so here we are when I'll be 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.140
 there before that I take the apd to 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:20.380
 following and well back the world so I 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.030
 looked how to go for the zap in 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.139
 do it according to what I understood 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:29.069
 for a gun but it takes 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:37.000
 jonathon you have to have 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:38.949
 the covenant they commit one must see 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.139
 the alliance that has territory that 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:45.849
 find here so that is the key 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.569
 if these symbols so any sum know 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:51.039
 had it dead enough on our favor I 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:52.330
 I'm sure it's the same 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.490
 laboratory to your empirical data that 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.900
 if a sauna test to take the 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.460
 and no longer be paid 5 hama for 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.659
 get there and you'll have sap 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.669
 basically it's like a brigands village 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:02.380
 from one or two villages points away it's 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.620
 so it's a bit boring 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.190
 here is then regretted to start there 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.349
 a dialogue 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.349
 you got salad from the machine 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:16.300
 some updates that always lé pa

 tergnier bring back a salad and how 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.750
 we find a salad 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:21.750
 how to find a salad 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.110
 so I'll say was 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.740

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.979
 hop then we'll get there right now 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.759
 I hope he would not have the tip of the 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:47.629
 map 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:50.379
