00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
would expect pushes into the top corner

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.960 
would expect pushes into the top corner
and<00:01:22.820> then<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.939> bottom<00:01:24.240> pushes<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.720> as<00:01:24.810> well

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
and then the bottom pushes in as well

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.480 
and then the bottom pushes in as well
kind<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.119> flaps<00:01:27.780> over<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:30.420> then<00:01:31.490> just

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
kind of flaps over and then just

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.069 
kind of flaps over and then just
basically<00:01:32.729> each<00:01:32.909> corner<00:01:33.180> clips<00:01:33.570> over<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.900> top

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
over the iPad and as you would expect

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.100 
over the iPad and as you would expect
the<00:01:40.610> magnets<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.060> cover<00:01:42.329> turn<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.840> ipad

the magnets in the cover turn the ipad
on<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.350> off<00:01:44.270> probably<00:01:45.270> see<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.450> amazingly

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
use the rolled ups kind of cover to hold

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.160 
use the rolled ups kind of cover to hold
the<00:02:01.170> ipad<00:02:01.469> up<00:02:02.270> it's<00:02:03.270> not<00:02:03.479> not<00:02:03.840> really<00:02:03.869> a

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
the ipad up it's not not really a

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.700 
the ipad up it's not not really a
fantastic<00:02:04.530> angle<00:02:05.369> for<00:02:05.759> typing<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:07.229> bit<00:02:07.530> low

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
fantastic angle for typing a bit low

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.260 
fantastic angle for typing a bit low
possibly<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.399> it's

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
possibly and it's

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.780 
possibly and it's
and<00:02:10.420> you<00:02:10.930> can<00:02:11.130> quite<00:02:12.130> easily<00:02:12.160> knock<00:02:12.580> it<00:02:12.700> off

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
and you can quite easily knock it off

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.400 
and you can quite easily knock it off
its<00:02:12.940> perch<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.420> make<00:02:13.570> it<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.750> lot<00:02:13.900> lower<00:02:14.080> that's

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
its perch and make it a lot lower that's

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.380 
its perch and make it a lot lower that's
only<00:02:14.590> like<00:02:14.680> an<00:02:14.890> inch<00:02:15.040> or<00:02:15.190> so<00:02:15.340> which<00:02:15.550> is<00:02:15.760> which

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
only like an inch or so which is which

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.110 
only like an inch or so which is which
isn't<00:02:16.660> super<00:02:17.080> can<00:02:18.040> also<00:02:18.220> fold<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.030> other

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
isn't super can also fold it the other

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.990 
isn't super can also fold it the other
way<00:02:19.380> use<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.500> as<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.620> stand<00:02:23.100> like<00:02:24.100> that<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:24.880> that

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
way use it as a stand like that so that

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.400 
way use it as a stand like that so that
would<00:02:25.090> be<00:02:25.150> really<00:02:25.300> useful<00:02:25.480> you're<00:02:25.990> on<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.170> plane

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
would be really useful you're on a plane

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.380 
would be really useful you're on a plane
