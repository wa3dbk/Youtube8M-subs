00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.829
 It is nine minutes today It is this to introduce micro cube this time 

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:11.240
 Transformers Lost Age movie advanced prototype 

00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:11.240
 Optimus Prime 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.980
 This is the so-called reprint of the first Lost Age related items released on May 17 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.130
 It is a group 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.570
 Click here for the origin of this item 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.200
 A prototype Optimus of the same name released in 2007, the year of the first theater version 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.340
 Prime 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.430
 In fact, it is the same as the premiere of what we say in this year, but before the full release 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.860
 Sold in advance to 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.850
 It was a preview figure, that is to say, the first to commemorate the live-action movie version of the item 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.530
 I mean 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.280
 It is obvious when you look at it, but this is not a vehicle and it can not be said sf mecha 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.880
 Right 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:53.420
 The official name is also written as entry mode not vehicle 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:58.429
 Possibly mobile from the image in the play that probably fell on the earth as a stone stone 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:02.059
 It will be an entry in the sense of that, but it is still live-action when this reprinted original is released 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:03.050
 Nobody do not know Transformers to be drawn is really become any visual 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.820
 Because it was a state 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.810
 Many of the people by the first bullet was this not say downright shape of the vehicle is stir the imagination 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.080
 I think I was 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.409
 By the way, this word "protoform" which is also in product name 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.159
 This is Transformers 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:21.179
 A word representing the original state of the original before scanning 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:24.090
 That is, prototype Optimus scans Peterbilt 379 on the earth 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:28.350
 Optimus in the state of the subject before you 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:32.350
 The concept of the word plutoform is slightly different from series to series 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:36.580
 But basically transformers are body shape and fine specs 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:40.299
 He is free to be changed by scan or fundamental performance to some extent at the time of the proto form 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:45.040
 The scan is fixed and can not deviate significantly from this 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:49.090
 For example, body size, whether it can fly gender or special like triple change 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.200
 Whether the transformation can be made or not is already done in the prototype before the scan 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.340
 It is determined 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.329
 Tiger That I mean Tsu not fly in the proto form 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:00.409
 It means that you will not be able to fly even if you scan the vehicle that the market price flies 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:05.479
 If you remember the movie version in the meantime, you can see that Megatron and Starscream are deformed 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.979
 I build up against being able to fly freely just to do it is a big addition in the 2nd work or the 3rd work 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.519
 I can not fly without equipment 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.360
 This op but it can not fly without additional equipment is so from g 1 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:16.470
 The base of the Autobots a Abbott 2 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.890
 When I was a miasma of before either love is applied is that the Tteyuu jet pack equipped there was over the wall 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.360
 Ne 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:25.140
 That's why the prototype Optimus is in the form it is in before scanning. 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:29.480
 It's clearly color after scanning This is a bit strange going from settings 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.480
 That's all but there are no color variations at all 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.180
 By the way, as for the item of reprint, there is a case that the number of steps of transformation is not written like this 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.020
 I have it 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.680
 According to the instructions Fifteen steps are not so complicated 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.880
 Well, let's try styling and transforming the prototype Optimus Prime 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.880
 I will also see at once 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.670
 th 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.590
 is 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.420
 th 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.370
 th 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.310
 def 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.480
 Had 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.409
 is 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.409
 I 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.250
 boomer 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.760
 What 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.460
 1 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.460
 Hmm 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.630
 Uzan 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.030
 dj 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.090
 I had 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.150
 Hmm 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.150
 What 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:26.560
 By the way, the effect parts of this windmill garden that was on the tail part in the entry mode 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.560
 In fact, this is the tip of 4 blaster that the tip is shaped like a pin and you want to deploy 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.980
 To 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.570
 So it is to serve as a firing effects that you can that you want to keep with in such Fu 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.110
 Well this is good 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:40.730
 That's Optimus before reprinted, but I was not with a paint degradation in such Fu 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:45.440
 This time painting is lost This time we introduce port shots several times as usual. 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:47.550
 One of the greatest attraction of this protoform Optimus is its operational excellence 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.450
 It is often omitted in the deluxe class 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:58.010
 Around the neck it has been made to place that there is a move all 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:05:00.450
 The congregation is supposed to be able to sleep 22 days under the chest and cost how much , and the hip joint is 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:05.640
 It looks like also fall back and forth 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:07.569
 And the shape of the ankles is very flexible entry mode with all joints come and go with the pin 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.169
 I'm getting out of it for nothing 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:16.300
 It might be many people say or rather this movie advanced 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:21.039
 I think this is probably the best running item for lostage related items 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.569
 Even if it is compared with the deluxe class of all generations other than lostage 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:27.099
 I think it is the highest level 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:27.560
 So this prototype Optimus has an impression when it is run in robot mode 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:31.490
 100 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.110
 80 degrees change and I think you messed up on the other true in only pose with the robot mode 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.389
 More than fun 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.540
 Transformers Lost Age movie advanced prototype form 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:42.009
 How was the Optimus Prime microphone ? 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:46.270

 Thank you 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:01.450
 p but is dated after the other this time I'm at all to do with Transformers 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:05.530
 Do you know adventure time with short animation from North America ? 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:09.670
 A dubbed version is currently being broadcast on csk's Cartoon Network in Japan as well . 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:12.250
 But in it, a character called 3ds portable game console alive comes out 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.969
 This seems to be pretty cute, isn't it? 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:23.989
 I wonder if this is the head office 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:26.469
 Booby's cute patties, but with a lot of cuteness Transformers Nou Blue 

00:06:23.989 --> 00:06:26.469
 Part is 

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:37.990
 The woman's expression changes, and furthermore, when it rotates this silk 4 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:42.400
 The effect of the spring of the tax spring is great feeling and it will play just about 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:45.969
 Adventure time has a surugag-like face that feels casually, and in fact it is a view of the world 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:49.599
 Kind of kind you can not see so much in Japan that you look at 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:50.199
 If you can see the series as it is an animation, it might be interesting to see it once 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:52.880
 not 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:58.490
 And not if came out even better luck with a look b is 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:07:00.490
 When I think definitely it is punched Please ultra-cute try to attention 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.490
 Hmm 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.389
 Ah 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.389
 Have
