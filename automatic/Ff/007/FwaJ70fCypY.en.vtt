around<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:03.400> horse<00:05:03.610> was<00:05:03.789> a<00:05:03.879> little<00:05:04.089> tired<00:05:04.469> and

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
around the horse was a little tired and

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.070 
around the horse was a little tired and
we<00:05:06.550> had<00:05:06.699> two<00:05:06.909> rails<00:05:07.300> down<00:05:07.539> that<00:05:07.749> I<00:05:07.779> didn't

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
we had two rails down that I didn't

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.339 
we had two rails down that I didn't
expect<00:05:08.379> and<00:05:08.800> the<00:05:09.069> first<00:05:09.310> row<00:05:09.610> we<00:05:09.789> head<00:05:09.939> down<00:05:10.349> we

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
expect and the first row we head down we

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:13.050 
expect and the first row we head down we
seriously<00:05:11.589> going<00:05:12.039> into<00:05:12.279> a<00:05:12.339> bit<00:05:12.490> of<00:05:12.520> a<00:05:12.639> tangle

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
seriously going into a bit of a tangle

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.670 
seriously going into a bit of a tangle
getting<00:05:13.330> that<00:05:13.479> first<00:05:13.779> step<00:05:14.050> I<00:05:14.259> think<00:05:14.499> it<00:05:14.560> was

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
getting that first step I think it was

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.909 
getting that first step I think it was
fence<00:05:15.009> for<00:05:15.539> so<00:05:16.539> that<00:05:17.139> wasn't<00:05:17.499> the<00:05:17.560> horses

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
fence for so that wasn't the horses

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.860 
fence for so that wasn't the horses
fault<00:05:18.129> then<00:05:18.520> we<00:05:18.639> had<00:05:18.759> two<00:05:18.939> rails<00:05:19.210> after<00:05:19.659> that

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
fault then we had two rails after that

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.409 
fault then we had two rails after that
he<00:05:20.529> was<00:05:20.680> just<00:05:20.830> a<00:05:20.949> little<00:05:20.979> tired<00:05:21.400> the<00:05:21.999> only<00:05:22.240> hope

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
he was just a little tired the only hope

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.769 
he was just a little tired the only hope
is<00:05:22.629> just<00:05:22.689> to<00:05:22.930> keep<00:05:23.080> the<00:05:23.259> pace<00:05:23.499> going<00:05:23.830> because

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:24.779 
is just to keep the pace going because

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:27.749 
is just to keep the pace going because
the<00:05:25.779> time<00:05:26.050> was<00:05:26.379> hard<00:05:26.710> and<00:05:27.009> I<00:05:27.099> thought<00:05:27.339> he<00:05:27.550> could

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 
the time was hard and I thought he could

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:30.300 
the time was hard and I thought he could
come<00:05:27.969> down<00:05:28.210> to<00:05:28.270> just<00:05:28.599> a<00:05:28.810> point<00:05:29.529> or<00:05:29.770> two<00:05:29.800> at<00:05:30.249> the

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
resigned myself to the fact that he was

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:13.409 
brilliant destiny vente but he probably
just<00:06:10.150> couldn't<00:06:10.509> run<00:06:10.659> the<00:06:10.689> times<00:06:11.050> down<00:06:11.439> in<00:06:12.419> the

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
just couldn't run the times down in the

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.439 
just couldn't run the times down in the

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:16.449 
big in the big time and so when I got

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:20.480 
big in the big time and so when I got
here<00:06:16.919> at<00:06:17.919> the<00:06:18.039> start<00:06:18.310> of<00:06:18.490> this<00:06:18.669> competition<00:06:19.449> I

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
here at the start of this competition I

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.830 
here at the start of this competition I
looked<00:06:21.490> at<00:06:21.610> the<00:06:21.789> cross<00:06:22.240> country<00:06:22.449> time<00:06:22.810> I

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
looked at the cross country time I

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.010 
looked at the cross country time I
thought<00:06:23.169> gee<00:06:23.500> 10<00:06:23.889> minutes<00:06:24.550> 10<00:06:24.849> seconds<00:06:25.419> like

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
thought gee 10 minutes 10 seconds like

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.899 
thought gee 10 minutes 10 seconds like
that's<00:06:26.349> beyond<00:06:26.860> where<00:06:27.159> we're<00:06:27.400> out<00:06:27.610> at<00:06:27.789> the

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:27.909 
that's beyond where we're out at the

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:30.269 
that's beyond where we're out at the
moment<00:06:28.120> and<00:06:28.479> of<00:06:28.779> course<00:06:29.020> he<00:06:29.259> put<00:06:29.560> in<00:06:29.650> a<00:06:29.740> blinder

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:30.279 
moment and of course he put in a blinder

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:34.379 
moment and of course he put in a blinder
of<00:06:30.370> a<00:06:30.430> dressage<00:06:30.849> test<00:06:31.270> and<00:06:32.759> 38.3<00:06:33.759> I<00:06:33.789> think<00:06:34.180> and

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:34.389 
of a dressage test and 38.3 I think and

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:37.800 
of a dressage test and 38.3 I think and
holy<00:06:35.169> hell<00:06:35.680> they<00:06:35.919> gave<00:06:36.159> me<00:06:36.400> but<00:06:36.699> i<00:06:37.120> think<00:06:37.629> it

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 
holy hell they gave me but i think it

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.610 
holy hell they gave me but i think it
was<00:06:37.960> nearly<00:06:38.229> 12<00:06:38.789> point<00:06:39.789> lead<00:06:40.000> and<00:06:40.990> I<00:06:41.110> hotel

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
was nearly 12 point lead and I hotel

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.980 
was nearly 12 point lead and I hotel
that's<00:06:42.069> a<00:06:42.250> lot<00:06:42.460> of<00:06:42.490> time<00:06:42.849> you<00:06:43.240> know<00:06:43.300> if<00:06:43.509> I<00:06:43.689> just

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
that's a lot of time you know if I just

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.290 
that's a lot of time you know if I just
spend<00:06:44.289> this<00:06:44.469> time<00:06:44.770> very<00:06:45.129> carefully<00:06:45.909> and

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
spend this time very carefully and

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.230 
spend this time very carefully and
minimize<00:06:47.199> the<00:06:47.560> loss<00:06:48.219> of<00:06:48.430> time<00:06:48.669> out<00:06:48.909> there<00:06:48.939> on

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
minimize the loss of time out there on

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.489 
minimize the loss of time out there on
cross-country<00:06:49.629> and<00:06:49.839> he<00:06:50.050> jumps<00:06:50.379> as

00:06:50.489 --> 00:06:50.499 
cross-country and he jumps as

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:52.050 
cross-country and he jumps as
brilliantly<00:06:50.979> as<00:06:51.159> I<00:06:51.279> think<00:06:51.520> he's<00:06:51.669> going<00:06:51.909> to

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
brilliantly as I think he's going to

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.839 
brilliantly as I think he's going to
then<00:06:52.900> will<00:06:53.740> these<00:06:54.069> the<00:06:54.400> rest<00:06:54.580> of<00:06:54.669> the<00:06:54.729> guys

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:54.849 
then will these the rest of the guys

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:57.300 
then will these the rest of the guys
again<00:06:55.180> have<00:06:55.300> to<00:06:55.360> run<00:06:55.569> hard<00:06:55.779> to<00:06:56.169> to<00:06:56.620> round<00:06:56.949> us<00:06:57.159> up

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
again have to run hard to to round us up

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.909 
again have to run hard to to round us up
and<00:06:58.000> of<00:06:58.089> course<00:06:58.120> he<00:06:58.360> went<00:06:58.770> sensationally<00:06:59.770> out

00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 
and of course he went sensationally out

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:02.429 
and of course he went sensationally out
there<00:07:00.189> on<00:07:00.310> cross-country<00:07:00.779> just<00:07:01.779> sensation

00:07:02.429 --> 00:07:02.439 
there on cross-country just sensation

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:04.469 
there on cross-country just sensation
and<00:07:02.560> that<00:07:03.310> and<00:07:03.550> the<00:07:03.669> interesting<00:07:03.819> thing<00:07:04.120> was

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:04.479 
and that and the interesting thing was

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:06.689 
and that and the interesting thing was
by<00:07:04.719> the<00:07:04.810> time<00:07:05.080> I<00:07:05.110> was<00:07:05.500> coming<00:07:05.889> back<00:07:05.919> around<00:07:06.250> on

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:06.699 
by the time I was coming back around on

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:08.879 
by the time I was coming back around on
to<00:07:06.849> the<00:07:07.060> the<00:07:07.330> sort<00:07:07.659> of<00:07:07.750> nine<00:07:07.990> minute<00:07:08.469> marker

and the 10-minute mark earth they're

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:13.309 
and the 10-minute mark earth they're
grinding<00:07:10.930> minutes<00:07:11.649> they're<00:07:11.770> really<00:07:12.399> savage

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319 
grinding minutes they're really savage

pounding away just this doesn't just

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:20.249 
pounding away just this doesn't just
like<00:07:18.639> when<00:07:18.879> he<00:07:18.909> went<00:07:19.149> out<00:07:19.300> the<00:07:19.330> gates<00:07:19.719> and

the sport because in Hong Kong just
three<00:07:45.190> weeks<00:07:45.370> ago<00:07:45.900> the<00:07:47.460> Olympic<00:07:48.460> track<00:07:48.760> was

three weeks ago the Olympic track was
eight<00:07:49.330> minutes<00:07:49.780> in<00:07:50.050> in<00:07:50.830> length<00:07:51.220> this<00:07:51.670> horse<00:07:52.060> in

eight minutes in in length this horse in
