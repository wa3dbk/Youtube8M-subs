heavier<00:04:40.090> is<00:04:40.360> a<00:04:40.419> little<00:04:40.720> bit<00:04:40.810> bigger<00:04:41.110> but<00:04:41.680> the

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
heavier is a little bit bigger but the

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.600 
heavier is a little bit bigger but the
people<00:04:42.669> is<00:04:42.850> exactly<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:43.750> same<00:04:43.930> size<00:04:44.490> you<00:04:45.490> know

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
there's really no difference between

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.230 
there's really no difference between
them<00:04:48.810> this<00:04:49.810> one<00:04:49.990> has<00:04:50.080> more<00:04:50.500> memory<00:04:51.010> and<00:04:51.240> the

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240

I'm not going to try here because it's

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.460 
I'm not going to try here because it's
adharmic<00:05:03.700> dice<00:05:04.050> doesn't<00:05:05.050> have<00:05:05.139> the<00:05:05.260> same
