00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
in the US and the contemporary look and

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.480 
in the US and the contemporary look and
are<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.619> starting<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:04.979> see<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.340> these<00:02:05.430> are

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
are you starting to see that these are

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.219 
are you starting to see that these are
moving<00:02:06.000> over<00:02:06.090> into<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.540> into<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.930> United

moving over into the into the United

absolutely<00:02:08.280> quilters<00:02:08.789> there<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.509> think

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
absolutely quilters there and I think

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.270 
absolutely quilters there and I think
the<00:02:09.810> reason<00:02:10.140> for<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.349> is<00:02:10.649> there<00:02:10.800> such<00:02:11.069> a

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
the reason for that is there such a

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.000 
the reason for that is there such a
cross<00:02:11.640> exchange<00:02:12.270> between<00:02:12.780> Japan<00:02:13.170> and

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
cross exchange between Japan and

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.710 
cross exchange between Japan and
of<00:02:14.190> course<00:02:14.430> when<00:02:14.580> we<00:02:14.670> go<00:02:14.820> to<00:02:14.880> Houston<00:02:15.120> we<00:02:15.540> see

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
of course when we go to Houston we see

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.660 
of course when we go to Houston we see
all<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:15.960> these<00:02:16.230> beautiful<00:02:16.290> Japanese<00:02:17.190> quilts

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
all of these beautiful Japanese quilts

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.760 
all of these beautiful Japanese quilts
and<00:02:17.880> so<00:02:18.480> many<00:02:18.630> American<00:02:19.080> quilters<00:02:19.440> have<00:02:19.650> been

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
and so many American quilters have been

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.040 
and so many American quilters have been
traveling<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.310> Japan<00:02:20.460> as<00:02:20.820> well<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.390> they're

traveling to Japan as well and they're

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.840 
traveling to Japan as well and they're
starting<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.500> develop<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.100> appreciation

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
starting to develop that appreciation

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.330 
starting to develop that appreciation

a Japanese restaurant and that's what

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
in the current trend of Grande charcoal

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.310 
in the current trend of Grande charcoal
well<00:02:45.150> let's<00:02:45.300> go<00:02:45.450> back<00:02:45.660> again<00:02:45.960> to<00:02:46.170> these

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
well let's go back again to these

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.530 
well let's go back again to these
contemporary<00:02:47.070> fabrics<00:02:47.760> because<00:02:47.940> as<00:02:48.360> I<00:02:48.480> said

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
contemporary fabrics because as I said

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.310 
contemporary fabrics because as I said
earlier<00:02:49.670> traditionally<00:02:50.670> in<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:51.390> u.s.<00:02:51.720> these

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
earlier traditionally in the u.s. these

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.020 
earlier traditionally in the u.s. these
two<00:02:52.650> colors<00:02:52.950> have<00:02:53.190> been<00:02:53.220> considered<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.880> bit

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
two colors have been considered a bit

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.700 
two colors have been considered a bit
country<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.720> in<00:02:55.080> Japan<00:02:55.380> they're<00:02:55.560> very

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
country and in Japan they're very

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.200 
country and in Japan they're very
contemporary<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.490> we're<00:02:56.730> probably<00:02:56.850> gonna<00:02:57.030> be

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
contemporary and we're probably gonna be

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.120 
contemporary and we're probably gonna be
seeing<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.600> influence<00:02:58.500> coming<00:02:58.710> over<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.040> the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
seeing that influence coming over to the

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.040 
seeing that influence coming over to the
United<00:02:59.430> States<00:02:59.670> what<00:02:59.850> you<00:02:59.940> think<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.390> think<00:03:00.570> so

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
United States what you think I think so

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.230 
United States what you think I think so
and<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.830> would<00:03:02.010> say<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.580> it's<00:03:02.850> kind<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.150> a

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
and I would say that it's kind of a

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.850 
and I would say that it's kind of a
paradox<00:03:03.660> in<00:03:03.900> Japan<00:03:04.260> because<00:03:04.650> it's

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
paradox in Japan because it's

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.250 
paradox in Japan because it's
traditional<00:03:05.520> and<00:03:06.180> contemporary<00:03:06.540> at<00:03:06.960> the<00:03:07.050> same

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
traditional and contemporary at the same

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.550 
traditional and contemporary at the same
time<00:03:07.560> mm-hmm<00:03:08.430> well<00:03:09.360> I<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.900> actually<00:03:10.440> brought

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
time mm-hmm well I you actually brought

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.250 
time mm-hmm well I you actually brought
these<00:03:10.770> packets<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.550> fabrics<00:03:12.390> here<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:12.870> tell

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
these packets of fabrics here and tell

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.770 
these packets of fabrics here and tell
me<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.440> story<00:03:13.470> behind<00:03:13.920> these<00:03:14.360> yes<00:03:15.360> this<00:03:15.600> is<00:03:15.750> a

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
me the story behind these yes this is a

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.170 
me the story behind these yes this is a
wonderful<00:03:15.900> Japanese<00:03:16.500> tradition<00:03:17.400> in<00:03:17.700> Japan

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
wonderful Japanese tradition in Japan

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.540 
wonderful Japanese tradition in Japan
because<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:19.020> fabric<00:03:19.410> is<00:03:19.560> so<00:03:19.739> expensive<00:03:20.160> and

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
because the fabric is so expensive and

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.670 
because the fabric is so expensive and
of<00:03:20.640> course<00:03:20.670> their<00:03:21.030> space<00:03:21.330> is<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:21.720> limited<00:03:21.750> they

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
of course their space is so limited they

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.990 
of course their space is so limited they
tend<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.040> think<00:03:23.130> of<00:03:23.340> things<00:03:23.520> in<00:03:23.820> small

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
tend to think of things in small

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.270 
tend to think of things in small
packages<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:24.900> so<00:03:25.440> there's<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.709> traditional

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
packages and so there's a traditional

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.120 
packages and so there's a traditional
gift<00:03:26.459> of<00:03:26.730> giving<00:03:26.910> fabric<00:03:27.420> in<00:03:27.600> Japan<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.230> these

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
gift of giving fabric in Japan and these

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.650 
gift of giving fabric in Japan and these
days<00:03:29.370> what<00:03:29.610> they<00:03:29.730> do<00:03:29.790> with<00:03:30.150> quilting<00:03:30.510> fabric

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
days what they do with quilting fabric

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.170 
days what they do with quilting fabric
is<00:03:31.020> they<00:03:31.140> will<00:03:31.320> cut<00:03:31.530> tiny<00:03:31.800> little<00:03:32.040> pieces<00:03:32.340> fold

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
is they will cut tiny little pieces fold

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.449 
is they will cut tiny little pieces fold
them<00:03:33.330> up<00:03:33.450> into<00:03:33.690> little<00:03:34.590> packets<00:03:35.070> like<00:03:35.220> this

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
them up into little packets like this

they<00:04:09.150> would<00:04:09.300> buy<00:04:09.450> fabric<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.400> so<00:04:11.400> you

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
they would buy fabric and so you

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.280 
they would buy fabric and so you
