00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 in the next action we will deal 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.970
 with the fundamentals of imaging 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.710
 diagnostics 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.219
 this will be a relatively short topic 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.110
 as these basics are basically in the 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.540
 state exam can no longer be queried 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.810
 That was the topic of the first state examination 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.220
 and these topics are just not back 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.789
 were recorded in the framework of the hammer 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.010
 axams we start with the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.730
 radiation exposure 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.560
 what does one mean now 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.769
 radiation exposure for each of us 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.940
 what was asked is how high the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.550
 natural radiation in 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.110
 germany is per citizen and year 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.960
 that's about 2 1 millisievert that 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.700
 depends on where you live so that 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.989
 is region dependent is the first 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.450
 our second part of it too 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.610
 depending on which floor you live as 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.649
 eg cellar apartments to expensive apartments 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.059
 there is the radiation exposure over the 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.309
 terrestrial radiation a bit 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.140
 higher if I'm in the mountains now 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.160
 living then is the cosmic radiation 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.770
 a little bit higher 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.579
 the artificial radiation exposure to us 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.790
 per year 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.570
 I say once overtaken is about 0 1 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.299
 milliSievert 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.950
 that is radiation that adds up 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.490
 the nuclear power plants from the nuclear accident 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.340
 from the nuclear weapons test 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.750
 the relatively small number always 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.030
 was queried again 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.350
 the mean radiation dose through 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.390
 medical applications per 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.020
 citizen is about 19 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.299
 milliSievert 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.880
 that's a lot when you do that 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.350
 compares to the natural 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.930
 sources of radiation and one must also say 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.850
 that every year more will be 90 percent 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.640
 this radiation pollution is caused by 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.649
 the ct applications the x-rays 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.409
 applications and are the graphic 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.299
 Investigations, on the other hand, are relative 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.320
 to estimate low 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.509
 then I have to pay a few 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.009
 maybe brought with you 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.470
 times can lead to the moment 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.200
 what we actually do when we do one 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.479
 X-ray examination order and which 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.909
 Radiation exposure of the patient exposed 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.159
 for example, so that's a x-ray 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.429
 thorax pa so beam path of 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.850
 postareal to antalya about 0.02 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.340
 millisievert compare 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.840
 that is of course a bit 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.520
 depending on how big and how heavy 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.260
 the patient is but that's about it 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.090
 the median order of magnitude over which we 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.220
 Talk here and you can compare that 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.810
 with three days in the open air 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.570
 the natural radiation is so 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.820
 it becomes relatively little problematic then 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.160
 but here in the area of 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.600
 lumbar spine should turn in 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.090
 two levels, for example, in boys 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.560
 women the most persistent at night or on 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.700
 weekend the emergency room come along 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.950
 back pain 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.900
 you usually know that one already 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.950
 it will not see on the radiograph 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.810
 unless of course are from the horse 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.300
 fallen or something else but i would 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.110
 I always save this investigation because 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:54.190
 here 2 4 millisievert radiation exposure 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.680
 are to be expected and that exceeds 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.680
 in principle, the annual radiation dose 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.910
 by X-rays and also the 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.950
 natural radiation means we have 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.080
 here is an investigation the more 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.580
 Radiation dose has what we do 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.200
 naturally in a year 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.520
 radiation dose would get 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.260
 and as I said, who does not necessarily 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.670
 is necessary because he is completely normal 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.380
 Back pain most often attitude 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.860
 and muscular are you have to 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.930
 that's good then the cc so 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.490
 Computer tomography of the skull are 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.870
 about two millisievert that it is not 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.550
 Dramatic if I consider what 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.590
 bleeding for indications again have 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.840
 want to exclude or just 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.940
 injuries after falling from big 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.670
 height for example 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.720
 the ct thorax abdomen is one again 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.790
 completely different story 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.110
 Here we have radiation exposure up 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.020
 25 millisieverts 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.610
 that, too, depends on how tall and 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.620
 how heavy the patient is that is 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.230
 the heavier this patient is the bigger 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.480
 is also the radiation exposure and 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.850
 just shock- chamber cds are yes 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.220
 actually from head to toe we say 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.230
 but from hack to neck and that 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.430
 then affects more thorax and nature with 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.770
 25 millisieverts 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.200
 but also in addition to the two 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.370
 millisievert for the skull 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.660
 there can be 30 very quickly 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.610
 millisievert come together if it 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.050
 now an obese patient is why 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.160
 you have to think that over well 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.020
 actually this investigation 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.950
 So it really needs it 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.120
 or maybe that's me 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.040
 can reduce a bit 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.750
 by application of sonography or 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.690
 targeted x-ray pictures 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.690
