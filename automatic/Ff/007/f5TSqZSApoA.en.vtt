00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
these construct bots that you build um

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.459 
these construct bots that you build um
like<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.940> built<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.329> obviously<00:00:57.899> from<00:00:58.140> parts

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
like I built this obviously from parts

like I built this obviously from parts
and<00:01:00.170> you<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.320> convert<00:01:01.649> them<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
and you can convert them and this is the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.179 
and you can convert them and this is the
converted<00:01:02.910> mode<00:01:03.120> from<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.690> robot<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.290> it's

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
converted mode from the robot and it's

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.460 
converted mode from the robot and it's
it's<00:01:05.369> vehicle<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.299> right<00:01:06.840> now<00:01:06.869> what<00:01:07.170> I'll<00:01:07.290> do

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
it's vehicle so right now what I'll do

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.230 
it's vehicle so right now what I'll do
is<00:01:07.619> I'll<00:01:07.710> convert<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.400> robot<00:01:08.580> show<00:01:09.180> you

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
is I'll convert it to the robot show you

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.580 
is I'll convert it to the robot show you
what<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.900> we'll<00:01:10.020> wrap<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.350> review

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
what that is and we'll wrap the review

alright guys and here's Soundwave
construct<00:01:32.290> bots<00:01:32.530> sound<00:01:32.890> way<00:01:33.100> of<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.860> robot

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
construct bots sound way of in robot

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.860 
construct bots sound way of in robot
mode<00:01:36.250> now<00:01:36.640> he<00:01:36.700> looks<00:01:36.970> really<00:01:37.330> cool<00:01:37.600> actually

um<00:01:38.760> I<00:01:39.760> definitely<00:01:40.240> like<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.600> look<00:01:40.840> of<00:01:40.960> a<00:01:41.080> man

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
um I definitely like the look of a man

under<00:01:41.470> that<00:01:42.100> tone<00:01:42.400> of<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:42.730> underside<00:01:43.510> of<00:01:43.540> the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
under that tone of the underside of the

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.810 
under that tone of the underside of the
plastic<00:01:44.410> being<00:01:44.710> yellow<00:01:45.010> is<00:01:45.160> actually<00:01:45.550> really

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
plastic being yellow is actually really

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.580 
plastic being yellow is actually really
i<00:01:46.150> thought<00:01:46.630> that<00:01:46.780> was<00:01:46.960> going<00:01:47.080> to<00:01:47.140> kind<00:01:47.350> of<00:01:47.410> like

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
i thought that was going to kind of like

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.280 
i thought that was going to kind of like
really<00:01:47.830> kill<00:01:48.040> it<00:01:48.190> for<00:01:48.340> me<00:01:48.520> but<00:01:49.390> that<00:01:49.630> the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
really kill it for me but that the

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.960 
really kill it for me but that the
plastic<00:01:50.530> under<00:01:51.010> there<00:01:51.130> actually<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:51.730> yellow

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
plastic under there actually the yellow

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.480 
plastic under there actually the yellow
color<00:01:52.300> is<00:01:52.540> actually<00:01:52.930> really<00:01:53.050> nice<00:01:53.490> obviously

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
color is actually really nice obviously

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.610 
color is actually really nice obviously
you<00:01:54.580> can<00:01:54.760> use<00:01:54.880> one<00:01:55.060> of<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.390> thrusters<00:01:56.080> here<00:01:56.440> as

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
you can use one of the thrusters here as

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.520 
you can use one of the thrusters here as
his<00:01:57.340> shoulder<00:01:58.210> cannon<00:01:58.420> and<00:01:59.080> you<00:01:59.230> can<00:01:59.380> actually

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
his shoulder cannon and you can actually

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.230 
his shoulder cannon and you can actually
I<00:01:59.860> can't<00:02:00.310> really<00:02:00.430> see<00:02:00.700> in<00:02:00.820> there<00:02:00.940> because<00:02:01.060> of

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
I can't really see in there because of

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.480 
I can't really see in there because of
the<00:02:01.300> shadow<00:02:01.570> but<00:02:01.930> it<00:02:02.710> does<00:02:02.920> look<00:02:02.950> like<00:02:03.250> there's

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
the shadow but it does look like there's

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.190 
the shadow but it does look like there's
like<00:02:03.700> a<00:02:03.729> little<00:02:03.910> cannon<00:02:04.600> in<00:02:04.750> there<00:02:04.900> and<00:02:05.020> stuff

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
like a little cannon in there and stuff

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.750 
like a little cannon in there and stuff
where<00:02:05.350> you<00:02:05.410> could<00:02:05.530> put<00:02:05.680> both<00:02:05.830> of<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.369> cannons

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
where you could put both of the cannons

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.570

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
with like little weapons that you can

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.550 
with like little weapons that you can
peg<00:02:16.930> in<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.620> his<00:02:17.770> hands<00:02:18.310> now<00:02:19.300> it<00:02:19.840> shows<00:02:20.170> in<00:02:20.470> the

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
peg in to his hands now it shows in the

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.350 
peg in to his hands now it shows in the
directions<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.280> you<00:02:21.430> should<00:02:21.610> put<00:02:21.970> plug<00:02:22.180> both

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
directions that you should put plug both

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.180 
directions that you should put plug both
these<00:02:22.660> in<00:02:22.930> there<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.320> don't<00:02:23.860> think<00:02:23.920> that's

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
these in there I don't think that's

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.420 
these in there I don't think that's
necessary<00:02:24.880> i<00:02:24.970> think<00:02:25.270> just<00:02:25.620> doing<00:02:26.620> one<00:02:27.190> on<00:02:27.220> each

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
necessary i think just doing one on each

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.330 
necessary i think just doing one on each
hand<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:27.850> pretty<00:02:28.060> good<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.890> can<00:02:30.070> get<00:02:30.220> at

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
hand is pretty good so you can get at

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.490 
hand is pretty good so you can get at
least<00:02:30.370> from<00:02:30.670> one<00:02:30.880> blaster<00:02:31.360> going<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:32.290> i

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
least from one blaster going and i

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.650 
least from one blaster going and i
really<00:02:32.770> like<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.100> now<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.280> one<00:02:33.550> cool<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.510> one

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
really like it now the one cool the one

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.270 
really like it now the one cool the one
cool<00:02:34.900> part<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:35.290> all<00:02:35.410> these<00:02:35.560> guys<00:02:35.800> is<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.220> they

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
cool part of all these guys is that they

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.240 
cool part of all these guys is that they
have<00:02:36.430> really<00:02:36.820> stiff<00:02:37.510> ball<00:02:37.810> joints<00:02:38.290> so<00:02:39.100> the

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
have really stiff ball joints so the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.670 
have really stiff ball joints so the
whole<00:02:39.489> at<00:02:39.700> pool<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.120> pretty<00:02:40.450> well<00:02:40.630> I<00:02:40.870> mean<00:02:41.560> it

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
whole at pool is pretty well I mean it

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.140 
whole at pool is pretty well I mean it
would<00:02:41.769> take<00:02:41.950> quite<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.250> bit<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.430> force<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.880> get

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
would take quite a bit of force to get

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.330 
would take quite a bit of force to get
one<00:02:43.269> of<00:02:43.360> these<00:02:43.420> guys<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:44.019> tip<00:02:44.260> over<00:02:44.410> you'd<00:02:45.190> have

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
I'm like I said this guy he's pretty

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.270 
I'm like I said this guy he's pretty
much<00:02:49.420> holding<00:02:49.690> true<00:02:50.080> he's<00:02:50.680> just<00:02:50.830> rocking<00:02:51.250> back

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280

and<00:02:51.430> forth<00:02:51.640> on<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.090> little<00:02:52.300> gap<00:02:52.510> between<00:02:52.720> his

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.540 
and forth on the little gap between his
foot<00:02:53.290> so<00:02:53.530> that's<00:02:53.739> actually<00:02:53.920> kind<00:02:54.250> of<00:02:54.280> funny
