00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
you know like a forced ferment test to

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.239 
you know like a forced ferment test to
see<00:01:48.270> how<00:01:48.869> far<00:01:49.079> your<00:01:49.229> words<00:01:49.409> gonna<00:01:49.619> attenuate

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:50.249 
see how far your words gonna attenuate

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:53.149 
see how far your words gonna attenuate
because<00:01:50.700> always<00:01:50.850> people<00:01:51.210> say<00:01:51.390> oh<00:01:51.780> my<00:01:52.649> beer

because always people say oh my beer
didn't<00:01:53.399> attenuate<00:01:53.820> enough<00:01:54.060> I'm<00:01:54.299> like<00:01:54.420> well

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
didn't attenuate enough I'm like well

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.480 
didn't attenuate enough I'm like well
did<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.109> do<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.259> forceful<00:01:55.710> man<00:01:55.829> test<00:01:56.039> I'll<00:01:56.249> tell

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
did you do a forceful man test I'll tell

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.160 
did you do a forceful man test I'll tell
you<00:01:56.609> whether<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.999> did<00:01:57.149> or<00:01:57.210> didn't<00:01:57.630> whether

you whether it did or didn't whether
it's<00:01:58.289> a<00:01:58.350> recipe<00:01:58.649> problem<00:01:59.100> or<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.609> yeast<00:01:59.850> problem

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
it's a recipe problem or a yeast problem

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.539 
it's a recipe problem or a yeast problem
so<00:02:01.259> things<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.310> lot<00:02:02.520> of

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.669 
so things like that it's a lot of
practical<00:02:03.390> hands-on<00:02:03.719> advice<00:02:03.869> there's<00:02:04.590> a

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
practical hands-on advice there's a
