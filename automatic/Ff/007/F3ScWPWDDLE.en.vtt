00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
scratch because then you can make your

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.270

getting in some specialty shop in Europe

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.170 
getting in some specialty shop in Europe
it<00:03:14.810> has<00:03:15.020> about<00:03:15.350> a<00:03:15.530> third<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.010> fat<00:03:16.490> of<00:03:16.820> ice

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
it has about a third the fat of ice

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.090 
it has about a third the fat of ice
cream<00:03:17.540> so<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:17.870> put<00:03:18.050> a<00:03:18.080> lot<00:03:18.260> less<00:03:18.470> cream<00:03:18.800> in<00:03:18.980> it

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
cream so you put a lot less cream in it

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.310 
cream so you put a lot less cream in it
and<00:03:19.310> then<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.209> other<00:03:20.240> thing<00:03:20.660> is<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:20.840> ice

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
and then the other thing is that ice

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.199 
and then the other thing is that ice
cream<00:03:21.709> can<00:03:22.070> have<00:03:22.280> from<00:03:22.580> fifty<00:03:22.940> to<00:03:22.970> one<00:03:23.120> hundred

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
cream can have from fifty to one hundred

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.900

percent<00:03:23.420> of<00:03:23.780> air<00:03:23.990> volume<00:03:24.500> pumped<00:03:24.890> into<00:03:25.040> it<00:03:25.370> so

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
percent of air volume pumped into it so

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.030 
percent of air volume pumped into it so
it's<00:03:26.060> really<00:03:26.300> light<00:03:26.480> and<00:03:26.660> fluffy<00:03:26.870> our<00:03:27.650> gelato

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
more many people have this idea that

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.370 
more many people have this idea that
gelato<00:03:49.280> is<00:03:49.580> more<00:03:49.910> fattening<00:03:50.390> than<00:03:50.870> ice<00:03:51.050> cream

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
that it has you know because it tastes

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.140 
that it has you know because it tastes
so<00:03:53.360> good<00:03:53.630> they<00:03:54.320> confuse<00:03:54.920> that<00:03:55.160> with<00:03:55.220> cream<00:03:55.880> and

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
we have to educate them in understanding

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.420 
we have to educate them in understanding
that<00:03:59.540> it's<00:03:59.780> not<00:04:00.200> the<00:04:00.410> cream<00:04:00.739> that<00:04:00.770> gives<00:04:01.280> it
