00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello girls today I 'm coming back 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.980
 you 're talking about a foundation it's all about 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.740
 of the one I presented to you in a 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.559
 of my last halls made him of 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.410
 maybelline that I took in shades 220 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.719
 nude beige and I thought that like 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.119
 I had just made a mask and that I 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.730
 some traces I do not know if you 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.800
 will see red well actually I do not know 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.539
 why I reacted to my mask this 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.820
 this time on what I usually do 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.680
 not and so we see a little bit of 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.349
 redness and I thought it was 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.940
 pile right the right time to test this 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.960
 little stick and see a little bit what 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.550
 he has in his stomach 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.010
 so here more closely you can see 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.840
 the rashes actually I was in the process of 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.320
 tell you we'll see if they arrive 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.300
 to camouflage her already to start the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.219
 tips for use apply 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.719
 partouche on the whole face and 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.420
 went gingerly 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:59.309
 circular is gone we are starting 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:05.010
 by the forehead the nose a little bit on the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:07.619
 days and the chin and I decided to 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:14.610
 apply it with Marc de Breucq films 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:19.950
 8 technical to see a little bit here 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:23.030
 relies well and we can say that he 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.030
 applies pretty well 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:39.700
 so let's see while at the level of 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.320
 the coverage I do not know if you're going 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.380
 see my still sees a little bit 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.720
 the demarcation but normally one has to 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.170
 still less so I think it's 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.729
 not bad 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.970
 besides it might be necessary that 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.970
 I try with a second layer 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.829
 and then it's even less so already at 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.349
 know how to modulate the coverage in 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.450
 by putting a little bit here and there 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:19.319
 so not bad for the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:23.099
 rest he has a mattifying side no 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.560
 shine no I think you see 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.879
 although it does not shine at the level of 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.190
 feeling of lightness 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.200
 I would not say it's so light 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.150
 that the water table in real but 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.890
 light there's no need to say I do not really 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.650
 the impression of having cast in 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.480
 super beefy super lot to have skin 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.489
 who chokes and for the ends 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.049
 actually it's not finished powdery 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.670
 so I think it's well- defined on 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.760
 velvety finished cardboard 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.260
 yes yes we can say that 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.230
 we can powder and overcoat of course 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.099
 but actually it's pretty cool 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.810
 so just still to finish 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.090
 the smell is not there 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.430
 so it's not bad anymore and so for 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.470
 conclude for those who love them 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.790
 stick foundations looking for 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.530
 a rather low coverage to modulable 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.109
 I would not say moderately better but 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.930
 flexible in any case and who loves the 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.819
 light side on the skin you can there 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.430
 to go very sincerely it's rather 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.109
 nice the matte side and there I would say 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.810
 not that it's extraordinary because 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:27.239
 that's not how to say he does not 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.190
 does not give the feeling of being archi 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.700
 arch math is due to be finished 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.919
 velvety 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.989
 but in any case he is matifying that 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:36.750
 it's safe and at the application level 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.250
 is good for a stick foundation 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.599
 the fact that easily applies to 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.040
 brush is still not negligible 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.150
 because I did not think that 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.910
 I could get to go as fast 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.859
 so so on arrival it is rather 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.630
 nice so here's this little review 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.940
 coming to an end if you too have 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.290
 tested the made mine of maybelline especially 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.090
 do not hesitate to let me know under 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.650
 video to give you your impressions and 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.959
 we have during the next video I you 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.139
 kisses very very loudly and I say to myself 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.139
 tomorrow
