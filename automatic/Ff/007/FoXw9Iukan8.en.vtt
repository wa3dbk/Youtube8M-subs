percent now there's two reasons we've

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.119 
percent now there's two reasons we've
done<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.359> one<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.229> save<00:01:04.440> energy<00:01:04.650> because

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
done that one is to save energy because

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.880 
done that one is to save energy because
even<00:01:06.030> though<00:01:06.119> 10%<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.380> lighting<00:01:07.710> can

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
even though 10% of the lighting can

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.190 
even though 10% of the lighting can
stable<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.340> minor<00:01:08.579> electricity<00:01:09.149> bill<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.960> also

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
stable a minor electricity bill but also

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.080 
stable a minor electricity bill but also
these<00:01:10.829> bulbs<00:01:11.130> are<00:01:11.310> going<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.490> last<00:01:11.610> twice<00:01:12.030> as

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
these bulbs are going to last twice as

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.179 
these bulbs are going to last twice as
long<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.659> because<00:01:12.869> they're<00:01:13.259> damaged<00:01:13.530> 10%

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
long just because they're damaged 10%

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.530 
long just because they're damaged 10%
they<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.520> make<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.820> bit<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.149> a<00:01:15.210> difference

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
they can make that bit of a difference

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.600 
they can make that bit of a difference
so<00:01:15.750> if<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.409> customer<00:01:16.590> comes<00:01:17.009> home<00:01:17.219> with<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.490> bag

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
so if the customer comes home with a bag

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.429 
so if the customer comes home with a bag
of<00:01:17.789> groceries<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.210> they<00:01:18.539> you<00:01:18.810> know<00:01:18.840> tough<00:01:19.229> hit

integrate<00:03:25.980> them<00:03:26.100> a<00:03:26.190> little<00:03:26.400> bit<00:03:26.549> because

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
integrate them a little bit because

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.220 
integrate them a little bit because
they're<00:03:27.150> going<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.390> have<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.600> TV<00:03:27.780> on<00:03:27.959> or

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
they're going to have the TV on or

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.740 
they're going to have the TV on or
something<00:03:28.500> like<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.850> but<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.359> main<00:03:30.540> focus

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
something like that but the main focus

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.630 
something like that but the main focus
is<00:03:30.989> now<00:03:31.170> over<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.680> counter<00:03:32.040> area<00:03:32.310> where

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
is now over the counter area where

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.640 
is now over the counter area where
they'll<00:03:32.760> be<00:03:32.850> eating<00:03:33.269> there's<00:03:34.109> still<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.440> little

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
they'll be eating there's still a little

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.949 
they'll be eating there's still a little
bit<00:03:34.859> of<00:03:34.950> light<00:03:35.130> in<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.730> kitchen<00:03:36.269> so<00:03:36.720> they<00:03:36.810> can

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
bit of light in the kitchen so they can

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.780 
bit of light in the kitchen so they can
still<00:03:37.170> get<00:03:37.350> some<00:03:37.380> things<00:03:37.799> you<00:03:37.980> know<00:03:38.069> but

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
still get some things you know but

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.270 
still get some things you know but
that's<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.630> main<00:03:39.750> focus<00:03:40.109> now<00:03:40.140> is<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.829> counter

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
that's the main focus now is the counter

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.660 
that's the main focus now is the counter
area<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:42.870> last<00:03:43.049> scene<00:03:43.380> is<00:03:43.560> called<00:03:43.799> Olaf<00:03:44.250> which

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
area the last scene is called Olaf which

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.580 
area the last scene is called Olaf which
we<00:03:44.819> started<00:03:45.239> with<00:03:45.420> actually<00:03:45.930> which<00:03:46.230> simply

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
we started with actually which simply

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.710 
we started with actually which simply
turned<00:03:46.799> all<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.250> lights<00:03:47.280> completely<00:03:48.030> off<00:03:48.389> to

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
turned all the lights completely off to

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.500 
turned all the lights completely off to
zero<00:03:49.130> next<00:03:50.130> I'm<00:03:50.400> going<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.579> show<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:50.760> what<00:03:51.389> the

keypads
and<00:03:52.290> switches<00:03:52.739> actually<00:03:53.220> look<00:03:53.370> like<00:03:53.400> and

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
and switches actually look like and

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.250 
and switches actually look like and
explain<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.209> little<00:03:54.359> bit<00:03:54.510> more<00:03:54.720> about<00:03:54.989> how<00:03:55.200> the

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
thing about the system as opposed to

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:36.900 
thing about the system as opposed to
other<00:04:35.770> lighting<00:04:35.980> control<00:04:36.250> systems<00:04:36.640> is<00:04:36.850> that

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
other lighting control systems is that

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.270 
other lighting control systems is that
it's<00:04:37.420> wireless<00:04:37.810> so<00:04:38.290> all<00:04:38.650> you<00:04:38.770> have<00:04:38.890> to<00:04:39.010> do<00:04:39.130> in

it's wireless so all you have to do in

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.610 
it's wireless so all you have to do in
an<00:04:39.400> existing<00:04:39.700> house<00:04:40.000> for<00:04:40.300> example<00:04:40.660> is<00:04:41.170> replace

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
an existing house for example is replace

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.930 
an existing house for example is replace
the<00:04:41.800> switches<00:04:42.130> you<00:04:42.220> already<00:04:42.460> have<00:04:42.610> with<00:04:42.760> these

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
the switches you already have with these

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.240 
the switches you already have with these
and<00:04:43.330> a<00:04:43.840> bell<00:04:44.110> lighting<00:04:44.380> control<00:04:44.650> system<00:04:45.010> it's

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
and a bell lighting control system it's

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.820 
and a bell lighting control system it's
just<00:04:45.460> as<00:04:45.640> simple<00:04:45.820> this<00:04:46.630> also<00:04:46.930> means<00:04:47.320> that<00:04:47.590> the

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
just as simple this also means that the

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.580 
just as simple this also means that the
system<00:04:47.980> is<00:04:48.220> expandable<00:04:48.850> very<00:04:49.210> easily<00:04:49.480> so<00:04:50.320> this

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
system is expandable very easily so this

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.770 
system is expandable very easily so this
client<00:04:50.830> for<00:04:51.100> instance<00:04:51.430> just<00:04:52.000> installed<00:04:52.480> it<00:04:52.570> in

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
client for instance just installed it in
