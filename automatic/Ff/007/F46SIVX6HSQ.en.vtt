00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.160
 Clear 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.860
 i

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.840
 hello coleguillas today what fun is it 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:34.960
 learn we are going to teach you how to do 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.960
 a minion welcome and we started 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.350
 we're back good guys in the 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.829
 today's video we will learn how to make a 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.710
 mini ballet so first of all 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.990
 we need a yellow egg 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.540
 then let's open the egg 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.820
 we open the egg and we have to 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.130
 introduce a five cent coin 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.640
 or two cents if you do not have five 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.030
 centers we are going to introduce we are going to 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.040
 make the egg and then you'll see 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.460
 because we need the currency according 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.430
 now we also make a piece of 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.770
 blue paper voucher is cut I already have 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.850
 here a piece already cut from a 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.860
 centimeter and a half 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.990
 so what we have to do is the 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.220
 part of the bottom of the egg 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.000
 we have to place this paper tape 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.710
 blue 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.710
 then what are we going to do 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.700
 take a little tape let 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.829
 down 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.350
 then we take a little tape 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.630
 adhesive 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:56.369
 that I already have it cut and 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.369
 we hope not 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.600
 plus 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.140
 now 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.899
 let's put the two eyes 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.709
 here I have the glue 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.989
 the glue and we're going to paste the two 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:19.870
 little eyes because this mini I'm 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.870
 doing right now it's called field 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.579
 have these eyes 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.239
 that the eyes stick together are eyes of 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.239
 plastic mobile 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.800
 port 1 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:44.030
 Now I'm going to put in another one that's fine with 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:47.260
 glue so you can paste if you do not 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.260
 it does not hit 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.040
 to place the other eye in order 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:03.409
 It is easy to remove 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:05.540
 so then we must make now 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:09.799
 so we have to make him with the marker 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:14.680
 black is worth around the glasses for 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.680
 hold on then let's do 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:22.890
 I have already finished the acb around the 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.440
 minimum around to hold on 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.420
 glasses that also the mouth is worth 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.270
 to not take much the video much the 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.880
 mouth and up here to the fact three 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.970
 movies with black marker 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.590
 see what chuli you remember that 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.160
 I told you that I needed a 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.530
 five cent coin is for this 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.510
 because now the mini is placed in here 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.510
 plans and you can move 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.530
 it does not fall 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:57.740
 here I have already made another minimum of 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.290
 this scale that has only one ojito 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.980
 guys and if for whatever it is not to have 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.650
 Yellow eggs are worth nothing 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.020
 because here we have several eggs 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.830
 different color voucher are mini of 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.050
 different color 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.680
 here we have a brown one and here a man 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.799
 It's dark in the suit because you can 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.870
 leave blue only or if you want to 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.830
 example you want to make a drawing for 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.289
 and what I want and it's worth 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.870
 I hope that boy I hope this video

 you liked what you can do at home 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.280
