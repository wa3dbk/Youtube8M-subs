a<00:02:48.030> physical<00:02:48.480> game<00:02:49.010> that<00:02:50.010> happens<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.850> I

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
a physical game that happens and I

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.840 
a physical game that happens and I
didn't<00:02:52.080> even<00:02:52.110> add<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.560> penalty<00:02:53.130> on<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.280> play<00:02:53.370> so
