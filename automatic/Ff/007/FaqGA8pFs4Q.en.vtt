00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.790
 hi everyone I'm checked and we're here 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.230
 in a new trÃ nsit guide and what 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.830
 let's do today is explained enough 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.810
 things that were pending and good 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.900
 we start here at the bank directly 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.450
 and let's go to see how to save and 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.010
 to take money out 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.720
 I'm quite important because what 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.690
 you can take in any game by 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.100
 example this game if you keep 10,000 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.170
 then the following ones you will have 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.390
 available and what you have to do is 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.570
 one day in here and you will have two keys 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.450
 in a drawer and in the one on the left 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.880
 you can withdraw the money and with that of the 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.100
 right deposits it jce keep in mind 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.239
 that to deposit the money deposits 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.950
 law of thousand in thousand but to withdraw in 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.390
 retire is 900 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.670
 well, you can remove a thousand but 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.960
 really withdraw the 900 because they charge you 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.250
 a rate of 100 to take it into account 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.610
 and well then we will return here to the bank 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.860
 but let's go to something else first 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.720
 and well before the city we 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.820
 to take advantage and I'll show you where 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.400
 you have the bleachers in text if someone 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.620
 you are interested here in this 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.420
 door that is closed and you have it 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.200
 electricity cart here if 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.360
 you remember there was a piece of him 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.909
 of the bus you can find in start 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.640
 the bus and pretty that you want in 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.100
 texas that are worth 250 and will give us four 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.380
 grenades and from that moment each 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.210
 once we find ammunition has a 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.950
 initial zombie because it does not respond to 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.119
 won in text not only so that 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.810
 if you knew someone 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.479
 Interested in using them and we will continue 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.740
 we go now to the farm and what 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.159
 let's see is how to use the fridge 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.140
 and it has a pretty similar use 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.080
 to the bank with the money simply 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.700
 you can leave a weapon and in the 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.560
 people who play a game again 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.929
 transit so I can recover it 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.560
 and it does not have much else it costs nothing and 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.489
 Black leave the weapon or pick it up 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.680
 simply that there are some weapons that do not 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.270
 he leaves them then deposit the for example 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.970
 the normal gun we can not deposit 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.520
 I think that the ray track 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.360
 we can not leave either but good here 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.930
 I bring a rpt and the rpd leaves us 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.480
 save it so I leave it here and 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.459
 and pick up at another time 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.799
 good continuing to that low also 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.959
 he wanted to show us what you can find 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.530
 the clayburgh is here in this door 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.720
 where 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.680
 where do you find another part of the bus 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.750
 and you have it here on the wall 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.150
 and well they are going to give us 22 playmore 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.150
 which can be quite useful useful in 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.830
 train if we use when we have 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.050
 enough changes together if we want 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.319
 make stumps or directly kill them and 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.689
 well let's continue 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.159
 we are here again in the bank and what 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.299
 that I want to show you now is how 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.160
 spend money to our classmates 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.020
 Even if they pass us money 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.090
 and not proven before because I had to 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.620
 go for the knuckles and since the 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.230
 we have seen here fallen back marito 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.820
 like the one we 've seen at the beginning and 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.160
 in this case it is disabled for it 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.960
 to activate it we need the knuckles 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.990
 we have to strike and now 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:31.290
 activate as you see puts add 1000 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:34.380
 and it has an amount of 100 just like 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.630
 before when we saw that now take out 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.630
 money they charged us 100 because now it's 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.350
 same as we deposit 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.270
 1000 and we will be charged 1100 in this case 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.250
 then whoever puts money will put 1100 and 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.660
 the one who picks up will collect 1000 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.320
 In this way, a 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.150
 little symbol then you go through it and 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.680
 you collect the money 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.260
 you do not have to do it a thousand times 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.629
 thousand you can put for example if you give 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.689
 twice add then add 'aces' 2000 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:06.630
 they will charge 2200 and the companion power will 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:08.760
 will collect and collect 2000 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.890
 It can be quite interesting if you come 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.370
 by train follow more than one and one of them 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.530
 he does not have much money he is left without 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.480
 money for whatever 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.209
 you can spend money and it can be 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.039
 quite useful 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.229
 and finally I wanted to show you the 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.539
 theme of teleportation I know that many 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.340
 you will know but good for those who do not 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.650
 once we turn on the electricity 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.310
 the streetlights that normally had a 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.900
 white light because they will become a light 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.040
 green 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.390
 then at that moment 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:45.190
 we can go to the lampposts and 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.110
 if he puts us, he will put on a big head 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.160
 over what you see now that in this 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.720
 I kill him 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.780
 then the next one that gets us 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.540
 above if we approach the street lamp 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.690
 will get inside now like a hole and 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.980
 a teleportation zone will be created 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.880
 this is a teleportation one you can 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:07.130
 leaving so unused is not going to go by 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.960
 example if you are for example you are 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.630
 going round here in the here in the 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.550
 town and you have it as a way of 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:19.000
 escape if they are very overwhelmed 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.000
 Well, you are going to teleport 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:26.169
 well there's a lot of there's a lot of 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:28.990
 lampposts in all the whole map of 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:31.629
 through and then it 's good that you know 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:36.960
 all places because it's a way 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:38.960
 much faster than going on the bus 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.539
 and good for example here we appear in 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.400
 the wheat area if we want to go by 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:46.680
 example to money then we turn to 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.080
 put in the teleportation until we 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.569
 out 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:55.520
 and today we are going to catch another bighead 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:57.229
 and lowers us between transportation again 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.560
 You can do this as many times as 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:59.560
 you want 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.669
 it is used enough to enter if by 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:06.830
 example if it kills you at the beginning and 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:09.259
 you have to go to bring the drinks of 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.020
 new then quite important because it 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:15.470
 it takes a long time and nothing else I hope 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.120
 that you have liked is this guide and 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.470
 As I always tell you, we'll see you 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.470
 next video goodbye
