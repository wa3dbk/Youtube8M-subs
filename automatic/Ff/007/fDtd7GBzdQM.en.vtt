lines<00:05:30.180> the<00:05:30.539> choke<00:05:30.900> points<00:05:31.380> I<00:05:31.500> mean<00:05:31.680> it's<00:05:32.130> so

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
lines the choke points I mean it's so

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.939 
lines the choke points I mean it's so
far<00:05:33.360> at<00:05:33.539> least<00:05:33.599> this<00:05:34.050> map<00:05:34.320> is<00:05:34.560> really

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
far at least this map is really

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:37.279 
far at least this map is really
well-balanced<00:05:35.639> and<00:05:35.699> it's<00:05:36.030> definitely<00:05:36.389> worth

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
well-balanced and it's definitely worth

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.080 
well-balanced and it's definitely worth
a<00:05:37.560> try<00:05:37.889> I<00:05:38.219> mean<00:05:39.060> I<00:05:39.210> paid<00:05:39.539> 15<00:05:40.020> euros<00:05:40.380> for
