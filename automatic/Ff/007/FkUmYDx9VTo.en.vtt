is the rear brake you make sure that
this<00:00:57.670> kills<00:00:58.000> flat<00:00:59.460> trial<00:01:00.460> up<00:01:00.670> now<00:01:02.219> right<00:01:03.219> the

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
this kills flat trial up now right the

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.100 
this kills flat trial up now right the
real<00:01:03.519> break<00:01:03.789> peels<00:01:04.059> absolute<00:01:04.360> you<00:01:04.449> find<00:01:04.750> the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
real break peels absolute you find the

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.960 
real break peels absolute you find the
disc<00:01:05.320> feels<00:01:05.590> flat<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:06.190> brakes<00:01:06.430> are<00:01:06.549> powerful

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
disc feels flat the brakes are powerful

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.170 
disc feels flat the brakes are powerful
enough<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:09.100> we're<00:01:09.280> going<00:01:09.369> to<00:01:09.460> go<00:01:09.490> right<00:01:09.759> here

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
and just fill the rest of the gears

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.050 
and just fill the rest of the gears
first

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
first

that's<00:02:02.650> the<00:02:02.799> test<00:02:03.070> i'm<00:02:03.250> just<00:02:03.400> going<00:02:03.549> to<00:02:03.579> put<00:02:03.640> it

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
that's the test i'm just going to put it

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.450 
that's the test i'm just going to put it
here<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:06.119> switch<00:02:07.119> the<00:02:07.270> camera
