00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
for flying a spinnaker one is the lines

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.340 
for flying a spinnaker one is the lines
that<00:00:21.240> we're<00:00:21.359> going<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.510> be<00:00:21.600> used<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.020> actually

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
that we're going to be used to actually

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.679 
that we're going to be used to actually
control<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.949> sail<00:00:23.130> when<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:23.460> up<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:24.570> other

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
control the sail when it's up the other

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.769 
control the sail when it's up the other
is<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:26.340> pole<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:27.029> we're<00:00:27.210> going<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.359> be<00:00:27.449> using

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
is the pole and we're going to be using

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.630 
is the pole and we're going to be using
the<00:00:27.869> pole<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.349> stabilize<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.099> sail<00:00:29.310> when<00:00:29.519> it's

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
the pole to stabilize the sail when it's

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.550 
the pole to stabilize the sail when it's
flying<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.150> then<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> last<00:00:31.230> thing<00:00:31.410> we're

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
flying and then the last thing we're

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.380 
flying and then the last thing we're
going<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.740> be<00:00:31.800> looking<00:00:32.099> at<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:33.059> spinnaker

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
going to be looking at is the spinnaker

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.520 
going to be looking at is the spinnaker
itself<00:00:33.920> and<00:00:35.300> how<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> actually<00:00:36.660> bag<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.469> a

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
itself and how to actually bag it in a

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.990 
itself and how to actually bag it in a
way<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.950> won't<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.280> any<00:00:38.430> twists<00:00:38.879> or

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
way that it won't have any twists or

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.400 
way that it won't have any twists or
hopefully<00:00:39.480> we<00:00:39.540> won't<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:39.780> any<00:00:39.989> twists<00:00:40.320> when

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
hopefully we won't have any twists when

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.229 
hopefully we won't have any twists when
it<00:00:40.530> comes<00:00:40.710> out<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.070> bag<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.820> start<00:00:42.090> with

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
it comes out of the bag to start with

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.459 
it comes out of the bag to start with
I'm<00:00:42.329> going<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.510> start<00:00:42.750> by<00:00:42.899> setting<00:00:43.140> up<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
I'm going to start by setting up the

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.290 
I'm going to start by setting up the
lines<00:00:43.710> well<00:00:44.309> what<00:00:44.520> we<00:00:44.579> need<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.789> remember<00:00:45.000> is

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
lines well what we need to remember is

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.049 
lines well what we need to remember is
that<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:46.020> sail<00:00:46.289> usually<00:00:47.010> will<00:00:47.160> hoist<00:00:47.489> from

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
that the sail usually will hoist from

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.180 
that the sail usually will hoist from
the<00:00:48.180> side<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.780> downwind<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> lowered

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
the side that is downwind so the lowered

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.860 
the side that is downwind so the lowered
side<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.520> where<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.760> sail<00:00:50.969> goes<00:00:51.149> up<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
side is where the sail goes up so the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.360 
side is where the sail goes up so the
first<00:00:52.079> line<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.500> I'm<00:00:52.590> setting<00:00:52.860> up<00:00:52.980> now<00:00:53.160> is

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
first line that I'm setting up now is

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.470 
first line that I'm setting up now is
going<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.579> be<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.820> after<00:00:54.180> guy<00:00:54.329> here<00:00:55.199> we<00:00:55.320> have

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
going to be the after guy here we have

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.889 
going to be the after guy here we have
at<00:00:57.480> wing<00:00:57.809> sometimes<00:00:58.770> known<00:00:59.039> as<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.250> tweeker<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
at wing sometimes known as a tweeker the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.990 
at wing sometimes known as a tweeker the
purpose<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.920> very<00:01:02.280> very<00:01:02.550> similar<00:01:02.850> to

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
purpose of this is very very similar to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.520 
purpose of this is very very similar to
actually<00:01:03.359> what<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> jib<00:01:03.719> sheet<00:01:03.750> fairly<00:01:04.260> does

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
actually what the jib sheet fairly does

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.080 
actually what the jib sheet fairly does
it<00:01:04.739> actually<00:01:05.010> controls<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.610> angle<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
it actually controls the angle of the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.640 
it actually controls the angle of the
sheet<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.479> how<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.689> pulls<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.439> clew

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
sheet and how it pulls on the the clew

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.320 
sheet and how it pulls on the the clew
of<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.830> sail<00:01:07.890> very<00:01:08.640> important<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.210> can

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
of the sail very important it can

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.120 
of the sail very important it can
remember<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.720> keep<00:01:09.900> all<00:01:10.080> your<00:01:10.200> spinnaker<00:01:10.920> gear

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
remember to keep all your spinnaker gear

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.100 
remember to keep all your spinnaker gear
outside<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.030> I'm<00:01:12.630> going<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.840> run<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.080> through

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
outside and I'm going to run it through

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.340 
outside and I'm going to run it through
the<00:01:13.320> cam<00:01:13.619> cleat<00:01:13.890> with<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.130> little<00:01:14.340> arch<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.729> it

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
the cam cleat with a little arch on it

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.600 
the cam cleat with a little arch on it
and<00:01:16.350> then<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.770> end<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.159> twin<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.580> I

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
and then in the end of this twin so I

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.740 
and then in the end of this twin so I
want<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.909> go<00:01:17.970> overboard<00:01:18.270> I'm<00:01:18.509> just<00:01:18.630> going

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
want it to go overboard I'm just going

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.850 
want it to go overboard I'm just going
to<00:01:18.810> put<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> little<00:01:19.110> figure<00:01:19.470> eight<00:01:19.619> knot

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
to put a little figure eight knot

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.980 
to put a little figure eight knot
it'll<00:01:20.520> stop<00:01:20.759> not<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.150> stop<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.450> sliding<00:01:21.750> out

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
it'll stop not to stop that sliding out

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.990 
it'll stop not to stop that sliding out
my<00:01:22.680> sheet<00:01:24.020> comes<00:01:25.020> through<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.409> eye<00:01:25.439> here<00:01:26.000> all

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
my sheet comes through the eye here all

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.520 
my sheet comes through the eye here all
the<00:01:27.210> way<00:01:27.299> back<00:01:27.540> again<00:01:27.720> making<00:01:28.110> sure<00:01:28.409> I'm

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the way back again making sure I'm

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.740 
the way back again making sure I'm
coming<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.950> from<00:01:29.130> outside

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
coming in from outside

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.149 
coming in from outside
to<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> turning<00:01:31.200> block<00:01:31.409> back<00:01:31.619> here<00:01:31.890> at<00:01:32.009> the

to a turning block back here at the
stanchion<00:01:33.530> this<00:01:34.530> then<00:01:34.740> runs<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.210> ratchet

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
the end of the pole as well so I'm just

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:16.619 
the end of the pole as well so I'm just
going<00:03:15.699> to<00:03:15.730> stick<00:03:15.910> that<00:03:15.970> through<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.419> jaws

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
going to stick that through the jaws

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.140 
going to stick that through the jaws
right<00:03:16.900> now<00:03:17.079> the<00:03:17.680> last<00:03:17.859> thing<00:03:18.129> to<00:03:18.519> consider<00:03:18.819> is

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
right now the last thing to consider is

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.050 
right now the last thing to consider is
the<00:03:19.269> sale<00:03:19.510> itself<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:21.220> what<00:03:21.340> I'm<00:03:21.459> looking<00:03:21.609> for

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
the sale itself and what I'm looking for

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.539 
the sale itself and what I'm looking for
is<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.239> head<00:03:22.629> of<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.930> sail<00:03:23.109> ok<00:03:23.949> so<00:03:24.010> I<00:03:24.160> found<00:03:24.459> my

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
is the head of the sail ok so I found my

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.129 
is the head of the sail ok so I found my
head<00:03:24.760> so<00:03:25.389> what<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.510> going<00:03:25.569> to<00:03:25.690> do<00:03:25.750> now<00:03:25.870> is

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
head so what I going to do now is

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.530 
head so what I going to do now is
accordion<00:03:26.829> fold<00:03:27.190> all<00:03:27.549> down<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.150> luff<00:03:28.329> of<00:03:28.480> the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
accordion fold all down the luff of the

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.689 
accordion fold all down the luff of the
sail<00:03:28.629> so<00:03:29.079> what<00:03:29.889> that<00:03:30.010> means<00:03:30.250> isn't<00:03:30.519> going<00:03:30.639> to

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:30.699 
sail so what that means isn't going to

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:32.069 
sail so what that means isn't going to
get<00:03:30.819> hold<00:03:31.030> of<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.209> head<00:03:31.329> keep<00:03:31.599> it<00:03:31.720> firm<00:03:31.930> and

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
get hold of the head keep it firm and

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.449 
get hold of the head keep it firm and
then<00:03:32.230> I'm<00:03:32.290> going<00:03:32.410> to<00:03:32.440> run<00:03:32.560> my<00:03:32.620> hand<00:03:33.010> down<00:03:33.250> the

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
then I'm going to run my hand down the

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:39.180 
then I'm going to run my hand down the
luff<00:03:33.639> tape<00:03:34.139> all<00:03:35.139> the<00:03:35.199> way<00:03:35.470> and<00:03:36.160> just<00:03:36.340> bring<00:03:38.190> the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
luff tape all the way and just bring the

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.270 
luff tape all the way and just bring the
sail<00:03:39.430> in<00:03:39.699> and<00:03:40.290> both<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.500> lower<00:03:41.680> corners<00:03:42.160> of

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
sail in and both the lower corners of

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.460 
sail in and both the lower corners of
the<00:03:42.370> sail<00:03:42.579> are<00:03:42.760> called<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.120> clues<00:03:43.449> until<00:03:43.810> one

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
the sail are called the clues until one

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.020 
the sail are called the clues until one
of<00:03:44.560> them<00:03:44.650> becomes<00:03:44.889> the<00:03:45.099> tack<00:03:45.310> so<00:03:45.669> we're<00:03:45.940> now

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
of them becomes the tack so we're now

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.550 
of them becomes the tack so we're now
starting<00:03:46.269> to<00:03:46.510> get<00:03:46.629> into<00:03:46.870> that<00:03:46.900> tricky<00:03:47.319> bit<00:03:47.440> of

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
starting to get into that tricky bit of

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.439 
starting to get into that tricky bit of
spinnaker<00:03:47.889> work<00:03:48.040> where<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.940> same<00:03:49.150> thing

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:49.449 
spinnaker work where the same thing

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:51.030 
spinnaker work where the same thing
starts<00:03:49.780> to<00:03:49.840> have<00:03:49.989> one<00:03:50.139> or<00:03:50.260> two<00:03:50.440> names<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:50.919> now

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
starts to have one or two names and now

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.819 
starts to have one or two names and now
I<00:03:51.069> need<00:03:51.250> to<00:03:51.370> run<00:03:51.959> down<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.139> green<00:03:53.349> left<00:03:53.560> tape

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
I need to run down the green left tape

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.490 
I need to run down the green left tape
and<00:03:54.269> accordion<00:03:55.269> fold<00:03:55.540> that<00:03:55.720> in<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.260> same<00:03:56.470> way

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
and accordion fold that in the same way

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.339 
and accordion fold that in the same way
without<00:03:57.010> losing<00:03:57.579> that<00:03:58.019> folds<00:03:59.019> I've<00:03:59.109> already

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
without losing that folds I've already

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.199 
without losing that folds I've already
done<00:03:59.500> so<00:04:00.040> now<00:04:00.159> I've<00:04:00.280> got<00:04:00.430> my<00:04:00.459> head<00:04:00.849> and<00:04:01.090> my<00:04:01.150> two

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
done so now I've got my head and my two

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.170 
done so now I've got my head and my two
Clues<00:04:01.720> all<00:04:01.930> nicely<00:04:02.250> packed<00:04:03.250> together<00:04:03.400> what<00:04:04.120> I

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
Clues all nicely packed together what I

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.610 
Clues all nicely packed together what I
need<00:04:04.299> to<00:04:04.389> do<00:04:04.510> is<00:04:04.629> get<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:04.900> sail<00:04:05.079> back<00:04:05.349> in<00:04:05.530> the

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
need to do is get the sail back in the

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.940 
need to do is get the sail back in the
bag<00:04:05.829> without<00:04:06.069> putting<00:04:06.400> any<00:04:06.639> twists<00:04:06.970> into<00:04:07.120> it

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
bag without putting any twists into it

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.400 
bag without putting any twists into it
so<00:04:08.099> there's<00:04:08.790> my<00:04:09.030> spinnaker<00:04:09.780> ready<00:04:10.050> to<00:04:10.170> hoist

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
so there's my spinnaker ready to hoist

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.589 
so there's my spinnaker ready to hoist
and<00:04:11.099> if<00:04:11.190> I<00:04:11.280> packed<00:04:11.550> it<00:04:11.730> away<00:04:11.790> properly<00:04:12.390> when<00:04:12.569> I

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
and if I packed it away properly when I

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.210 
and if I packed it away properly when I
pull<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:12.959> head<00:04:13.170> out<00:04:13.200> in<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.680> corners<00:04:14.069> at<00:04:14.160> the

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
pull the head out in the corners at the

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.310 
pull the head out in the corners at the
same<00:04:14.400> time<00:04:14.670> then<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.330> sails<00:04:15.540> are<00:04:15.720> just<00:04:15.930> open

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
same time then the sails are just open

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.289 
same time then the sails are just open
up<00:04:16.410> you<00:04:16.709> filled<00:04:16.980> with<00:04:17.040> win<00:04:17.250> so<00:04:17.970> there<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:18.269> have

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
up you filled with win so there you have

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.360 
up you filled with win so there you have

it the lines are all set up the poles

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.890 
it the lines are all set up the poles
all<00:04:20.549> set<00:04:20.760> up<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.389> spinnaker<00:04:21.690> is<00:04:21.780> now

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
all set up and the spinnaker is now

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.110 
all set up and the spinnaker is now
packed<00:04:22.230> what<00:04:22.830> we<00:04:22.950> need<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:23.130> do<00:04:23.250> now<00:04:23.400> is<00:04:23.610> attach
