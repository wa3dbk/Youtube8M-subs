00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:33.000
 accident then looks here ever trust 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:34.380
 So the logo from up here and is 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.409

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.810

 This gen part for cell phones or ipods 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.360
 teeth are then down here again for 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.119
 Almost everything is suitable or what all 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.600
 has and here is a small picture 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.610
 yes from above he is still strong and 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.000
 an order number is the same available 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.000
 everything 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:14.580
 I have this mouse at the media market 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:18.840
 bought for 20 euros first times the 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.840
 instructions how to install it 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.720
 this explains what it is next here 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:33.580
 once again explaining everything to the woman and 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:36.910
 then here then again 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:45.720
 a quick guide and tips 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:03:07.390
 you really need the cable 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:03:14.920
 then gold jack plug so here the 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:19.209
 mouse high-precision laser then still here 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:24.130
 a few things like that is our 12 2 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:34.590
 hinweise and yes that is number dpi 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:34.590
 pay attention 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.650
 very good in the hand 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:04:03.060
 I followed them also really nice there 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:04:07.110
 also really nice shaped back then 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.930
 here again this little conversion 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.670
 conversion sentence the mouse needs 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.959
 less electricity or respectively or 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:21.950
 and more power after coming back over 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.950
 secretes because down here it is 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:36.150
 So there's gaming series and here 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:48.060
 above that is the sign and next to it 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:51.930
 after that it would be yes and yes it was already 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:59.490
 everything because it was actually everything 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:05:01.560
 and that and I will do it all 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.720
 to summarize how I find it in one 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.720
 conclusion and 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:20.420
 now to the conclusion so this mouse is very 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.070
 good for the 20 euro is very good 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:26.290
 really 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.290
 she is also suitable for beginners and 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.400
 only this funny gold part would have 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.870
 that can not be saved 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.230
 really works on the mouse 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.210
 I think now the girl is 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:42.380
 also very good because that is metal 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.640
 I can show it, I think so 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.010
 comes from the then goes not so 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:49.270
 quickly broken then one 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:53.600
 high power laser down here 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:06:01.070
 she lies very good so i just say 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:04.790
 a big praise to trust and yes to 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:08.780

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:10.690
