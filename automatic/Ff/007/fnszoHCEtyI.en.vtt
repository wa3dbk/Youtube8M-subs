00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:13.449
 at sight is avoiding countries evils is quite peculiar and that turns out to be 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.449
 complicated to say 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.580
 since it is a two-cylinder rotax the rubin I understood 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:24.279
 cubic centimeters 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.279
 same as the aprilia rsv4 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:30.659
 but we also find details of which 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:34.210
 and even cars like the front track with a track width 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.310
 considerable 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.530
 that does not lack even a signaling system 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.720
 specifically created for this vehicle 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.980
 They are not rounded like on motorcycles since Espanyol does not lean 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.360
 details is not missing 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.579
 front there is a large boot for full-face helmets 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.020
 and the passenger's backing apart from being adjustable also saves a space 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.900
 for young 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.869
 the seat 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.960
 it is accessed among other things to the fuel tank 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.690
 the driving position is typical of a tourist bike 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.080
 we will not notice the brake handles on the handlebar 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.740
 front and clutch 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.740
 and even less in the version we tested 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
 five speeds with the automatic suit 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.190
 the gear selector that is in the power 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.980
 those on the riverbank and 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.980
 long 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.530
 when dosing the accelerator because remember that between the legs 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.690
 find a ligeti engine meters 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.930
 despite its many peculiarities in the end the trick is caught and it turns out 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.820
 up fun 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.610
 the spectacularity of its design 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.420
 a large volume of failures 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.730
 stands out from the rest of the bikes 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.710
 motogp environment car behavior 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.710
 so personal what is this 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.779
 Of course if you are one of those who want to go unnoticed in that country, no 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:16.779
 is your means of transport 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:18.509
 in this heist
