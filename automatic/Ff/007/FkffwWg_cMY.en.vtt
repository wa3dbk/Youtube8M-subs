far<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.409> course<00:01:28.439> i<00:01:28.860> revise<00:01:29.759> my<00:01:30.000> forecast<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.689> a

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
far of course i revise my forecast to a

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.280 
far of course i revise my forecast to a
15-percent<00:01:31.740> fall<00:01:32.119> so<00:01:33.119> we've<00:01:33.990> still<00:01:34.170> got

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
15-percent fall so we've still got

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.340 
15-percent fall so we've still got
another<00:01:34.439> team<00:01:34.740> person<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.250> go<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.610> reckon<00:01:36.350> but

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
another team person to go I reckon but

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.550 
another team person to go I reckon but
we<00:01:37.560> might<00:01:37.770> get<00:01:37.979> there<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.490> here's<00:01:39.210> why<00:01:39.560> this

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
we might get there and here's why this

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.770

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
the coming months and that will withdraw

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.770 
the coming months and that will withdraw
some<00:03:15.750> of<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.050> demand<00:03:16.560> for<00:03:16.980> housing<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.780> also

some of the demand for housing and also

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.780 
some of the demand for housing and also

migration is falling but we'll see it's

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.470
