00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.039
 hello today we are going to see how to do 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.500
 decreases in crochet many times is 

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:10.990
 necessary when we are making weaving 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.580
 that the fabric dwindles or becomes more 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.850
 narrow to shape 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.689
 there are two basic ways of doing 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.660
 crocheted in crochet look fabric a 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.849
 shows with low points and let's see 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.860
 one of the ways is simply 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.230
 imagine that we are knitting 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.050
 low 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.470
 worth the next low point tejerÃ­a 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.480
 here then what is done is one of 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.610
 the ways is to simply skip the 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.980
 point 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.130
 it gets quite tight so that it does not 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.540
 see the hole and we've got 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.540
 skip a point 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:58.390
 I'm going to do another one so this would be 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.390
 normal this would go here we do it here 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.210
 it squeezes a lot so you do not notice 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.600
 a lot and you see we have managed to reduce 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.600
 point 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.950
 we're going to finish and we're going to do 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.930
 next turn another type of shriveled 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.930
 with a point low 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.210
 we started weaving 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.340
 a tall chain and we're going to do 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.850
 here another diminished another way of doing it 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.119
 is 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.150
 weaving the dots but without finishing 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.130
 I mean let's see we're going to have two 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.030
 points together then we do the 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.110
 First 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.600
 a normal low point here we would close it 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.090
 but this step we do not do we leave it 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.619
 halfway then this one we do not 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.619
 we take another point 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:58.420
 and now if we close everything together 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.729
 then we have got 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.110
 shrink a point because we've woven two 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:07.170
 in the same place 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.179
 this we are going to do normal this yes that 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.270
 it closes this would be a low point 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.610
 normal but let's make now another 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.980
 another diminished 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.860
 instead of making the step of closed not what 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.170
 I do keep them I keep it here in 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.730
 the points on the needle and I take the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.730
 next and now yes 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.550
 we close everything together 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.550
 someone 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.070
 this would be the other way of doing it 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.650
 let's suppose now that we're 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.510
 working with high points of tissue 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.520
 a small sample so you can see it in 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.230
 this case the same as we said before 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.060
 low points of skipping a point is not 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.520
 you can do it because you would see the hole 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.260
 a lot then here what we're going to do 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.890
 we are going to knit a normal one, you see what we do 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.890
 in the steps 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.980
 know going from two to two this would be 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.490
 a normal high point let's do now 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.490
 a diminished 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.650
 here we do exactly the same 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.560
 but instead of making the last step 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.590
 when we have two left to close it, not 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.560
 we close let's take the next one 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.099
 point 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.500
 and we closed the first two and now what 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:31.840
 What we do is close them all at once 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.630
 we managed to see the way if 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.520
 you can see what it does like a uve there are two 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.520
 points that end at the same point 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.090
 OK 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.310
 let's go back to do again we do 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.790
 a point 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.250
 high but the last step that would be the 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.390
 closed this two together that's not what 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.510
 we make 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:04.370
 we take thread we take the next 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.370
 here we passed the first two 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.030
 when we have three points left 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.450
 close all at once we have done 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.900
 another decrease 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.100
 and the same would be with triple high point or 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.859
 any other point what is done is 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.169
 the last step of the closed we do not 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.210
 we reserve the points on the needle and 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:28.820
 the next point is knitted and then 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.820
 they close all together until then
