00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello friends moses with you today 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.940
 I want to show you one of my own 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.960
 the creation of beads this time is the system 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:16.890
 volley fire as called 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:21.140
 death is a tornado one is not death is paying 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.619
 already so tell what to tell here 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.949
 consists of four pairs of Kalio wheels 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:31.260
 mounted on hydraulics so to speak 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:34.800
 there are still caps on the shock absorbers 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.969
 connected as the last car only 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:43.350
 turns not due to the rotation of the wheels 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.910
 different sides but just how to say mind 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.280
 than 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.070
 bridge driven front one bridge and 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.390
 driven the rest are unmanaged so 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.350
 let's show you one more 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.750
 feature 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:03.390
 She must have a piston type 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.400
 but as you can see they are included but they are not 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:12.260
 have enough strength or raise a little well 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.259
 Here it rose but heavy too 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.689
 swim is not so important let's try 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:23.250
 let me tell you the whole design I 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.770
 watched from this type of starting system 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.790
 whether there is a tornado that something but 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.090
 this type of cabin is the scenery so to speak 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.960
 here are our two launchers directly 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:42.520
 installation shorter here 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.790
 we have six missiles we have an engine 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.330
 rocket well to build it you need 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:53.670
 wrapped rocket engine 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.780
 So here are these cables in order not to be 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.229
 while driving 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:03.220
 as much to say, this is not swayed 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:05.649
 launcher or something breaks off 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.119
 let me show you quickly 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.789
 sleep hunt me 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:14.290
 I decided to write it down so that tomorrow 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.690
 write so now she turns of course 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:21.600
 let's do nothing slowly 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:26.950
 a little here and try to do what there 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:30.010
 combat missions so it turns out I'm really in 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.610
 These things that I thought, I thought of how best 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.430
 make these launchers say or rails 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:42.970
 without these basked much less lighter 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:46.959
 you can much more of these him 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.380
 see how to beat dramatically slowed okay 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:54.489
 let me show you at least this rear 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.489
 just maybe I wanted to do more 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:06.930
 here look op 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:06.930
 We are increasing lower and 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:21.050
 about white brute need to aim more 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:25.130
 Of course it is not so immediately all this 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:31.819
 they are definitely there and closely I say this 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:38.120
 lan let's just give back as her 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:43.519
 fix here I do not know the engine probably 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:47.690
 need to do weaker to plan 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:51.170
 let's try somehow neatly 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.660
 stop it just i'm very sharp 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:58.430
 stopping at give a little bit whether 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:00.880
 let's go somewhere 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.880
 rockets 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:13.269
 broke off no so look this 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:20.739
 robbery and keeps the ropes about not let go 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:27.160
 now turn around warriors 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:28.030
 must also weaker than they do here 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.590
 flew 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:35.919
 well such inaccurate see she staggers 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:39.759
 very strong and inaccurate flies Well 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:42.460
 do for now so long as there is this 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:47.910
 generally flew very high on it more 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:52.870
 Exactly, at least he does not falter so well 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:57.849
 how would I have such a design 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:05:00.009
 it turned out I don't know maybe they are so well I 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:02.740
 I will finish I thought of her 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:05.409
 remake can not even on this highway 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:10.150
 I will do it I do not need me 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:12.280
 I like it seems like if by 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.180
 rotation times in the wheels in different directions 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:20.800
 it was no longer you turned so well 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:25.719
 lan let's do some shooting 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:29.469
 a little bit so simple with nothing to do so 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:34.770
 let's try to hit about 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:34.770
 archer so 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:45.060
 how to fix it Anton back and forth 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:45.060
 walks and I do not know why so 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:52.919
 people and 390 itself unfolds 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:55.069
 noticed that you get the engine going and 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:59.059
 a little pushing the trigger itself 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:06:03.319
 see she yes she still spinning 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:05.999
 so okay, this is such a grandfather 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:13.949
 tune these though these try 

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:16.589
 hit so accurate okay so here 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:18.089
 that's the kind of thing I did for everyone 

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:20.099
 thank you for seeing me 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:23.569
 Like put subscribe to a channel 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:23.569
 good luck to you all
