with cardio overtime your body will get

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.590 
with cardio overtime your body will get
used<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:25.980> working<00:02:26.490> out<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.060> eventually<00:02:27.480> the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
is a big however with weight training I

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.080 
is a big however with weight training I
highly<00:02:33.420> recommend<00:02:33.960> that<00:02:34.050> you<00:02:34.440> don't<00:02:34.970> you<00:02:35.970> know

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
highly recommend that you don't you know

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.450 
highly recommend that you don't you know
work<00:02:36.330> out<00:02:36.540> while<00:02:37.080> you're<00:02:37.320> still<00:02:37.560> sore<00:02:37.890> the

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
work out while you're still sore the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.190 
work out while you're still sore the
reason<00:02:38.850> being<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.240> that<00:02:39.300> with<00:02:39.960> weight

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
reason being is that with weight

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.290 
reason being is that with weight
training<00:02:40.500> because<00:02:40.830> it's<00:02:41.010> anaerobic<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:42.150> need

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
training because it's anaerobic you need

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.930 
training because it's anaerobic you need
to<00:02:42.450> give<00:02:42.660> your<00:02:43.110> muscles<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.890> longer<00:02:44.490> time<00:02:44.730> to

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
to give your muscles a longer time to

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.030 
to give your muscles a longer time to
prepare<00:02:45.300> what's<00:02:45.870> going<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.140> probably<00:02:46.470> occur

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
prepare what's going to probably occur

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.500 
prepare what's going to probably occur
is<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.370> your<00:02:47.490> strength<00:02:47.850> gains<00:02:48.090> are<00:02:48.270> going<00:02:48.450> to

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.250 
very uncomfortable and - like I said you
know<00:03:17.250> there's<00:03:17.459> a<00:03:17.489> better<00:03:17.670> chance<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:18.330> you

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
know there's a better chance that you

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.840

strength<00:03:21.150> gains<00:03:21.450> are<00:03:21.780> definitely<00:03:22.530> going<00:03:22.709> to

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
strength gains are definitely going to

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.100 
strength gains are definitely going to
probably<00:03:23.430> go<00:03:23.580> down<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:24.270> before<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.630> depart<00:03:25.020> I

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
probably go down and before I depart I

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.240 
probably go down and before I depart I
didn't<00:03:25.350> want<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:25.560> answer<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:25.950> second

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.449 
question of that is is there anything to
prevent<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.440> soreness<00:03:28.860> well<00:03:29.130> I<00:03:29.160> already

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
prevent the soreness well I already

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.640 
prevent the soreness well I already
talked<00:03:29.670> about<00:03:29.790> you<00:03:30.239> know<00:03:30.690> working<00:03:31.200> out<00:03:31.320> more

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
talked about you know working out more

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.500 
talked about you know working out more
which<00:03:32.070> will<00:03:32.340> definitely<00:03:32.790> decrease<00:03:33.270> the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
which will definitely decrease the

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.449 
which will definitely decrease the
chances<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:33.930> soreness<00:03:34.830> although<00:03:35.190> with<00:03:35.310> weight

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
chances of soreness although with weight

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.190 
chances of soreness although with weight
training<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:35.850> don't<00:03:36.030> recommend<00:03:36.450> that<00:03:36.510> but<00:03:37.020> with

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
training I don't recommend that but with

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.900 
training I don't recommend that but with
running<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.650> do<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:38.280> other<00:03:38.340> thing<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:38.700> you

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
running I do the other thing that you

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.240 
running I do the other thing that you
can<00:03:39.060> do<00:03:39.180> is<00:03:39.360> you<00:03:39.450> can<00:03:39.600> take<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:39.810> warm<00:03:40.200> bath<00:03:40.440> you

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
can do is you can take a warm bath you

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.880 
can do is you can take a warm bath you
could<00:03:41.489> go<00:03:41.910> into<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.239> sauna<00:03:42.510> room<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:43.560> can<00:03:43.739> get

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
could go into the sauna room you can get

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.330 
could go into the sauna room you can get
massages<00:03:44.370> take<00:03:45.090> some<00:03:45.269> over-the-counter

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
massages take some over-the-counter

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.890 
massages take some over-the-counter
medication<00:03:47.340> some<00:03:47.660> anti-inflammatories<00:03:48.660> as

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
far as ice goes that's kind of like a

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.729 
far as ice goes that's kind of like a
50/50<00:03:51.750> it's<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:51.870> little<00:03:52.019> bit<00:03:52.110> debatable<00:03:52.260> or

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
50/50 it's a little bit debatable or

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:53.810 
50/50 it's a little bit debatable or
been<00:03:52.860> some<00:03:53.070> studies<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.400> have<00:03:53.610> indicated

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
been some studies that have indicated

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.810 
been some studies that have indicated
that<00:03:54.150> ice<00:03:54.390> helps<00:03:54.959> a<00:03:55.050> little<00:03:55.290> bit<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:55.700> you<00:03:56.700> know

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
that ice helps a little bit and you know

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.520 
that ice helps a little bit and you know
other<00:03:57.090> studies<00:03:57.450> which<00:03:57.630> have<00:03:57.870> said<00:03:58.110> that<00:03:58.320> it

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
other studies which have said that it

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.620 
other studies which have said that it
doesn't<00:03:58.830> really<00:03:58.950> help<00:03:59.220> but<00:03:59.940> with<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.360> warm

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
doesn't really help but with the warm

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
doesn't really help but with the warm
baths<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:01.380> the

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
baths and the

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.430 
baths and the
that's<00:04:02.280> uh<00:04:02.519> you<00:04:03.180> know<00:04:03.269> pretty<00:04:03.480> common<00:04:04.019> and<00:04:04.170> can

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
that's uh you know pretty common and can

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.110
