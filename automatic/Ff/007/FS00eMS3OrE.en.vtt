you know I think this is one of those

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.330 
you know I think this is one of those
things<00:02:13.079> we're<00:02:13.319> talking<00:02:13.560> about<00:02:13.950> it's<00:02:14.190> not

want a glass of wine so much see we
should<00:02:19.319> have<00:02:19.530> done<00:02:19.680> this<00:02:19.799> last<00:02:20.069> night<00:02:20.400> know

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
should have done this last night know

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.300 
should have done this last night know
have<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.480> little<00:02:21.720> wine<00:02:21.900> take<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:22.530> edge<00:02:22.620> off

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
have a little wine take the edge off

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.830 
have a little wine take the edge off
actually<00:02:23.970> ethyl<00:02:24.239> alcohol<00:02:24.360> inhibits

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
actually ethyl alcohol inhibits

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.900 
actually ethyl alcohol inhibits
electrical<00:02:25.709> conduction<00:02:26.069> in<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.430> nerve<00:02:26.579> cells

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
electrical conduction in the nerve cells

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.390 
electrical conduction in the nerve cells
and<00:02:27.180> stimulates<00:02:28.110> reuptake<00:02:28.470> receptors<00:02:29.220> of

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
and stimulates reuptake receptors of

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.740 
and stimulates reuptake receptors of
inhibitory<00:02:29.819> neurotransmitters<00:02:30.720> like

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
inhibitory neurotransmitters like
