00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.249 
take a look at this speed Jeunesse GP
Neo<00:00:04.620> Hybrid<00:00:04.680> for<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.520> Google<00:00:05.879> Nexus<00:00:06.060> 5<00:00:06.509> so

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
Neo Hybrid for the Google Nexus 5 so

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.799 
Neo Hybrid for the Google Nexus 5 so
here's<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.529> case<00:00:07.710> itself<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.820> case<00:00:09.660> is

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
here's the case itself the case is

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.030 
here's the case itself the case is
available<00:00:10.019> in<00:00:10.290> several<00:00:10.500> different<00:00:10.650> colors

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
available in several different colors

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.650 
available in several different colors
this<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.580> slight<00:00:11.910> finish<00:00:12.330> so<00:00:12.480> that's

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
this is the slight finish so that's

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.970 
this is the slight finish so that's
actually<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.080> band<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.469> runs<00:00:13.620> around<00:00:13.769> the

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
actually the band that runs around the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.379 
actually the band that runs around the
outside<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.670> can<00:00:14.759> see<00:00:14.910> they've<00:00:15.089> got<00:00:15.299> the

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
outside so you can see they've got the

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.689 
outside so you can see they've got the
Neo<00:00:15.630> Hybrid<00:00:15.690> Brandon<00:00:16.680> you've<00:00:17.250> got<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.460> power

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
Neo Hybrid Brandon you've got the power

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.099 
Neo Hybrid Brandon you've got the power
button<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.090> she<00:00:18.300> presses<00:00:18.539> through<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.900> case

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
button that she presses through the case

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.679 
button that she presses through the case
itself<00:00:19.939> say<00:00:20.939> I'm<00:00:21.029> storing<00:00:21.300> therefore<00:00:21.630> the

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
itself say I'm storing therefore the

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.450 
itself say I'm storing therefore the
volume<00:00:21.840> up<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.260> down<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:22.949> this<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.189> actually<00:00:23.430> a

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
volume up and down so this is actually a

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.550 
volume up and down so this is actually a
band<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.970> separates<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.600> case<00:00:24.930> itself<00:00:25.320> that

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
band that separates the case itself that

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.230 
band that separates the case itself that
is<00:00:25.680> interchangeable<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.000> can<00:00:27.119> see

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
is interchangeable and you can see

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.320 
is interchangeable and you can see
you've<00:00:27.390> got<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.539> nice<00:00:27.750> design<00:00:28.170> inside<00:00:28.560> as<00:00:28.830> well

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
you've got a nice design inside as well

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.460 
you've got a nice design inside as well
no<00:00:30.330> it's<00:00:30.480> an<00:00:30.539> easy<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.840> fit<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.080> phone<00:00:31.289> in

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
no it's an easy to fit the phone in

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.500 
no it's an easy to fit the phone in
which<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.859> just<00:00:32.040> pop<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.340> soft<00:00:32.579> top<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:33.030> and

which you just pop the soft top in and

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.870 
which you just pop the soft top in and
then<00:00:33.630> work<00:00:33.780> each<00:00:34.050> corner<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.620> just<00:00:35.520> pop<00:00:35.730> that

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
then work each corner in just pop that

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.150 
then work each corner in just pop that
around<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.210> locks<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.630> nice<00:00:36.980> show<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.070> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
surface you are getting a screen

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.990 
surface you are getting a screen
protected<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:11.040> for<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.430> screen<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:11.850> there

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
protected just for the screen on there

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.420 
protected just for the screen on there
you<00:01:12.119> get<00:01:12.270> an<00:01:12.390> idea<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.810> kind<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.830> cover<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.189> how

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
you get an idea of kind of cover and how

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.890 
you get an idea of kind of cover and how
close<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.939> comes<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.360> screen<00:01:15.540> which<00:01:15.780> is

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
close it comes to the screen which is

can see the speed and logo the bat
there's<00:01:26.729> actually<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> grip<00:01:27.360> as<00:01:27.509> well<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:27.840> got

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
there's actually a grip as well it's got

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.780 
there's actually a grip as well it's got
a<00:01:27.990> nice<00:01:28.350> texture<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.130> feels<00:01:29.340> good<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
a nice texture so it feels good in the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.539 
a nice texture so it feels good in the
hand<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:31.320> thickness<00:01:31.710> there<00:01:32.100> ads<00:01:32.250> there

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
hand and the thickness there ads there

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.130 
hand and the thickness there ads there
is<00:01:32.729> not<00:01:33.030> very<00:01:33.180> very<00:01:33.390> much<00:01:33.659> at<00:01:33.810> all<00:01:33.900> which<00:01:34.110> is

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
is not very very much at all which is

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.560 
is not very very much at all which is
which<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.770> nice<00:01:35.119> overall<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.150> think<00:01:36.360> it's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
which is nice overall I think it's

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.969 
which is nice overall I think it's
pretty<00:01:36.689> much<00:01:36.840> one<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.200> best<00:01:37.439> cases<00:01:37.680> you

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
pretty much one of the best cases you

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.740 
pretty much one of the best cases you
can<00:01:38.100> get<00:01:38.310> we're<00:01:38.880> reviewing<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.329> slim<00:01:39.600> are

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
can get we're reviewing the slim are

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.569 
can get we're reviewing the slim are
masoom<00:01:40.170> which<00:01:40.409> does<00:01:40.890> have<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.070> bit<00:01:41.220> more<00:01:41.250> bowl

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
masoom which does have a bit more bowl

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.740 
masoom which does have a bit more bowl
but<00:01:41.790> then<00:01:41.880> again<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.210> have<00:01:42.240> got<00:01:42.390> more

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
but then again you have got more

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.240 
but then again you have got more
protection<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.439> think<00:01:43.979> there's<00:01:44.130> someone

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
protection I think there's someone

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.789 
protection I think there's someone
unless<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.700> work<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.780> content<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.229> know<00:01:46.350> in

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
unless you work in content you know in

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.050 
unless you work in content you know in
an<00:01:47.040> industry<00:01:47.460> where<00:01:47.670> you're<00:01:47.850> gonna<00:01:47.939> be

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
an industry where you're gonna be

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.010 
an industry where you're gonna be
dropping<00:01:48.570> weight

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
dropping weight

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.719 
dropping weight
the<00:01:49.350> phone<00:01:49.560> could<00:01:49.710> receive<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.040> lot<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.369> damage

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
the phone could receive a lot of damage

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.310 
the phone could receive a lot of damage
then<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:50.970> think<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.390> adequate<00:01:51.810> protection

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
then I think this is adequate protection

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.060 
then I think this is adequate protection
