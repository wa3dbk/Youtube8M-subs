I've<00:03:14.430> got<00:03:14.610> no<00:03:14.790> more<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.630> more<00:03:15.780> of<00:03:15.810> an

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
I've got no more and more of an

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.770 
I've got no more and more of an
opportunity<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:18.060> really<00:03:18.210> look<00:03:18.450> at<00:03:18.630> them

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
opportunity to to really look at them

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.030 
opportunity to to really look at them
and<00:03:18.870> see<00:03:19.580> what<00:03:20.580> we<00:03:20.700> have<00:03:21.560> defensively<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.680> think

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
and see what we have defensively I think

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.380 
and see what we have defensively I think
I<00:03:23.190> think<00:03:23.490> up<00:03:23.610> front<00:03:23.910> I<00:03:24.030> think<00:03:24.240> we're<00:03:24.360> very

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
I think up front I think we're very

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.130 
I think up front I think we're very
solid<00:03:24.990> up<00:03:25.110> front<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:26.450> I<00:03:27.450> think<00:03:27.690> we've<00:03:27.840> got<00:03:28.020> to

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
solid up front and I think we've got to

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.930 
solid up front and I think we've got to
do<00:03:28.230> some<00:03:28.410> things<00:03:28.440> in<00:03:28.770> the<00:03:29.130> passing<00:03:29.520> game<00:03:29.550> that

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
do some things in the passing game that

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.570 
do some things in the passing game that
help<00:03:30.120> ourselves<00:03:30.270> in<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.690> back<00:03:30.840> end<00:03:34.370> our<00:03:35.370> kid

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
help ourselves in the back end our kid

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.030

low-rent defenses well I don't want to
make<00:04:21.600> a<00:04:21.690> whole<00:04:21.930> lot<00:04:21.959> of<00:04:22.139> it<00:04:22.410> I<00:04:22.500> mean<00:04:22.650> I<00:04:22.740> just<00:04:22.770> you

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
make a whole lot of it I mean I just you

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.779 
make a whole lot of it I mean I just you
know<00:04:23.580> what<00:04:24.360> I<00:04:24.449> do<00:04:24.509> it's<00:04:25.199> pretty<00:04:25.320> interesting

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
know what I do it's pretty interesting

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.219 
know what I do it's pretty interesting
yeah<00:04:26.789> I<00:04:26.820> mean<00:04:27.030> I<00:04:27.180> think<00:04:27.419> it's<00:04:27.630> interesting<00:04:27.900> but

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
yeah I mean I think it's interesting but

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:29.650 
yeah I mean I think it's interesting but
I<00:04:28.259> think<00:04:28.470> what<00:04:28.590> you<00:04:28.680> look<00:04:28.860> at<00:04:29.009> is<00:04:29.160> you<00:04:29.280> look<00:04:29.430> at

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
I think what you look at is you look at

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.950 
I think what you look at is you look at
the<00:04:30.660> whole<00:04:30.810> team<00:04:31.639> and<00:04:32.639> that's<00:04:33.630> really<00:04:33.780> what

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
the whole team and that's really what

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.409 
the whole team and that's really what
matters<00:04:34.020> it's<00:04:34.500> not<00:04:34.680> really<00:04:35.070> about<00:04:35.300> how<00:04:36.300> does

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
matters it's not really about how does

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:37.850 
matters it's not really about how does
this<00:04:36.539> team<00:04:36.750> ranked<00:04:37.020> on<00:04:37.139> off<00:04:37.349> that's<00:04:37.590> how<00:04:37.740> does

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
this team ranked on off that's how does

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.740 
this team ranked on off that's how does
the<00:04:37.919> same<00:04:38.130> rank<00:04:38.370> on<00:04:38.550> defense<00:04:38.970> and<00:04:39.479> I<00:04:39.570> don't

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
the same rank on defense and I don't

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.510 
the same rank on defense and I don't
even<00:04:39.840> know<00:04:40.020> what<00:04:40.139> their<00:04:40.320> statistics<00:04:40.830> are<00:04:41.009> but

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
even know what their statistics are but

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.969 
even know what their statistics are but
I<00:04:42.020> think<00:04:43.020> if<00:04:43.110> you<00:04:43.169> look<00:04:43.320> at<00:04:43.410> those<00:04:43.530> teams<00:04:43.800> I

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
I think if you look at those teams I

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:45.320 
I think if you look at those teams I
mean<00:04:44.009> they<00:04:44.250> complement<00:04:44.789> each<00:04:44.849> other<00:04:45.060> very

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
mean they complement each other very

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.770 
mean they complement each other very
well<00:04:46.199> and<00:04:46.590> if<00:04:47.490> you're<00:04:47.669> going<00:04:47.910> to<00:04:48.000> be<00:04:48.090> you're

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
well and if you're going to be you're

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.939 
well and if you're going to be you're
going<00:04:48.840> to<00:04:48.990> give<00:04:49.110> up<00:04:49.229> a<00:04:49.320> lot<00:04:49.440> of<00:04:49.590> yards

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
going to give up a lot of yards

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:51.140 
going to give up a lot of yards
hopefully<00:04:50.250> you're<00:04:50.400> not<00:04:50.430> giving<00:04:50.759> up<00:04:50.849> a<00:04:50.910> lot<00:04:50.940> of

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
hopefully you're not giving up a lot of

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.300 
hopefully you're not giving up a lot of
points<00:04:51.560> but<00:04:52.560> if<00:04:52.650> you're<00:04:52.740> gonna<00:04:52.830> be<00:04:53.009> doing<00:04:53.220> that

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
points but if you're gonna be doing that

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.860 
points but if you're gonna be doing that
you<00:04:53.460> better<00:04:53.639> be<00:04:53.789> explosive<00:04:54.270> on<00:04:54.389> offense<00:04:54.419> and

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
you better be explosive on offense and

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.510 
you better be explosive on offense and
both<00:04:55.080> those<00:04:55.199> teams<00:04:55.410> own<00:04:55.620> teams<00:04:56.340> the<00:04:56.490> last

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
both those teams own teams the last

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.890 
both those teams own teams the last
couple<00:04:56.820> years<00:04:56.940> that<00:04:57.210> have<00:04:57.300> won<00:04:57.539> the<00:04:57.660> Super

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
off the board of scored points do you

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.730 
off the board of scored points do you
think<00:05:05.669> that<00:05:05.820> your<00:05:06.090> defensive<00:05:06.660> backs<00:05:06.870> have<00:05:07.500> the

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
think that your defensive backs have the

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.659 
think that your defensive backs have the
potential<00:05:07.979> that's<00:05:08.250> something<00:05:08.460> that<00:05:08.490> can<00:05:08.639> be

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
potential that's something that can be

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.450 
potential that's something that can be
taught<00:05:08.970> to<00:05:09.270> make<00:05:09.780> a<00:05:10.280> defensive<00:05:11.280> backfield

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
taught to make a defensive backfield

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.969 
taught to make a defensive backfield
make<00:05:12.270> place<00:05:12.539> like<00:05:12.780> that<00:05:12.810> that<00:05:13.409> score<00:05:13.680> take

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
make place like that that score take

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.560 
make place like that that score take
points<00:05:14.310> off<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:14.550> board<00:05:14.699> yeah<00:05:15.090> I<00:05:15.120> don't<00:05:15.419> think

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
points off the board yeah I don't think

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.089 
points off the board yeah I don't think
there's<00:05:15.750> any<00:05:15.900> question<00:05:16.050> that<00:05:16.320> those<00:05:16.889> are

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099
