00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840
 well folks continuing the video here 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:13.740
 is the the fw such that happened here was O 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.910
 the side here in the bubble on this side of this 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:23.430
 side here also spoke the whole ceiling and 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.199
 here behind broke the ophone with the car 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.349
 in conditioning but as you can see 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.199
 the goal here O 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.820
 It gets all dirty so you have a 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.320
 biggest concern block with the bubble 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:41.850
 here in this case in the wheel is also well 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.210
 dirty and I'll show you 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.230
 cleaning this car as it is 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.610
 made the logic mind bubbles and can in 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.980
 vague because the state was here 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.500
 take this is all grace here on the side 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.660
 when washing with a soap you do not have 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.430
 problem leaves clean and cute for 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:11.189
 in the coming years 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:14.310
 she gets very dirty had not done it either 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.250
 a video of him only that she did not record 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.830
 I thought I had recorded but did not record 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:24.810
 is basically how renovation does not have 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:29.729
 so much to flee the cleaning plus the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:33.360
 company becomes easier here as well. 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:37.200
 I'm going to hit some air on him and I'll take the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.930
 filter or clean the cleaning filter 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.829
 general in it is with the accident that you 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:47.340
 they saw 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:51.299
 I'll also take a look at made 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.240
 just did not break anything flight the realignment 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.119
 to switch again but this later 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:02.420
 I will not touch it now it's just 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:09.750
 even a good Olympiad in the car and 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:11.239
 after walking is with the car well that I 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.550
 I found the car 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.580
 guys 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.560
 I did not lean against the regulating needles of the 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.740
 engine of that car yet 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.740
 I made four standing tanks softening 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.410
 car called first 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:33.800
 us 4 then to walk also walked 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.850
 normal, I did not change anything 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:42.640
 so his needles are like 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:45.770
 came from factory with 111 done 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.560
 absolutely nothing in the car so far 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.810
 The only thing I did was to change the exchange rate. 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.050
 from him I open the pound field and start 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.700
 Just changing gear is usually 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.520
 these cases it comes with more exchange 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.330
 Caught for you not to force in the beginning 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:06.760
 but soon I have dropped so I was dosing 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.760
 It was controlling not for him. 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.340
 controlling the finger but I already started to 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.660
 change gears 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.850
 the first thing we do this 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:23.090
 car that I think is very important 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:25.780
 Let's take the I'm going to take the 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.780
 drums 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.810
 You can notice that as much as I said 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.910
 da life 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:42.050
 I'm using batteries duracell why 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:45.080
 pec next here I commented 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.480
 In there I talked to someone there in the 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.830
 comments from some video 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.660
 I want to replace the battery pack with a 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.489
 pack of batteries to stay longer using 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.940
 battery 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:03.440
 well I joked I even commented on 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.040
 will use life in the battery life in this car 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.160
 on here 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.510
 there it has six 6 volts points in this 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:14.060
 faithful car to him hangs the seal I think the 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.530
 voter or executor sends much force 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:20.930
 Do you think you're going to stop? 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.990
 So I took this pec I tried. 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.889
 put a normal pack 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.740
 he also gave the same problem 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:33.400
 and let me get the pec I 'm going to show 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:39.729
 for you here in the comma here 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.569
 nickel and it was there that decided of these 16 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.819
 on here 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:45.009
 he started doing the same thing too 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:47.889
 but I went to see the voltage is giving 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:50.919
 six points also something then I 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:53.469
 I have that I'm using same stack 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:56.529
 let's go to the battery that goes over 6 volts 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:58.689
 he starts to give this problem in my 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:01.180
 I 'm not saying that at all 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:04.029
 cars because it uses a pack of 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:08.710
 cid groin the pec deciding this 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:09.789
 basin type in the gt2 vehicle and not 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.759
 it happens 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:14.199
 this car is happening here and 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:24.610
 another thing I wanted to show 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:28.659
 you guys sent to you but elbow 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:31.629
 left then a bar hit here the 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:34.240
 face sent to my new sister is 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:37.629
 placed a different noise in the 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.849
 car is not much ball show gets 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:41.500
 very cool but the company that 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.800
 basically the same people I go 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:48.279
 pass an air like this guy is a car 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:55.560
 more and comes a little more due to the time 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:55.560
 because of everything happening one by one a 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.899
 Olympiad 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:04.300
 to wash the filter and another as it 

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:07.419
 stopped for at least a week and at least 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:14.430
 week of year only the weekend I 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:18.339
 I put the engine like I do sail shot 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.899
 Drop three drops here strip the filter pin 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:25.469
 three drops here on the carburetor with it 

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:28.779
 open and picks up his cord there 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:31.000
 sometimes for the artisan to enter the 

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:32.589
 engine to unify the entire engine there 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.680
 Beauty cart is ready to be 

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:37.419
 saved personal beauty then this 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.620
 second part of the video the two cars 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:40.689
 here o 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.849
 It's but he got distracted legal 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:44.259
 pity that you can not do other videos 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:46.809
 So I thought I 'd made one more 

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:50.860
 did not 

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:52.539
 but that's okay now left our the 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.459
 let the cars ready here for me 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:56.769
 to prepare for tomorrow 

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:58.119
 according to the working angles, 

00:06:56.769 --> 00:07:01.169
 escape 

00:06:58.119 --> 00:07:01.169
 said hug
