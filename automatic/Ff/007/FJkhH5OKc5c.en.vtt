00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
that this works just nicely or just as

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.259 
that this works just nicely or just as
well<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.880> can<00:02:27.120> attach<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.900> cannon<00:02:28.380> modes<00:02:28.620> in

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
well you can attach the cannon modes in

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.660 
well you can attach the cannon modes in
this<00:02:30.269> form<00:02:30.780> specifically<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.950> big<00:02:32.220> cannon

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
this form specifically the big cannon

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.640 
this form specifically the big cannon
there<00:02:32.849> at<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.060> top<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:33.510> then<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.110> sword<00:02:34.349> can

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
there at the top and then the sword can

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.759 
there at the top and then the sword can
just<00:02:34.830> be<00:02:34.950> held<00:02:35.190> off<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.090> side<00:02:36.330> or<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:37.140> can

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
just be held off to the side or you can

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.699 
just be held off to the side or you can
kind<00:02:38.040> of<00:02:38.190> give<00:02:38.340> him<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:39.050> 45<00:02:40.050> degree<00:02:40.230> or<00:02:40.500> thirty

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
kind of give him a 45 degree or thirty

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.100 
kind of give him a 45 degree or thirty
five<00:02:40.860> degree<00:02:41.160> angle<00:02:41.190> shooting<00:02:42.150> gun<00:02:42.630> thing

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
five degree angle shooting gun thing

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.920 
five degree angle shooting gun thing
yeah<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.670> sword<00:02:44.940> itself<00:02:45.239> is<00:02:45.450> kind<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.720> dumb

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
yeah the sword itself is kind of dumb

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.660 
yeah the sword itself is kind of dumb
but<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.380> appreciate<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:46.980> fact<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.310> they<00:02:47.459> have

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
but I appreciate the fact that they have

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.539 
but I appreciate the fact that they have
a<00:02:47.910> sword<00:02:48.209> as<00:02:48.480> opposed<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.930> gun<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.380> do<00:02:49.799> like

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
a sword as opposed to a gun I do like

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.150 
a sword as opposed to a gun I do like
the<00:02:50.940> look<00:02:51.120> but<00:02:51.810> I<00:02:51.989> will<00:02:52.350> much<00:02:52.560> rather<00:02:52.830> just

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
the look but I will much rather just

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.720 
the look but I will much rather just
have<00:02:53.310> him<00:02:53.549> in<00:02:53.760> his<00:02:54.090> Formula<00:02:54.569> one<00:02:54.750> mode

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
have him in his Formula one mode

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.949 
have him in his Formula one mode
transforming<00:02:56.730> him<00:02:56.849> into<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:57.120> Legg<00:02:57.420> mode<00:02:57.690> is

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
transforming him into a Legg mode is

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.650 
transforming him into a Legg mode is
very<00:02:58.230> easy<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:58.980> will<00:02:59.760> explain<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.239> little<00:03:00.360> bit

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
very easy I will explain a little bit

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.370 
very easy I will explain a little bit
here<00:03:00.870> in<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:00.989> minute

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
the front of the vehicle mode as you're

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.259 
the front of the vehicle mode as you're
going<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.860> do<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.310> robot<00:03:08.489> transformation

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
going to do the robot transformation

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.630 
going to do the robot transformation
fold<00:03:09.959> back<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.470> head<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:10.980> flip<00:03:11.459> up<00:03:11.610> the

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.430 
fold back the head and flip up the
combiner<00:03:12.120> port<00:03:12.420> now<00:03:12.959> you<00:03:13.019> might<00:03:13.319> be<00:03:13.349> wondering

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
combiner port now you might be wondering

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.000 
combiner port now you might be wondering
what<00:03:13.890> this<00:03:14.190> is<00:03:14.640> well<00:03:15.329> when<00:03:15.810> combining<00:03:16.290> this

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
what this is well when combining this

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.280 
what this is well when combining this
guy<00:03:17.280> at<00:03:17.670> drag<00:03:18.000> strip<00:03:18.239> as<00:03:18.359> a<00:03:18.390> leg<00:03:18.840> with<00:03:19.170> the

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
guy at drag strip as a leg with the

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.370 
guy at drag strip as a leg with the
aerial<00:03:19.739> BOTS<00:03:19.950> you<00:03:20.549> have<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:21.090> flip<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.750> rear<00:03:22.350> of

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
aerial BOTS you have to flip the rear of

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.729 
aerial BOTS you have to flip the rear of
the<00:03:22.709> vehicle<00:03:23.010> mode<00:03:23.370> up<00:03:23.780> otherwise<00:03:24.780> he's<00:03:25.470> going

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
the vehicle mode up otherwise he's going

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.759 
the vehicle mode up otherwise he's going
to<00:03:25.890> be<00:03:26.010> much<00:03:26.280> too<00:03:26.609> tall<00:03:27.150> of<00:03:27.600> a<00:03:27.750> leg<00:03:28.019> for<00:03:28.680> the

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
to be much too tall of a leg for the

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.220 
to be much too tall of a leg for the
other<00:03:28.950> aerial<00:03:29.519> BOTS<00:03:29.730> this<00:03:30.329> moving<00:03:31.049> this<00:03:31.170> up

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
other aerial BOTS this moving this up

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.039 
other aerial BOTS this moving this up
puts<00:03:32.010> him<00:03:32.220> in<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.519> same<00:03:32.880> height<00:03:33.299> as<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.600> other

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
puts him in the same height as the other

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.670 
puts him in the same height as the other
aerial<00:03:34.440> BOTS<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:35.489> I'm<00:03:36.450> assuming<00:03:37.230> that<00:03:37.470> when

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
aerial BOTS so I'm assuming that when

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.770 
aerial BOTS so I'm assuming that when
this<00:03:37.859> rest<00:03:38.100> of<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.310> stunticons<00:03:38.670> come<00:03:39.150> out<00:03:39.299> his

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
this rest of the stunticons come out his

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.920 
this rest of the stunticons come out his
light<00:03:40.049> will<00:03:40.230> look<00:03:40.380> like<00:03:40.590> that<00:03:41.299> our<00:03:42.299> mode<00:03:42.780> is

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
light will look like that our mode is

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.569 
light will look like that our mode is
like<00:03:43.109> all<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.290> other<00:03:43.530> guys<00:03:43.739> where<00:03:44.130> you<00:03:44.340> take

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
like all the other guys where you take

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.449 
like all the other guys where you take
part<00:03:44.910> of<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.120> robot<00:03:46.079> mode<00:03:46.290> bring<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.280> legs

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
part of the robot mode bring the legs

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.340 
part of the robot mode bring the legs
together<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:47.940> then<00:03:48.180> turn<00:03:48.510> them<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.989> make<00:03:49.170> the

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
together and then turn them to make the

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.890 
together and then turn them to make the
arm<00:03:49.590> or<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.280> lower<00:03:50.430> arm<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.090> then<00:03:51.720> do<00:03:51.870> a

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
arm or the lower arm and then do a

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.660 
arm or the lower arm and then do a
little<00:03:52.109> bit<00:03:52.260> of<00:03:52.440> fiddling<00:03:52.859> up<00:03:53.010> top<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.519> make

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
little bit of fiddling up top to make

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.940 
little bit of fiddling up top to make
the<00:03:53.880> upper<00:03:54.329> part<00:03:54.540> of<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.720> arm<00:03:54.750> you<00:03:55.590> can<00:03:55.829> get

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
the upper part of the arm you can get

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.770 
the upper part of the arm you can get
the<00:03:56.069> arms<00:03:56.430> or<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.760> robot<00:03:57.000> arms<00:03:57.450> out<00:03:57.600> of<00:03:57.630> the

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
the arms or the robot arms out of the

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.420 
the arms or the robot arms out of the
way<00:03:57.810> pretty<00:03:58.230> easily<00:03:58.470> by<00:03:58.769> just<00:03:58.799> folding<00:03:59.340> over

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
way pretty easily by just folding over

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.789 
way pretty easily by just folding over
the<00:03:59.609> where<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.880> head<00:04:00.030> used<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.420> be<00:04:00.569> I<00:04:00.799> like

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
the where the head used to be I like

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.500 
the where the head used to be I like
drag<00:04:02.040> strip<00:04:02.310> a<00:04:02.430> lot<00:04:02.639> even<00:04:02.940> though<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.329> figure

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
drag strip a lot even though the figure

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.750 
drag strip a lot even though the figure
has<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.840> few<00:04:04.290> minor<00:04:04.560> little<00:04:04.859> faults<00:04:05.400> I<00:04:05.489> still

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
has a few minor little faults I still

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.280 
has a few minor little faults I still
can't<00:04:06.000> help<00:04:06.239> but<00:04:06.420> loving<00:04:06.780> him<00:04:06.900> and<00:04:07.049> I<00:04:07.079> always

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
can't help but loving him and I always

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.789 
can't help but loving him and I always
like<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.769> stunticons<00:04:08.160> more<00:04:09.060> than<00:04:09.299> I<00:04:09.389> did<00:04:09.600> the

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
like the stunticons more than I did the
