one of me and bouncing we're working on

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.250 
one of me and bouncing we're working on
I<00:00:11.269> did<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.469> coordinates<00:00:13.610> to<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:14.960> it's<00:00:15.960> I'll

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
I did the coordinates to this it's I'll

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.080 
I did the coordinates to this it's I'll
leave<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.590> link<00:00:16.920> in<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.160> description<00:00:17.820> below

but<00:00:18.720> actually<00:00:19.140> there's<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.650> site<00:00:19.859> where<00:00:19.890> you

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
but actually there's a site where you

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.160 
but actually there's a site where you
could<00:00:20.220> find<00:00:20.580> your<00:00:20.880> coordinates<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.869> where<00:00:22.020> you

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
could find your coordinates to where you

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.050 
could find your coordinates to where you
should<00:00:22.380> build<00:00:22.560> your<00:00:22.769> slime<00:00:23.010> farm<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.910> was

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
should build your slime farm it was

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.790 
should build your slime farm it was
originally<00:00:24.539> made<00:00:24.689> for<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.960> PC<00:00:25.350> version<00:00:25.769> but

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
originally made for the PC version but

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.070 
originally made for the PC version but
it<00:00:26.279> actually<00:00:26.699> works<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.060> Xbox<00:00:27.539> version<00:00:27.960> as<00:00:28.050> you

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
it actually works on Xbox version as you

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.049 
it actually works on Xbox version as you
can<00:00:28.289> see<00:00:29.269> anyway<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:30.529> the<00:00:31.529> canal<00:00:31.890> drags<00:00:32.790> into

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
can see anyway so the canal drags into

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.990 
can see anyway so the canal drags into
the<00:00:33.149> spot<00:00:33.530> where<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.680> see<00:00:35.040> there<00:00:35.340> where<00:00:35.940> I

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the spot where you can see there where I

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.930 
the spot where you can see there where I
trap<00:00:36.390> some<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:37.410> will<00:00:37.649> actually<00:00:37.980> drown<00:00:38.309> them<00:00:38.610> to

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
trap some it will actually drown them to

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.150 
trap some it will actually drown them to
the<00:00:39.120> size<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.079> smaller<00:00:40.440> ones<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.920> you

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
the size of the smaller ones that you

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.900 
the size of the smaller ones that you
need<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.700> will<00:00:42.510> shoot<00:00:42.750> up<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.050> hatch<00:00:43.320> here

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
need that will shoot up this hatch here

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.979 
need that will shoot up this hatch here
and<00:00:44.910> they'll<00:00:45.059> actually<00:00:45.270> go<00:00:45.570> right<00:00:45.719> up<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
and they'll actually go right up the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.779 
and they'll actually go right up the
ladder<00:00:46.170> into<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.739> room<00:00:46.950> which<00:00:47.430> I'm<00:00:47.610> about<00:00:47.730> to

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
ladder into the room which I'm about to

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.720 
ladder into the room which I'm about to
show<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.120> guys<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:49.010> seen<00:00:50.010> they<00:00:50.190> get<00:00:50.370> smaller

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
show you guys I seen they get smaller

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.979 
show you guys I seen they get smaller
and<00:00:52.100> then<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.309> feeds<00:00:53.610> them<00:00:53.910> right<00:00:54.239> into<00:00:54.570> this

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
and then it feeds them right into this

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.720 
and then it feeds them right into this
little<00:00:55.260> very<00:00:55.649> goats<00:00:56.010> right<00:00:56.340> up<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.579> ladder

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
little very goats right up the ladder

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.000 
little very goats right up the ladder
there<00:00:59.300> it's<00:01:00.300> really<00:01:00.629> quite<00:01:01.079> convenient<00:01:01.680> this

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
there it's really quite convenient this

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
way you don't have to go all the way to

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.479 
way you don't have to go all the way to
the<00:01:03.449> ground<00:01:03.629> as<00:01:03.899> well<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.379> check<00:01:05.040> your<00:01:05.250> slime
