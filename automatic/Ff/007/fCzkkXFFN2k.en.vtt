00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
without easily it came on if anything

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.260 
without easily it came on if anything
I'd<00:05:23.949> say<00:05:23.979> there's<00:05:24.400> a<00:05:24.460> chance<00:05:24.729> that<00:05:24.849> I<00:05:25.089> would

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
I'd say there's a chance that I would

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.239 
I'd say there's a chance that I would
accidentally<00:05:25.960> put<00:05:26.199> too<00:05:26.439> much<00:05:26.620> on<00:05:26.830> because<00:05:27.159> I

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:27.249 
accidentally put too much on because I

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:29.369 
accidentally put too much on because I
didn't<00:05:27.490> expect<00:05:27.849> it<00:05:28.060> to<00:05:28.300> be<00:05:28.419> so<00:05:28.449> pigmented<00:05:28.960> but

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:29.379 
didn't expect it to be so pigmented but

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:31.140 
didn't expect it to be so pigmented but
if<00:05:29.860> you<00:05:29.949> just<00:05:30.159> do<00:05:30.279> a<00:05:30.310> little<00:05:30.460> by<00:05:30.669> little<00:05:30.699> then

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
if you just do a little by little then

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.369 
if you just do a little by little then
you<00:05:31.270> shouldn't<00:05:31.509> have<00:05:31.539> any<00:05:31.629> issues<00:05:31.810> with<00:05:32.169> that

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:32.379 
you shouldn't have any issues with that

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:34.740 
you shouldn't have any issues with that
I'm<00:05:32.830> really<00:05:33.189> happy<00:05:33.520> with<00:05:33.789> the<00:05:33.939> color<00:05:34.089> I<00:05:34.419> really

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
pretty reasonable next is this mascara

applying<00:06:25.539> it<00:06:25.960> it<00:06:26.259> became<00:06:26.680> like<00:06:26.979> instantly

00:06:27.869 --> 00:06:27.879 
applying it it became like instantly

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:29.760 
applying it it became like instantly
hard<00:06:28.240> like<00:06:28.539> this<00:06:28.719> mascara<00:06:29.110> is<00:06:29.289> not<00:06:29.560> going<00:06:29.710> to

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
hard like this mascara is not going to

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.619 
hard like this mascara is not going to
rub<00:06:30.069> off<00:06:30.250> on<00:06:30.430> anything<00:06:30.699> so<00:06:31.330> you<00:06:31.389> would

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:31.629 
rub off on anything so you would

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:34.829 
rub off on anything so you would
definitely<00:06:32.229> need<00:06:32.620> to<00:06:33.129> do<00:06:33.610> your<00:06:33.849> eyeliner<00:06:34.180> or

00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:34.839 
definitely need to do your eyeliner or

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:37.350 
definitely need to do your eyeliner or
eyeshadow<00:06:34.959> and<00:06:35.709> stuff<00:06:35.979> before<00:06:36.550> putting<00:06:37.180> on

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
eyeshadow and stuff before putting on

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.930 
eyeshadow and stuff before putting on
the<00:06:37.479> mascara

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
the mascara

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.180 
the mascara
because<00:06:38.240> it<00:06:38.450> is<00:06:38.630> just<00:06:38.900> not<00:06:39.230> moving<00:06:39.680> it<00:06:40.070> would

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
because it is just not moving it would

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.070 
because it is just not moving it would
probably<00:06:40.430> be<00:06:40.670> a<00:06:40.700> really<00:06:40.790> good<00:06:41.330> mascara<00:06:41.540> to

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
probably be a really good mascara to

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.170 
probably be a really good mascara to
wear<00:06:42.290> with<00:06:42.740> fake<00:06:43.100> lashes<00:06:43.430> because<00:06:43.820> of<00:06:44.060> how

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
wear with fake lashes because of how

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.300 
wear with fake lashes because of how
stiff<00:06:44.630> it<00:06:44.810> actually<00:06:45.200> makes<00:06:45.440> your<00:06:45.710> eyelashes

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
stiff it actually makes your eyelashes

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.130 
stiff it actually makes your eyelashes
so<00:06:46.850> if<00:06:46.910> you're<00:06:47.060> somebody<00:06:47.270> who<00:06:47.540> likes<00:06:47.750> your

so if you're somebody who likes your

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.350 
so if you're somebody who likes your
lashes<00:06:48.350> to<00:06:48.680> still<00:06:48.920> feel<00:06:49.100> soft<00:06:49.610> while<00:06:50.030> I<00:06:50.060> have
