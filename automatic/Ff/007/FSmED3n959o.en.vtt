00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
this at a store called Tuesday morning

stores around you'll know what I'm

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.299 
stores around you'll know what I'm
talking<00:00:28.619> about<00:00:28.699> but<00:00:29.699> uh<00:00:30.439> it<00:00:31.439> was<00:00:31.710> four<00:00:32.160> dollars

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
talking about but uh it was four dollars

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.639 
talking about but uh it was four dollars
I<00:00:32.700> believe<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.329> Tuesday<00:00:33.870> morning<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:35.149> it's

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
I believe a Tuesday morning and it's

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.930 
I believe a Tuesday morning and it's
pretty<00:00:37.649> much<00:00:37.770> almost<00:00:39.469> identical<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:41.100> nerf

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
pretty much almost identical to a nerf

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.240 
pretty much almost identical to a nerf
secret<00:00:42.719> strike<00:00:44.090> size<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.480> actually<00:00:46.250> almost

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
secret strike size is actually almost

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.830 
secret strike size is actually almost
the<00:00:47.610> same<00:00:47.850> it's<00:00:48.210> actually<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.510> little<00:00:48.629> bit

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
the same it's actually a little bit

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.260 
the same it's actually a little bit
shorter<00:00:49.260> than<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.530> secret<00:00:50.160> strike<00:00:50.610> but<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.059> does

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
shorter than a secret strike but it does

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.850 
shorter than a secret strike but it does
have<00:00:51.539> more<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.989> handle<00:00:52.440> for<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.829> grip<00:00:54.860> it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
have more of a handle for you to grip it

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.260 
have more of a handle for you to grip it
comes<00:00:56.100> with<00:00:56.309> one<00:00:56.579> chop<00:00:57.149> Dart<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:59.270> really

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
comes with one chop Dart and really

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.880 
comes with one chop Dart and really
that's<00:01:00.390> all<00:01:00.600> there<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.260> it

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
that's all there is to it

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.009 
that's all there is to it
it<00:01:02.430> works<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.879> same<00:01:02.910> as<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.300> secret<00:01:03.719> strike

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
it works the same as a secret strike

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.190 
it works the same as a secret strike
just<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.470> pump<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:06.479> only<00:01:06.689> difference<00:01:07.080> is

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
just a pump the only difference is

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.050 
just a pump the only difference is
instead<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.770> push-button<00:01:08.070> trigger<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:08.939> a

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
instead of a push-button trigger it's a

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.440 
instead of a push-button trigger it's a
slider<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.890> slide<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.070> back<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.610> that's<00:01:12.180> what

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
slider you slide it back and that's what

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.200 
slider you slide it back and that's what
fires<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:16.310> looking<00:01:17.310> at<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.610> from<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.150> angle

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
fires it looking at it from this angle

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.210 
fires it looking at it from this angle
it's<00:01:18.840> actually<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> little<00:01:19.530> bit<00:01:19.650> thinner<00:01:19.950> than

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
it's actually a little bit thinner than

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.149 
it's actually a little bit thinner than
a<00:01:20.340> secret<00:01:20.549> strike<00:01:21.290> like<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.320> said<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:22.710> shorter

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
a secret strike like I said it's shorter

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.120 
a secret strike like I said it's shorter
but<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.240> has<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.689> longer<00:01:25.110> handle<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.770> has<00:01:25.890> more

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
but it has a longer handle it has more

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.539 
but it has a longer handle it has more
of<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.280> handle<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:27.740> I'll<00:01:28.740> take<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> shot<00:01:29.310> here

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
of a handle to it I'll take a shot here

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.080 
of a handle to it I'll take a shot here
real<00:01:29.880> quick<00:01:30.150> with<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:34.400> if<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.729> get<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:35.970> to

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
real quick with it if I can get it to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:45.280 
real quick with it if I can get it to
work<00:01:37.939> which<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.119> now<00:01:39.390> can't<00:01:40.520> so<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.640> actually

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.510 

there<00:01:46.130> yeah

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.490 

ranges<00:01:49.520> are<00:01:49.760> about<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.570> same<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.200> secret

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
ranges are about the same to the secret

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.200 
ranges are about the same to the secret
strike<00:01:54.130> try<00:01:55.130> another<00:01:55.400> this<00:01:55.730> is<00:01:55.880> actually<00:01:56.180> a

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
strike try another this is actually a

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.950 
strike try another this is actually a
Arizona<00:01:56.840> dart<00:01:57.170> here<00:01:57.560> that<00:01:58.600> seems<00:01:59.600> like<00:01:59.780> it

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
Arizona dart here that seems like it

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.900 
Arizona dart here that seems like it
gets<00:02:00.080> a<00:02:00.260> better<00:02:00.410> fit<00:02:00.800> in<00:02:01.010> the<00:02:01.100> barrel<00:02:01.310> than<00:02:01.640> the

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
gets a better fit in the barrel than the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:09.910 
gets a better fit in the barrel than the
chalk<00:02:02.420> dart<00:02:07.149> so<00:02:08.149> it<00:02:08.360> uh<00:02:08.390> issues<00:02:09.140> pretty<00:02:09.470> decent

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
chalk dart so it uh issues pretty decent

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:17.800 
chalk dart so it uh issues pretty decent
for<00:02:10.070> such<00:02:10.399> a<00:02:10.430> small<00:02:10.790> compact<00:02:11.890> blaster<00:02:16.690> when<00:02:17.690> it

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
for such a small compact blaster when it

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.110 
for such a small compact blaster when it
works<00:02:17.990> correctly<00:02:18.230> about<00:02:18.860> three<00:02:19.850> or<00:02:19.940> four

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
works correctly about three or four

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.220 
works correctly about three or four
pumps<00:02:20.480> in<00:02:20.630> it's<00:02:20.750> full<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:23.360> does<00:02:23.600> have<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:23.840> dart

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
pumps in it's full it does have a dart

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.500 
pumps in it's full it does have a dart
peg<00:02:24.470> inside<00:02:26.770> restrictor<00:02:27.770> I<00:02:27.830> guess<00:02:28.160> I<00:02:28.510> haven't

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
peg inside restrictor I guess I haven't

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.450 
peg inside restrictor I guess I haven't
actually<00:02:29.690> opened<00:02:30.350> it<00:02:30.470> up<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.650> look<00:02:31.130> at<00:02:31.280> the

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
actually opened it up to look at the

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.780 
actually opened it up to look at the
actual<00:02:32.180> internal<00:02:32.840> but<00:02:33.320> there<00:02:33.770> is<00:02:33.950> three

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
actual internal but there is three

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.940 
actual internal but there is three
screws<00:02:35.120> in<00:02:35.660> it<00:02:36.200> that's<00:02:36.500> it<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:38.180> it's<00:02:39.110> I<00:02:39.440> mean

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
screws in it that's it and it's I mean

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.320 
screws in it that's it and it's I mean
it's<00:02:40.130> pretty<00:02:40.310> straightforward<00:02:40.670> nothing

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
it's pretty straightforward nothing

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.830 
it's pretty straightforward nothing
really<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.750> it<00:02:42.130> gets<00:02:43.130> fairly<00:02:43.970> okay<00:02:44.300> ranges

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
really to it gets fairly okay ranges

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.990 
really to it gets fairly okay ranges
like<00:02:45.110> I<00:02:45.260> said<00:02:45.440> I<00:02:45.470> paid<00:02:45.770> four<00:02:46.220> dollars<00:02:46.550> for<00:02:46.670> it

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
like I said I paid four dollars for it

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.190 
like I said I paid four dollars for it
so<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:48.410> guess<00:02:49.310> it's<00:02:49.489> a<00:02:49.720> different<00:02:50.720> alternative

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
so I guess it's a different alternative

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.030 
so I guess it's a different alternative
to<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.370> secret<00:02:53.090> strike<00:02:53.420> so<00:02:54.230> if<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.860> come

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
to the secret strike so if you come

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.000 
to the secret strike so if you come
across<00:02:55.070> one<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:56.750> may<00:02:57.110> want<00:02:57.350> to<00:02:57.410> pick<00:02:57.560> it<00:02:57.709> up<00:02:57.800> if

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
across one you may want to pick it up if

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.130 
across one you may want to pick it up if
you<00:02:58.070> want<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.150> you<00:02:59.360> know<00:02:59.480> fiddle<00:02:59.810> around<00:02:59.900> with

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
you want to you know fiddle around with

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.740 
you want to you know fiddle around with
it<00:03:00.260> like<00:03:00.590> I<00:03:01.100> said<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.489> does<00:03:01.670> get<00:03:01.940> fairly<00:03:02.360> decent

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
it like I said it does get fairly decent

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.130 
it like I said it does get fairly decent
ranges<00:03:04.450> that's<00:03:05.450> close<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:05.720> thirty<00:03:06.080> feet<00:03:08.140> maybe

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
ranges that's close to thirty feet maybe

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.850 
ranges that's close to thirty feet maybe
more<00:03:09.530> maybe<00:03:10.160> less<00:03:10.340> but<00:03:10.850> uh<00:03:11.660> I'm<00:03:12.260> pretty<00:03:12.470> happy

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
more maybe less but uh I'm pretty happy

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.710 
more maybe less but uh I'm pretty happy
with<00:03:12.980> it

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
with it

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.660 
with it
so<00:03:14.720> there<00:03:15.290> you<00:03:15.470> have<00:03:15.530> it<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.950> wipeout<00:03:16.340> mini

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670
