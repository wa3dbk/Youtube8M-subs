the ones tested there will be tested

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.940 
the ones tested there will be tested
probably<00:04:47.750> off<00:04:47.840> in<00:04:47.870> relationship<00:04:48.740> like

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
probably off in relationship like

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.250 
probably off in relationship like
opposition<00:04:49.670> like<00:04:49.910> someone<00:04:50.360> stopping<00:04:50.960> their

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
plants like things getting harder moving

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.440 
plants like things getting harder moving
harder<00:04:54.710> than<00:04:54.890> they<00:04:55.070> expect<00:04:55.580> it's<00:04:55.820> a<00:04:55.970> testing

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
harder than they expect it's a testing
