00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.019

 the rules of appearance accompanied with a bang 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.460
 strange for the sake of interference television 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.440
 which arose on the screen well and in 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.270
 Basically, the whole point of the game was not 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.130
