00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.390
 we have here and all our 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.870
 ingredients I will spend this delicious 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.270
 salsita ay does not know what wonder and already 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.800
 saw what good it does to make and 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.620
 you can put any spicy with 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.410
 Chipotle is also delicious if 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.990
 truth and there is god saw a little bit of 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.400
 Ginger could also put garlic and 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:27.800
 like you can do a different variety 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.820
 then let me cook the salsita a 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.060
 little bit more 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.370
 first we are going to pass the strips of 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.280
 chicken that is chicken breast by the 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.430
 flour we went through the flour very very 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.319
 well then let's go through the 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.900
 egg 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.599
 since it is completely covered in 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.079
 beaten egg finally we will pass 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:53.989
 by coconut exactly delicious coquito 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:57.200
 it's the same procedure for you 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:04:00.170
 make fried chicken but instead of coconut 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.500
 you can put panko breadcrumbs 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.680
 wheat germ in infinity of the 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.290
 paris also crispy is true is 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.400
 rich then is the procedure very 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.469
 simple let's move on to frying it and you 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.169
 I recommend that you make them thin 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:21.530
 strips because the coconut tends to burn 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:24.620
 very very easy if they make very thick 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.430
 to stay raw and the coconut can be 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:31.009
 brown other then so fire 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:34.090
 medium-low golden brown 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:37.099
 look for example this is already golden brown 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.289
 let's stop spinning 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:42.610
 have to be careful so that we do not get 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:45.230
 go to burn let's serve the salsita 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.200
 that is nothing more 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.900
 well rich you can also put curry 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.510
 I fancy if you like curry 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.780
 you can put it and you can do as you 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.240
 I say the variation that I like then 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.910
 this bandage that was well thin and 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.060
 it's ready we're going to turn it into a paper 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.420
 absorbent then it is a recommendation 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.690
 well thin strips over medium heat 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.550
 low and in three minutes they are donated and 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.340
 perfect that aside the chicken is 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.680
 super tender, very juicy as well as 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.510
 I like children I think it can be a 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.060
 good dish for today 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.400
 accompany it with vegetables can 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.920
 accompany with salad and you know you 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.420
