00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.750 

we've<00:00:01.380> covered<00:00:01.620> how<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:01.860> create<00:00:02.220> regions<00:00:02.610> of

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
we've covered how to create regions of

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.240 
we've covered how to create regions of
interest<00:00:02.939> both<00:00:03.899> with<00:00:04.110> atlases<00:00:04.740> and<00:00:05.040> with

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
interest both with atlases and with

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.280 
interest both with atlases and with
contrast<00:00:05.819> we've<00:00:06.060> run<00:00:06.299> through<00:00:06.629> first<00:00:07.049> and

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
contrast we've run through first and

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.009 
contrast we've run through first and
second<00:00:07.589> level<00:00:07.830> analyses<00:00:08.420> now<00:00:09.420> what<00:00:09.570> we<00:00:09.690> can<00:00:09.840> do

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
second level analyses now what we can do

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.850 
second level analyses now what we can do
is<00:00:10.320> we<00:00:10.590> can<00:00:10.710> actually<00:00:10.950> just<00:00:11.400> create<00:00:12.030> an<00:00:12.330> ROI

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
is we can actually just create an ROI

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.760 
is we can actually just create an ROI
using<00:00:13.860> something<00:00:14.099> like<00:00:14.219> Microsoft<00:00:15.000> Paint

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
using something like Microsoft Paint

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.580 
using something like Microsoft Paint
right<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.190> you<00:00:17.279> remember<00:00:17.369> like<00:00:17.850> when<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.590> you

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
right so you remember like when you you

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.230 
right so you remember like when you you
kind<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.800> have<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.949> crush<00:00:20.550> on<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.820> girl<00:00:21.029> in

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
kind of have a crush on that girl in

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.880 
kind of have a crush on that girl in
school<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.500> didn't<00:00:22.650> really<00:00:22.769> you

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
school and you you you didn't really you

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.830 
school and you you you didn't really you
don't<00:00:23.039> talk<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.519> her<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.670> just<00:00:23.880> instead<00:00:24.210> you

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
don't talk to her you just instead you

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.720 
don't talk to her you just instead you
know<00:00:24.930> throw<00:00:25.529> stuff<00:00:25.800> in<00:00:25.920> ms<00:00:26.189> paint<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.670> you

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
know throw stuff in ms paint and you

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.089 
know throw stuff in ms paint and you
send<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.269> her<00:00:27.390> kind<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.840> like<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.019> joke<00:00:28.289> to

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
send it to her kind of like a joke to

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.429 
send it to her kind of like a joke to
get<00:00:29.220> our<00:00:29.340> attention<00:00:29.480> it's<00:00:30.480> kind<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.050> like<00:00:31.170> that

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
get our attention it's kind of like that

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.910 
get our attention it's kind of like that
so<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:31.920> can<00:00:32.189> do<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.579> FSL<00:00:33.149> view<00:00:33.739> if<00:00:34.739> you

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
so you can do this to FSL view if you

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.220 
so you can do this to FSL view if you
just<00:00:35.070> open<00:00:35.610> up<00:00:35.730> one<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.239> these<00:00:36.300> standardized

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
just open up one of these standardized

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.510 
just open up one of these standardized
spaces<00:00:38.129> okay<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.590> it's<00:00:40.590> like<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.860> average

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
spaces okay so it's like this average

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.110 
spaces okay so it's like this average
152<00:00:42.420> brain<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.230> let's<00:00:44.129> say<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.760> want<00:00:44.789> to

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
152 brain and let's say we want to

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.560 
152 brain and let's say we want to
create<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.600> mask<00:00:45.899> based<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:47.059> again<00:00:48.059> just<00:00:48.390> like

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
create a mask based on again just like

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.520 
create a mask based on again just like
Microsoft<00:00:48.870> Paint

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
Microsoft Paint

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.080 
Microsoft Paint
you<00:00:49.649> know<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:49.950> fill<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.370> places<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:50.940> we

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
you know we just fill in places that we

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.270 
you know we just fill in places that we
want<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.960> our<00:00:52.079> region<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.350> interest<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.949> make

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
want for our region of interest and make

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.340 
want for our region of interest and make
that<00:00:53.520> one<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.239> zero<00:00:54.870> otherwise

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
that one and zero otherwise

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.680 
that one and zero otherwise
so<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.460> when<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:56.730> actually<00:00:56.850> run<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.420> region

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
so that when we actually run the region

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.810 
so that when we actually run the region
of<00:00:57.780> interest<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.289> only<00:00:58.469> extract<00:00:58.949> data<00:00:59.640> from

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
of interest we only extract data from

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.889 
of interest we only extract data from
those<00:01:00.270> voxels<00:01:00.809> which<00:01:00.960> have<00:01:01.109> been<00:01:01.230> painted<00:01:01.710> on

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
those voxels which have been painted on

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.679 
those voxels which have been painted on
to<00:01:03.899> do<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.170> go<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.470> file<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.339> create<00:01:05.760> mask<00:01:06.060> or

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
to do this go to file and create mask or

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.730 
to do this go to file and create mask or
Apple<00:01:07.350> C<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.860> you'll<00:01:08.700> see<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.590> excuse<00:01:10.590> me

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
Apple C and you'll see this excuse me

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.270 
Apple C and you'll see this excuse me
this<00:01:10.920> mask<00:01:11.220> tool<00:01:11.549> gets<00:01:11.820> unlocked<00:01:13.130> click<00:01:14.130> on

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
this mask tool gets unlocked click on

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.780 
this mask tool gets unlocked click on
that<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:15.030> notice<00:01:16.020> here<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.590> have<00:01:16.890> first<00:01:17.670> of

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
that and notice here you have first of

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.070 
that and notice here you have first of
all<00:01:18.500> depend<00:01:19.500> value<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.640> might<00:01:20.850> have<00:01:21.090> one

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
all depend value so we might have one

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.990 
all depend value so we might have one
color<00:01:22.350> correspond<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.130> one<00:01:23.400> mask<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.939> another

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
color correspond to one mask and another

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.060 
color correspond to one mask and another
color<00:01:24.420> corresponding<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.170> another<00:01:25.350> mask<00:01:25.680> if

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
color corresponding to another mask if

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.190 
color corresponding to another mask if
you<00:01:26.189> want<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.460> draw<00:01:26.640> multiple<00:01:26.880> masks<00:01:27.570> on<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
you want to draw multiple masks on the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.980 
you want to draw multiple masks on the
same<00:01:28.380> brain<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.340> also<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.210> can<00:01:30.479> increase<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
same brain and also you can increase the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.800 
same brain and also you can increase the
pen<00:01:31.229> size<00:01:31.530> okay<00:01:32.340> guys<00:01:32.729> are<00:01:32.970> really<00:01:33.299> crazy

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
pen size okay guys are really crazy

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.690 
pen size okay guys are really crazy
about<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.380> we<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:34.770> increase<00:01:35.670> a

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
about this so we can just increase a

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.990 
about this so we can just increase a
number<00:01:35.820> until<00:01:36.659> we<00:01:36.990> have<00:01:37.350> say<00:01:38.100> five<00:01:38.400> boxes<00:01:38.640> at

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
number until we have say five boxes at

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.200 
number until we have say five boxes at
the<00:01:39.060> time<00:01:39.270> being<00:01:39.689> created<00:01:40.790> so<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.880> show<00:01:42.150> you

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
the time being created so to show you

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.700 
the time being created so to show you
how<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.720> done<00:01:42.869> let's<00:01:43.259> say<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.470> want<00:01:43.649> to

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
how this is done let's say we want to

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.740 
how this is done let's say we want to
create<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.920> mask<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.490> anterior<00:01:45.360> cingulate

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
create a mask of the anterior cingulate

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.789 
create a mask of the anterior cingulate
cortex<00:01:47.240> so<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.570> can<00:01:48.720> draw<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.290> pen<00:01:49.619> around

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
cortex so we can draw this pen around

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.090 
cortex so we can draw this pen around
here<00:01:50.960> now<00:01:51.960> we<00:01:52.020> could<00:01:52.259> create<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.560> bigger<00:01:52.799> circle

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
here now we could create a bigger circle

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.399 
here now we could create a bigger circle
for<00:01:53.520> example<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:54.720> could<00:01:54.840> use<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> bucket

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
for example and we could use a bucket

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.100 
for example and we could use a bucket
just<00:01:55.770> like<00:01:55.860> an<00:01:56.070> MS<00:01:56.310> paint<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.969> fill<00:01:57.930> that

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
just like an MS paint and fill that

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.350 
just like an MS paint and fill that
stuff<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.649> okay<00:01:59.189> if<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.759> screw<00:02:00.030> up<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.270> go

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
stuff in okay if you screw up and go

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.810 
stuff in okay if you screw up and go
outside<00:02:00.719> then<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.049> whole<00:02:01.259> thing<00:02:01.530> gets

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
outside then the whole thing gets

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.010 
outside then the whole thing gets
plotted<00:02:02.820> out<00:02:02.969> I'm<00:02:03.540> sure<00:02:03.750> you're<00:02:03.899> all<00:02:03.990> familiar

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
plotted out I'm sure you're all familiar

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.310 
plotted out I'm sure you're all familiar
with<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.619> but<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:05.759> undo<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.119> okay<00:02:07.079> so

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
with that but you can undo it okay so

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.889 
with that but you can undo it okay so
that's<00:02:08.310> really<00:02:08.849> all<00:02:09.060> there<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.690> you

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
that's really all there is to it and you

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.720 
that's really all there is to it and you
can<00:02:10.050> erase<00:02:10.289> stuff<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.770> can<00:02:10.890> make<00:02:11.039> things<00:02:11.280> you

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
can erase stuff you can make things you

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.390 
can erase stuff you can make things you
know<00:02:11.819> zero<00:02:12.290> zero<00:02:13.290> them<00:02:13.440> out

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
know zero zero them out

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.180 
know zero zero them out
and<00:02:15.090> by<00:02:15.269> increasing<00:02:15.450> your<00:02:15.840> pen<00:02:15.989> size<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.830> can

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
and by increasing your pen size you can

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.720 
and by increasing your pen size you can
make<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.659> lot<00:02:19.230> easier<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.799> do<00:02:19.980> also<00:02:20.489> gets<00:02:20.700> a

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
make this a lot easier to do also gets a

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.030 
make this a lot easier to do also gets a
little<00:02:20.849> bit<00:02:21.000> Messier<00:02:21.450> but<00:02:21.900> it's<00:02:22.769> just<00:02:22.860> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
little bit Messier but it's just the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.820 
little bit Messier but it's just the
trade-off<00:02:23.510> okay<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:24.569> I'm<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.379> know<00:02:25.500> roughly

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
trade-off okay so I'm you know roughly

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.490 
trade-off okay so I'm you know roughly
the<00:02:26.250> anterior<00:02:27.000> area<00:02:27.420> okay

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
the anterior area okay

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.949 
the anterior area okay
I'm<00:02:28.769> happy<00:02:29.099> with<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:30.150> all<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.780> need<00:02:30.930> to

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
I'm happy with that and all you need to

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.020 
I'm happy with that and all you need to
do<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.440> make<00:02:31.680> sure<00:02:31.709> you<00:02:31.920> do<00:02:32.129> it<00:02:32.280> within<00:02:32.519> each

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
do is make sure you do it within each

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.509 
do is make sure you do it within each
orthogonal<00:02:33.989> view<00:02:34.319> so<00:02:34.920> make<00:02:35.069> sure<00:02:35.129> you<00:02:35.280> do<00:02:35.430> it

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
orthogonal view so make sure you do it

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.000 
orthogonal view so make sure you do it
in<00:02:35.579> two<00:02:35.930> coronal<00:02:36.930> section<00:02:37.349> make<00:02:37.590> sure<00:02:37.739> you<00:02:37.829> do

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
in two coronal section make sure you do

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
in two coronal section make sure you do
it<00:02:38.129> in<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:39.230> transverse<00:02:40.230> section<00:02:40.879> things<00:02:41.879> like

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
it in the transverse section things like

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.240 
it in the transverse section things like
that<00:02:42.239> okay<00:02:42.989> filling<00:02:43.440> all<00:02:43.560> those<00:02:43.709> gray<00:02:44.040> matter

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
that okay filling all those gray matter

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.949 
that okay filling all those gray matter
voxels<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.900> just<00:02:46.709> have<00:02:47.040> fun<00:02:47.750> that's<00:02:48.750> really

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
voxels and just have fun that's really

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.690 
voxels and just have fun that's really
all<00:02:49.049> there<00:02:49.170> is<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.739> once<00:02:50.519> you're<00:02:50.670> done

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
all there is to it and once you're done

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.910 
all there is to it and once you're done
with<00:02:50.940> one<00:02:51.150> slice

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
with one slice

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.289 
with one slice
remember<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.099> alter<00:02:53.579> your<00:02:53.609> position<00:02:54.120> from

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
remember to alter your position from

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.750 
remember to alter your position from
another<00:02:54.540> slice<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:55.440> for<00:02:55.620> example<00:02:56.040> on<00:02:56.370> the

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
another slice so for example on the

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.160 
another slice so for example on the
transverse<00:02:57.060> slice<00:02:57.420> on<00:02:57.540> which<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.810> left<00:02:58.049> or

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
transverse slice on which the left or

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.259 
transverse slice on which the left or
the<00:02:58.200> right<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.829> you<00:02:59.310> can<00:02:59.459> see<00:02:59.640> that<00:02:59.790> I<00:02:59.849> need<00:03:00.120> to

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
the right and you can see that I need to

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.809 
the right and you can see that I need to
fill<00:03:00.989> on<00:03:01.140> this<00:03:01.290> slice<00:03:01.530> now<00:03:01.940> with<00:03:02.940> more<00:03:03.599> voxels

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
fill on this slice now with more voxels

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.220 
fill on this slice now with more voxels
and<00:03:05.819> do<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.180> until<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:06.540> have<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.720> good<00:03:06.780> three

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
and do that until you have a good three

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.130 
and do that until you have a good three
representation<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:09.510> region<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:10.019> you

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
representation of the region that you

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.149 
representation of the region that you
want<00:03:10.409> to<00:03:10.709> create<00:03:11.220> as<00:03:11.819> a<00:03:11.879> mask<00:03:12.799> like<00:03:13.799> I<00:03:13.950> said

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
want to create as a mask like I said

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:21.470 
want to create as a mask like I said
this<00:03:14.310> doesn't<00:03:14.370> take<00:03:14.849> down<00:03:15.120> much<00:03:15.329> time<00:03:20.480> maybe

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
this doesn't take down much time maybe

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.360 
this doesn't take down much time maybe
it<00:03:21.660> does

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
it does

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.780 
it does
after<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.180> while<00:03:24.330> you<00:03:24.510> just<00:03:24.630> kind<00:03:24.720> of<00:03:24.930> zone<00:03:25.110> out

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
after a while you just kind of zone out

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:34.760 
after a while you just kind of zone out
it's<00:03:26.790> kind<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.030> fun

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.200 

all<00:03:35.190> right<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:35.520> now<00:03:35.610> I'm<00:03:35.730> finished<00:03:36.060> creating

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
all right so now I'm finished creating

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.360 
all right so now I'm finished creating
my<00:03:36.510> region<00:03:37.080> of<00:03:37.170> interest<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.950> now<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.190> would

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
my region of interest and now I would

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.520 
my region of interest and now I would
like<00:03:38.490> to<00:03:38.730> save<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.090> out<00:03:39.300> so<00:03:39.840> make<00:03:40.020> sure<00:03:40.050> first

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
like to save it out so make sure first

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.190 
like to save it out so make sure first
of<00:03:40.680> all<00:03:40.800> that<00:03:41.010> this<00:03:41.220> mask<00:03:41.580> is<00:03:42.060> highlighted<00:03:43.050> and

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
of all that this mask is highlighted and

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.940 
of all that this mask is highlighted and
then<00:03:43.650> click<00:03:43.710> on<00:03:44.040> file<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:44.610> save<00:03:44.880> as<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.950> can

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
then click on file and save as you can

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.140 
then click on file and save as you can
call<00:03:47.190> this<00:03:47.400> a<00:03:47.970> CC<00:03:48.630> mask<00:03:49.850> that's<00:03:50.850> all<00:03:50.940> there<00:03:51.090> is

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
call this a CC mask that's all there is

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.550 
call this a CC mask that's all there is
to<00:03:51.300> it<00:03:51.420> so<00:03:51.570> it's<00:03:51.750> like<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:51.960> created<00:03:52.290> all<00:03:52.440> the

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
to it so it's like you created all the

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.260 
to it so it's like you created all the
other<00:03:52.680> masks<00:03:53.160> so<00:03:53.520> now<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:53.760> have<00:03:54.030> three

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
other masks so now you have three

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.580 
other masks so now you have three
different<00:03:54.300> ways<00:03:54.630> to<00:03:54.690> create<00:03:54.900> regions<00:03:55.470> of

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
different ways to create regions of

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.740 
different ways to create regions of
interest<00:03:55.740> and<00:03:56.280> now<00:03:56.850> you're<00:03:57.030> ready<00:03:57.210> to<00:03:57.270> use

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
interest and now you're ready to use

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.160 
interest and now you're ready to use
feed<00:03:58.050> query<00:03:58.350> to<00:03:58.530> extract<00:03:58.950> that<00:03:59.010> data
