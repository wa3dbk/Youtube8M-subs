right<00:00:35.550> now<00:00:35.670> I'm<00:00:35.880> about<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.210> fifty<00:00:36.780> percent

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
right now I'm about a fifty percent

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.630 
right now I'm about a fifty percent
charge<00:00:37.469> because<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.920> have<00:00:38.040> been<00:00:38.129> charged<00:00:38.520> it

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
charge because I have been charged it

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.639 
charge because I have been charged it
and<00:00:38.820> then<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.899> other<00:00:39.930> cool<00:00:40.260> thing<00:00:40.290> about<00:00:40.500> it

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
and then the other cool thing about it

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.680 
and then the other cool thing about it
is<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:40.950> can<00:00:41.070> switch<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.280> from<00:00:41.489> nine<00:00:41.760> volts<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.420> 12

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
is I can switch it from nine volts to 12

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.279 
is I can switch it from nine volts to 12
volts<00:00:42.809> spending<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.559> what<00:00:43.890> I'm<00:00:43.980> marketing<00:00:44.399> etc

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
volts spending on what I'm marketing etc

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.540 
volts spending on what I'm marketing etc
so<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.379> way<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.530> actually<00:00:46.800> charge<00:00:47.219> up<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
so the way you actually charge up the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.240 
so the way you actually charge up the
battery<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.870> up<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.770> turn<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.070> on

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
battery is you up you can turn this on

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.279 
battery is you up you can turn this on
and<00:00:50.460> put<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.820> into<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:52.730> wall<00:00:53.730> socket<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.539> plug

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
and put it into a wall socket and plug

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.299 
and put it into a wall socket and plug
the<00:00:55.469> cable<00:00:55.890> into<00:00:56.809> the<00:00:57.809> input<00:00:58.020> section<00:00:58.440> in

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
the cable into the input section in

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.920 
the cable into the input section in
order<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.579> charge<00:00:59.760> it<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.300> lights<00:01:00.750> would

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
order to charge it and the lights would

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.959 
order to charge it and the lights would
start<00:01:01.199> once<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.649> have<00:01:01.800> for<00:01:02.219> life<00:01:02.430> showing<00:01:02.730> it

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
start once you have for life showing it

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.750 
start once you have for life showing it
would<00:01:03.120> be<00:01:03.239> no<00:01:03.420> new<00:01:03.719> %<00:01:04.049> battery<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.949> journal

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
would be no new % battery in the journal

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.690 
would be no new % battery in the journal
better<00:01:06.380> so<00:01:07.380> I'm<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:07.770> gonna<00:01:07.950> show<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.460> how<00:01:08.580> it
