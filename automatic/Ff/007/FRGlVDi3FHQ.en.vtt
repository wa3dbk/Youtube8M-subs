right now we have a ton of stuff on the
stage<00:05:29.240> you<00:05:29.780> know<00:05:29.870> one<00:05:29.990> of<00:05:30.050> the<00:05:30.140> challenges

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.170 
stage you know one of the challenges

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.900 
stage you know one of the challenges
with<00:05:30.590> VR<00:05:30.770> in<00:05:30.920> general<00:05:31.220> is<00:05:31.310> just<00:05:31.340> like<00:05:31.610> showing

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
with VR in general is just like showing

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.240 
with VR in general is just like showing
it<00:05:32.060> off<00:05:32.240> on<00:05:33.140> a<00:05:33.200> stage<00:05:33.530> is<00:05:33.710> always<00:05:33.950> so<00:05:34.070> difficult

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
it off on a stage is always so difficult

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.340 
it off on a stage is always so difficult
so<00:05:35.030> I<00:05:35.060> think<00:05:35.150> touching<00:05:35.810> on<00:05:35.930> it<00:05:36.080> and<00:05:36.260> then

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
so I think touching on it and then

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.810 
so I think touching on it and then
having<00:05:36.560> people<00:05:36.890> experience<00:05:37.310> this<00:05:37.400> is<00:05:37.490> really

having people experience this is really

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.180 
having people experience this is really
what<00:05:37.970> the<00:05:38.060> goal<00:05:38.210> is<00:05:38.270> so<00:05:38.510> we<00:05:38.690> have<00:05:38.870> more<00:05:39.230> demo

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.320 
will be talking lots more about it but
to<00:05:52.190> us<00:05:52.310> it's<00:05:52.490> also<00:05:52.640> about<00:05:52.880> getting<00:05:53.090> people

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
to us it's also about getting people

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.810 
to us it's also about getting people
getting<00:05:54.110> their<00:05:54.230> heads<00:05:54.470> in<00:05:54.740> in<00:05:55.130> the<00:05:55.250> set

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
getting their heads in in the set

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
getting their heads in in the set
because<00:05:56.180> that's<00:05:56.540> when<00:05:56.720> you<00:05:56.810> really

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
because that's when you really

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.540 
because that's when you really
understand<00:05:57.530> we<00:05:57.710> are<00:05:57.860> and<00:05:58.040> so<00:05:58.160> that's<00:05:58.370> I<00:05:58.520> think
