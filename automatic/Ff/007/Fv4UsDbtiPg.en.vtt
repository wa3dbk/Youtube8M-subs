sets<00:00:18.560> in<00:00:18.740> 3d<00:00:18.980> coat<00:00:19.220> and<00:00:19.550> in<00:00:20.450> this<00:00:20.660> case<00:00:20.960> we're

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
sets in 3d coat and in this case we're

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.400 
sets in 3d coat and in this case we're
going<00:00:21.680> to<00:00:21.829> look<00:00:22.040> at<00:00:22.310> the<00:00:22.669> new<00:00:22.820> support<00:00:23.270> for

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
going to look at the new support for

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.639 
going to look at the new support for
importing<00:00:24.410> and<00:00:24.439> exporting<00:00:24.800> with<00:00:25.579> UV<00:00:25.880> tiles<00:00:26.390> as

I<00:00:27.649> mentioned<00:00:28.009> in<00:00:28.099> that<00:00:28.189> video<00:00:28.399> 3d<00:00:29.060> coat<00:00:29.239> works

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
I mentioned in that video 3d coat works

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.870 
I mentioned in that video 3d coat works
with<00:00:29.930> just<00:00:30.140> a<00:00:30.259> singular<00:00:30.739> texture<00:00:31.250> space<00:00:31.520> there

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
with just a singular texture space there

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.360 
with just a singular texture space there
are<00:00:31.910> no<00:00:32.060> tiles<00:00:32.930> or<00:00:33.140> patches<00:00:33.649> within<00:00:34.220> the

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
are no tiles or patches within the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.240 
are no tiles or patches within the
application<00:00:34.910> itself<00:00:35.530> but<00:00:36.530> what<00:00:36.800> it<00:00:36.890> will<00:00:37.040> do

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
application itself but what it will do

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.030 
application itself but what it will do
is<00:00:37.400> upon<00:00:37.670> import<00:00:38.150> it<00:00:38.300> will<00:00:38.450> convert<00:00:38.960> tiles<00:00:39.740> or

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
is upon import it will convert tiles or

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.340 
is upon import it will convert tiles or
UV<00:00:40.370> patches<00:00:40.850> to<00:00:41.240> this<00:00:41.360> singular<00:00:41.780> workspace

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
and I had my little icon here for the

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.210 
and I had my little icon here for the
app<00:01:43.070> link<00:01:45.370> and<00:01:46.370> it<00:01:46.490> updated<00:01:46.820> everything<00:01:48.070> so<00:01:49.070> go

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
app link and it updated everything so go

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.460 
app link and it updated everything so go
and<00:01:49.310> close<00:01:49.520> that<00:01:49.870> I'm<00:01:50.870> going<00:01:51.050> to<00:01:51.140> go<00:01:51.230> ahead<00:01:51.290> and

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
and close that I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.510 
and close that I'm going to go ahead and
open<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.860> material<00:01:52.250> editor<00:01:52.580> and<00:01:54.100> you<00:01:55.100> can<00:01:55.280> see

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
open the material editor and you can see

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.210 
open the material editor and you can see
just<00:01:55.850> as<00:01:56.090> with<00:01:56.330> the<00:01:56.470> exporting<00:01:57.470> of<00:01:57.590> just<00:01:57.830> UV

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
just as with the exporting of just UV

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.560 
just as with the exporting of just UV
sets<00:01:58.520> it<00:01:58.820> still<00:01:59.060> gives<00:01:59.180> you<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.300> same

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
sets it still gives you the same

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.200 
sets it still gives you the same
arrangement<00:01:59.840> a<00:02:00.320> single<00:02:01.280> multi/sub-object

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
arrangement a single multi/sub-object

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.610 
arrangement a single multi/sub-object
material<00:02:02.560> okay<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:04.630> let's<00:02:05.630> go<00:02:05.810> ahead<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:06.020> give

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
material okay so let's go ahead and give

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.100 
material okay so let's go ahead and give
this<00:02:06.860> model<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:09.310> UV<00:02:10.310> map<00:02:10.490> modifier<00:02:10.990> I'm<00:02:11.990> going

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
this model the UV map modifier I'm going

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.190 
this model the UV map modifier I'm going
to<00:02:12.200> open<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.590> editor<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:15.680> if<00:02:16.250> i<00:02:16.340> zoom<00:02:16.370> out

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
to open the editor and if i zoom out

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.230 
to open the editor and if i zoom out
actually<00:02:18.200> I'm<00:02:18.290> going<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.670> expand<00:02:19.670> this<00:02:19.730> a<00:02:19.820> bit

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.680 

you<00:02:23.240> know<00:02:23.300> if<00:02:23.390> i<00:02:23.480> zoom<00:02:23.510> out<00:02:23.840> just<00:02:23.900> a<00:02:24.200> bit<00:02:25.690> you

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
you know if i zoom out just a bit you

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.070 
you know if i zoom out just a bit you
can<00:02:26.840> see<00:02:27.080> that<00:02:27.290> it's<00:02:27.410> arranged<00:02:27.950> in<00:02:28.100> tiles<00:02:28.550> now

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
can see that it's arranged in tiles now

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.300 
can see that it's arranged in tiles now
and<00:02:30.080> if<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.320> want<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:31.060> rearrange<00:02:32.060> this<00:02:33.310> you

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
and if you want to rearrange this you

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.340 
and if you want to rearrange this you
can<00:02:34.580> in<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.790> lower<00:02:34.970> left<00:02:35.510> hand<00:02:35.630> corner<00:02:35.810> here

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
can in the lower left hand corner here

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.130 
can in the lower left hand corner here
just<00:02:37.070> designate<00:02:37.670> how<00:02:38.210> you<00:02:38.270> want<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.780> move<00:02:38.930> this

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
just designate how you want to move this

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.140 
just designate how you want to move this
so<00:02:39.290> if<00:02:39.380> I<00:02:39.470> want<00:02:39.710> to<00:02:39.740> move<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.070> two<00:02:40.640> places<00:02:40.910> to

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
so if I want to move this two places to

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.230 
so if I want to move this two places to
the<00:02:41.180> left<00:02:41.300> I<00:02:41.720> need<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:41.960> go<00:02:42.080> negative<00:02:43.070> 2<00:02:43.460> okay

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
the left I need to go negative 2 okay

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.790 
the left I need to go negative 2 okay
you<00:02:44.300> don't<00:02:44.480> have<00:02:44.600> to<00:02:44.690> select<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.230> other

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
you don't have to select the other

00:02:45.800 --> 00:03:02.740 
you don't have to select the other
elements<00:02:46.670> first<00:02:53.020> okay<00:02:56.020> so<00:02:57.020> negative<00:02:57.560> 2<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:02.480> if

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
elements first okay so negative 2 and if

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:12.179 
elements first okay so negative 2 and if
I<00:03:02.900> want<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.170> move<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:03.380> out<00:03:03.500> one

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:12.189 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:18.039 

so<00:03:13.189> there<00:03:13.430> you<00:03:13.459> have<00:03:13.549> it<00:03:14.650> alright<00:03:15.650> so<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.870> what

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
so there you have it alright so and what

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.119 
so there you have it alright so and what
I<00:03:18.079> would<00:03:18.200> need<00:03:18.290> to<00:03:18.409> do<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:18.590> make<00:03:18.829> sure<00:03:18.950> the

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:19.129 
I would need to do to make sure the

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.349 
I would need to do to make sure the
texture<00:03:19.760> Maps<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.150> line<00:03:20.329> up<00:03:20.540> is<00:03:20.719> that<00:03:21.620> same

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
texture Maps the line up is that same

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.410 
texture Maps the line up is that same
material<00:03:23.359> for<00:03:23.950> that<00:03:24.950> map<00:03:25.189> I<00:03:25.549> need<00:03:26.180> to<00:03:26.269> make

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
material for that map I need to make

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.990 
material for that map I need to make
sure<00:03:26.450> that<00:03:27.079> all<00:03:27.859> my<00:03:28.450> texture<00:03:29.450> maps<00:03:29.659> are<00:03:29.989> offset

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
sure that all my texture maps are offset

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000 
sure that all my texture maps are offset
to<00:03:32.000> reflect<00:03:32.480> their<00:03:33.200> locate<00:03:33.680> their<00:03:33.859> new

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
to reflect their locate their new

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.429 
to reflect their locate their new
location<00:03:34.639> so<00:03:35.329> that<00:03:35.480> means<00:03:35.719> just<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.230> same

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:36.439 
location so that means just the same

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:39.309 
location so that means just the same
parameters<00:03:37.189> that<00:03:37.310> I<00:03:37.370> put<00:03:37.609> in<00:03:37.760> and<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.930> editor

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
parameters that I put in and the editor

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.559 
parameters that I put in and the editor
I<00:03:39.530> need<00:03:40.010> to<00:03:40.099> put<00:03:40.250> them<00:03:40.370> all<00:03:40.549> so<00:03:40.790> for<00:03:41.389> the

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
I need to put them all so for the

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.649 
I need to put them all so for the
individual<00:03:42.049> Maps<00:03:42.260> so<00:03:43.040> that<00:03:43.189> would<00:03:43.340> be

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
individual Maps so that would be

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:49.589 
individual Maps so that would be
negative<00:03:44.659> two<00:03:45.109> and<00:03:45.849> one<00:03:46.849> in<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.299> V<00:03:47.480> axis<00:03:47.900> okay

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
negative two and one in the V axis okay

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.610 
negative two and one in the V axis okay
so<00:03:51.069> what<00:03:52.069> I'm<00:03:52.129> going<00:03:52.310> to<00:03:52.340> do<00:03:52.489> is<00:03:53.439> I'm<00:03:54.439> gonna

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.599 
so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna
open<00:03:54.709> my<00:03:55.069> 3d<00:03:55.639> code<00:03:55.790> app<00:03:55.939> link<00:03:56.239> panel<00:03:56.989> here<00:03:57.200> and

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
open my 3d code app link panel here and

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.360 
open my 3d code app link panel here and
now<00:03:58.609> I'm<00:03:58.790> going<00:03:58.969> to<00:03:59.090> send<00:03:59.389> it<00:03:59.480> over<00:04:00.159> per<00:04:01.159> pixel

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
now I'm going to send it over per pixel

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.659 
now I'm going to send it over per pixel
painting<00:04:05.109> in<00:04:06.109> order<00:04:06.620> to<00:04:06.799> demonstrate<00:04:06.950> the

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
painting in order to demonstrate the

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.509 
painting in order to demonstrate the
import<00:04:08.419> so<00:04:09.290> I'm<00:04:09.439> going<00:04:09.680> to<00:04:09.769> treat<00:04:10.099> this<00:04:10.189> as<00:04:10.340> if

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
import so I'm going to treat this as if

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.300 
import so I'm going to treat this as if
it's<00:04:10.669> a<00:04:10.730> new<00:04:10.849> scene<00:04:12.250> I'm<00:04:13.250> going<00:04:13.280> to<00:04:13.459> continue

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
it's a new scene I'm going to continue

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.180 
it's a new scene I'm going to continue
okay<00:04:16.310> so<00:04:16.370> I<00:04:16.849> have<00:04:17.209> my<00:04:17.239> import<00:04:17.840> dialog<00:04:18.500> now<00:04:18.709> and

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
okay so I have my import dialog now and

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.000 
okay so I have my import dialog now and
I<00:04:20.090> want<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:20.359> make<00:04:20.449> sure<00:04:20.599> that<00:04:20.870> I<00:04:20.930> check<00:04:21.289> import

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
I want to make sure that I check import

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:32.680 
I want to make sure that I check import
tiles<00:04:22.460> as<00:04:22.610> UV<00:04:23.479> sets<00:04:25.690> okay<00:04:31.180> okay<00:04:32.180> there<00:04:32.539> we<00:04:32.659> have

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
tiles as UV sets okay okay there we have

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.450 
tiles as UV sets okay okay there we have
it<00:04:33.099> as<00:04:34.099> you<00:04:34.280> can<00:04:34.400> see<00:04:35.139> 3d<00:04:36.139> coat<00:04:36.409> converted<00:04:37.099> the

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
it as you can see 3d coat converted the

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.520 
it as you can see 3d coat converted the
tiles<00:04:39.310> okay<00:04:40.310> into<00:04:40.789> regular<00:04:41.570> UV<00:04:41.840> sets<00:04:42.139> that<00:04:42.320> it

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
tiles okay into regular UV sets that it

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.689 
tiles okay into regular UV sets that it
can<00:04:42.830> work<00:04:43.310> with<00:04:43.490> a<00:04:44.919> UV<00:04:45.919> room<00:04:46.130> you<00:04:46.280> can<00:04:46.430> see<00:04:46.580> what

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699 
can work with a UV room you can see what

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.790 
can work with a UV room you can see what
I'm<00:04:46.789> talking<00:04:47.090> about<00:04:47.150> here<00:04:47.479> for<00:04:48.470> left<00:04:48.620> hand

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
I'm talking about here for left hand

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:56.180 
I'm talking about here for left hand
corner<00:04:50.289> you<00:04:51.289> can<00:04:51.320> cycle<00:04:51.800> between<00:04:51.830> the<00:04:52.220> UV<00:04:52.460> sets

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.020 

okay<00:04:57.890> all<00:04:58.890> right<00:04:59.010> so<00:04:59.220> that<00:04:59.400> should<00:04:59.790> conclude

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
okay all right so that should conclude

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.600 
okay all right so that should conclude
this<00:05:00.810> look<00:05:01.080> at<00:05:01.350> importing<00:05:01.650> exporting<00:05:02.040> UV
