00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
come up with a racket that I lost last

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.850 
come up with a racket that I lost last
year<00:00:07.410> I<00:00:08.090> found<00:00:09.090> but<00:00:09.990> I'm<00:00:10.200> going<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.440> show<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:10.710> a

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
couple of things here yeah in the the

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.530 
couple of things here yeah in the the
players<00:00:13.830> today<00:00:14.099> they<00:00:14.610> use<00:00:14.820> different<00:00:15.059> strings

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
players today they use different strings

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.240 
players today they use different strings
now<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.139> keep<00:00:16.379> hearing<00:00:16.650> about<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.130> want

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
now I keep hearing about this and I want

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.010 
now I keep hearing about this and I want
you<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.490> explain<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:18.029> for<00:00:18.359> example<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.810> use<00:00:18.990> a

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
you to explain it for example I use a

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.800 
you to explain it for example I use a
natural<00:00:19.380> string<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.189> mains<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:21.359> a

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
natural string in the mains and a

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.080 
natural string in the mains and a
synthetic<00:00:22.140> string<00:00:22.769> here<00:00:23.100> okay<00:00:23.519> which<00:00:23.760> gives

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
synthetic string here okay which gives

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.849 
synthetic string here okay which gives
it<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.269> little<00:00:24.420> dead<00:00:24.689> or<00:00:24.840> feel<00:00:25.109> because<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
it a little dead or feel because of the

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.859 
it a little dead or feel because of the
synthetic<00:00:26.220> going<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:26.760> way<00:00:26.939> but<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> lively

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
synthetic going this way but a lively

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.870 
synthetic going this way but a lively
feel<00:00:28.199> because<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.710> natural<00:00:28.859> gut<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.460> also

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
feel because of the natural gut and also

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.359 
feel because of the natural gut and also
better<00:00:30.240> feel<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.740> little<00:00:31.980> volleys<00:00:32.340> and

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
better feel in the little volleys and

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.560 
better feel in the little volleys and
the<00:00:32.550> small<00:00:32.820> shows<00:00:33.000> because<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.390> natural

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
the small shows because of the natural

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.260 
the small shows because of the natural
gut<00:00:34.190> sometimes<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.550> other<00:00:35.579> way<00:00:35.730> around

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
gut sometimes do it the other way around

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.790 
gut sometimes do it the other way around
where<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.480> get<00:00:36.690> more<00:00:36.930> spin<00:00:37.410> because<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
where you get more spin because the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.040 
where you get more spin because the
synthetic<00:00:38.070> strings<00:00:38.610> are<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.940> means<00:00:39.210> and

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
synthetic strings are the means and

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.319 
synthetic strings are the means and
they're<00:00:40.260> stronger<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:40.980> they<00:00:41.250> it's<00:00:42.000> more<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.300> a

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
they're stronger and they it's more of a

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.299 
they're stronger and they it's more of a
trampoline<00:00:42.719> effect<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.680> they<00:00:43.770> put<00:00:43.920> natural

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
trampoline effect and they put natural

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.970 
trampoline effect and they put natural
gut<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:45.090> other<00:00:45.270> way<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.809> have<00:00:46.050> some<00:00:46.350> feel<00:00:46.649> left

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
gut the other way to have some feel left

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.220 
gut the other way to have some feel left
the<00:00:47.460> most<00:00:47.730> players<00:00:48.030> use<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.329> synthetic<00:00:48.629> string

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
the most players use a synthetic string

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.930 
the most players use a synthetic string
all<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.530> way<00:00:49.950> across<00:00:50.250> always<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
all the way across always the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.400 
all the way across always the
combination<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.750> two<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.110> makes<00:00:52.289> a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
combination of the two that makes a

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.990 
combination of the two that makes a
difference<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:52.829> as<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.039> say<00:00:53.280> well<00:00:53.399> maybe<00:00:53.789> not

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
difference so as I say well maybe not

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.150 
difference so as I say well maybe not
just<00:00:54.210> put<00:00:54.329> all<00:00:54.420> guttin<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.020> all<00:00:55.440> synthetic

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
just put all guttin in all synthetic

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160 
just put all guttin in all synthetic
well<00:00:56.460> all<00:00:56.640> God<00:00:56.910> will<00:00:57.090> break<00:00:57.329> very<00:00:57.600> quickly<00:00:57.870> and

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
well all God will break very quickly and

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.750 
well all God will break very quickly and
our<00:00:58.440> synthetic<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:59.070> know<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.250> lot<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.489> players

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
our synthetic I know a lot of players

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.939 
our synthetic I know a lot of players
most<00:01:00.030> players<00:01:00.210> do<00:01:00.510> put<00:01:00.809> they<00:01:01.469> can<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:01.739> get<00:01:01.829> it

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
most players do put they can just get it

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.759 
most players do put they can just get it
restrung<00:01:02.370> well<00:01:02.730> yeah<00:01:03.180> maybe<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.530> lot<00:01:04.680> of

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
restrung well yeah maybe but a lot of

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.289 
restrung well yeah maybe but a lot of
folks<00:01:04.949> put<00:01:05.189> synthetic<00:01:05.729> all<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> way<00:01:06.090> all<00:01:06.270> over

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
folks put synthetic all the way all over

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.090 
folks put synthetic all the way all over
and<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.689> think<00:01:06.900> most<00:01:07.110> players<00:01:07.350> do<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.710> but

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
and I think most players do that but

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.710 
and I think most players do that but
it's<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.369> much<00:01:08.549> dead<00:01:08.880> or<00:01:09.030> feeling<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.570> to

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
it's a much dead or feeling you have to

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.530 
it's a much dead or feeling you have to
be<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.990> hard<00:01:10.470> hitter<00:01:10.860> okay<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.820> make<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.270> but

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
be a hard hitter okay to make that but

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.270 
be a hard hitter okay to make that but
another<00:01:12.750> thing<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.409> my<00:01:13.710> own<00:01:13.860> racket<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
another thing this is my own racket and

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.499 
another thing this is my own racket and
I've<00:01:14.400> built<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.880> myself

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
I've built it myself

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.570 
I've built it myself
basically<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.740> obviously<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.100> wilson

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
basically it's it is obviously a wilson

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.120 
basically it's it is obviously a wilson
as<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.909> see<00:01:18.090> but<00:01:18.509> i<00:01:18.600> put<00:01:18.810> LED<00:01:19.110> tape<00:01:19.380> okay

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
as you can see but i put LED tape okay

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.920 
as you can see but i put LED tape okay
down<00:01:20.460> here<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.909> make<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.270> little<00:01:21.420> heavier<00:01:21.630> in

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
down here to make it a little heavier in

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.320 
down here to make it a little heavier in
the<00:01:22.020> head<00:01:22.229> yeah<00:01:22.590> i'm<00:01:23.310> what's<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.000> do<00:01:24.150> then

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
the head yeah i'm what's like to do then

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.080 
the head yeah i'm what's like to do then
well<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.900> gives<00:01:25.590> her<00:01:25.830> just<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.400> heavier<00:01:26.670> feel<00:01:26.880> at

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
well it gives her just a heavier feel at

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.670 
well it gives her just a heavier feel at
the<00:01:27.210> end<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.509> felt<00:01:27.689> too<00:01:27.960> light<00:01:28.200> for<00:01:28.229> me<00:01:28.530> this

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
the end it felt too light for me this

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.380 
the end it felt too light for me this
racket<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.490> if<00:01:29.610> you're<00:01:29.790> at<00:01:29.880> home<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.329> you

flexibility of the frame but then you

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.650 
flexibility of the frame but then you
