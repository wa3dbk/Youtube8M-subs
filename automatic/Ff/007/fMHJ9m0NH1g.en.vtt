hybrid in-ground pop-up sprayer but it's

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.150 
hybrid in-ground pop-up sprayer but it's
meant<00:00:32.930> to<00:00:33.050> run<00:00:33.260> off<00:00:33.440> regular<00:00:35.020> garden<00:00:36.020> hose<00:00:36.230> my

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
meant to run off regular garden hose my

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.190 
meant to run off regular garden hose my
plan<00:00:37.430> is<00:00:37.460> to<00:00:37.640> actually<00:00:37.820> just<00:00:38.150> bury<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.780> garden

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
plan is to actually just bury the garden

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.750 
plan is to actually just bury the garden
hose<00:00:39.380> I'll<00:00:40.010> show<00:00:40.220> this<00:00:40.340> in<00:00:40.460> better<00:00:40.610> detail

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
hose I'll show this in better detail

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.520 
hose I'll show this in better detail
right<00:00:41.060> now<00:00:41.120> it's<00:00:41.329> just<00:00:41.390> my<00:00:41.570> backyard<00:00:42.140> wedge

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
right now it's just my backyard wedge

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.860 
right now it's just my backyard wedge
between<00:00:42.710> some<00:00:43.100> bricks<00:00:43.370> it's<00:00:43.550> some<00:00:43.880> debris

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
between some bricks it's some debris

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.440 
between some bricks it's some debris
that<00:00:45.290> I<00:00:45.350> removed<00:00:45.830> from<00:00:46.610> another<00:00:46.850> project<00:00:47.120> I'm

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
that I removed from another project I'm

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:54.100 
that I removed from another project I'm
working<00:00:47.480> on<00:00:51.400> so<00:00:52.400> obviously<00:00:53.030> the<00:00:53.300> idea<00:00:53.570> is<00:00:53.810> at

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
working on so obviously the idea is at

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.410 
working on so obviously the idea is at
set<00:00:54.410> intervals<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:55.310> timer<00:00:55.580> turns<00:00:55.940> on<00:00:56.180> what

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
set intervals the timer turns on what

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.350 
set intervals the timer turns on what
you're<00:00:56.510> going<00:00:56.630> to<00:00:56.690> do<00:00:56.780> manually<00:01:01.240> takes<00:01:02.240> a

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
you're going to do manually takes a

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.399 
you're going to do manually takes a
moment<00:01:02.450> to<00:01:02.630> come<00:01:02.780> out<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:03.440> it's<00:01:03.890> hard<00:01:04.070> to<00:01:04.309> tell

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
moment to come out and it's hard to tell

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.810 
moment to come out and it's hard to tell
from<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:06.560> camera<00:01:06.920> but<00:01:07.100> it<00:01:07.189> actually<00:01:07.340> gets<00:01:07.640> a

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
from the camera but it actually gets a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.120 
from the camera but it actually gets a
good<00:01:08.000> spread<00:01:08.960> it<00:01:09.290> looks<00:01:09.470> like<00:01:09.619> it's<00:01:09.799> just<00:01:09.860> one

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
good spread it looks like it's just one

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.899 
good spread it looks like it's just one
line<00:01:10.369> spraying<00:01:10.820> way<00:01:11.000> up<00:01:11.680> but<00:01:12.680> actually<00:01:12.860> it's

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.000 

all<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.300> way<00:01:17.330> from<00:01:17.450> here<00:01:17.840> up<00:01:17.900> and<00:01:18.320> that's

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
all the way from here up and that's

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.730 
all the way from here up and that's
adjustable<00:01:19.520> to<00:01:19.850> this<00:01:20.659> thing<00:01:20.840> can<00:01:21.020> turn<00:01:21.230> full

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
adjustable to this thing can turn full

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.060 
adjustable to this thing can turn full
360<00:01:22.400> so<00:01:22.550> you<00:01:22.640> could<00:01:22.760> put<00:01:22.880> it<00:01:22.970> in<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.120> center

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
360 so you could put it in the center

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:32.170 
360 so you could put it in the center
yeah<00:01:26.530> and<00:01:27.530> obviously<00:01:28.159> this<00:01:28.430> is<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:31.180> like

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
yeah and obviously this is the like

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.850 
yeah and obviously this is the like
where<00:01:32.360> you'd<00:01:32.510> bury<00:01:32.750> it<00:01:32.930> too<00:01:33.080> so<00:01:33.440> to<00:01:33.500> stay

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
where you'd bury it too so to stay

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.370 
where you'd bury it too so to stay
hidden<00:01:34.340> which<00:01:34.760> is<00:01:34.909> the<00:01:35.030> pointers<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.690> second

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
hidden which is the pointers the second

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.800 
hidden which is the pointers the second
part<00:01:36.680> of<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:37.070> project<00:01:37.280> try<00:01:38.120> and<00:01:38.270> make<00:01:38.390> sense

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
part of the project try and make sense

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.530 
part of the project try and make sense
of<00:01:38.990> this<00:01:39.170> these<00:01:39.950> are<00:01:40.159> the<00:01:40.340> pop-up<00:01:41.150> sprayers

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
of this these are the pop-up sprayers

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.980 
of this these are the pop-up sprayers
for<00:01:41.870> the<00:01:41.930> garden<00:01:42.350> so<00:01:43.120> this<00:01:44.120> guy<00:01:44.659> right<00:01:44.930> here

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
for the garden so this guy right here

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.899 
for the garden so this guy right here
was<00:01:47.530> think<00:01:48.530> they're<00:01:48.799> nine<00:01:48.979> bucks<00:01:49.280> apiece<00:01:49.460> I

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
was think they're nine bucks apiece I

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.940 
was think they're nine bucks apiece I
don't<00:01:50.840> know<00:01:50.930> why<00:01:50.990> I'm<00:01:51.049> having<00:01:51.290> such<00:01:51.470> a<00:01:51.500> trouble

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
don't know why I'm having such a trouble

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.740 
don't know why I'm having such a trouble
focusing<00:01:52.430> anyway<00:01:53.119> when<00:01:53.299> water<00:01:53.479> goes<00:01:53.690> through

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
focusing anyway when water goes through

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.039 
focusing anyway when water goes through
this<00:01:54.440> pops<00:01:54.770> up<00:01:55.040> start<00:01:55.850> spraying<00:01:56.180> I<00:01:56.510> mean

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
this pops up start spraying I mean

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.980 
this pops up start spraying I mean
obviously<00:01:57.170> show<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:57.770> final<00:01:58.729> version<00:01:58.990> but

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
obviously show the final version but

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.440 
obviously show the final version but
it's<00:02:00.140> pretty<00:02:00.320> simple<00:02:00.560> to<00:02:00.710> hook<00:02:00.830> up<00:02:01.010> so<00:02:01.450> nine

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
it's pretty simple to hook up so nine

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.980 
it's pretty simple to hook up so nine
dollars<00:02:03.670> 12<00:02:04.670> bucks<00:02:04.940> for<00:02:05.150> 50<00:02:05.450> foot<00:02:05.659> of<00:02:05.780> this

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
dollars 12 bucks for 50 foot of this

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.639 
dollars 12 bucks for 50 foot of this
tubing<00:02:07.239> then<00:02:08.239> it<00:02:08.360> goes<00:02:08.509> for<00:02:08.689> this<00:02:08.810> half<00:02:09.379> inch

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
tubing then it goes for this half inch

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.520 
tubing then it goes for this half inch
tubing<00:02:10.069> which<00:02:11.060> is<00:02:11.180> kind<00:02:11.420> of<00:02:11.510> like<00:02:11.629> sort<00:02:12.349> of<00:02:12.409> a

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
tubing which is kind of like sort of a

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.090 
tubing which is kind of like sort of a
rigid<00:02:12.769> plastic

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
rigid plastic

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.550 
rigid plastic
and<00:02:16.100> you<00:02:16.970> have<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.120> compression<00:02:17.720> fitted<00:02:18.020> end<00:02:18.260> I

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
and you have a compression fitted end I

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.650 
and you have a compression fitted end I
think<00:02:18.770> this<00:02:18.860> was<00:02:19.070> two<00:02:19.700> dollars<00:02:19.970> fifty<00:02:20.270> cents

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
think this was two dollars fifty cents

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.020 
think this was two dollars fifty cents
it<00:02:21.140> unscrews<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:21.860> you<00:02:22.250> can<00:02:22.400> add<00:02:22.490> extensions

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
it unscrews and you can add extensions

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.880 
it unscrews and you can add extensions
to<00:02:23.210> it<00:02:23.300> in<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.420> future<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:24.140> then<00:02:24.590> there's<00:02:24.800> a

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
to it in the future and then there's a

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.720 
to it in the future and then there's a
compression<00:02:25.880> fit<00:02:26.450> on<00:02:26.660> this<00:02:27.080> side<00:02:27.350> which<00:02:28.280> is<00:02:28.310> to

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
compression fit on this side which is to

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.450 
compression fit on this side which is to
plug<00:02:29.480> into<00:02:29.720> a<00:02:30.380> faucet<00:02:31.070> /<00:02:31.430> garden<00:02:31.880> hose<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:33.460> this

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
plug into a faucet / garden hose so this

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.030 
plug into a faucet / garden hose so this
line<00:02:35.330> actually<00:02:35.900> gets<00:02:36.050> buried<00:02:36.350> underground

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
line actually gets buried underground

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.520 
line actually gets buried underground
and<00:02:37.700> I'll<00:02:38.210> have<00:02:38.390> this<00:02:38.480> meet<00:02:38.690> up<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.960> a<00:02:38.990> tee<00:02:39.290> and

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
and I'll have this meet up to a tee and

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.950 
and I'll have this meet up to a tee and
the<00:02:39.620> other<00:02:39.740> side<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.100> T<00:02:40.310> goes<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.960> the

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
the other side of the T goes to the

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.820 
the other side of the T goes to the
sprinkler<00:02:42.350> for<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.590> lawn<00:02:42.770> and<00:02:44.290> these<00:02:45.290> get

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
sprinkler for the lawn and these get

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.410 
sprinkler for the lawn and these get
buried<00:02:46.190> I<00:02:46.370> mean<00:02:46.730> they're<00:02:46.850> pretty<00:02:46.940> long<00:02:47.240> they

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
buried I mean they're pretty long they

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.510 
buried I mean they're pretty long they
very<00:02:47.660> pretty<00:02:47.930> deep<00:02:48.140> I'm<00:02:48.830> going<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.070> have<00:02:49.190> three

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
very pretty deep I'm going to have three

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.920 
very pretty deep I'm going to have three
of<00:02:49.640> these<00:02:49.760> in<00:02:49.820> a<00:02:50.060> row<00:02:50.300> so<00:02:50.600> when<00:02:50.690> this<00:02:50.780> is

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
of these in a row so when this is

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.610 
of these in a row so when this is
unraveled<00:02:52.150> there<00:02:53.150> will<00:02:53.240> be<00:02:53.270> the<00:02:54.080> three<00:02:54.440> feet

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
unraveled there will be the three feet

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.790 
unraveled there will be the three feet
of<00:02:54.740> parts<00:02:55.070> a<00:02:55.250> nine<00:02:55.430> foot<00:02:55.550> length<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.800> these

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
of parts a nine foot length and these

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.850 
of parts a nine foot length and these
connect<00:02:58.160> pretty<00:02:58.370> easily<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:59.810> just<00:03:00.080> slides

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
connect pretty easily it just slides

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.490 
connect pretty easily it just slides
onto<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.280> air<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:02.920> then<00:03:03.920> for<00:03:04.310> this<00:03:04.490> side<00:03:04.820> you

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
onto the air and then for this side you

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.250 
onto the air and then for this side you
have<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:06.620> buy<00:03:06.800> a<00:03:06.830> punch<00:03:07.460> set<00:03:08.270> a<00:03:08.330> dollar<00:03:08.810> eighty

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
have to buy a punch set a dollar eighty

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.010 
have to buy a punch set a dollar eighty
and<00:03:09.650> it<00:03:10.070> punches<00:03:10.370> a<00:03:10.430> hole<00:03:10.520> in<00:03:10.880> here<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.390> do<00:03:11.870> the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
and it punches a hole in here to do the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.840 
and it punches a hole in here to do the
connection<00:03:12.500> ok<00:03:12.950> I<00:03:12.980> just<00:03:13.070> did<00:03:13.370> a<00:03:13.400> quick<00:03:13.520> mock-up

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
connection ok I just did a quick mock-up

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.630 
connection ok I just did a quick mock-up
I<00:03:14.270> just<00:03:14.870> stuck<00:03:15.080> this<00:03:15.260> between<00:03:15.500> some<00:03:15.800> rocks<00:03:16.010> and

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
I just stuck this between some rocks and

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.760 
I just stuck this between some rocks and
I<00:03:16.700> got<00:03:16.820> this<00:03:16.970> all<00:03:17.150> hooked<00:03:17.390> up<00:03:17.510> here<00:03:17.840> one<00:03:18.620> thing

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
I got this all hooked up here one thing

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.020 
I got this all hooked up here one thing
I<00:03:18.860> want<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.070> point<00:03:19.130> out<00:03:19.370> is<00:03:19.430> for<00:03:19.670> these<00:03:19.760> little

I want to point out is for these little

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.150 
I want to point out is for these little
garden<00:03:20.750> sprayers<00:03:21.080> you<00:03:21.350> need<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.590> buy<00:03:21.800> a

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
garden sprayers you need to buy a

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.730 
garden sprayers you need to buy a
pressure<00:03:22.670> regulator<00:03:23.080> this<00:03:24.080> is<00:03:24.170> like<00:03:24.350> six<00:03:24.650> or

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
pressure regulator this is like six or

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.340 
pressure regulator this is like six or
eight<00:03:24.890> bucks<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:25.459> it<00:03:25.550> just<00:03:25.790> makes<00:03:26.000> sure<00:03:26.090> that

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
eight bucks and it just makes sure that

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.230 
eight bucks and it just makes sure that
you're<00:03:27.350> not<00:03:27.670> applying<00:03:28.670> too<00:03:29.060> much<00:03:29.090> pressure

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
you're not applying too much pressure

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.570 
you're not applying too much pressure
which<00:03:29.900> could<00:03:30.110> end<00:03:30.170> up<00:03:30.320> breaking<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:31.280> smaller

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
which could end up breaking the smaller

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.370 
which could end up breaking the smaller
components<00:03:32.709> and<00:03:33.709> you<00:03:34.250> could<00:03:34.400> imagine<00:03:35.380> this

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
components and you could imagine this

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.080 
components and you could imagine this
will<00:03:36.620> be<00:03:36.800> flush<00:03:37.340> with<00:03:37.370> soil<00:03:38.380> right<00:03:39.380> about<00:03:39.620> here

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
will be flush with soil right about here

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.310 
will be flush with soil right about here
alright<00:03:41.090> so<00:03:41.270> I'm<00:03:41.330> going<00:03:41.450> to<00:03:41.540> turn<00:03:41.660> it<00:03:41.810> on<00:03:41.900> see

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
alright so I'm going to turn it on see

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.960 
alright so I'm going to turn it on see
if<00:03:42.350> it<00:03:42.590> does<00:03:42.770> anything

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.730 

okay<00:03:48.970> cool<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:50.440> this<00:03:50.710> actually<00:03:52.320> goes<00:03:53.320> up<00:03:53.530> quite

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
okay cool so this actually goes up quite

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.470 
okay cool so this actually goes up quite
a<00:03:53.770> bit

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.860 

and<00:03:59.870> this<00:04:00.290> is<00:04:00.440> your<00:04:01.540> it's<00:04:02.540> misting

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.990 

quite<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.590> bit<00:04:07.769> out<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.610> I'm<00:04:08.700> not<00:04:08.849> actually

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
quite a bit out and I'm not actually

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.160 
quite a bit out and I'm not actually
going<00:04:09.299> to<00:04:09.390> want<00:04:09.569> it<00:04:09.599> to<00:04:09.750> go<00:04:09.840> out<00:04:09.959> that<00:04:10.140> far

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
going to want it to go out that far

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.770 
going to want it to go out that far
that's<00:04:10.590> why<00:04:10.769> I<00:04:11.099> chose<00:04:11.790> this<00:04:11.849> valve<00:04:12.299> so<00:04:12.540> i<00:04:12.569> can

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
that's why I chose this valve so i can

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:20.180 
that's why I chose this valve so i can
adjust<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.230> flow<00:04:13.470> to<00:04:13.530> it<00:04:16.519> all<00:04:17.519> right

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.860 

and<00:04:20.459> I<00:04:20.940> don't<00:04:21.090> think<00:04:21.180> I've<00:04:21.330> got<00:04:21.480> screwed<00:04:21.780> on

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
and I don't think I've got screwed on

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.480 
and I don't think I've got screwed on
all<00:04:22.080> the<00:04:22.170> way<00:04:22.290> so<00:04:22.350> let<00:04:22.650> me<00:04:22.740> mess<00:04:23.070> around<00:04:23.220> i

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
all the way so let me mess around i

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.830 
all the way so let me mess around i
didn't<00:04:23.730> have<00:04:23.850> that<00:04:24.000> screw<00:04:24.330> then<00:04:24.480> all<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.750> way

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
didn't have that screw then all the way

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:43.119 
didn't have that screw then all the way
so<00:04:25.170> this<00:04:25.290> is<00:04:25.320> better<00:04:25.590> let's<00:04:26.040> try<00:04:26.400> this<00:04:26.520> out

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:43.129 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:47.640 

alright<00:04:43.969> pretty<00:04:44.300> cool

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.230 

and<00:04:48.190> there's<00:04:48.340> different<00:04:48.699> ends<00:04:48.880> you<00:04:48.940> can<00:04:49.090> buy

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
and there's different ends you can buy

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.700 
and there's different ends you can buy
here<00:04:49.690> or<00:04:49.840> actually<00:04:50.169> comes<00:04:50.560> at<00:04:50.680> three

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
here or actually comes at three

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.400 
here or actually comes at three
different<00:04:50.919> ends<00:04:51.280> quarter<00:04:52.180> half<00:04:52.630> and<00:04:52.990> full

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
different ends quarter half and full

different ends quarter half and full
circle<00:04:56.490> alright<00:04:57.490> can't<00:04:57.850> wait<00:04:57.970> to<00:04:58.060> install<00:04:58.360> it
