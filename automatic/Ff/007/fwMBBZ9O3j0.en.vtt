all<00:00:00.450> right<00:00:00.719> it<00:00:00.870> stays<00:00:01.170> six<00:00:01.560> of<00:00:01.770> this<00:00:01.920> garlic

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
all right it stays six of this garlic

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.940 
all right it stays six of this garlic
germination<00:00:02.760> experiment<00:00:03.480> it's<00:00:03.959> nighttime<00:00:04.259> so

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
germination experiment it's nighttime so

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.190 
germination experiment it's nighttime so
I'm<00:00:05.040> using<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.400> flashlight<00:00:05.670> kind<00:00:06.660> of<00:00:06.779> gives<00:00:07.109> you

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
I'm using a flashlight kind of gives you

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.830 
I'm using a flashlight kind of gives you
a<00:00:07.290> creepy<00:00:07.680> feeling<00:00:07.919> no<00:00:08.760> not<00:00:09.000> really<00:00:09.179> but

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
a creepy feeling no not really but

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.070 
a creepy feeling no not really but
anyway<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.590> development<00:00:11.340> has<00:00:11.580> been<00:00:11.940> not<00:00:12.870> to

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
anyway the development has been not to

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.530 
anyway the development has been not to
fast<00:00:13.349> but<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:14.309> pleasant<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:15.179> know<00:00:15.299> it's<00:00:15.480> only

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
fast but a pleasant you know it's only

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.640 
fast but a pleasant you know it's only
been<00:00:15.780> one<00:00:16.020> day<00:00:16.049> since<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.770> saw<00:00:17.160> some<00:00:17.550> new<00:00:17.910> shoots

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
been one day since I saw some new shoots

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.740 
been one day since I saw some new shoots
so<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.980> way<00:00:20.130> germination<00:00:20.609> seems<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.270> work<00:00:21.449> is

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
so the way germination seems to work is

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.870 
so the way germination seems to work is
you<00:00:21.779> have<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:22.529> first<00:00:23.010> leaf<00:00:23.279> coming<00:00:23.730> out

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
you have this first leaf coming out

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.080 
you have this first leaf coming out
pushes<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.689> soil<00:00:24.960> aside<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:26.039> it's<00:00:26.699> sort<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:26.970> a

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
pushes the soil aside and it's sort of a

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.500 
pushes the soil aside and it's sort of a
fat<00:00:27.390> fleshy<00:00:28.170> sheath<00:00:28.859> for<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.400> second<00:00:29.939> leaf<00:00:30.119> and

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
fat fleshy sheath for a second leaf and

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.120 
fat fleshy sheath for a second leaf and
all<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.810> other<00:00:30.960> subsequent<00:00:31.470> leaves<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:32.070> are

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
all the other subsequent leaves that are

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.220 
all the other subsequent leaves that are
green<00:00:32.520> or<00:00:32.669> thinner<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.300> come<00:00:33.510> out<00:00:33.690> from<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
green or thinner to come out from the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.670 
green or thinner to come out from the
inside<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:35.660> like<00:00:36.660> with<00:00:36.989> some<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.469> these<00:00:37.620> other

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
inside and like with some of these other

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.760 
inside and like with some of these other
bulb<00:00:38.100> plants<00:00:38.780> they<00:00:39.780> don't<00:00:40.079> have<00:00:40.320> visible

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
bulb plants they don't have visible

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.799 
bulb plants they don't have visible
cotyledons<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:41.820> what<00:00:42.149> you're<00:00:42.300> seeing<00:00:42.510> here<00:00:42.600> is

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
cotyledons so what you're seeing here is

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.380 
cotyledons so what you're seeing here is
already<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.290> first<00:00:43.440> leaf<00:00:43.850> the<00:00:44.850> beginning<00:00:45.300> is

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
already the first leaf the beginning is

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.510 
already the first leaf the beginning is
largely<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.960> waiting<00:00:46.379> game<00:00:46.410> because<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.010> don't

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
largely a waiting game because I don't

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.700 
largely a waiting game because I don't
really<00:00:47.700> need<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.059> water<00:00:48.239> all<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.629> deep<00:00:48.870> maybe

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
really need to water all that deep maybe

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.160 
really need to water all that deep maybe
just<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.129> top<00:00:50.489> inch<00:00:50.760> or<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.570> root<00:00:51.750> systems

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
just the top inch or so the root systems

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.200 
just the top inch or so the root systems
are<00:00:52.320> all<00:00:52.379> very<00:00:52.590> shallow<00:00:52.890> all<00:00:53.610> right<00:00:53.760> it's<00:00:53.969> a

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
are all very shallow all right it's a

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.080 
are all very shallow all right it's a
seven<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.870> we've<00:00:55.079> got<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.590> lot<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.920> sprouts<00:00:56.340> and

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
seven and we've got a lot of sprouts and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.880 
seven and we've got a lot of sprouts and
I<00:00:57.180> think<00:00:57.420> there's<00:00:57.629> any<00:00:57.719> activity<00:00:58.320> from<00:00:58.350> that

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
I think there's any activity from that

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
I think there's any activity from that
you<00:00:59.730> know<00:00:59.850> bulb<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.449> middle<00:01:00.750> but<00:01:01.910> thank

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
you know bulb in the middle but thank

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.899 
you know bulb in the middle but thank
you<00:01:03.030> I'll<00:01:03.329> be<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.780> side<00:01:04.140> too<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.909> growth

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
you I'll be on that side too the growth

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.760 
you I'll be on that side too the growth
here<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.330> definitely<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.930> lot<00:01:07.110> faster<00:01:07.560> than

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
here is definitely a lot faster than

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.160 
here is definitely a lot faster than
ginger<00:01:08.189> that's<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:08.700> sure<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.750> first<00:01:09.930> leaf

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
ginger that's for sure so the first leaf

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.050 
ginger that's for sure so the first leaf
has<00:01:10.380> elongated<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.280> still<00:01:11.610> serving<00:01:11.939> as<00:01:12.030> a

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
has elongated and still serving as a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.149 
has elongated and still serving as a
sheath<00:01:12.390> for<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.780> second<00:01:13.140> leaf<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.590> both<00:01:13.979> are

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
sheath for the second leaf and both are

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.340 
sheath for the second leaf and both are
very<00:01:14.310> green<00:01:14.549> these<00:01:15.299> have<00:01:15.570> some<00:01:15.869> more<00:01:16.110> good

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
very green these have some more good

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.120 
very green these have some more good
examples<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.070> what's<00:01:17.280> going<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:19.040> here's<00:01:20.040> a

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
examples of what's going on here's a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.219 
examples of what's going on here's a
fresh<00:01:20.759> chute<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.990> go<00:01:22.770> over<00:01:22.979> here<00:01:23.930> and<00:01:24.930> it's

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
fresh chute and go over here and it's

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.530 
fresh chute and go over here and it's
kind<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> same<00:01:25.920> way<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.610> know<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.119> first

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
kind of the same way you know the first

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.270 
kind of the same way you know the first
one<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.840> come<00:01:27.990> out<00:01:28.080> isn't<00:01:28.439> all<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.740> green<00:01:29.009> I

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
one to come out isn't all that green I

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.520 
one to come out isn't all that green I
planted<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:30.000> lot<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.210> these<00:01:30.360> cloves<00:01:30.780> very<00:01:31.229> close

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
planted a lot of these cloves very close

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.999 
planted a lot of these cloves very close
to<00:01:31.680> each<00:01:31.770> other<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.909> expected<00:01:34.009> okay

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
to each other so this is expected okay

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.340 
to each other so this is expected okay
it's<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.670> end<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.360> garlic<00:01:36.900> germination

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
it's the end of this garlic germination

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.010 
it's the end of this garlic germination
experiment<00:01:38.100> as<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.150> can<00:01:39.270> see<00:01:39.509> there<00:01:39.869> are<00:01:39.990> a

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
experiment as you can see there are a

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.100 
experiment as you can see there are a
lot<00:01:40.229> more<00:01:40.259> sprouts<00:01:40.860> they<00:01:41.790> grow<00:01:42.030> up<00:01:42.060> about<00:01:42.689> 2<00:01:42.990> to

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
lot more sprouts they grow up about 2 to

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.770 
lot more sprouts they grow up about 2 to
3<00:01:43.290> centimeters<00:01:43.590> per<00:01:44.040> day<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.220> would<00:01:44.490> say<00:01:44.780> all

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
3 centimeters per day I would say all

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.899 
3 centimeters per day I would say all
right<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.259> day<00:01:46.560> 11<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.130> I'm<00:01:47.460> gonna<00:01:47.579> make<00:01:47.880> a

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
right it's day 11 and I'm gonna make a

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.080 
right it's day 11 and I'm gonna make a
hydrogen<00:01:48.720> peroxide<00:01:49.229> solution<00:01:49.409> that's<00:01:50.090> 0.6%

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
hydrogen peroxide solution that's 0.6%

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.260 
hydrogen peroxide solution that's 0.6%
so<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:52.020> five-fold<00:01:52.470> illusion<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.610> 3%

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
so it's a five-fold illusion of a 3%

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.350 
so it's a five-fold illusion of a 3%

I<00:02:48.390> would<00:02:48.750> estimated<00:02:49.260> about<00:02:49.350> twelve<00:02:49.920> to

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
I would estimated about twelve to

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.580 
I would estimated about twelve to
thirteen<00:02:50.610> centimeters<00:02:51.030> for<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.930> longest

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
thirteen centimeters for the longest

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.680 
thirteen centimeters for the longest
ones<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:55.140> middle<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.830> barren<00:02:56.549> I<00:02:56.760> planted

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
ones and the middle is barren I planted

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.470 
ones and the middle is barren I planted
a<00:02:57.780> whole<00:02:57.989> bulb<00:02:58.290> there<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:59.340> think<00:02:59.480> the

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
a whole bulb there and I think the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.570 
a whole bulb there and I think the
shoots<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.500> roots<00:03:01.709> are<00:03:01.920> having<00:03:02.250> trouble

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
shoots and the roots are having trouble

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.520 
shoots and the roots are having trouble
pushing<00:03:02.760> through<00:03:03.209> all<00:03:03.450> of<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:03.810> dead<00:03:04.260> mass

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
pushing through all of that dead mass

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.710 
pushing through all of that dead mass
you<00:03:04.920> know<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.190> wrapping<00:03:05.640> essentially<00:03:06.239> and

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
you know the wrapping essentially and

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.199 
you know the wrapping essentially and
over<00:03:07.470> here<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:07.769> see<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.040> crescent<00:03:08.549> shaped

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
over here you see a crescent shaped

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.289 
over here you see a crescent shaped
shadow<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.340> on<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.459> other<00:03:11.549> side<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:12.060> see

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
shadow and on the other side you see

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.690 
shadow and on the other side you see
tall<00:03:12.959> shoots<00:03:13.349> and<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.680> lot<00:03:13.830> more<00:03:14.040> of<00:03:14.160> them<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:14.670> I

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
tall shoots and a lot more of them so I

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.720 
tall shoots and a lot more of them so I
think<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.690> sunlight<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.829> heat<00:03:17.100> probably

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
think the sunlight and the heat probably

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.890 
think the sunlight and the heat probably
has<00:03:18.329> affected<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.140> germination<00:03:19.590> rates<00:03:20.900> here

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
has affected the germination rates here

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.690 
has affected the germination rates here
is<00:03:21.989> what's<00:03:22.200> going<00:03:22.380> on<00:03:22.590> now<00:03:22.829> you<00:03:23.459> have<00:03:23.579> our

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
is what's going on now you have our

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.880 
is what's going on now you have our

that<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.540> made<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.739> I'm<00:04:01.889> just<00:04:02.069> gonna<00:04:02.190> do<00:04:02.430> some

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
that I made and I'm just gonna do some

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.290 
that I made and I'm just gonna do some
casual<00:04:03.480> spring<00:04:03.980> know

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.360 

just<00:04:10.300> a<00:04:10.420> wet<00:04:10.599> top<00:04:10.930> of<00:04:11.080> the<00:04:11.140> soil<00:04:11.380> you<00:04:11.770> really

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
just a wet top of the soil you really

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.830 
just a wet top of the soil you really
don't<00:04:12.580> need<00:04:12.730> all<00:04:12.790> that<00:04:12.970> much<00:04:13.300> water<00:04:13.510> at<00:04:13.750> this

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
don't need all that much water at this

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.800 
don't need all that much water at this
point<00:04:14.200> but<00:04:14.980> another<00:04:15.430> point<00:04:15.790> that<00:04:15.970> helps<00:04:16.540> is

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
point but another point that helps is

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.680 
point but another point that helps is
the<00:04:17.709> hydrogen<00:04:18.130> peroxide<00:04:18.280> will<00:04:19.000> help<00:04:19.419> break

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
the hydrogen peroxide will help break

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.350 
the hydrogen peroxide will help break
down<00:04:19.959> this<00:04:20.560> bulb<00:04:20.980> in<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.280> center<00:04:21.639> you<00:04:22.210> know

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
down this bulb in the center you know

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.670 
down this bulb in the center you know
the<00:04:22.510> sheets<00:04:22.750> surrounding<00:04:23.260> all<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.470> little

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
the sheets surrounding all the little

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.480 
the sheets surrounding all the little
cloves<00:04:23.950> and<00:04:25.650> you<00:04:26.650> know<00:04:26.770> prevent<00:04:27.160> any<00:04:27.280> kind<00:04:27.460> of

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
cloves and you know prevent any kind of

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.760 
cloves and you know prevent any kind of
rock<00:04:27.730> from<00:04:27.970> going<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:28.330> I'll<00:04:28.450> also<00:04:28.770> oxygenate

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
rock from going and I'll also oxygenate

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.950 
rock from going and I'll also oxygenate
the<00:04:29.800> roots<00:04:31.320> and<00:04:32.320> what<00:04:32.919> that<00:04:33.070> does<00:04:33.280> is<00:04:33.810> you<00:04:34.810> know

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
the roots and what that does is you know

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.870 
the roots and what that does is you know
it<00:04:35.050> provides<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.800> roots<00:04:36.100> with<00:04:36.280> oxygen<00:04:36.730> to

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
it provides the roots with oxygen to

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.969 
it provides the roots with oxygen to
breathe<00:04:37.060> and<00:04:37.450> it<00:04:37.600> also<00:04:37.750> oh<00:04:40.200> you<00:04:41.200> know<00:04:41.350> disrupt

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
breathe and it also oh you know disrupt

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.120 
breathe and it also oh you know disrupt
any<00:04:42.220> kind<00:04:42.520> of<00:04:42.610> anaerobic<00:04:43.110> microbes<00:04:44.110> on<00:04:44.950> in

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
any kind of anaerobic microbes on in

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.450 
any kind of anaerobic microbes on in
there

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
there

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.460 
there
you<00:04:46.030> know<00:04:46.150> bacterial<00:04:46.750> species<00:04:47.020> for<00:04:47.440> example

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
you know bacterial species for example

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.700 
you know bacterial species for example
that<00:04:48.130> need<00:04:48.880> an<00:04:49.090> oxygen<00:04:49.450> less<00:04:49.960> environment<00:04:50.620> to

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
that need an oxygen less environment to

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.430 
that need an oxygen less environment to
grow<00:04:50.800> will<00:04:51.040> be<00:04:51.130> disturbed<00:04:51.580> by<00:04:51.700> this<00:04:51.760> then<00:04:52.440> you

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
grow will be disturbed by this then you

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.810 
grow will be disturbed by this then you
know<00:04:53.530> they<00:04:53.710> won't<00:04:53.860> be<00:04:53.979> able<00:04:54.160> to<00:04:54.220> go<00:04:54.370> they'll

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
know they won't be able to go they'll

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.490 
know they won't be able to go they'll
even<00:04:55.000> die<00:04:55.270> in<00:04:55.570> the<00:04:55.750> president's<00:04:56.200> have<00:04:56.290> a<00:04:56.350> lot

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
even die in the president's have a lot

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.060 
even die in the president's have a lot
of<00:04:56.590> oxygen<00:04:58.320> so<00:04:59.320> you<00:04:59.470> can<00:04:59.590> probably<00:04:59.770> hear<00:05:00.010> some

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
of oxygen so you can probably hear some

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.840 
of oxygen so you can probably hear some
fizzing<00:05:00.700> and<00:05:02.130> that's<00:05:03.130> all<00:05:03.340> the<00:05:03.460> hydrogen

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
fizzing and that's all the hydrogen

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.000 
fizzing and that's all the hydrogen
peroxide
