and therefore we understand the

collar and around her neck area just to

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.340 
collar and around her neck area just to
secure<00:01:33.450> her<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.720> make<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.930> feel<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> bit<00:01:34.110> more

secure her and make it feel a bit more
safe<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.829> we<00:01:35.220> did<00:01:35.369> microchip<00:01:35.850> her<00:01:35.970> earlier<00:01:36.329> so

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
safe and we did microchip her earlier so

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.149 
safe and we did microchip her earlier so
this<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.200> demonstration<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.860> what<00:01:38.040> we

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
this is just a demonstration of what we

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.219 
this is just a demonstration of what we
did<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.579> will<00:01:39.119> lift<00:01:39.360> up<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> scruff<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.110> her

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
did I will lift up the scruff of her

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.499 
did I will lift up the scruff of her
neck<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.920> insert<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> chip<00:01:41.700> just<00:01:42.119> into<00:01:42.390> this

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
neck and insert the chip just into this

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.200 
neck and insert the chip just into this
area<00:01:42.960> under<00:01:43.350> under<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.070> graph<00:01:44.310> here<00:01:44.520> and

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
area under under this graph here and

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.760 
area under under this graph here and
this<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.509> an<00:01:45.600> implant<00:01:45.960> which<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:46.320> used<00:01:46.619> earlier

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
this is an implant which we used earlier

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.980 
this is an implant which we used earlier
and<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.490> would<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:47.640> insert<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.509> microchip

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
and it would just insert the microchip

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.690 
and it would just insert the microchip
just<00:01:49.259> there<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:50.189> then<00:01:50.310> we'll<00:01:50.399> give<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.640> a

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
just there and then we'll give it a

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.569 
just there and then we'll give it a
small<00:01:50.909> rub<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.990> scan<00:01:52.680> her<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.070> make<00:01:53.220> sure<00:01:53.250> it's

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
small rub and scan her to make sure it's

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.819 
small rub and scan her to make sure it's
in<00:01:53.700> place<00:01:53.939> which<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.750> beeps<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.560> picks<00:01:55.710> up

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
in place which it is beeps and picks up

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.950 
in place which it is beeps and picks up
her<00:01:55.950> chip<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.579> we<00:01:56.610> can<00:01:56.820> trace<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.240> back<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.630> her

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
her chip and we can trace it back to her

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.429 
her chip and we can trace it back to her
owner<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:59.159> that's<00:01:59.369> it<00:02:00.049> so<00:02:01.049> it's<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.229> really
