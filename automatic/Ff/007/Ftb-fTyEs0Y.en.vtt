00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello everyone this video is a 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.710
 continuation of a video I made 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.599
 a few months dedicated to the headset of 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.320
 phone when we have for example the 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.719
 headset the telephone of a telephone 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.580
 domestic where we stay at home and 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.020
 the same one has failed us we are going to 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.090
 get rid of him because he has a breakdown 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.010
 we are going to throw it well then ya 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.720
 I commented that with the headset we could 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.519
 recycle as line tester see 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.620
 the telephone of the line tester 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.870
 that we have at home on the wall 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.270
 Well, there's nothing like some headphones 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.470
 directly you can not use the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.870
 themselves but you have to make them 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.420
 small modification most of the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.100
 headphones changing the plug as you 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.190
 I commented 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.449
 the rj11 of the redota 9 would happen in the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.610
 pj 11 plug and masters and directly 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.649
 we would listen through the headset 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.210
 if we want the whole line or if we are 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.900
 receiving some conversation 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.970
 on that telephone line 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.520
 so there are some headphones that 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.620
 internally they are modified 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.540
 specific to be able to work 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.300
 only with a phone then the 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.020
 plugged in we did not see anything then 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.210
 nothing 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.550
 This is a scrapping of a headset 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.800
 phone broke down was to throw 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.360
 and nothing is recovered the casing me 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.480
 waste of it since it was shattered 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.820
 without anything we will see how we could 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.830
 modify the same 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.290
 the modification that has the same 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.979
 it is simply to change a wiring of 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:36.640
 position and disconnect the microphone that 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:39.040
 no use any longer for nothing the 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.470
 topic would be the next we look at the 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.400
 pin what are the wiring the two 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:48.640
 exchanges that carry the telephone line 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.100
 They are usually red and green 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.750
 as we see here we have the four 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:59.380
 cables we have the black that we will go 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.979
 to the microphone the red that is the line 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.880
 positive the green is the negative line and 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:10.750
 the yellow goes to the headset is so 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.800
 simple as we must change 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.410
 the headphone cable the cable that would go 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.100
 to yellow on one side we should not 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.770
 move to the center to the red wire so 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.420
 we will both remove the microphone and I say 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.980
 It can vary from phones to others 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.160
 but good in this case I found 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.350
 this that internally modifies the 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.990
 standard operation that lead to 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.150
 other phones carrying the headset in 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.340
 the center and the microphone in the 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.100
 laterals this does not carry the two in a 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.780
 lateral on the side the microphone and on 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.550
 the other does not vehiculate since nothing hands to 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.280
 the work and we see that we would do the first 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.300
 we eliminate the microphone that is not going to 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.170
 have any use 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.710
 another solution could be to cut the 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.230
 cables and leave only the headset 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.450
 That would be worth a next step 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.310
 we could perform but good the 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.710
 problem of cutting the wires and leaving 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.490
 only the headset is that this guy 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.440
 of cables used by phones are 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.590
 cables they carry are steel cables 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.410
 They carry a lot of plastic plastic 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.120
 very hardened and the copper wire is very 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.190
 small is very fine then in the 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.780
 time to cut the cable splicing 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.950
 we are going to stay with him in his hand 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.170
 let's break the cable 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.520
 we have made the first maneuver as now 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.500
 You see the subject is already a little bit more 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:39.040
 clear the black we are going to ride the 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.040
 principle and red we will pass 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.180
 here that we see it closely the red that 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.260
 we have on one side we will pass 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.260
 to the central terminal 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:01.320
 how we have been a little piece of yarn 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.320
 we will retire with the help of a plier 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.140
 and we already have the vacuum the hole has 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.410
 xavi from the cable and now the 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:15.610
 handset we do not take out 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:19.180
 of your location that we have 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.829
 we will let go in the central pin that I have 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.500
 commented 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:27.620
 in the red 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.620
 and we would have the modified headset 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.310
 to be able to use it as a controller 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.919
 these are expensive and there it would be ready 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.560
 as such as we have now 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.080
 it could work as a tester 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.960
 line 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.080
 the plug if we put it in the 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.949
 key in the rosette of the wall 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.319
 moving it a bit we will get 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.150
 find everything we will find 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:57.729
 make connection and I say yours 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.250
 change them for a rj11 plug this is 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:03.069
 the 9 smallest but good with this one 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.860
 some connection action may come and 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:08.800
 we have the headset directly 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.819
 placed on the two central cables of 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.069
 line the red and the green therefore 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:17.229
 directly through the headset we're going to 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:19.389
 can hear if we have tone yes 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.430
 you want to do it already as a tool 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.050
 even smaller problems and so on 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:28.050
 Nothing is as simple as placing 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.050
 the cable cut here we eliminate 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.770
 yellow and black 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.710
 these two we would take off 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:43.430
 we would only leave red and green 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:46.700
 this would be cut would be only red 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:50.030
 and green the two wires in reals and we 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:54.009
 we would join welding the cable directly 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:57.070
 the handset would therefore 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:59.320
 we would stay like this 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.960
 a very small test tool 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.330
 simple and quite practical normally 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.100
 the faults of telephones nowadays already 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.310
 they tend to produce little is the issue that 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.810
 It has improved a lot but, well, I say 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.000
 if you have an old headset that warns 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.310
 discard that you are going to throw because always 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.380
 we can do with it a tool of 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.520
 proof that it can be 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.520
 quite useful 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:26.000
 it's one more recycling we can do 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.940
 something that we were going to get rid of it 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.550
 then nothing until the small video 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.440
 I hope you liked that it serves as 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.960
 usefulness of recycling and that you have in 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.000
 realize that not all phones are worth 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.120
 to connect directly to the booth 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.070
 of telephone or telephony and listen if 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.890
 we have tone there are some that make 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.110
 a little modification a greeting and that 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:50.860
 keep visiting the web and the videos that 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.860
 for yourself
