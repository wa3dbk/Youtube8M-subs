 pasta of the magical godfathers I hope that 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.230
 We like to start, it was rumored in the 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.990
 streets that Mr. wood hardman 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.790
 writer of the magical godfathers thought 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.980
 in directing some episodes of the 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.529
 magical godparents to a more adult audience 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.570
 even on the internet they spread 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.449
 some spots for the adult version of 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.369
 the magical godfathers but harman in 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.230
 deferred blogs still existing in 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.359
 Internet reveals that his childhood was very 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.610
 hard even tried to take his own life in 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.800
 several times entering the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.440
 for him all change he knew 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.750
 a girl had friends laughed and lived 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.430
 happy he reveals in the blogs already 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.559
 mentioned that the fact that timmy 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.750
 turner needed a pair of godparents 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.000
 magical to brighten your everyday life 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.039
 it is a metaphor of what was for him the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.649
 past his parents did not pay attention 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.960
 his nanny did not take care of his neighbors what 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.989
 they mistreated their parents used to get 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.539
 drunk to mistreat him like that he wrote the 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.969
 magical godfathers a happier version 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.860
 of his horrendous daily life when 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.900
 decided to change the public to one more 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.820
 adult thought it would be a good idea 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.310
 to drown all your sorrows at once 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.320
 for all this is the only chapter 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.560
 satanic version of the magical godfathers 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.360
 who could see the light start to narrate 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.510
 is what was my experience with that 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.120
 chapter I with insomnia all three of the 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.190
 tomorrow the moon in all its splendor the 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.430
 remote control in my hand changing of 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.460
 channel looking for something interesting to see 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.490
 or how well the magical godparents will give me 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.380
 a little sleep alone that the scene 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.240
 main started with tim and crying 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.090
 in his room I saw that as usual 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.150
 without paying attention to Tim and his parents 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.580
 same for a change they were traveling but 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.130
 why tim and cried where are you cosmo 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.440
 and wanda a scene in the bathroom of the house 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.080
 with godparents tied to a chair 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.119
 pleading for the life of tim and change 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.729
 of scene Jorge in the soldier grandulÃ³n 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.650
 drinking glass after glass of whiskey in the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.960
 another hand a cigarette turns around 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.970
 staying face to face with tiny tim and 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.640
 I looked at him with pleading eyes with the 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.410
 hope that he will take pity on him Jorge 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.090
 a tear on his cheek screams at him 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.670
 cry everything will end faster than this 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.370
 raising his hand holding a stick hits 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.800
 to tim and one after another after again and I 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.050
 about to be unconscious says between 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.480
 teeth with a very pale voice 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.970
 behind you damn before Jorge 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.319
 I could react a pretty knife 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.420
 Sharp comes out of his nose 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.549
 Jorgensen moves very grotesquely 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.010
 while cosmo says never we 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.170
 hurt us again neither them nor me 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.209
 desperately cosmo stabs the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.430
 Jorge's corpse in certain times 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.440
 while wanda leaves from a side of cosmo 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.450
 and runs to hug Tim and covers him 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.640
 eyes while wanda has a huge 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.010
 smile of satisfaction to see how 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.569
 Cosmo ends with Jorge after his walk 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.400
 says until she follows 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.530
 cosmo ascends with the head without 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.510
 expression on his face when tim 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.000
 and he turns away from wanda and tells him I want 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.530
 do this go down the stairs with a 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.599
 Shotgun in the hands 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.640
 vicky surprised to see him says tim and 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.530
 If you do not lower that shotgun, I'll tell your 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.540

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.209

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.350
 right at the head of vic and ends with 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.660
 every sign of life in it appears a 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.900
 poster with a pretty bizarre background in 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.180
 the 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.299
 two hours later the parents arrive 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.159
 tim and dad drunk the mother beaten and 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.870

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.819
 Honey why their acts to view two 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.890
 corpses behind the sofa in the room and 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.930
 pointing to his parents with a tone 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.209
 quite empty he answers them because I do not 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.310
 they took care how their 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.170
 words followed by a single shot of 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.890
 shotgun ended with the life of their 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.930
 parents 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.480

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.670

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.769

 do it team and yell at them yes yes I will 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.150

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.159
 the words of tim and cosmo and wanda al 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.530
 At the same time he holds a knife and 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:01.690
 they cut the veins the episode ends with 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.090
 tim and hung from a tie with a face 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.939
 that expressed rest and satisfaction 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.709
 after that the light went away the only thing 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:10.299
 What I wanted to do was hold on to my 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.159
 pillow between fear and 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:15.069
 despair I just had to wait for 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:18.599
 that the light came good friends this was 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.599
