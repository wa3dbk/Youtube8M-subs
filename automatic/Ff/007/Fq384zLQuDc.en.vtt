a review about the orangutan durán wheel
alright<00:00:16.170> this<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> 75<00:00:16.949> millimeter<00:00:17.550> wheel

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
alright this is a 75 millimeter wheel

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.510 
alright this is a 75 millimeter wheel
with<00:00:18.030> a<00:00:18.060> 45<00:00:18.539> millimeter<00:00:18.960> contact<00:00:19.470> patch<00:00:19.680> it

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
with a 45 millimeter contact patch it

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.939 
with a 45 millimeter contact patch it
comes<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:21.240> two<00:00:21.449> different<00:00:21.480> aids<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.619> can<00:00:22.769> get

yellow<00:00:25.650> these<00:00:26.369> are<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.119> 86<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.929> these<00:00:28.230> are

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
yellow these are the 86 is these are

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.099 
yellow these are the 86 is these are
definitely<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.759> good<00:00:30.330> thing<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.720> get<00:00:30.839> for

definitely a good thing to get for
sliding<00:00:31.759> they<00:00:32.759> slide<00:00:33.090> right<00:00:33.120> out<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.720> box

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
sliding they slide right out of the box

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.350 
sliding they slide right out of the box
I<00:00:34.410> never<00:00:35.130> saw<00:00:35.340> people<00:00:35.370> we're<00:00:35.850> saying<00:00:36.090> that

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
I never saw people we're saying that

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.420 
I never saw people we're saying that
they<00:00:36.480> weren't<00:00:36.690> but<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.140> mean<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.650> thought<00:00:38.280> at

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
they weren't but I mean I thought at

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.119 
they weren't but I mean I thought at
first<00:00:38.460> too<00:00:38.789> but<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.390> noticed<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.199> these<00:00:40.890> have

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
first too but I noticed that these have

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.040 
first too but I noticed that these have
a<00:00:41.160> little<00:00:41.280> bit<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.699> different<00:00:42.239> style<00:00:42.600> when

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
a little bit of a different style when

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.049 
a little bit of a different style when
you<00:00:43.170> ride<00:00:43.410> they're<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.280> little<00:00:44.640> bit<00:00:44.850> more

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
you ride they're a little bit more

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:45.770 
you ride they're a little bit more
laid-back

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
laid-back

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.319 
laid-back
um<00:00:46.219> some<00:00:47.219> people<00:00:47.250> say<00:00:47.579> they're<00:00:47.789> too<00:00:47.969> slippery

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
um some people say they're too slippery

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.979 
um some people say they're too slippery
they<00:00:48.870> are<00:00:49.020> not<00:00:50.059> maybe<00:00:51.059> after<00:00:51.449> about<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.690> year<00:00:51.780> of

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
they are not maybe after about a year of

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.630 
they are not maybe after about a year of
riding<00:00:52.500> them<00:00:52.649> they<00:00:52.829> might<00:00:52.980> start<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.430> really

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
riding them they might start to really

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.000 
riding them they might start to really
lose<00:00:53.910> their<00:00:54.149> grip<00:00:54.440> there<00:00:55.440> are<00:00:55.530> pretty<00:00:55.769> wide

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
lose their grip there are pretty wide

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.160 
lose their grip there are pretty wide
wheel<00:00:56.370> as<00:00:56.609> you<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:56.879> see<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.390> 45<00:00:57.809> millimeter

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
wheel as you can see the 45 millimeter

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.669 
wheel as you can see the 45 millimeter
contact<00:00:58.649> patch<00:00:58.890> yeah<00:00:59.820> it's<00:01:00.690> about<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.440> whole

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
contact patch yeah it's about this whole

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.119 
contact patch yeah it's about this whole
area<00:01:02.070> right<00:01:02.129> here<00:01:02.340> um<00:01:03.559> great<00:01:04.559> wheel<00:01:04.800> I'm

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
area right here um great wheel I'm

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.830 
area right here um great wheel I'm
riding<00:01:05.489> them<00:01:05.580> with<00:01:05.700> some<00:01:05.880> loaded<00:01:06.210> Jews<00:01:06.570> with

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
riding them with some loaded Jews with

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.390 
riding them with some loaded Jews with
spacers<00:01:08.120> yeah<00:01:09.120> look<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.600> know<00:01:09.660> um<00:01:10.400> orangutan

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
spacers yeah look I know um orangutan

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.860 
spacers yeah look I know um orangutan
carries<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> couple<00:01:12.240> different<00:01:12.540> types<00:01:12.660> of

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
carries a couple different types of

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.870 
carries a couple different types of
wheels<00:01:12.990> these<00:01:13.770> are<00:01:14.160> probably<00:01:14.610> my<00:01:14.850> favorite

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
wheels these are probably my favorite

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.740 
wheels these are probably my favorite
the<00:01:15.720> best<00:01:16.230> for<00:01:16.440> sliding<00:01:17.000> I<00:01:18.000> don't<00:01:18.570> know<00:01:18.630> if

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
the best for sliding I don't know if

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.780 
the best for sliding I don't know if
these<00:01:18.900> would<00:01:19.020> be<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> good<00:01:19.530> for<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> racing

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
these would be the good for a racing

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.290 
these would be the good for a racing
type<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.600> performance<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:22.530> uh<00:01:23.000> yeah<00:01:24.000> cuz<00:01:24.210> they

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
type of performance but uh yeah cuz they

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.120 
type of performance but uh yeah cuz they
might<00:01:24.510> slip<00:01:24.810> out<00:01:24.990> under<00:01:25.260> you<00:01:25.470> when<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.830> ride

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
might slip out under you when you ride

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.460 
might slip out under you when you ride
but<00:01:26.880> um<00:01:27.090> yeah<00:01:27.570> these<00:01:27.720> are<00:01:27.870> great<00:01:27.960> for<00:01:28.050> sliding

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
but um yeah these are great for sliding

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.980 
but um yeah these are great for sliding
not<00:01:28.890> too<00:01:29.130> slightly<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.760> can<00:01:29.820> go<00:01:30.570> down<00:01:30.750> some

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
not too slightly you can go down some

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.660 
not too slightly you can go down some
hills<00:01:31.200> go<00:01:31.470> down<00:01:31.650> some<00:01:31.860> turns<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.400> you're<00:01:32.550> not

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
hills go down some turns and you're not

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.250 
hills go down some turns and you're not
going<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.910> end<00:01:33.060> up<00:01:33.180> wiping<00:01:33.660> out<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:34.080> because

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
going to end up wiping out just because

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.060 
going to end up wiping out just because
it<00:01:34.380> rips<00:01:34.710> out<00:01:34.890> under<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.400> um<00:01:36.410> yeah<00:01:37.410> they<00:01:37.770> they

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
it rips out under you um yeah they they

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.740 
it rips out under you um yeah they they
have<00:01:38.580> a<00:01:38.610> little<00:01:38.940> bit<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.120> friction<00:01:39.300> on<00:01:39.600> them

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
have a little bit of friction on them

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.380 
have a little bit of friction on them
486<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.530> but<00:01:41.010> I<00:01:41.040> mean<00:01:41.250> performance<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.180> them<00:01:42.300> is

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
486 a but I mean performance of them is

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.710 
486 a but I mean performance of them is
great<00:01:42.720> really<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.440> love<00:01:44.130> them<00:01:44.370> I<00:01:44.610> was<00:01:45.180> riding<00:01:45.600> on
