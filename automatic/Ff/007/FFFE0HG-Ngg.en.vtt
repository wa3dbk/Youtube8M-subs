00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:28.080
 this is a case of model is easy 121 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:33.140
 it is all steel 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.140
 the stainless steel speaker bracelet 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.670
 but I find this watch interesting 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:48.250
 interactivity with time I will 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:50.950
 develop every 30 seconds every 30 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.800
 start second and starts running it 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:01:03.489
 O for that segment 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:06.460
 until finally saying 23 seconds to the second 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:11.130
 it begins to disappear segment that 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.130
 he completed the 1st 2nd and 1st 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:35.759
 also has the segment 10 minutes better 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:35.759
 every minute because 10 minutes when 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:45.130
 finish with got 8 41 and it's a minute 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.240
 at 10 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.740
 then every ten minutes it is filled that 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:02:00.240
 all and disappears in coke second 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:00.240
 segment that is happening here 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:12.930
 and this watch is manufactured in china usa 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:16.980
 the Japanese movement every 20 seconds. 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:22.560
 mexico pointer now saw to be a 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:29.760
 another segment here watch very heavy is 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:34.190
 pure stainless steel is difficult 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.190
 it's hard is better in Portuguese 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:51.190
 Heroes is very handsome 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:56.190
 I wanted a digital watch that 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:59.800
 come rate come it all fits in 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:03.130
 of steel but I did not find digital sun 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.080
 so I got this one that has analog 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:15.820
 which is cool too and has a man 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:21.780
 also the moment the other segment 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.780
 appeared here he has 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.640
 like the subway 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:47.050
 hospitals with a stopwatch that has two 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:50.850
 kilometers at once the forrÃ³ 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.850
 the two times occurring 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.490
 I think is cool 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.519
 yahoo in relation to what 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.359
 I'll try to stop at this time. 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.939
 close the time it takes 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.289
 come back 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.110
 so much 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:06.950
 he 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:06.950
 it's an all- brushed act 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.840
 it's difficult 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.840
 the dts
