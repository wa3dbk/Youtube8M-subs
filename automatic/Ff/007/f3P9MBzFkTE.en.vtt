skull amethyst glitter and I thought it

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.740

I'll probably do a tutorial when I

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.230 
I'll probably do a tutorial when I
triumph<00:04:56.510> and<00:04:57.510> then<00:04:57.720> the<00:04:57.900> last<00:04:58.200> thing<00:04:58.680> is<00:04:59.240> this

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
triumph and then the last thing is this

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.650 
triumph and then the last thing is this
nail<00:05:00.990> art<00:05:01.340> decoration<00:05:02.340> set<00:05:02.610> and<00:05:02.910> it<00:05:03.450> comes
