00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.919
 something has changed where with this ship 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:22.760
 This video is about the most scandalous book on 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:25.350
 light for jazz individual layer with us 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.150
 there is such a tradition from time to time we 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.250
 choose some small book and 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.150
 agree that every yoga is all so 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.130
 a certain date 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.290
 and then somebody writes questions 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.850
 for example in the spirit of why the hero acted 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.540
 so then i'm wrong and how are you to this 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.450
 treat 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.510
 we all discuss these questions oh these 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.550
 fun humanities down 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.030
 some all this recently went through this 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.129
 the hearth of the family council and was the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.230
 scandalous book does not rise 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.149
 issues like death freedom 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.879
 responsibility of the relationship between children and 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.559
 parents relationship between lovers 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.530
 respect for someone else's life is no longer for someone else 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:06.470
 death racism russian realism 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.470
 imperialism well, not yet guessed 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.580
 alber camu pastoral story begins 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.830
 with that middle-aged man who 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.350
 will cause the world juice he lives there french 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.780
 in lies it seems thirties 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.690
 twentieth century and so are you still 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.640
 is influenced by France in general 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.290
 the person gets a telegram about what's in 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.509
 house introduced download and beg 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.880
 and he's going to go there on 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.200
 funeral though a book and quite small 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.810
 only 100 pages and so small 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.869
 this despite it is very much here 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.830
 events occurs mercy manages a bunch 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:52.220
 actions to make and a bunch of consequences 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:54.690
 after them contemplate and they are all controversial 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.210
 by doing something he does harm 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.039
 there are some others around but in one 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.170
 case brings exactly and in general it's all 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:05.240
 Each issue can be discussed three 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.679
 days because it is ingeniously written 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.140
 also of great importance for me personally 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.660
 has when this book was written she 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.130
 was written in 1942 more precisely it was 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.799
 published for the first time this year 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.720
 written in my opinion a little earlier so 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.780
 can say right before the second world 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.209
 war and 10 years before in algeria 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.760
 anti-colonial war began against 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:31.170
 France and generally it is wrong how would 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.420
 explain past events of the future but i 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.100
 get out and say that the war itself with 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.200
 the sky does not fall no so probably 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.320
 attitudes in society were not the most 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.320
 rainbow colored and there were some questions 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.650
 in algeria about this whole situation 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.260
 colonial still further do and judging 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.440
 because one hero in this book 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.209
 secondary but already for the slave natural 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.760
 resident exploded from the very world with 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.700
 which we don't know came there or there 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.120
 born and their relationship between themselves and 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.060
 stew and happens to them and between them 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.840
 unrealistically important thing happens this is all 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.170
 sets a bunch of complements 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.480
 question for readers as far as I know 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.550
 from talking to other people when 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.200
 We discussed this book I am so 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.230
 concluded that there are two different ways 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.180
 how can people relate to her and the first 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.810
 way this is such a moral when they don't 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.030
 see that mi soo is an immoral person and 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.860
 what a bad thing and what all our 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.590
 society is rotting the group say so far 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.780
 so far but i'm holding to mating to the second 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.660
 a group of people who believe that mara and 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.230
 in which here laid a stone is like 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.750
 since there is a trap in which 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.340
 appear you reader must get caught 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.860
 actually a book 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.510
 the bones that the moral is overvalued 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.000
 there is a stone in my opinion that says 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.709
 morality is invented by a society without society 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.400
 it makes perfect sense 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.140
 and developed correctly to do only those 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.569
 things that I re-read others do 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.069
 ok and do the things that you 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.110
 narrow here to do bad 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.019
 Gopher is not a sign knows how to 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.120
 need to kill other people there or 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.340
 Something is not well, just says that 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.730
 maybe human morality is not 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.690
 the deepest way to justify your 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.280
 deeds here and in general every person 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:25.000
 principle is free to do what he wants 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.280
 and you can not blame someone for what he 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.530
 not experiencing love where he should her 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:34.180
 experience or not do something where 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:36.070
 He has to do it here and now 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.530
 somehow I am not a fan will give abruptly and not 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.050
 take offense if you are a fan and that is 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.580
 so for me this is a manifestation 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.470
 which is just some kind of mercilessly 100 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.260
 pages takes this grain what 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.669
 crime of punishment which 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.550
 upgraded one thousand five hundred million 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.740
 points shrunk became the ideal of 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.500
 I will get him for a stranger because 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:00.820
 themes here raise the same but much 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.860
 deeper disclosed and compels readers 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.840
 think to think they just impose 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.490
 he thinks something to me 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.020
 eat as gradually spread 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.000
 Kazan and here it seems to me this book will be 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:16.010
 much longer actual than 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.750
 delivery receipt can void 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.280
 No other books tests Astana 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.780
 crime when not exactly needed on 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.210
 clean for me is very true this book 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.780
 just like an iceberg 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.470
 Well, if you also read an outsider 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.570
 alber camu 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.340
 he impressed you to this or 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.530
 even if not necessarily produced 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.550
 tell about your impressions 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.240
 comments or the absence of these 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.400
 impressions 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.130
 I would be very interested to know even 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.100
 probably more interesting than ever if 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.020
 honestly so i hope we talk 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.560
 comment tap now and see you 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.560
 next issue
