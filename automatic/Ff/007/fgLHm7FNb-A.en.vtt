 curious the tecmundo selected the five 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.270
 more interesting features of ad 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.640
 You need to know the branch is a 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.129
 tool that microsoft included night 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.039
 to make the browser more organized 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.079

 your list of downloads and also the 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.270
 history of recent navigation but what 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.180
 really is new in this session is the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.940
 read list can save news 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.370

 this list for you to read when you have 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.880
 time 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.130
 is basically an organization solution 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.560
 to store things for later without 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.210
 need to save anything needed in the 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.549
 bookmark the web note function is a 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.670
 novelty of the west according to 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.290
 microsoft it basically allows 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.439
 draw with the mouse or with your fingers 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.049
 any website is a new 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.450
 way of interacting with the web that 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.090
 being more natural and practical 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.189
 when you click the evernote icon to 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.329
 your current tab turns a page 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.220
 notes 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.520
 you can select a pen for 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.770
 write circular and mark things gives 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.649
 also to use a colored text mark 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.890
 and highlight specific parts of the page 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.009
 you can still make more notes 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.009
 simple and locally save all the 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.140
 share with friends 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.450
 the reading mode is not exactly a 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.549
 novelty in web browsers but the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.520
 microsoft decided to incorporate this 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.890
 tool in ad natively in chrome and 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.190
 in firefox for example you need 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.700
 an extension to have something similar in the 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.750
 ed 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.000
 it only takes one click 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.340
 the open booklet icon on top of 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.100
 window and check the reading options 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.140
 that the browser offers the read mode 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.480
 basically eliminates everything that is 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.570
 unnecessary at the moment leaving only 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.480
 the text and images on your screen you 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.970
 can even customize the font color 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.780
 background and some other details for 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.430
 have a more enjoyable experience 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.280
 Microsoft explained that any 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.520
 chrome extension firefox could be 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.230
 cut to the ad without much complication 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.900
 developers will only have to do 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.390
 some adaptations and make their 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.510
 extensions to the ad what the company 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.030
 I still do not say it 's exactly like that. 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.370
 will not work either. 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.590
 browser will have a specific store for 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.209
 or whether these add-ons will be on the 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.160
 app store own Windows 10 to 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.020
 West integration with the assistant 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.760
 digital cortana should be the largest 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.010
 browser differential 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.470
 this will make many more activities 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.750
 automatic and intelligent yet 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.500
 we know exactly what will be 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.480
 available at a first 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.549
 we know that the cut in the 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.150
 interpret direct searches in the 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:32.580
 addresses and bring objective results 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.239
 typing the Ã©der which means time in 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.220
 English 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.850
 Do you already see the current temperature in your 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.870
 the city before even giving 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.329
 unfortunately cutting it has not yet 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.799
 It works neither Portuguese nor smartphone. 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.049
 nor on the computer 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.670
 there is evidence that Microsoft is already 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.920
 working on an adaptation of the 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.730
 assistant to brazil they the company 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.799
 still does not have a release forecast 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.860
 for now who wants to test these 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.450
 microsoft news has two options 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.329
 you can run the latest test version 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.850
 windows 10 on a virtual machine or 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.810
 still install the operating system 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.820
 straight on the pc 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.010
