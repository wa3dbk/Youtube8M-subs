 I have a diamond and I get caught like a 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.200
 bastard or rich in iron 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.680

 there are elite with chips there back 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.390
 we'll see 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.670
 ok there's one near you there where 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.670

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.010
 with all 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.530
 and I'm not here 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.700
 4 and others 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.700
 but here it is no longer valid 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.700
 one 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.390
 and since I am here, he is very little 

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:53.789
 if the water was not the water the water 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:03.629
 but you do not look that then here there 

00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:03.629
 a wall in my case that is not out there 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.840
 and this part is created 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.840
 I have lost 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:24.480
 the center is the two that remain 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.740
 above you see it 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:37.440
 it is foolish not 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:39.450
 not because of the bar 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.380
 but this was grass the crime was 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.380
 I take you war 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.030

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:51.800
 we see well at last 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.800
 with this 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:09.710
 He says do not do what little is that 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.569
 so never do it, it's like we're going to 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.530
 start here but I do not know if in 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:14.530
 Chinese or whatever 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.210
 that is, there are people who do not know it, 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:27.559
 He tells 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:35.770
 finally and that little by little 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:44.110
 if you want the cruise 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:46.150

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:54.320
 stars 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:56.480
 ramp 737 of 1,000 of 1602 is bad 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.790
 but he's not dead either we could not 

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.790
 say yes once square 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.660
 He does not know what the fuck 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:16.530
 well I think this joke 

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:25.979
 I'm going to do it with the numbers so 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:28.580
 I probably won with the numbers 

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:28.580
 they are my hand 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.349
 3 2 1 already 

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.260

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.290
