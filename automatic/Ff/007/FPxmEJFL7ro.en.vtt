00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hi so this video is really 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.790
 very very very very important 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.830
 I showed things to do about 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.480
 solos that go completely all 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.830
 processed 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.809
 I do not mince the words here you know 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.730
 I often talk about risk is very 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.070
 very important it must be that 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.439
 the sentences be in rhythm that play in 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.510
 rhythm is so ugly that playing fake good 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.070
 short that now you know it but he 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.019
 is something else that is very important 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.369
 maybe even more important than 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.619
 the rhythm and all that if you play with 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.670
 only a few notes 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.720
 there will be little chance that she 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.290
 not in rhythm if I do not have 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.719
 a lot and so must these notes she 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.129
 be well and be beautiful and 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.540
 so I showed you how to do that 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.399
 how are we going to do that 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.690
 simply there are elements of the game 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.160
 we will be able to establish 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.260
 elements of what is called the touchdown 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.340
 and that's very important because 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.469
 that's what makes personality 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.559
 guitarist we say we recognize them 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.719
 to touch them touch what is that 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.199
 is going to be the way to approach the notes 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.300
 here is the care to anticipate 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.949
 attack and full of things to 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.460
 to do on all that I have all summer in 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.369
 this video 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.250
 so it's very important to follow that 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.350
 to the end and therefore to know how 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.900
 without being able to integrate that into his game 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.119
 for this is what is also called 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.280
 that's saying it's often crying 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.509
 his guitar to shout and well all 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.080
 these elements that allow you to do 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.970
 to pass emotions 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.770
 oslo in your game the way you 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.740
 go to attack with the right hand you 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.210
 go to tackle them with the left hand there 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.120
 there is a lot to do with 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.000
 all this to succeed in passing 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.380
 emotions in your sentences and then 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.120
 what are we going to be able to put like 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.190
 things I'm explaining 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.210
 we say all that here and after I 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.990
 apply in sizes and how to 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.000
 to put them 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.490
 so there are already all the attacks of 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 notes to the pick so what are we going 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.880
 to be able to be attacked loud either 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.240
 attacked gently here we are not going 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.010
 have the same sound but many ways 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.380
 to do to attack the pick I 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.280
 will show his left hand 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.979
 we will be able to do everything amr 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.330
 husband offers it works very well he goes 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:15.120
 to have the slides 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.950
 and all that is ugly band another 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.120
 very important element of which I 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:26.640
 talk here it'll be vibrato here 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.020
 can do either a light thing or I 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.190
 will you explain all this how 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.960
 are we going to be able to do like axa 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.030
 up in the cold with some 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.000
 simple little exercises first I you 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.200
 speak and therefore the pick that we go 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.820
 to do is that there are so many 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.130
 ways to attack ours to be able to 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.530
 be attacked loudly or gently and the 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.660
 loire between testing your sentence how 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.820
 make it ring according to sic she notes in 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.790
 does you want accentuated so the house 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.970
 on them on three notes 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.780
 what are we going to accentuate the first 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:01.650
 is what we see on it and the 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:02.760
 second accentuated the last one that's it 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.190
 it's up to you to see what will be yours to test 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.850
 so take your sentences from this lot so 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.890
 there I took something stupid and 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:18.019
 so try to accentuate the 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:20.040
 first the second you last 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.310
 so it's up to you to see what you 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.739
 please 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.459
 and how do you want to put 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.900
 that up 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.820
 take the oslo phrases that you have 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.560
 used to play and try to put 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.170
 accents in several places 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.220
 after that will come also with the felt 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.530
 from the moment where is what wanted 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.760
 accentuate here often what works 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.900
 well it's the first dumpling in Bern 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.820
 so that's something I give 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.010
 afterwards it's up to you to see where is that 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.470
 you want to put accents so that 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.750
 it is to accentuate for expected is 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.170
 so either you play harder some 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.340
 notes to the pick can even do what 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.830
 I do it is that I pass the rope 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:57.640
 enter 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:04:00.260
 the mediator is with this shot and the agreement 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.850
 for example age added the second 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.500
 Walloon is already the end of this excerpt 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.240
