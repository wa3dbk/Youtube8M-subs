00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
tried to do the same thing but they had

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.469 
tried to do the same thing but they had
too<00:01:28.920> many<00:01:29.009> pounds<00:01:29.610> circulating<00:01:30.180> they<00:01:30.299> went

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
too many pounds circulating they went

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.060 
too many pounds circulating they went
down<00:01:30.600> back<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.079> an<00:01:31.200> old<00:01:31.350> price<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.009> they

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
didn't withdraw any pounds so it didn't

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.350 
didn't withdraw any pounds so it didn't
work<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.920> now<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:35.880> have<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.030> bigger<00:01:36.270> problem

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
work and now we have a bigger problem

work and now we have a bigger problem
the<00:01:36.869> transition<00:01:37.380> would<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:37.680> pretty<00:01:37.979> tough<00:01:38.250> and

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
the transition would be pretty tough and

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.370 
the transition would be pretty tough and
I've<00:01:38.549> written<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.180> talked<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.720> lot<00:01:39.869> about<00:01:39.930> this

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
I've written and talked a lot about this

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.130 
I've written and talked a lot about this
and<00:01:40.650> you'd<00:01:41.130> have<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.490> devise<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> system<00:01:42.299> where

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
and you'd have to devise a system where

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.050 
and you'd have to devise a system where
there<00:01:43.290> would<00:01:43.530> be<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.740> transition<00:01:44.610> where<00:01:44.820> maybe

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
there would be a transition where maybe

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.030 
there would be a transition where maybe
you<00:01:45.270> could<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> gold<00:01:45.990> standard<00:01:46.320> competing

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
you could have a gold standard competing

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.520 
you could have a gold standard competing
with<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.189> paper<00:01:47.520> standard<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.390> then<00:01:48.960> obviously

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
with a paper standard and then obviously

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.200 
with a paper standard and then obviously
gold<00:01:50.040> would<00:01:50.220> win<00:01:50.430> out<00:01:50.460> people<00:01:51.060> would

so if money quit flowing in there

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.000 
so if money quit flowing in there
if<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.060> few<00:02:12.630> foreigners<00:02:13.020> decide<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.530> dump<00:02:13.710> some
