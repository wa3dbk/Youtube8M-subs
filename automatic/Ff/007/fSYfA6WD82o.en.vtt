00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.950 

okay<00:00:04.049> with<00:00:04.589> this<00:00:04.710> design<00:00:05.150> obviously<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.810> way

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
okay with this design obviously the way

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.930 
okay with this design obviously the way
it's<00:00:07.140> set<00:00:07.379> up<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.770> that<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.400> engine<00:00:08.700> is<00:00:08.790> going

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
it's set up is that the engine is going

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.850 
it's set up is that the engine is going
to<00:00:09.000> be<00:00:09.150> in<00:00:09.420> between<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.230> person's<00:00:10.559> legs<00:00:10.740> as

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
to be in between the person's legs as

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.390 
to be in between the person's legs as
they<00:00:10.889> drive<00:00:11.269> what<00:00:12.269> that<00:00:12.450> means<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:13.400> i'm

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
they drive what that means is that i'm

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.540 
they drive what that means is that i'm
going<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.580> be<00:00:14.639> building<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.240> shroud<00:00:16.400> so<00:00:17.400> that

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
going to be building a shroud so that

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.450 
going to be building a shroud so that
will<00:00:17.699> go<00:00:17.970> around<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.359> engine<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.900> exhaust

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
will go around the engine so the exhaust

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.550 
will go around the engine so the exhaust
if<00:00:20.460> you're<00:00:20.699> good<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.380> fabrication<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.470> that

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
if you're good and fabrication and that

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.450 
if you're good and fabrication and that
sort<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.800> thing<00:00:22.859> then<00:00:23.100> you'll<00:00:23.220> be<00:00:23.250> able<00:00:23.369> to

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
sort of thing then you'll be able to

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.950 
sort of thing then you'll be able to
build<00:00:23.670> an<00:00:23.880> exhaust<00:00:24.269> pipe<00:00:24.539> that's<00:00:24.750> going<00:00:24.900> to

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
build an exhaust pipe that's going to

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.000 
build an exhaust pipe that's going to
come<00:00:25.080> out<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.380> engine<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.920> go<00:00:26.490> down<00:00:26.730> below

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
come out of the engine and go down below

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.250 
come out of the engine and go down below
I'm<00:00:29.010> going<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.400> be<00:00:29.490> doing<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:30.060> now<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.720> a

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
I'm going to be doing this now in a

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.720 
I'm going to be doing this now in a
fashion<00:00:31.439> where<00:00:31.800> I'll<00:00:31.980> have<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> little<00:00:32.340> shroud

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
fashion where I'll have a little shroud

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.870 
fashion where I'll have a little shroud
right<00:00:33.030> here<00:00:33.770> on<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.920> steering<00:00:35.130> column<00:00:35.579> right

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
right here on the steering column right

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.010 
right here on the steering column right
here<00:00:36.469> but<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.590> problem<00:00:37.950> with<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.219> setup<00:00:38.520> is

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
here but the problem with this setup is

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
here but the problem with this setup is
that<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> way<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.350> steering<00:00:40.680> column<00:00:40.829> is

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
that the way the steering column is

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.770 
that the way the steering column is
going<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.250> go<00:00:41.399> I'm<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.300> have<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.450> remove

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
going to go I'm going to have to remove

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.920 
going to go I'm going to have to remove
my<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.320> my<00:00:43.530> gas<00:00:44.190> tank<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.780> since<00:00:45.780> there's

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
my in my gas tank and since there's

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.479 
my in my gas tank and since there's
going<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.110> be<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.200> slight<00:00:46.500> shroud<00:00:46.829> around<00:00:47.010> here

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
going to be a slight shroud around here

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.069 
going to be a slight shroud around here
when<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> exhaust<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.360> coming<00:00:48.690> out<00:00:48.809> hitting

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
when the exhaust is coming out hitting

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.010 
when the exhaust is coming out hitting
the<00:00:49.230> shroud<00:00:50.360> we're<00:00:51.360> not<00:00:51.480> going<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.690> want<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
the shroud we're not going to want the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.110 
the shroud we're not going to want the
exhaust<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.590> be<00:00:52.800> able<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.039> build<00:00:53.550> up<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.820> pull

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
exhaust to be able to build up a pull

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.979 
exhaust to be able to build up a pull
back<00:00:54.649> in<00:00:55.649> between<00:00:55.980> here<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.539> be<00:00:57.539> going<00:00:57.809> back

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
back in between here and be going back

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.830 
back in between here and be going back
up<00:00:58.140> into<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.399> carburetor<00:00:59.399> so<00:01:00.359> we<00:01:00.480> don't<00:01:00.690> want

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
up into the carburetor so we don't want

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.299 
up into the carburetor so we don't want
any<00:01:01.020> exhaust<00:01:01.410> fumes<00:01:01.800> going<00:01:02.039> into<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
any exhaust fumes going into the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.290 
any exhaust fumes going into the
carburetor<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:02.910> I'm<00:01:03.000> going<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.149> have<00:01:03.270> to

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
carburetor so I'm going to have to

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.050 
carburetor so I'm going to have to
modify<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.930> also<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:07.700> first<00:01:08.700> things<00:01:08.970> come

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
modify that also so first things come

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.030 
modify that also so first things come
first<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:10.229> what<00:01:10.350> I'm<00:01:10.439> going<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.590> be<00:01:10.710> doing<00:01:10.830> is

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
first so what I'm going to be doing is

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.230 
first so what I'm going to be doing is
I'm<00:01:11.189> using<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.520> little<00:01:11.760> harbor<00:01:12.030> freight

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
I'm using this little harbor freight

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.649 
I'm using this little harbor freight
engine<00:01:12.770> that's<00:01:13.770> what<00:01:13.890> I'm<00:01:13.950> doing<00:01:14.509> and<00:01:15.509> I'm

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
engine that's what I'm doing and I'm

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.640 
engine that's what I'm doing and I'm
taking<00:01:15.840> off<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.229> screws<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.950> remove<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.060> tank

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
taking off the screws to remove the tank

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.410 
taking off the screws to remove the tank
because<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.920> will<00:01:20.070> clot<00:01:20.400> getting<00:01:20.909> get<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.360> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
because it will clot getting get in the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.490 
because it will clot getting get in the
way<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:23.640> steering<00:01:23.939> column<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:25.259> gas

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
way of the the steering column the gas

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.789 
way of the the steering column the gas
tank<00:01:25.920> will<00:01:26.280> go<00:01:26.520> back<00:01:26.790> above<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.720> tire<00:01:28.369> so<00:01:30.799> now

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
tank will go back above the tire so now

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.679 
tank will go back above the tire so now

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
have to do here is that because the

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.149 
have to do here is that because the
exhaust<00:01:57.689> plume<00:01:58.020> will<00:01:58.170> be<00:01:58.289> back<00:01:58.469> here<00:01:58.859> I'll

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
exhaust plume will be back here I'll

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.459 
exhaust plume will be back here I'll
have<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.579> buildup<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.090> exhaust<00:02:00.479> back<00:02:00.780> here<00:02:01.109> you

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
have a buildup of exhaust back here you

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.719 
have a buildup of exhaust back here you
get<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:01.770> will<00:02:01.920> all<00:02:02.039> make<00:02:02.069> sense<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.579> when

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.160 
get this will all make sense to you when
i'm<00:02:02.819> almost<00:02:03.000> done<00:02:03.179> with<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.539> thing<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:03.990> don't

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
i'm almost done with this thing so don't

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.539 
i'm almost done with this thing so don't
be<00:02:04.319> asking<00:02:04.590> me<00:02:04.619> any<00:02:04.799> questions<00:02:04.829> about<00:02:05.219> this

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
be asking me any questions about this

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.940 
be asking me any questions about this
but<00:02:06.509> what<00:02:06.780> will<00:02:06.869> happen<00:02:06.899> here<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.530> i'll<00:02:07.829> be

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
but what will happen here is i'll be

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.650 
but what will happen here is i'll be
plugging<00:02:08.280> up<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.629> two<00:02:09.629> intake<00:02:10.110> ports<00:02:11.540> to<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
plugging up the two intake ports to the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.080 
plugging up the two intake ports to the
air<00:02:12.810> filter<00:02:13.190> now<00:02:14.190> initially<00:02:14.670> what<00:02:14.790> i<00:02:14.819> figured

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
air filter now initially what i figured

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.670 
air filter now initially what i figured
was<00:02:15.330> thinking<00:02:15.660> about<00:02:15.840> was<00:02:16.049> putting<00:02:16.349> in<00:02:16.470> some

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
was thinking about was putting in some

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.289 
was thinking about was putting in some
type<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:16.920> middle<00:02:17.250> partition<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:17.879> between<00:02:18.209> the

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
type of middle partition in between the

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.800 
type of middle partition in between the
exhaust<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.670> carburetor<00:02:20.670> but<00:02:21.660> that's

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
exhaust and the carburetor but that's

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.089 
exhaust and the carburetor but that's
just<00:02:21.930> not<00:02:22.019> going<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.290> be<00:02:22.379> feasible<00:02:22.890> because

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
just not going to be feasible because

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.039 
just not going to be feasible because
that's<00:02:23.790> where<00:02:23.970> my<00:02:24.060> spark<00:02:24.420> plug<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:24.810> going<00:02:24.989> to

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
that's where my spark plug is going to

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.339 
that's where my spark plug is going to
go<00:02:25.910> so<00:02:26.910> now<00:02:27.299> I<00:02:27.329> got<00:02:27.569> to<00:02:27.660> figure<00:02:27.840> out<00:02:27.989> something

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
go so now I got to figure out something

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.530 
go so now I got to figure out something
else<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.700> think<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.910> pretty<00:02:30.090> much<00:02:30.180> got<00:02:30.420> it

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
else and I think I pretty much got it

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.970 
else and I think I pretty much got it
figured<00:02:30.720> out<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.349> this<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.560> what<00:02:31.769> i'm<00:02:31.860> going

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
figured out and this is what i'm going

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.490 
figured out and this is what i'm going
to<00:02:32.040> do<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:33.510> since<00:02:33.840> i'm<00:02:33.959> going<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.170> be<00:02:34.260> plugging

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
to do so since i'm going to be plugging

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.130 
to do so since i'm going to be plugging
those<00:02:34.739> two<00:02:35.040> up<00:02:35.660> i'm<00:02:36.660> going<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.930> be<00:02:36.989> putting

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
those two up i'm going to be putting

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.470 
those two up i'm going to be putting
this<00:02:37.349> on<00:02:37.530> here<00:02:37.769> like<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:39.239> means

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
this on here like that that means

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.449 
this on here like that that means
there's<00:02:40.230> going<00:02:40.349> to<00:02:40.440> be<00:02:40.470> no<00:02:40.650> air<00:02:40.920> being<00:02:41.190> able<00:02:41.400> to

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
there's going to be no air being able to

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.300 
there's going to be no air being able to
get<00:02:41.549> into<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:42.620> carburetor<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:43.980> i'll<00:02:44.069> have<00:02:44.190> to

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
get into that carburetor so i'll have to

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.580 
get into that carburetor so i'll have to
figure<00:02:44.489> out<00:02:44.610> some<00:02:44.970> other<00:02:45.060> way

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.089 

what<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.430> did<00:02:51.239> was<00:02:52.239> I<00:02:52.360> cut<00:02:52.569> two<00:02:52.780> holes<00:02:52.810> in<00:02:53.319> the

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
what I did was I cut two holes in the

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.670 
what I did was I cut two holes in the
front<00:02:54.340> of<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.690> cover<00:02:56.400> put<00:02:57.400> in<00:02:57.519> to<00:02:57.700> channel<00:02:58.680> two

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
front of the cover put in to channel two

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.600 
front of the cover put in to channel two
beans

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.340 

from<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.240> stuff<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:03.510> was<00:03:03.690> donated<00:03:03.840> off<00:03:04.200> to

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
from that stuff that was donated off to

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.920 
from that stuff that was donated off to
me<00:03:04.580> from<00:03:05.580> George<00:03:05.940> thank<00:03:06.660> you<00:03:06.720> George

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.599 

and<00:03:10.109> that's<00:03:10.709> where<00:03:10.920> my<00:03:10.980> air<00:03:11.189> will<00:03:11.489> be<00:03:11.579> coming

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
and that's where my air will be coming

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.960 
and that's where my air will be coming
from

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.080 

once<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.120> plug<00:03:18.390> up<00:03:18.510> those<00:03:18.630> other<00:03:18.780> ones<00:03:18.989> and

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
once I plug up those other ones and

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.760 
once I plug up those other ones and
since<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.330> engine<00:03:21.780> since<00:03:22.319> the<00:03:22.410> vehicle<00:03:22.680> will

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
since the engine since the vehicle will

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.100 
since the engine since the vehicle will
be<00:03:22.800> traveling<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.459> way<00:03:23.700> there<00:03:24.690> will<00:03:24.959> be

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
be traveling that way there will be

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:35.020 
be traveling that way there will be
blowing<00:03:25.739> into<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:29.270> there<00:03:30.270> will<00:03:30.420> be<00:03:30.450> blowing<00:03:30.810> in

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.839 

ok<00:03:36.030> now<00:03:36.330> I<00:03:36.360> just<00:03:36.599> took<00:03:36.750> off<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.290> bolts<00:03:37.849> took

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
ok now I just took off the bolts took

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.910 
ok now I just took off the bolts took
out<00:03:38.970> this<00:03:39.120> one<00:03:39.360> bolt<00:03:39.930> took<00:03:40.440> out<00:03:40.560> these<00:03:40.680> two

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
out this one bolt took out these two

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.589 
out this one bolt took out these two
little<00:03:41.220> screws<00:03:41.459> right<00:03:41.640> here<00:03:41.700> that<00:03:42.090> hold<00:03:42.360> this

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
little screws right here that hold this

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.350 
little screws right here that hold this
contained<00:03:43.170> this<00:03:43.440> section<00:03:43.890> here<00:03:44.160> on<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:45.269> the

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
contained this section here on to the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.070 
contained this section here on to the
carburetor<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:46.550> then<00:03:47.720> it'll<00:03:48.720> be<00:03:48.780> time<00:03:49.019> to

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
carburetor and then it'll be time to

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.539 
carburetor and then it'll be time to
plug<00:03:49.440> up<00:03:49.470> that<00:03:49.860> hole<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:52.290> hole

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.069 

okay<00:03:55.549> so<00:03:55.969> what<00:03:56.090> I'm<00:03:56.180> going<00:03:56.299> to<00:03:56.359> do<00:03:56.480> here<00:03:56.510> to

okay so what I'm going to do here to

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.770 
okay so what I'm going to do here to
plug<00:03:57.290> up<00:03:57.379> these<00:03:57.530> holes<00:03:58.209> is<00:03:59.209> that<00:03:59.389> cut<00:03:59.599> some

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
plug up these holes is that cut some

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:11.750 
plug up these holes is that cut some
more<00:03:59.900> of<00:04:00.049> that<00:04:00.579> tubing

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.969 

got<00:04:12.420> a<00:04:12.450> heating<00:04:12.810> gun<00:04:13.340> right<00:04:14.340> here<00:04:15.139> he<00:04:16.139> hit<00:04:16.769> glue

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
got a heating gun right here he hit glue

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:28.030 
got a heating gun right here he hit glue
gun<00:04:17.220> yeah<00:04:20.359> i'm<00:04:21.359> going<00:04:21.600> to<00:04:21.660> coil<00:04:22.049> this<00:04:22.320> up

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040

simply<00:06:51.810> rear<00:06:52.050> out<00:06:52.230> the<00:06:52.410> air<00:06:52.590> coming<00:06:53.010> from<00:06:53.100> a

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 
simply rear out the air coming from a

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.730 
simply rear out the air coming from a
different<00:06:53.580> location<00:06:53.990> this<00:06:54.990> is<00:06:55.170> it<00:06:55.320> since<00:06:55.620> this

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 
different location this is it since this

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.770 
different location this is it since this
is<00:06:55.860> going<00:06:55.980> to<00:06:56.040> be<00:06:56.130> the<00:06:56.250> front<00:06:56.490> of<00:06:56.670> the<00:06:56.820> bike<00:06:57.450> or

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 
is going to be the front of the bike or

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.140 
is going to be the front of the bike or
front<00:06:58.500> of<00:06:58.590> the<00:06:58.680> trike<00:06:59.040> the<00:06:59.700> air<00:06:59.880> will<00:07:00.060> be

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.150 
front of the trike the air will be

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.290 
front of the trike the air will be
flowing<00:07:00.390> into<00:07:00.690> that<00:07:00.960> into<00:07:01.410> those<00:07:01.530> ports<00:07:01.860> I

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:02.300 
flowing into that into those ports I

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.120 
flowing into that into those ports I
think<00:07:03.300> I<00:07:03.390> might<00:07:03.720> put<00:07:04.020> some<00:07:04.170> type<00:07:04.350> of<00:07:04.380> screen<00:07:04.890> or

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130 
think I might put some type of screen or

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.620 
think I might put some type of screen or
something<00:07:05.400> over<00:07:05.490> that<00:07:05.580> just<00:07:05.880> to<00:07:06.000> avoid<00:07:06.090> bugs

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630 
something over that just to avoid bugs

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.500 
something over that just to avoid bugs
