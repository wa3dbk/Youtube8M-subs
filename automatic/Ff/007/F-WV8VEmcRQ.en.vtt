them we'll start out with death knight

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.060 
them we'll start out with death knight
one<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.910> three<00:00:36.270> new<00:00:36.530> talents<00:00:37.530> there<00:00:37.770> they

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
one of the three new talents there they

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.459 
one of the three new talents there they
will<00:00:38.219> be<00:00:38.430> able<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.120> receive<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.780> necrotic

will be able to receive is necrotic

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.910 
will be able to receive is necrotic
plague<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> passive<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.920> powerful

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
plague and is a passive a powerful

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.520 
plague and is a passive a powerful
disease<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.640> deals<00:00:44.850> 100<00:00:45.539> damage<00:00:45.750> per<00:00:46.170> stack

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
disease that deals 100 damage per stack

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.610 
disease that deals 100 damage per stack
every<00:00:47.100> three<00:00:47.370> seconds<00:00:47.789> for<00:00:48.000> 30<00:00:48.180> seconds<00:00:48.660> each

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
every three seconds for 30 seconds each

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.950 
every three seconds for 30 seconds each
time<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.160> deals<00:00:50.370> damage<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:51.059> gains<00:00:51.300> one<00:00:51.629> stack

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
time it deals damage it gains one stack

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.400 
time it deals damage it gains one stack
and<00:00:52.289> jumps<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.980> another<00:00:53.219> nearby<00:00:53.430> enemy<00:00:53.969> if

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
and jumps to another nearby enemy if

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.139 
and jumps to another nearby enemy if
possible<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:56.219> cannot<00:00:56.670> spread<00:00:57.149> by<00:00:57.449> pestilence

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
possible it cannot spread by pestilence

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.900 
possible it cannot spread by pestilence
so<00:01:00.149> it's<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.390> self<00:01:00.629> spreading<00:01:01.020> disease<00:01:01.910> good

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
so it's a self spreading disease good

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.420 
so it's a self spreading disease good
for<00:01:03.090> AOE<00:01:03.329> packs<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.870> would<00:01:04.019> assume<00:01:04.430> another
