00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
wheel on the stock of a steering wheel I

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.350 
wheel on the stock of a steering wheel I
push<00:05:35.520> and<00:05:35.669> hold<00:05:35.880> it<00:05:36.150> resets<00:05:36.510> the<00:05:36.660> zero<00:05:38.360> go

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
push and hold it resets the zero go

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.040 
push and hold it resets the zero go
through<00:05:39.600> again

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
through again

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.020 
through again
see<00:05:40.800> it's<00:05:40.979> estimated<00:05:41.760> range<00:05:41.970> right<00:05:42.210> now<00:05:42.289> and

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
see it's estimated range right now and

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:51.909 
see it's estimated range right now and
then<00:05:45.030> back<00:05:45.180> to<00:05:45.330> odometer

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.469
