00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.500
 it's a traditional pizzeria that they make 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.720
 very good pizzas in the wood oven nothing 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.320

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:45.120

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.640

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.860
 answering and encouraged us guys who did not 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.409
 be ashamed whenever you are 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.510
 outside in a restaurant in a bar 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:57.790
 ask the following that contains the 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.680
 food because it's one thing that you have 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.690
 to say if you are ashamed to 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.570
 ask this because you forget about it 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.040
 espn from anything apologize me 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.170
 could you say if he's so kind 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.610
 customers who has the pizza the grams 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.610
 a bit above if you do not know 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:23.200
 it's worth a little bit above the mass 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:27.039
 more or less are 240 250 grams of dough 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.789
 tomato sauce with a tablespoon 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:34.780
 that are roughly 50 grams will be assembled 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:37.329
 in Florence forget about 80 80 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.819
 grams did not have any problem with that 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.130
 will tax them and then they mentioned 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.500
 the masses with the sourdough that they use 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.120
 for pizzas thing that if there had not 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.750
 asked never would have seen 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.750
 now that he is very young 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.689
 good guys you see is nothing 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:58.140
 difficult to ask you have to have 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.689
 shame right now there are a thousand 875 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.360
 calories to eat so this pizza 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.700
 I can be assured very good is the 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.429
 pizza and how I live do not have 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.500
 shame for nothing the limitations we 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.460
 we put them each one 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.120
 is where you want as I say 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:20.080
 I love eating that fresh food 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:24.160
 even if it's pizza, the truth is that 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.910
 fresh cheese fresh tomato mass the 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.340
 ham all 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.340
 very high nutritional value 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.270
 here in the port of ibiza as they can and 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:44.420
 I am realizing that there is nobody who 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:46.040
 is walking and running incredible I have 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.560
 the impression that they have to be 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.010
 aligned stars that we have to 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.099
 have time to feel like 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.840
 feel our energy I do not know that everything 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.319
 it has to be perfectly organized 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.930
 and in its perfect conditions for 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.269
 to be able to do what we want is not about 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.890
 of software you have to do what you 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.799
 you have to do regardless of 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.930
 what others do than what happens and 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.090
 around you it's worth that we really 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.370
 we limit ourselves thinking of 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.440
 this 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.799
 because we have to depend on things 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.200
 external to progress do not get 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.569
 limitations and you're going to train yourself 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.230
 well this is wrong that you are going to run on gas 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.230
 or the rain 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:39.329
 because it is what I remember of the 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:41.690
 Interview with Carmen PeÃ±alver is this 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.690
