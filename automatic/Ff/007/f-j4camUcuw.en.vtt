00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
was like a rough but I don't know what's

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.339 
was like a rough but I don't know what's
coming<00:00:26.580> on<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:26.939> was<00:00:27.210> there<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.840> whole<00:00:28.080> game

coming on it was there the whole game

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.470 
coming on it was there the whole game
pretty<00:00:28.650> much<00:00:28.830> or<00:00:29.519> okay<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.090> don't<00:00:30.240> know<00:00:30.390> what

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
pretty much or okay I don't know what

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.299 
pretty much or okay I don't know what
I'm<00:00:30.539> saying<00:00:30.810> it's<00:00:31.260> starting<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:31.769> round<00:00:31.949> 36

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
I'm saying it's starting on round 36

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.490 
I'm saying it's starting on round 36
right<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.510> disappeared<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:33.960> around<00:00:34.140> 38

right and it disappeared on around 38
and<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.309> thought<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.700> would<00:00:35.760> come<00:00:35.940> back<00:00:35.969> but<00:00:36.570> it

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.920 
and I thought it would come back but it
never<00:00:37.170> did<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.700> so<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:38.910> video<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.600> will

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
time i play and i think that's pretty

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.150 
time i play and i think that's pretty
good

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
good

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.250 
good
i<00:00:56.190> don't<00:00:56.640> know<00:00:56.730> what<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.149> guys<00:00:57.300> consider
