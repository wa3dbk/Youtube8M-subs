00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
and the sort of home screen for the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.399 
and the sort of home screen for the
iPhone<00:01:35.759> because<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.810> really<00:01:37.110> hasn't

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
iPhone because that really hasn't

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.090 
iPhone because that really hasn't
changed<00:01:37.920> since<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.220> first<00:01:38.400> came<00:01:38.579> out<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:40.100> with

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
changed since it first came out and with

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.280 
changed since it first came out and with
the<00:01:41.189> iPad<00:01:41.610> just<00:01:41.880> coming<00:01:42.180> out<00:01:42.299> being<00:01:42.869> able<00:01:43.200> to

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
the iPad just coming out being able to

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.800 
the iPad just coming out being able to
sort<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.590> change<00:01:43.920> your<00:01:44.159> background<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:45.030> do

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
sort of change your background and do

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
all that stuff on it um I think the

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.330 
all that stuff on it um I think the
iphone<00:01:49.079> sort<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.409> might<00:01:49.530> take<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> leap<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.189> that

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
iphone sort of might take a leap in that

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.950 
iphone sort of might take a leap in that
direction<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.939> Apple<00:01:51.390> has<00:01:51.570> seen<00:01:51.780> how

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
direction this Apple has seen how

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.230 
direction this Apple has seen how
successful<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:53.159> iPad<00:01:53.520> spin<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:53.970> people

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
successful the iPad spin and people

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.819 
successful the iPad spin and people
really<00:01:54.329> like<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.810> feature<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.290> customize

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
really like that feature to customize

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.109 
really like that feature to customize
their<00:01:56.579> background<00:01:57.540> in<00:01:57.719> home<00:01:58.079> screen<00:01:59.060> um<00:02:00.060> I

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
their background in home screen um I

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.929 
their background in home screen um I
think<00:02:00.689> that's<00:02:01.049> pretty<00:02:01.380> much<00:02:01.649> sort<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.579> that

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
think that's pretty much sort of it that

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.730 
think that's pretty much sort of it that
we<00:02:03.030> can<00:02:03.210> expect<00:02:03.540> from<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.439> will<00:02:04.560> probably

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
we can expect from it it will probably

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.249 
we can expect from it it will probably
be<00:02:04.860> for<00:02:05.130> ipod<00:02:05.460> touch<00:02:05.729> as<00:02:05.939> well<00:02:06.119> because<00:02:06.899> that's

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
be for ipod touch as well because that's

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.540 
be for ipod touch as well because that's
sort<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.649> what<00:02:07.770> they've<00:02:07.920> done<00:02:08.099> with<00:02:08.160> all<00:02:08.429> their

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
sort of what they've done with all their

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.249 
sort of what they've done with all their
updates<00:02:08.970> except<00:02:09.509> i<00:02:09.599> believe<00:02:09.840> what<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.080> last

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
updates except i believe what the last

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.440 
updates except i believe what the last
one<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.530> had<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.890> pay<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.670> get<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.060> ipod<00:02:12.390> touch

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
one you had to pay to get the ipod touch
