00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.320
 now we are going to all of you as you are 

00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:05.750
 today I bring you the masters and students 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.780
 for call for the season in number 4 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.520
 to cali as you know is this character 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.980
 that does a lot of damage when it swells 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.200
 has a lot of ways to escape with 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.000
 that puddle that makes invisible and in itself is 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.670
 a very good character I recommend it 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.530
 a lot so we're not going to start a 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.780
 As you can see, we are going to put 21 of 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.460
 attack 9 in defense as always I was going to 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.380
 be a little weird, now you will see 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.060
 I will explain everything we are going to put a point in 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.530
 butcher were points in witchcraft there 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.390
 a point in the feast because we're going to 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.660
 do this because when it comes to training 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.550
 the lime and being to me is doing very well 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.230
 at the time of forming we can recover a 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.520
 little bit of life since we are in a mole 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.310
 in mid especially if we are in mid 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.510
 we are going to suffer a lot from the enemy already 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.460
 that is going to hit us from far away is going to 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.680
 destroy then if we go 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.360
 to approach farmar at least when 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.770
 we tied that bug so at least 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.450
 recover a little bit of that life that we 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.130
 have done damage that has been done 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.770
 equal enemy for this so they will not be 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.770
 less damage and much better for us 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.690
 here we will do more damage the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.480
 I bomb the children therefore 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.030
 we can kill him with more ease and so 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.940
 so much we can form better we are going to 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.080
 increase mana cap as pea 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.400
 here and even if he has a skill that 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.680
 It is also that at the time of me 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.619
 I recommend maksar the ape since he cares for her 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.690
 ere is what is going to be taken out and 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.330
 based entirely on ap we're going to 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.210
 continue here to kill people but 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.160
 super fast is archived for more ap-1 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.940
 arcane blade 35 for devastating and one 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.930
 is worth it because we have skipped this 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.720
 this what it does is that it heals us when 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.670
 we kill the enemy, I prefer 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.220
 do more damage with arcane blade me 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.560
 I prefer sacrificed to cure me 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.230
 do more damage by being bases of 5 to 1 and 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.300
 therefore jumping to the brim and destroying it 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.590
 I always recommend is that you may be 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.570
 this time I will recommend that you go up 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.490
 is apart from the usual that comes to 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.170
 be this life a little more the armor 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.000
 because I recommend this instead of this 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.160
 as I said when doing a character love 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.550
 you will suffer much more in levels 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.320
 low therefore this nothing that we can 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.880
 have more support online this is going to 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.820
 make them simply make us less 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.470
 damage but in your online this will make us 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.790
 that we can register more time online 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.710
 we can recover more life and so not 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.360
 suffer so much in line with the low life 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.520
 so nothing is to cali as always 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.230
 down left and nothing runes 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.680
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.680
 until next time
