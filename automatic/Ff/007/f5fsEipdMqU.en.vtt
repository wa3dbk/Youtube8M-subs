00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
all right welcome to dart University

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.470 
all right welcome to dart University
we're<00:00:11.280> going<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.490> talk<00:00:11.580> about<00:00:11.610> lash<00:00:12.090> it's

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
we're going to talk about lash it's

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.299 
we're going to talk about lash it's
confusing<00:00:12.900> topic<00:00:13.170> there's<00:00:13.860> different<00:00:14.190> ways

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
confusing topic there's different ways

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.070 
confusing topic there's different ways
to<00:00:14.519> do<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:14.730> we're<00:00:15.330> going<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.509> show<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.750> two

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
to do it we're going to show you two

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.529 
to do it we're going to show you two
one's<00:00:17.070> going<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.340> be<00:00:17.490> from<00:00:17.699> mild<00:00:17.940> build<00:00:18.210> cams

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
one's going to be from mild build cams

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.540 
one's going to be from mild build cams
but<00:00:18.930> if<00:00:19.020> you've<00:00:19.109> got<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.289> roller<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.949> big<00:00:20.250> roller

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
but if you've got a roller a big roller

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.429 
but if you've got a roller a big roller
you<00:00:21.210> might<00:00:21.359> want<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.539> try<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.750> second<00:00:22.289> one

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
you might want to try the second one

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.840 
you might want to try the second one
it's<00:00:22.590> going<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.740> ensure<00:00:22.859> your<00:00:23.160> your<00:00:23.550> valves

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
it's going to ensure your your valves

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.700 
it's going to ensure your your valves
are<00:00:23.939> lashed<00:00:24.180> properly<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.410> we're<00:00:25.529> going<00:00:25.619> to

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
are lashed properly so we're going to

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.240 
are lashed properly so we're going to
get<00:00:25.800> TDC<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.670> cylinder<00:00:27.060> number<00:00:27.269> one<00:00:27.599> and

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
get TDC on the cylinder number one and

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.220 
get TDC on the cylinder number one and
yep<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.429> can<00:00:29.580> hear<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.029> compression<00:00:30.929> stroke

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
yep you can hear the compression stroke

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.160 
yep you can hear the compression stroke
there<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:32.340> we're<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.550> TDC<00:00:33.090> now<00:00:33.630> we<00:00:33.690> can<00:00:33.899> set

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
there so we're on TDC now we can set

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.400 
there so we're on TDC now we can set
both<00:00:34.380> lash<00:00:34.710> for<00:00:35.040> intake<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.730> exhaust<00:00:36.260> now<00:00:37.260> all

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
both lash for intake and exhaust now all

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.530 
both lash for intake and exhaust now all
we<00:00:37.500> got<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.649> do<00:00:37.860> once<00:00:38.160> we<00:00:38.309> set<00:00:38.520> our<00:00:38.610> lash<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:39.390> we

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
we got to do once we set our lash is we

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.479 
we got to do once we set our lash is we
can<00:00:39.660> go<00:00:39.750> into<00:00:39.870> firing<00:00:40.290> order<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.070> Chevy's

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
can go into firing order on the Chevy's

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.510 
can go into firing order on the Chevy's
one<00:00:41.940> eight<00:00:42.239> four<00:00:42.660> three<00:00:43.020> six<00:00:43.739> five<00:00:43.950> seven<00:00:44.219> two

one eight four three six five seven two

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.889 
one eight four three six five seven two
so<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.300> can<00:00:45.450> go<00:00:45.539> about<00:00:45.750> 90<00:00:46.079> degrees<00:00:46.579> and<00:00:47.629> I'll<00:00:48.629> be

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
so I can go about 90 degrees and I'll be

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.279 
so I can go about 90 degrees and I'll be
TDC<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:50.280> number<00:00:50.610> eight<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.719> come<00:00:51.989> up<00:00:52.050> here<00:00:52.170> at

is set right I can lock it down now if

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.340 
is set right I can lock it down now if
I'm<00:01:14.460> doing<00:01:14.670> mechanical<00:01:14.939> lash<00:01:15.420> well<00:01:16.140> I'm<00:01:16.259> gonna

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
I'm doing mechanical lash well I'm gonna

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.020 
I'm doing mechanical lash well I'm gonna
get<00:01:16.500> my<00:01:16.619> feeler<00:01:16.860> gauge<00:01:17.189> out<00:01:17.460> I'm<00:01:17.670> going<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.880> set

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
get my feeler gauge out I'm going to set

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.850 
get my feeler gauge out I'm going to set
it<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.150> spec<00:01:18.570> ideally<00:01:19.380> you're<00:01:19.500> gonna<00:01:19.590> do<00:01:19.770> it

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
it to spec ideally you're gonna do it

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.620 
it to spec ideally you're gonna do it
hot<00:01:20.070> cold<00:01:20.729> you'd<00:01:20.970> set<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.299> little<00:01:21.330> bit

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
hot cold you'd set it a little bit

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.060 
hot cold you'd set it a little bit
different<00:01:21.960> maybe<00:01:22.020> go<00:01:22.259> back<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.619> adjust<00:01:22.680> it

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
different maybe go back and adjust it

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.920 
different maybe go back and adjust it
once<00:01:23.250> we're<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.700> now<00:01:24.299> that's<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.689> easy

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
once we're on it now that's the easy

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.350 
once we're on it now that's the easy
method<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.100> do<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> whole<00:01:26.670> cylinder<00:01:27.119> at<00:01:27.330> a

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
method so I can do a whole cylinder at a

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.350 
method so I can do a whole cylinder at a
time<00:01:27.630> now<00:01:28.380> I've<00:01:28.829> got<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> big<00:01:29.280> duration<00:01:29.729> cam<00:01:30.000> I

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
time now I've got a big duration cam I

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.999 
time now I've got a big duration cam I
gotta<00:01:30.630> make<00:01:30.810> sure<00:01:30.869> I'm<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.170> my<00:01:31.320> base<00:01:31.560> circle

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
gotta make sure I'm on my base circle

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.819 
gotta make sure I'm on my base circle
these<00:01:32.549> big<00:01:32.850> specially<00:01:33.420> roller<00:01:33.630> cams<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.350> base

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
these big specially roller cams the base

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.350 
these big specially roller cams the base
circle<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.280> actually<00:01:35.610> pretty<00:01:35.820> small<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.270> I

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
circle is actually pretty small and I

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.390 
circle is actually pretty small and I
might<00:01:36.509> have<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.659> ramp<00:01:37.049> leading<00:01:37.860> into<00:01:38.040> my<00:01:38.189> big

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
might have a ramp leading into my big

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.910 
might have a ramp leading into my big
lift<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.299> what<00:01:39.450> we're<00:01:39.540> going<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.689> do<00:01:39.960> we'll

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
lift so what we're going to do we'll

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.679 
lift so what we're going to do we'll
come<00:01:41.130> back<00:01:41.340> here<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.240> number<00:01:42.509> one

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
come back here is the number one

exhaust just starts to go down now I'm
on<00:01:49.380> my<00:01:49.409> base<00:01:49.619> circle<00:01:49.979> for<00:01:50.100> my<00:01:50.189> into

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
on my base circle for my into

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.100 
on my base circle for my into
so<00:01:51.130> I<00:01:51.159> can<00:01:51.310> set<00:01:51.520> this<00:01:51.700> one<00:01:51.909> well<00:01:52.690> I<00:01:52.869> can<00:01:53.049> go

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
so I can set this one well I can go

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.420 
so I can set this one well I can go
through<00:01:53.260> my<00:01:53.290> firing<00:01:53.740> order<00:01:53.950> again<00:01:54.220> I'm<00:01:54.340> not
