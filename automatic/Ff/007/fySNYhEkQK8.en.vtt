00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.440
 There are three turns when cornering 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.410
 lay styles back and henning on two 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.560
 of which are roadworthy because of it 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.570
 suppress 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.760
 the laying is about the fact that the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.560
 inclination of the machine and the inclination of the machine 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.250
 upper body of the driver pretty much 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.050
 are identical 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.120
 only the head is out of inclination 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.070
 taken out when pressing it is like that 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.140
 that the machine is pressed into it 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.030
 and the upper body is in proportion to 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.950
 street emergency the question is natural 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.980
 then i need the two curves 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.780
 press place and place so is is 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.089
 usually required if I am 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.790
 long country road courses drive 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.430
 and press when I bend tight pointed 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.110
 or so around and very close to the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.250
 turn around then I press the 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.250
 machine into the bend 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.920
 so again, both the curves still 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.079
 press as well as shut down the curves 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.619
 are suitable for a circle too 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.409
 drive 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.960
 which variant you should choose depends 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.170
 much of the twisted curve radius 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.009
 at bridges he is too small at radii 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.110
 to prefer 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.390
 For this reason, this is suitable 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.450
 Curve technology is also very good 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.310
 for close turning maneuvers such as those of 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.310
 knows so-called sharp sweeps 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.210
 when pressing so behaves the 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.640
 upper body in relation to the street almost 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.340
 plumb only the machine is deep in 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.500
 the curve pressed in so far that 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:02:01.070
 the inside of the bend almost through the 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:04.970
 route is the side stand at the bottom of the 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:11.390
 come up and christian you have to 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:13.640
 you look more, yes the head is 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.320
 so strong turned to the inside of the curve 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.770
 to look over his own shoulder 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.959
 can 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.450
 the feet are the same as always 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.490
 Fussballen on the footrests because 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.459
 inside the curve presses the 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.990
 Footpegs down the buttocks can 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.870
 even from the usual middle 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.170
 seated position shifted to the outside 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.170
 become 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.050
 the curve style should be the 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.989
 tilt of the machine to be identical 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.970
 with the inclination of her upper body only 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.340
 Her head is just so that she is not 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.920
 Distorted image perceiving your surroundings 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.230
 Here, too, the inside of the curve should be 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.720
 Press the footrest harder 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.940
 Turn your head so far that you 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.849
 the road course already visually ahead 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.720
 take a circle that can be a half 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.720
 its circular length 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.170
 also heard in the driving license exam 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.510
 that circle to the 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.190
 exam tasks with a circle 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.430
 diameter of nine meters 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.650
 They should be second in the ranking about 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.900
 Drive 20 kilometers per hour 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.210
 You can do both the curves 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.490
 Press and stand with each other 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.590
 take turns and drive the price 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.870
 right and left 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.370
 probably you will realize that 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.110
 a direction as theirs 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.110
 chocolate side out
