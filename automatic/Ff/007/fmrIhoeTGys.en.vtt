00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
of think it's a little stupid because it

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.360 
of think it's a little stupid because it
looks<00:00:45.870> like<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.230> going<00:00:46.469> into<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.039> future

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
looks like it's going into the future

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.020 
looks like it's going into the future
and<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.539> really<00:00:48.899> don't<00:00:49.110> like<00:00:49.289> when<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.879> go<00:00:50.879> into

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
and I really don't like when you go into

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.600 
and I really don't like when you go into
the<00:00:51.239> future<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.590> really<00:00:52.800> can't<00:00:53.219> predict

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the future is you really can't predict

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.810 
the future is you really can't predict
it<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.840> actually<00:00:56.840> another<00:00:57.840> question<00:00:58.530> is

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820
