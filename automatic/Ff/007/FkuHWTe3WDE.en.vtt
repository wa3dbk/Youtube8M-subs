 his number and giving between and and to 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.690
 to continue on windows 7 is mine 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.760
 consciousness 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.150
 but you have to know the username is 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.980
 you debut it on the cd, do not fall, and 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.540
 a subscription fee for this video there 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:29.269
 you are and you enter with the cd is a little 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.170
 different song the procedure is you 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.850
 click on then have one on have again 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.500
 choose the partition that windows is on 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.019
 if not even number 1 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.700
 It's the windows of who knows 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.790
 when maybe this case really is a 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.440
 There you, then, click and enter. 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.230
 again to win for you and click 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.329
 in having the guard a little to give the name 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.880
 of the two user in case what I want is 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:55.790
 one so wise coast number 1 and 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:00.320
 to understand very practical and simple 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.239
 then you click on y flower again 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.450
 which will always be only one 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.310
 key in case here to continue you 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.329
 can call the user you want without 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.459
 no problem you can repeat 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.769
 break accounts you want without any 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.340
 problem is very simple and practical with 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:19.039
 this same test works for 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.200
 windows 8 so you can do this and 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:23.810
 also on windows 8 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.909
 just start is the dvd or cd with this 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.430
 download of this video and know the 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:32.030
 name of the user you want to break from 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:36.039
 bud for the cd wait a little bit and 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:38.960
 starts password break windows 8 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:41.659
 inside the windows 7 segment includes the 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.250
 part one click 1 and then I tried later 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:46.130
 with the partition that windows is on 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.490
 case to 1 and enter again for this 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.200
 example and windows is on partition one is 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.720
 you wait a little longer on the list of 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.180
 users of that machine for you 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.720
 there you will have a number you choose to 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:02.510
 enter the school again the idea of 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.000
 number invite then a patient is 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.229
 you break being the one in the one with 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.610
 that user 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.500
 only that this technique has a detail 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.490
 staff does not work when you associate 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.349
 your online account with windows and create 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.510
 an online password in which case there 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.590
 works that way to understand that 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.110
 You will not break a hundred or 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.909
 simply because you associate the 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.260
 hotmail agreement or account 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:27.110
 computer is no different than 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.060
 procedure is now for you as 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.860
 protect your pendrive or as a ball 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.340
 of virus that transforms part has shortcut 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.890
 or takes care of your external USB drive or hdd 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.510

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.090
 shown you can download it from the 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.159
 video description ok 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.320
 the singing of the mouse edit you see the 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:47.479
 and may be foaming on the cmt 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.750
 also if you want so you prefer 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:53.960
 below you decorate this command is the ac 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:56.539
 to enter the cm of taheri on your computer 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.550
 and enter the drive letter 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:01.039
 corresponding to a pen drive in the case of 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.289
 itf that is two point your external hd 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:05.599
 edit that lippi command that works 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:08.690
 it is also at your discretion and 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:10.099
 first command and the tribe by dash 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.930
 it may be more but you keep 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:13.909
 downloads and file from your flash drive 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.710
 infected hd coop in there and 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:17.840
 run as administrator 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.060
 if normal running does not work as 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.770
 without being as administrator wanted to do 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.510
 check and return to take a 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.969
 virus that has the effect that the virus 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.860
 transforms from the shortcut 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:29.889
 worship your files and show all 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.989
 Leave everything 100% right there ready 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:34.809
 Calm down, you already have the pen drive. 

00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:36.429
 or external hd is very practical 

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:38.649
 now let's have a more technical 

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:40.269
 advanced because the virus enters will enter 

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:42.129
 can enter again and then how 

00:06:40.269 --> 00:06:43.089
 makes to permanently block to not 

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:45.279
 enter one more 

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:48.939
 this program so here too 

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:50.889
 first you format it is in etfs 

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:52.629
 the program works as in tfsi inter 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:55.209
 only accepts hds and pen drive with 

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:57.069
 second lieutenant in tfs is you download the 

00:06:55.209 --> 00:07:01.449
 program in the niche description between 1 and 

00:06:57.069 --> 00:07:03.219
 It's the pen drive for you, and we 're going to do it. 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:05.619
 test that negotiate the program 

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:08.110
 - is there it just gets me only have the 

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:09.939
 option only has but you can put the 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.649
 hold neighborhoods check this option if 

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:12.279
 Leave me alone I'll show you only the pen 

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:14.079
 drive 

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:15.459
 I 'll show you that it's not just letter f 

00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:17.110
 what is a pen drive 

00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:19.959
 but removing this option shows the hds 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:23.709
 It's you too, click Block more 

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:25.989
 create a folder your ninth man for you 

00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:29.349
 or whatever name you want a folder and 

00:07:25.989 --> 00:07:31.449
 click on block why is it that people 

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:34.659
 doing this by creating a peace that 

00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:37.300
 everything will be played within that folder O 

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:39.999
 I can not copy anything else anymore 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:42.369
 just sit inside the folder and copy the 

00:07:39.999 --> 00:07:44.379
 file into it will work 

00:07:42.369 --> 00:07:46.329
 understood what he was doing and protects 

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:48.999
 the root of the pendrive then has no way to 

00:07:46.329 --> 00:07:51.550
 virus come in understood then it gets very 

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:52.869
 the more practical you copy into the 

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.599
 law can block is very easy enough 

00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:57.219
 selecting the letter and unlocking it is very
