00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.000
 hello dear hungry today is baked 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.140
 and it should be a Russian 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 to be cake 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.520
 this one is for his ingredients he 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.200
 in a little heavier curves so not 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.450
 absolutely suitable for losing weight 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.430
 and around this state counter 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.320
 and at the same time something else 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.809
 He will join in the summer 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.850
 sour cherries I think that's prepared 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.440
 a delicious combination and hope you 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:44.019
 it works the same way we need it quark 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:46.070
 sugar cocoa powder eggs flour 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.780
 sour cherries and that can be fresh 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.720
 or be drained of glass 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.830
 Custard became my cooking 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.949
 Sugar baking powder and butter in one 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:00.320
 bowl we give flour baking powder and 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.629
 sugar mix everything and then give 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.630
 one egg and half a piece of soft 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.909
 Add butter to finish this 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.130
 cacau was about it and with that 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.540
 kneading the hearing aid all to one 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.549
 crumble dough 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.770
 Incidentally, Russian ginger could 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.840
 be prepared with shortcrust the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.960
 So would be the alternative variant I 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.450
 However, I have decided understand 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.370
 in a thoroughly greased springform 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.040
 here one with 26 centimeters diameter 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.370
 Let us now give two- thirds of the strike 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.960
 distribute this evenly and press 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:38.020
 then follow him on the ground of the bug 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.020
 firm and press a run 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.100
 in a bowl we give 750 grams 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:53.030
 quark one piece of soft butter 120 grams 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:57.230
 sugar 3 1 packet of vanilla sugar and 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.360
 then add the pudding powder 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.210
 However, this time with the hearing aid 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.410
 whisk everything to a nice one 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.410
 mix creamy mass 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.900
 then the sour cherries to 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.900
 give and fold this 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.910
 We now give this mass to the 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.910
 prepared bottom of the cake 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:34.720
 and smooth them out now we come 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.159
 the remaining third of the strike 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.120
 now on the surface of the quark mass 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.040
 is distributed 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.319
 It is up to you whether you 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.959
 like I cover everything here 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.640
 spread or you prefer larger bouquets 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.950
 so that goes on 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.560
 Surface mixed bright and at the end 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.629
 looks dark and when done 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.159
 Let's put the cake in the oven 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:03:00.940
 and at 180 degrees air circulation 160 degrees 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:03.700
 for 45 to 50 minutes and counter 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.230
 end of the rod tubes of the effort 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.000
 for preparing this cake 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.639
 really borders and he tastes good 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.900
 Really delicious by the way only on the edge 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:13.090
 but because he has already asked several times 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.310
 was this black china what you 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.239
 See here is old english 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.239
 porcelain 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.530
 i like that very much back to the cake me 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.480
 I wish you much fun in the 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.799
 preparation and quite good appetite 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.449
 but if you are something completely different 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.280
 maybe a giant wants to bake 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:33.129
 Cupcake or the beginning of the new one 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.930
 bundesliga season a soccer toto then 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.669
 just take a look at these videos 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.079
 in 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:41.400
 remains to be said until the next 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.400
