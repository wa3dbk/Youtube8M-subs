00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
stuff now I know why I hated Qbert in

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.400 
stuff now I know why I hated Qbert in
the<00:01:11.430> arcades<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.090> more<00:01:12.960> or<00:01:13.050> less<00:01:13.080> than<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
the arcades and more or less than the

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.109 
the arcades and more or less than the
home<00:01:13.560> system<00:01:13.920> too<00:01:14.070> because<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.729> controls

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
home system too because the controls

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.940 
home system too because the controls
were<00:01:15.300> a<00:01:15.330> little<00:01:15.690> bit<00:01:15.930> difficult<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.649> didn't

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
were a little bit difficult and didn't

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.889 
were a little bit difficult and didn't
feel<00:01:17.160> you<00:01:17.490> know<00:01:17.610> quite<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.300> intuitive

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
feel you know quite that intuitive

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:21.620 
feel you know quite that intuitive
because<00:01:19.500> you're<00:01:20.250> faced<00:01:20.610> with<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.820> joystick

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
because you're faced with a joystick

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.889 
because you're faced with a joystick
that<00:01:21.930> controls<00:01:23.479> basically<00:01:24.479> you're<00:01:24.660> used<00:01:24.840> to

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
that controls basically you're used to

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:26.180 
that controls basically you're used to
controlling<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> joystick<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:25.860> four

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
controlling a joystick in four

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.580 
controlling a joystick in four
directions<00:01:26.640> up<00:01:26.820> down<00:01:27.030> left<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.539> right<00:01:27.780> but

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
directions up down left and right but

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.340 
directions up down left and right but
Qbert<00:01:29.220> inverted<00:01:29.759> these<00:01:29.850> controls<00:01:30.330> 45<00:01:30.960> degrees

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
Qbert inverted these controls 45 degrees

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.060 
Qbert inverted these controls 45 degrees
and<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:33.479> your<00:01:33.810> first<00:01:34.020> instinct<00:01:34.560> was<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.830> press

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
and so your first instinct was to press

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.490 
and so your first instinct was to press
down<00:01:35.369> or<00:01:35.729> up<00:01:35.970> or<00:01:36.240> left<00:01:36.600> or<00:01:36.780> right<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
down or up or left or right on the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.789 
down or up or left or right on the
joystick<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.630> that<00:01:39.630> usually<00:01:40.170> caused<00:01:40.440> you<00:01:40.650> to

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
joystick and that usually caused you to

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.609 
joystick and that usually caused you to
go<00:01:40.950> off<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.880> side<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.479> pyramid<00:01:45.200> now<00:01:46.200> Qbert

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
go off the side of the pyramid now Qbert

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.219 
go off the side of the pyramid now Qbert
was<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> tremendous<00:01:47.430> hit<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.939> 1982<00:01:48.810> when<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.110> was
