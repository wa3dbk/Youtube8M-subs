00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hello everyone, today we will review the canon 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.240
 50 mm 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.240
 fast opening of the diaphragm 14 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.180
 here is the good old 50 mm of 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.310
 fano I say old because in production 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.830
 from 93 but still it still does 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.750
 respect very solid reconstruction 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.820
 maybe a little less focus than that 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.949
 however in compensation in modality of 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.109
 autofocus is really fast because 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.110
 moved by an sm while in mode 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.620
 manual maybe a little too slow a bit 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.660
 too long let's say it's composed of seven 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.870
 lenses divided into six groups, one of which 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:47.489
 spherical the diameter of the filter must 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.579
 be 58 mm and sorry at an angle of 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.399
 field of 46 degrees and a minimum distance 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.010
 of focusing of 45 centimeters however 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.100
 the highlight of the lens is the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.800
 diaphragm composed of eight slats e 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.589
 as a rapid maximum opening of 1 and 4 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.150
 this allows you to take pictures with 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.010
 less light but still have one 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.280
 photographic rendering or otherwise one 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.070
 greater definition of photographic performance 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.500
 really good though not being 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.509
 stabilized will give some trouble between 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.090
 quotation marks without a tripod either 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.009
 the photos that here for the videos in fact 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.070
 a photo of arm and took it by hand 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.229
 free in which we see that it has moved 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.439
 while this was taken with a 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.090
 easel and in short we appreciate the 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.280
 differences 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.650
 this instead is a video to make you 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.720
 understand the importance of a goal 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.170
 stabilized for video shooting by hand 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.280
 free and as you can see 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.350
 the lens absorbs all the vibrations 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.290
 of the hand and this affects the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.049
 images that are all wobbly though 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.479
 beyond this as can be seen from the 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.509
 photo the picture quality is 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.710
 really high even if the lights are not 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.869
 of the best 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.300
 then summarizing the aspects 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.240
 positive of this 50 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.400
 speed winds are his uniform of 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.460
 our focus is the diaphragm a in addition to the 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.200
 leather and with a maximum opening of 14 while 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.270
 the negative aspects are the fact of 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.700
 not be stabilized and set up 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.470
 fire not really solid the slowness of the 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.420
 I do not consider the manual focus at the end 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.150
 a very aspect in the climate as for 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.190
 sometimes it might even stop rosell and if 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.000
 think of both the negative and the negative aspects 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.370
 positives 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.380
 we can say that the 50 mm is 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.960
 really a nice object but anyway 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.580
 as always let me know your if 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.610
 you have what your experiences are 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.900
 and if you have any questions and ask them now 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.900
 it's all see you next time
