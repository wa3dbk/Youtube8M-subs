 see on the day will be just about all 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.429
 the two weeks so we already have 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.450
 does the mcg ediles the rainbow 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.160
 many things so today we 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.320
 let's go see waka waka and see him at 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.970
 the inverted ouakamois inverted stone so 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.949
 it is this very technical gesture very beautiful 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.300
 and we can do some I 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.869
 must 5 stars five stars as well 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.720
 obliged that's where I am with nÃ®mes 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.359
 a very fast player very really so 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.450
 if you start this technical gesture do 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.910
 do not take it to start because 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.290
 more as the gesture reminded is going to get 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.090
 do it more easily you will have a little 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.489
 more trouble to succeed well the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.809
 correctly as I do there the waka 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.750
 waka 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:48.329
 rather take ronaldinho or banjo so at 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.489
 what is the waka waka 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.800
 a little more to make a nice shot of 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.300
 things on the waka waka spilled and 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.579
 useful in match but we will see base 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.850
 so we will start you press the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.550
 touch 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.250
 she's showing you to you after my hands 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.840
 like young shoots and I can not 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.159
 do both at the same time once the 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.130
 judge her that I know few words 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.430
 finally I'm looking so we'll do like 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.590
 that's the normal waka waka it's this one 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.360
 so you spend with the jury tic you 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.920
 press your playstation 3 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.240
 excuse me xbox have not had the 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.610
 time to see how it was called 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.509
 you have to create 1 just like that for 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.119
 seal skin 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.500
 so you hold down the l2 key to 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.600
 playstation 3 who is doing the gestures 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.030
 techniques then you have one thing that 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.000
 bell that directional for you 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.110
 lead you know on May 3rd the right there 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.340
 will be 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.220
 finally to the technical gestures like you 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.620
 see the tac tac tac and so with the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.680
 joystick of technical gestures for 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.410
 playstation3 r3 you spend 3 hours 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.580
 on the clock in from three o'clock to noon 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.940
 in the opposite direction of the hands of a 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.229
 watch 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.840
 khattak and then you go with your 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.970
 left stick show split to the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.470
 left opting it's really a 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.510
 matter of timing first goudjo 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:06.619
 ronaldinho rats to start this will be 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:08.640
 simpler and so that's it's done 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.860
 as I told you now with the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.420
 So let's go for waka waka 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.250
 normal you see to tell normally 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.840
 behind you press the key she 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.890
 tock pain this one then there you are 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.950
 from three o'clock to noon what I wanted 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.120
 to say that's it I type like that in time 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.770
 I'm trying to see TV here it is 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.200
 you speak in a long time so you 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.040
 from there you will see very quickly 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.350
 tac brothers 12h03 o'clock noon ctaq 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.269
 allard and of course and at the same time you 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:46.260
 are lice on this stick to the left or 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:51.930
 it's gone and that's so l 2 3h 12h03 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:54.209
 noon hour and we now turn the 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.350
 waka waka inverted waka waka inversis 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.299
 so more useful for example you to 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.380
 the arrival of their match you go on 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.910
 one side the state you do other 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.209
 thing but that he missed it night by 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.600
 example 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.310
 finally waka waka the inverted la ctaq up 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.549
 oh well xd calais more after you 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.160
 do what you want so how 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:14.519
 I do the same as before you bring me 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.470
 l2 you do as before the end so 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.870
 three o'clock at noon 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.310
 tac and then is except that with you 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.480
 justin directional cause like that 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.600
 will not tell you in the place of the left 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.269
 you go right and it's still a 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.880
 timing issue 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.690
 this is tac then must well who pushes it 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.450
 pouffe 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.650
 otherwise it's not helpful in countering the 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.340
 eight you can charlie the guardian on 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.090
 will try come on so let's keep 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.090
 you see you do not have 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:49.050
 here you come you come too late go 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.940
 what do you do good so imagining the 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.800
 goaltender come I wanted a team 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.190
 easy you make your expectations and your 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.840
 voice that wasquehal then when I miss 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.190

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.220
 left on the left we try very 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.320
 beautiful guardian there he did not have 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.240
 for me the waka waka is rather 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.770
 something very pretty that when 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.080
 you really dominate a me you watch 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.450
 your superiority than anything else 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.650
 lie to you with the same emma and I hope 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.130
 you have the idea forget about them in 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.650

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.370
 tutorial it will be a headscarf and the 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.299
 ladle when is this a 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.270
