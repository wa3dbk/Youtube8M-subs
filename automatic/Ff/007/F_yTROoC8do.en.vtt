00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.170 
remember growing up watching those
movies<00:05:10.660> and<00:05:10.870> being<00:05:11.770> obsessed<00:05:12.430> with<00:05:12.550> them<00:05:12.850> and

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
movies and being obsessed with them and

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.690 
movies and being obsessed with them and
I<00:05:13.720> know<00:05:13.780> that<00:05:14.350> the<00:05:14.530> actors<00:05:14.860> are<00:05:15.130> a<00:05:15.160> lot<00:05:15.370> older

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
I know that the actors are a lot older

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.400 
I know that the actors are a lot older
now<00:05:15.729> so<00:05:15.880> it<00:05:16.240> would<00:05:16.330> be<00:05:16.450> a<00:05:16.479> lot<00:05:16.750> different<00:05:17.229> and

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
now so it would be a lot different and

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.320 
now so it would be a lot different and
they<00:05:17.500> probably<00:05:17.740> have<00:05:17.979> to<00:05:18.100> recasting<00:05:18.850> it<00:05:19.120> just

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
they probably have to recasting it just

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.880 
they probably have to recasting it just
wouldn't<00:05:19.630> be<00:05:19.750> as<00:05:19.870> good<00:05:20.050> as<00:05:20.200> the<00:05:20.350> original<00:05:20.380> ones

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
wouldn't be as good as the original ones

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.950 
wouldn't be as good as the original ones
but<00:05:21.220> if<00:05:21.340> somehow<00:05:21.640> we<00:05:22.120> could<00:05:22.300> go<00:05:22.450> back<00:05:22.720> into

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
but if somehow we could go back into

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.500 
but if somehow we could go back into
time<00:05:23.289> and<00:05:23.590> have<00:05:24.010> them<00:05:24.160> film<00:05:24.460> fourth

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
time and have them film fourth

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.060 
time and have them film fourth
