00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:03.629
 step by step towards the garden of their dreams 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.250
 take a step 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.160
 collects poverty if you like you can do that by taking a walk 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.590
 in the neighborhood and the talents 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.489
 but write proto buy everything you need to remember 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.099
 we are looking for their son kai in the neighborhood 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:28.429
 at the bookstore some magazines disagree so according to succeed 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.019
 standing there 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.820
 furthermore we have the line 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.290
 450 anyone can 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.730
 on a DVD 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.730
 You can also get a lot of inspiration from this 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.030
 tax 2 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.470
 I used cadastre drawing 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.220
 he usually received a land registry drawing when buying a house 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.450
 and of course still find that and then one of the parents goes 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.290
 this information is useful for creating a map 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.190
 you can do the best thing to do with it 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.070
 the land registry curriculum clock is not always one hundred percent full 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.790
 if you have no cadastre drawings 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.990
 you can still start wondering where your land register is 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.950
 make an inventory of what may remain 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.070
 once you have the floor plan it is best to check what is there 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.900
 may stay in the new garden 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.650
 then everyone's lunch and maybe some soil that I would like to keep 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.630
 you can do this on 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.969
 gaal him a map to count you can from the beginning take into account 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:43.260
 to hold 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.020
 make the map 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.760
 for damage 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.490
 make a map 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.749
 a new challenge to always work to scale 

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:54.960
 this is necessary to calculate the material costs 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.229
 en maarten is necessary for the construction of the course 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.890
 step 3 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.890
 the copies is from a map 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.080
 so he 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.629
 if it should go wrong 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:11.860
 that the bill 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.860
 and you were allowed to do it yourself 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.959
 the number of new homes I have on the kitchen 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.769
 It is very important that you look good this year 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:27.869
 just consider the garden well 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:30.869
 or not immediately rise in the right place 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.109
 for otherwise about vacation 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.319
 papers for computer 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.289
 it is still very easy for now 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:42.079
 once the object is there you cannot 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.199
 of course change 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:45.669
 so am i 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:48.729
 good after 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:51.729
 Skate the consultations with your family and last 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.769
 discuss where your customers want to move with your family 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.389
 if you have children he therefore count 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.189
 with a little odd 5 and why 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:03.569
 as a prof 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.269
 the hour a small children to the moon 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.139
 this can lead to dangerous situations 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.079
 you need to know and want again 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.979
 play children's attitude of both teams 

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:16.069
 a healthy one 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.870
 are always a sandbox 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:18.809
 welcome 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:22.849
 if your family agrees with the skate you may want to go 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.359
 walk the dealer 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.349
 you should do this especially if a tree might take away a wild lazar 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.369
 lawsuits 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:33.779
 when my father starts docking 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:35.969
 that will cause inconvenience 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:37.889
 although this is natural beauty 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:38.979
 is beautiful 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:40.250
 can viewers 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.630
 and water fountains but make some noise 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:47.709
 we will continue until 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.709
 you are satisfied with the result 

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:53.799
 step 4 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.139
 but after that he should have designed 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.409
 place all objects scaling the drawing 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:02.409
 you can do this on the pier or with a drawing program 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.000
 when it's done make a copy 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.130
 van duijn subject so that you can start with the planting plan 

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:13.049
 that move 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.090
 the disadvantage of a planting plan 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.999
 somewhat divided 

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:22.239
 The first thing he is going to do is make a list of the plant that is beautiful 

00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:23.129
 finds 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:26.099
 cares according to the inflorescence 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.050
 and flourish 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.409
 so is one 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:32.569
 always take into account the requirement of their plan 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:37.389
 the unit wants the sun and the other is not in the shade 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.610
 So at least it is very important that you review this topic 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.840
 theo attention focused 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.800
 plantum are not cheap 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.150
 a shame if you buy plants 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.610
 let them die or not 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.879
 want to bloom well 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:57.009
 the purpose is 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.090
 if must get design 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.270
 and the mcclaren planting plan gives you can we now think this 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.830
 as handy as as smoothly as possible 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.550
 we have to lay 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.740
 usually do the first 9 teylings to trade 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.860
 everything that can be stored can enter the container 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.020
 customers who do not want to keep there we can now maybe have to spend on expensive ones 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.659
 still girlfriend 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:21.569
 afterwards 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:24.990
 galema construct all the dead materials 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.680
 the street work big parties 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.689
 and the fence 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:35.069
 possibly engine can and so on when that is ready then the poor 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:38.809
 grounds work with compost and the proton plants 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:41.729
 finally a case that 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.039
 the grass he consults the turf 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:48.650
 red always a nice thing to do it is common 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.180
 because no agreements are made 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.949
 The consequence of this is that I can at least get the pill and 3 the relationship with the 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:58.869
 neighbors 

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:03.729
 it is mainly about noise nuisance and picking up dead materials 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:05.900
 some support 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.460
 what a service official bystanders may experience 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:14.669
 my parents' fireworks team by gerwen 

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:18.629
 coming is going to be a few chances of placement later 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.619
 you probably have it canceled 

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:23.820
 their product 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.339
 on time 

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:30.559
 the rules are different per municipality so it is best to contact your 

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:32.389
 Township 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:35.699
 do mladic with such activities 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:40.199
 street work in addition is place in a horse is building santa 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:42.869
 specialized work 

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:44.450
 juventus super 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:45.970
 can do it yourself 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.840
 but it became a professional company so in most cases 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.909
 do it faster than now 

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:55.909
 they have to deal with that every day 

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:00.259
 also have all the tools at home 

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:04.550
 the costs of having that done 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.400
 his duties are considerable 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.670
 but it succeeds for years in pleasure 

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:14.430
 especially street work is a handyman that can do better by doing one 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.430
 road worker or landscaping company 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.629
 step 7 

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:24.580
 How can you start realizing a pair of pliers if you advance well 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.129
 has thought about all steps 

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:29.479
 I cannot do much with that company 

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:31.849
 going wrong 

00:07:31.849 --> 00:07:33.909
 and the final step 

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:36.909
 is of course that you should enjoy your garden 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.520
