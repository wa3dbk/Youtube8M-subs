see<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:46.250> but<00:00:47.250> that's<00:00:48.090> how<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:49.070> do<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.309> sort<00:00:50.820> of

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
see this but that's how I do it sort of

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.270 
see this but that's how I do it sort of
with<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.170> chords<00:00:55.170> written<00:00:55.320> above<00:00:55.770> where<00:00:56.100> the

with the chords written above where the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.420 
with the chords written above where the
words<00:00:56.640> change<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.420> if<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.440> do<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.739> same<00:00:58.949> sort

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
words change so if you do the same sort

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.490 
words change so if you do the same sort
of<00:00:59.460> thing<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.940> will<00:01:00.000> be<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.719> much<00:01:00.930> easier

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.630 

okay<00:04:01.390> that's<00:04:01.959> how<00:04:02.080> I<00:04:02.200> play<00:04:02.439> I<00:04:02.620> know<00:04:02.680> that<00:04:03.069> if

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
okay that's how I play I know that if

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.850 
okay that's how I play I know that if
you<00:04:04.180> want<00:04:04.750> to<00:04:04.810> get<00:04:04.959> really<00:04:05.140> picky<00:04:05.319> about<00:04:05.439> it<00:04:05.620> it

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
you want to get really picky about it it

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.229 
you want to get really picky about it it
has<00:04:06.069> a<00:04:06.099> c-sharp<00:04:06.760> in<00:04:07.030> it<00:04:07.150> and<00:04:07.329> that<00:04:08.140> could<00:04:08.439> but

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
has a c-sharp in it and that could but

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.819 
has a c-sharp in it and that could but
my<00:04:10.239> hand<00:04:10.480> can't<00:04:10.780> meet<00:04:10.959> each<00:04:11.079> other<00:04:11.319> there<00:04:11.650> as

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
my hand can't meet each other there as

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.439 
my hand can't meet each other there as
well<00:04:12.069> so<00:04:12.310> I<00:04:13.150> find<00:04:13.659> that<00:04:13.750> that<00:04:14.430> just<00:04:15.430> sounds<00:04:15.849> as

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
well so I find that that just sounds as

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:22.010 
well so I find that that just sounds as
good<00:04:17.289> as<00:04:17.650> you<00:04:17.859> know<00:04:17.979> with<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.430> C<00:04:18.609> shop<00:04:20.910> and

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
then the next one that comes up is D

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.969 
then the next one that comes up is D
