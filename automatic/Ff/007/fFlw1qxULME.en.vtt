that<00:00:33.520> way<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.780> stats<00:00:35.110> are<00:00:35.410> pretty<00:00:35.649> good<00:00:36.390> it'll

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
that way the stats are pretty good it'll

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.230 
that way the stats are pretty good it'll
take<00:00:37.600> three<00:00:37.840> shots<00:00:38.110> to<00:00:38.260> kill<00:00:38.440> with<00:00:38.890> 412<00:00:39.820> damage

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.240 
take three shots to kill with 412 damage

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.240 
take three shots to kill with 412 damage
and<00:00:40.480> it<00:00:40.570> will<00:00:40.660> be<00:00:40.720> firing<00:00:41.020> at<00:00:41.260> 13<00:00:41.710> shots<00:00:42.010> per

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
and it will be firing at 13 shots per

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.640 
and it will be firing at 13 shots per
second<00:00:42.730> that's<00:00:43.480> fair<00:00:43.750> two<00:00:44.050> bullets<00:00:44.410> in<00:00:44.530> each

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
second that's fair two bullets in each

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.700 
second that's fair two bullets in each
mag<00:00:44.980> and<00:00:45.220> it's<00:00:46.000> not<00:00:46.210> too<00:00:46.840> overpowered<00:00:47.470> against

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
mag and it's not too overpowered against

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.170 
mag and it's not too overpowered against
the<00:00:47.890> current<00:00:48.190> weapons<00:00:48.490> like<00:00:48.640> the<00:00:48.760> Reaper

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
the current weapons like the Reaper

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.540 
the current weapons like the Reaper
because<00:00:50.110> you<00:00:50.410> know<00:00:50.530> it<00:00:50.860> doesn't<00:00:51.250> shoot

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
because you know it doesn't shoot

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.420 
because you know it doesn't shoot
particularly<00:00:52.329> fast<00:00:52.800> however<00:00:53.800> the<00:00:53.950> range<00:00:54.190> is

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
particularly fast however the range is

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.810 
particularly fast however the range is
200<00:00:55.239> meters<00:00:55.600> and<00:00:55.900> the<00:00:56.560> recoil<00:00:57.010> is<00:00:57.130> 20%<00:00:57.520> which

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
200 meters and the recoil is 20% which

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.220 
200 meters and the recoil is 20% which
means<00:00:58.030> over<00:00:58.329> a<00:00:58.360> long<00:00:58.600> distance

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
means over a long distance

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.740 
means over a long distance
it<00:00:59.380> will<00:00:59.620> perform<00:00:59.980> better<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:01.239> ability<00:01:01.660> of

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
it will perform better the ability of

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.079 
it will perform better the ability of
this<00:01:01.960> gun<00:01:02.170> is<00:01:02.200> 102<00:01:02.950> which<00:01:03.190> is<00:01:03.430> very<00:01:03.790> fast

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
this gun is 102 which is very fast

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.060 
this gun is 102 which is very fast
compared<00:01:04.509> to<00:01:04.629> I<00:01:04.720> expected<00:01:05.350> since<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.740> Reapers
