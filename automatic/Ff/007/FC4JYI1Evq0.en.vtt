00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.940 

all<00:00:00.659> right<00:00:00.870> this<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.290> a<00:00:02.419> 97<00:00:03.980> OBS<00:00:04.980> power<00:00:05.339> stroke

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:06.950 
all right this is a 97 OBS power stroke

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.770 
all right this is a 97 OBS power stroke
no<00:00:07.950> intercooler<00:00:08.580> but<00:00:09.030> I<00:00:09.059> got<00:00:09.269> three<00:00:09.570> nozzles

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
no intercooler but I got three nozzles

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.480 
no intercooler but I got three nozzles
cooling<00:00:10.679> mist<00:00:11.840> water<00:00:12.840> meth<00:00:13.170> kit<00:00:14.120> we<00:00:15.120> got<00:00:15.389> a

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
cooling mist water meth kit we got a

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.179 
cooling mist water meth kit we got a
cooling<00:00:17.490> mist<00:00:17.699> ten<00:00:18.800> nozzle<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.890> think<00:00:20.070> it's

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
cooling mist ten nozzle I think it's

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.620 
cooling mist ten nozzle I think it's
about<00:00:21.470> 600<00:00:22.470> something<00:00:22.800> cc<00:00:24.590> per<00:00:25.590> minute<00:00:26.630> I

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
about 600 something cc per minute I

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.600 
about 600 something cc per minute I
think<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:29.300> cm7<00:00:30.300> nozzle<00:00:31.279> and<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.489> about

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
think this is a cm7 nozzle and is about

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.950 
think this is a cm7 nozzle and is about
400<00:00:33.360> something<00:00:34.130> and<00:00:35.130> then<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.760> see<00:00:36.000> m5<00:00:36.420> nozzle

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
400 something and then I see m5 nozzle

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.810 
400 something and then I see m5 nozzle
maybe<00:00:37.260> 300<00:00:37.800> cc<00:00:39.290> it's<00:00:40.290> progressive<00:00:41.129> starting

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
maybe 300 cc it's progressive starting

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:57.099 
maybe 300 cc it's progressive starting
out<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.329> 10<00:00:43.280> coming<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.520> about<00:00:45.360> 20%<00:00:46.260> Oh

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.700 

so<00:00:58.850> if<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.090> start<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.510> out<00:01:00.719> usually<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> pump

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
so if you start it out usually the pump

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.520 
so if you start it out usually the pump
the<00:01:02.670> lowest<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.090> will<00:01:03.180> come<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.809> about<00:01:03.960> 20

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the lowest it will come on is about 20

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.820 
the lowest it will come on is about 20
or<00:01:04.650> 30%<00:01:05.600> will<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:06.810> show<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.080> 30<00:01:07.500> looks

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
or 30% will just show you a 30 looks

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:19.660 
or 30% will just show you a 30 looks
like<00:01:12.380> so<00:01:13.380> here's<00:01:13.799> that

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.350 

cm10<00:01:20.600> nozzle<00:01:21.110> you<00:01:22.040> can<00:01:22.070> see<00:01:22.490> how<00:01:23.000> much<00:01:23.120> water

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
cm10 nozzle you can see how much water

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.400 
cm10 nozzle you can see how much water
this<00:01:23.660> thing's<00:01:23.900> doing<00:01:24.320> this<00:01:24.410> is<00:01:24.590> only<00:01:25.210> 30%

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.660 

let's<00:01:30.410> go<00:01:30.530> ahead<00:01:30.620> and<00:01:30.770> turn<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.010> pump<00:01:31.280> on<00:01:31.460> to

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
let's go ahead and turn the pump on to

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.720 
let's go ahead and turn the pump on to
100%<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:33.050> it's<00:01:33.590> going<00:01:33.710> to<00:01:33.800> kick<00:01:34.040> on<00:01:34.250> both

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
100% and it's going to kick on both

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:41.910 
100% and it's going to kick on both
solenoids<00:01:35.330> throughout<00:01:35.810> all<00:01:35.930> three<00:01:36.170> nozzles

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:54.980 

and<00:01:42.920> here<00:01:43.490> we<00:01:43.610> go

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.850 

you<00:01:55.990> can<00:01:56.170> see<00:01:57.690> how<00:01:58.690> much<00:01:58.900> water's<00:01:59.350> is<00:01:59.470> kicking

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
you can see how much water's is kicking

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.380 
you can see how much water's is kicking
out<00:02:00.010> I<00:02:01.260> don't<00:02:02.260> know<00:02:02.320> how<00:02:02.440> much<00:02:02.590> pressure<00:02:04.080> I

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
out I don't know how much pressure I

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.609 
out I don't know how much pressure I
don't<00:02:07.390> know<00:02:07.480> how<00:02:07.570> much<00:02:07.720> pressure<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.320> setup

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
don't know how much pressure the setup

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:18.960 
don't know how much pressure the setup
is<00:02:08.770> running<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:11.100> do<00:02:12.100> have<00:02:12.460> a<00:02:15.540> 16<00:02:16.540> gallon<00:02:17.970> tank
