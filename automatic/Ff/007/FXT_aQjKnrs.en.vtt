00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.540
 hello kirby nautas welcome to the canal 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.629
 of barbie live and here we continue in 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.029
 our kirby guide and the end of the arc 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.160
 iris and you know we're going to get 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.610
 all the gold coins of the 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.800
 screens all the chests and the diary 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.060
 always when the luck roulette ' 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.279
 let me although I think it already 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.450
 I'm asking for the trick come on 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:36.680
 there at level three we played the 32 the 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:40.870
 Enchanted ship we go there to see how 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.850
 we are given this little screen with kirby 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.289
 Well, here we start with Kirby. 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.140
 first thing we're going to do is ignore 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:49.540
 the arrow and go back because 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.989
 we have another arrow that tells us that 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.180
 down here there's a little gold box for 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.280
 I say it golden because the golden one comes 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.500
 we go there now if we pay attention to this 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.660
 date that tells us to go up to 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.530
 canon 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.590
 and from the cannon it passes us to a new zone 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.710
 with these ghosts that if they touch us 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.500
 they kill directly we do not lose life if 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.770
 do not directly culminate us so there's 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.320
 that dodge them we can only 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.820
 eliminate them with the magic candy but 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.100
 we still do not have any candy for 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.520
 here so come take the key 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.979
 Be careful not to touch us and we go to the 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.530
 next area where is the little door 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.619
 but before going to the door we're going to 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.890
 break this low wall because there is a 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.869
 chest well with the second chest in 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.229
 our power we can already move to the 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:47.289
 next area up is our 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.330
 exit but access is blocked as well 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.910
 What the hell was that? 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.220
 first get the key that yes the 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.479
 little fish give us little stars that 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.580
 It is very important because there is very 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.759
 little stars and we're going to 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.220
 need all the others that all 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.460
 that we can to reach the medal of 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.399
 gold 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:12.000
 and recharge and store rainbows and you're done 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.310
 perfect we move on to the next area 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.800
 here we are going to find a lot 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.620
 of closed accesses and keys for 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.570
 pick up we start with this we go there 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.670
 thank goodness the ghosts are leaving 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.070
 stopping from time to time and there we have 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.500
 a chest that with a little 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.860
 run we reached it without any 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.110
 problem now we drop down to the 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.670
 perfect lock we went to the 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.280
 next area where there are a lot of 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.490
 ghosts and there's the magic candy 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.880
 this candy makes us vulnerable and 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.010
 well we were breaking everything and 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.770

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.330

 the ghosts that do not come by are 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.730
 quickly eliminated by the herald 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.250
 thanks to the magic candy 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.430

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.130
 this new area here is a waterfall in 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.220
 the top part there is a door that 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.100
 will take us to the last chest there good 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.770
 Here is the enemy who can beat 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.610

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.770
 there to drop a lot of stars 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.990
 here we are going to need an impulse if not 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.850
 we had enough that in this case 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.030
 yes because I have reserved the momentum 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:55.840
 here there are enough stars to 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.990
 can load the impulse again but 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:02.580
 active me with two impulses just in case 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.780
 the first thing I will use the already 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.699

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.949
 second there well I have not needed 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:12.490

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.180
 at the end 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.800

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.560

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:30.370

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.500
 the newspapers in the final roulette we get 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.140
 only 236 stars but they are 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.500
 enough to get the medal 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:06:00.820
