00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
to find the fish most because the water

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:21.620

is running and the waters probably

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.450 
is running and the waters probably

tube<00:02:10.509> really<00:02:11.170> really<00:02:11.380> great<00:02:11.530> great<00:02:11.890> bait<00:02:12.100> to

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
tube really really great great bait to

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.430 
tube really really great great bait to
entice<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:13.420> largemouth<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.260> smallmouth

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
entice the largemouth and smallmouth

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.770 
entice the largemouth and smallmouth
bass<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.280> wintertime<00:02:15.520> one<00:02:16.300> thing<00:02:16.480> you<00:02:16.569> do

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
bass in the wintertime one thing you do

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.470 
bass in the wintertime one thing you do
want<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:16.989> know<00:02:17.080> when<00:02:17.560> fishing<00:02:17.800> rivers<00:02:18.480> for

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
want to know when fishing rivers for

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.360 
want to know when fishing rivers for
smallmouth<00:02:19.750> largemouth<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.350> late<00:02:21.130> or<00:02:21.340> early

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
smallmouth largemouth and late or early

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.820 
smallmouth largemouth and late or early
winter<00:02:21.819> is<00:02:22.120> that<00:02:22.840> they'll<00:02:23.050> usually<00:02:23.200> hide<00:02:23.620> in

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
winter is that they'll usually hide in

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.940 
winter is that they'll usually hide in
slack<00:02:24.190> water<00:02:24.430> eight<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:25.090> four<00:02:25.300> feet<00:02:25.450> deep<00:02:25.950> now

slack water eight to four feet deep now

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.490 
slack water eight to four feet deep now
this<00:02:27.130> is<00:02:27.459> pretty<00:02:27.819> interesting<00:02:28.090> because<00:02:28.500> you

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
this is pretty interesting because you

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.050 
this is pretty interesting because you
would<00:02:29.620> think<00:02:29.650> of<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.280> largemouth<00:02:31.000> and

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
would think of the largemouth and

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.430 
would think of the largemouth and
smallmouth<00:02:31.239> investment<00:02:31.930> being<00:02:32.230> more

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
smallmouth investment being more

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.199 
smallmouth investment being more
aggressive<00:02:32.890> looking<00:02:33.160> for<00:02:33.340> more<00:02:33.489> food<00:02:33.730> and

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
aggressive looking for more food and

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.670 
aggressive looking for more food and
going<00:02:34.480> out<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:34.780> different<00:02:35.080> places<00:02:35.230> because

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
going out in different places because

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.350 
going out in different places because
it's<00:02:35.860> hard<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.100> find<00:02:36.280> food<00:02:36.489> well<00:02:37.120> actually

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
it's hard to find food well actually

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.110 
it's hard to find food well actually
they<00:02:37.930> become<00:02:38.290> more<00:02:38.470> calmer<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.730> majority<00:02:40.090> of

they become more calmer the majority of

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.880 
they become more calmer the majority of
the<00:02:40.209> smallmouth<00:02:40.480> become<00:02:41.050> much<00:02:41.319> more<00:02:41.470> calmer

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
the smallmouth become much more calmer

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.220 
the smallmouth become much more calmer
and<00:02:42.330> since<00:02:43.330> it's<00:02:43.480> really<00:02:43.569> cold<00:02:43.900> they<00:02:44.110> don't

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
and since it's really cold they don't

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.130 
and since it's really cold they don't
have<00:02:44.350> enough<00:02:44.680> energy<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.280> enough<00:02:46.209> calories

the main two things that you want to

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.120 
the main two things that you want to
imitate<00:03:32.410> our<00:03:32.769> nymphs<00:03:33.700> or<00:03:34.859> crayfish<00:03:35.859> which

imitate our nymphs or crayfish which

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.759 
imitate our nymphs or crayfish which
become<00:03:37.090> very<00:03:37.570> slow<00:03:37.930> in<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.140> wintertime<00:03:38.350> and

this<00:03:54.940> I<00:03:55.120> would<00:03:55.239> suggest<00:03:55.329> a<00:03:55.600> different<00:03:55.750> color

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
this I would suggest a different color

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.349 
this I would suggest a different color
maybe<00:03:56.980> more<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.250> darker<00:03:57.609> brown<00:03:57.850> or<00:03:58.030> darker

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
maybe more a darker brown or darker

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.569 
maybe more a darker brown or darker
black<00:03:58.600> or<00:03:58.870> kind<00:03:59.590> of<00:03:59.620> a<00:03:59.739> venom<00:04:00.010> red<00:04:00.220> looking

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
black or kind of a venom red looking

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.210 
black or kind of a venom red looking
color<00:04:00.819> and<00:04:01.090> to<00:04:01.570> cast<00:04:01.810> into<00:04:02.199> open<00:04:02.620> water<00:04:02.859> and<00:04:03.130> by

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
color and to cast into open water and by

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.110 
color and to cast into open water and by
open<00:04:03.489> water<00:04:03.639> I<00:04:03.729> mean

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
open water I mean

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.520 
open water I mean
areas<00:04:04.780> within<00:04:04.959> labs

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
areas within labs

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.430 
areas within labs
and<00:04:06.180> deep<00:04:07.180> areas<00:04:07.720> where<00:04:07.930> there's<00:04:08.110> nothing

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
and deep areas where there's nothing

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.070 
and deep areas where there's nothing
really<00:04:08.650> around<00:04:08.950> not<00:04:09.400> that<00:04:09.550> many<00:04:09.870> sticks<00:04:10.870> or

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
really around not that many sticks or

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.760 
really around not that many sticks or
logs<00:04:11.370> rocks<00:04:12.370> and<00:04:12.730> what<00:04:13.720> this<00:04:13.840> allows<00:04:14.020> to<00:04:14.110> do<00:04:14.290> is

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
logs rocks and what this allows to do is

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.159 
logs rocks and what this allows to do is
allows<00:04:15.069> the<00:04:15.220> bats<00:04:15.400> to<00:04:15.580> see<00:04:15.790> that<00:04:16.000> lure<00:04:16.169> and

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
allows the bats to see that lure and

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.159 
allows the bats to see that lure and
think<00:04:17.500> it's<00:04:17.650> a<00:04:17.829> crayfish<00:04:18.280> and<00:04:18.750> make<00:04:19.750> it<00:04:19.870> seem

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
think it's a crayfish and make it seem

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.280 
think it's a crayfish and make it seem
like<00:04:20.620> an<00:04:20.739> easy<00:04:21.090> dinner<00:04:22.090> or<00:04:22.450> lunch<00:04:22.480> for<00:04:23.169> that

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
like an easy dinner or lunch for that

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.280 
like an easy dinner or lunch for that
bass<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:25.150> it's<00:04:25.330> a<00:04:25.360> really<00:04:25.600> good<00:04:25.720> choice<00:04:25.930> again

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
bass and it's a really good choice again

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.110 
bass and it's a really good choice again
it's<00:04:26.410> a<00:04:26.440> very<00:04:26.620> small<00:04:26.919> subtle<00:04:27.190> lure<00:04:27.460> I<00:04:27.730> would

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
it's a very small subtle lure I would

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.180 
it's a very small subtle lure I would
suggest<00:04:28.240> jigging<00:04:28.900> this<00:04:29.080> or<00:04:29.350> twitching<00:04:29.919> off

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
suggest jigging this or twitching off

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.820 
suggest jigging this or twitching off
the<00:04:30.310> bottom<00:04:30.580> very<00:04:30.850> very<00:04:31.210> slowly<00:04:31.480> most<00:04:32.470> because

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
the bottom very very slowly most because

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.010 
the bottom very very slowly most because
the<00:04:32.950> bats<00:04:33.220> won't<00:04:33.730> usually<00:04:34.300> go<00:04:34.690> out<00:04:34.720> of<00:04:34.930> their

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
the bats won't usually go out of their

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.060 
the bats won't usually go out of their
way<00:04:35.110> to<00:04:35.139> find<00:04:35.260> the<00:04:35.889> bait<00:04:36.639> or<00:04:37.770> another<00:04:38.770> type<00:04:39.040> of

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
way to find the bait or another type of

way to find the bait or another type of
fish<00:04:40.030> or<00:04:40.240> crayfish<00:04:40.480> that<00:04:40.840> they're<00:04:40.930> looking

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
fish or crayfish that they're looking
