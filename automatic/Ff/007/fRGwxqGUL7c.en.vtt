look demonstrate some stuff yeah but as

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.190 
look demonstrate some stuff yeah but as
you<00:02:08.039> can<00:02:08.099> see<00:02:08.179> looking<00:02:09.179> going<00:02:09.479> up<00:02:09.629> there

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
you can see looking going up there

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.670 
you can see looking going up there
from<00:02:11.470> doohickey<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:14.020> seems<00:02:14.290> like<00:02:14.470> here

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
from doohickey and it seems like here

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.040 
from doohickey and it seems like here
this<00:02:14.800> would<00:02:14.950> be<00:02:15.010> pretty<00:02:15.160> simple<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.640> do<00:02:15.790> but<00:02:16.050> in

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
this would be pretty simple to do but in

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.559 
this would be pretty simple to do but in
actually<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.860> was<00:02:18.010> so<00:02:18.190> much<00:02:18.310> confusion<00:02:19.209> to

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
actually it was so much confusion to

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.809 
actually it was so much confusion to
make<00:02:19.720> this<00:02:19.840> work<00:02:20.050> because<00:02:20.370> when<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.400> first<00:02:21.580> put

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
make this work because when I first put

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.699 
make this work because when I first put
it<00:02:21.880> in<00:02:22.000> as<00:02:22.239> it<00:02:23.020> would<00:02:23.170> go<00:02:23.200> up<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.620> down

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
it in as it would go up and down

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.440 
it in as it would go up and down
sideways<00:02:24.220> like<00:02:24.370> this<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:25.000> character<00:02:25.360> would

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
sideways like this the character would

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.620 
sideways like this the character would
just<00:02:25.660> like<00:02:25.780> slowly<00:02:26.770> move<00:02:27.489> over<00:02:27.880> this<00:02:28.000> way<00:02:28.060> you

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
just like slowly move over this way you

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.250 
just like slowly move over this way you
see<00:02:28.750> what<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:28.930> mean

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
see what I mean

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.660 
see what I mean
I'm<00:02:29.500> in<00:02:29.650> contact<00:02:29.860> there<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.220> he'd<00:02:30.310> move<00:02:30.459> over

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
I'm in contact there and he'd move over

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.710 
I'm in contact there and he'd move over
this<00:02:30.760> way<00:02:30.910> like<00:02:31.030> this<00:02:31.060> so<00:02:31.360> it<00:02:31.420> looks<00:02:31.450> like<00:02:31.660> he

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
this way like this so it looks like he

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.240 
this way like this so it looks like he
was<00:02:31.840> only<00:02:31.900> staying<00:02:32.170> still<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.620> that's<00:02:33.130> what

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
was only staying still and that's what

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.860 
was only staying still and that's what
when<00:02:33.400> I<00:02:33.430> was<00:02:33.550> going<00:02:33.730> down<00:02:33.819> look<00:02:34.300> he'd<00:02:34.660> be<00:02:34.750> like

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
when I was going down look he'd be like

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.500 
when I was going down look he'd be like
falling<00:02:35.530> down<00:02:35.770> every<00:02:36.430> time<00:02:36.580> which<00:02:37.300> wasn't

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
falling down every time which wasn't

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.809 
falling down every time which wasn't
much<00:02:37.660> used<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:37.989> me<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.200> was<00:02:38.350> not<00:02:38.739> really<00:02:39.640> what<00:02:39.790> I

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
much used to me it was not really what I

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.750 
much used to me it was not really what I
want<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.120> happen<00:02:40.239> in<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.540> game<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:44.580> but<00:02:45.580> yes

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
want to happen in the game and but yes

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.100 
want to happen in the game and but yes
so<00:02:46.090> obviously<00:02:46.900> that's<00:02:47.080> working<00:02:47.470> now's<00:02:47.650> good

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
so obviously that's working now's good

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.800 
so obviously that's working now's good
oh<00:02:50.110> what's<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.650> oh<00:02:50.769> he<00:02:50.950> kills<00:02:51.220> you<00:02:51.430> oh<00:02:51.459> no<00:02:51.819> yes

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
we finally got death in the game which

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:56.309 
we finally got death in the game which
is<00:02:55.330> pretty<00:02:55.569> important<00:02:55.930> don't<00:02:56.049> see<00:02:56.230> because

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
is pretty important don't see because

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.630 
is pretty important don't see because
it's<00:02:56.500> not<00:02:56.650> really<00:02:56.830> much<00:02:56.980> of<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.130> challenge<00:02:57.340> in<00:02:57.580> a

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
it's not really much of a challenge in a

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.580 
it's not really much of a challenge in a
platformer<00:02:58.000> game<00:02:58.239> if<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:58.870> can't<00:02:59.080> die<00:02:59.260> look

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
platformer game if you can't die look

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.289 
platformer game if you can't die look
but<00:03:00.280> we<00:03:00.489> also<00:03:00.610> have<00:03:00.819> these<00:03:00.940> checkpoints

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
but we also have these checkpoints

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.490 
but we also have these checkpoints
because<00:03:01.720> you<00:03:01.810> see<00:03:01.989> lay<00:03:02.920> killed<00:03:03.750> back<00:03:04.750> here<00:03:04.959> if

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
because you see lay killed back here if

you<00:04:02.290> work<00:04:02.440> at<00:04:02.530> a<00:04:02.560> bugger<00:04:02.739> to<00:04:02.829> put<00:04:03.010> now<00:04:03.100> that<00:04:03.280> we

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
you work at a bugger to put now that we

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.670 
you work at a bugger to put now that we
actually<00:04:03.400> have<00:04:03.609> bets<00:04:04.540> on<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:04.780> game<00:04:04.810> it's<00:04:05.560> much

nicer to fall in a hole oh yeah his
other<00:04:10.840> animation<00:04:11.319> is<00:04:11.549> climbing<00:04:12.549> on<00:04:12.639> the<00:04:12.670> wall

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850

we<00:04:17.970> didn't<00:04:18.970> quite<00:04:19.090> make<00:04:19.239> it

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
we didn't quite make it

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.060

so haven't quite worked out what happens
at<00:04:21.159> the<00:04:21.250> top<00:04:21.280> of<00:04:21.580> the<00:04:21.640> wall<00:04:21.789> as<00:04:21.940> well<00:04:22.090> I<00:04:22.419> feel

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
at the top of the wall as well I feel

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.330 
at the top of the wall as well I feel
like<00:04:23.110> I<00:04:23.229> should<00:04:23.440> make<00:04:23.590> you<00:04:23.740> automatically

claim
but<00:04:24.979> at<00:04:25.100> the<00:04:25.190> moment<00:04:25.310> they<00:04:25.520> just<00:04:25.550> kind<00:04:25.850> of<00:04:25.940> if

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
but at the moment they just kind of if

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.210 
but at the moment they just kind of if
you<00:04:26.780> hold<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.289> crane<00:04:27.530> button<00:04:27.830> user<00:04:27.979> kind<00:04:28.160> of

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
you hold the crane button user kind of

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.129 
you hold the crane button user kind of
bounces<00:04:28.580> on<00:04:28.729> top<00:04:29.030> which<00:04:29.389> isn't<00:04:29.570> really<00:04:29.690> what<00:04:30.110> I

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
bounces on top which isn't really what I

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.159 
bounces on top which isn't really what I
want<00:04:30.440> and<00:04:31.570> but<00:04:32.570> yeah<00:04:32.720> those<00:04:32.840> are<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.050> main

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
want and but yeah those are the main

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.150 
want and but yeah those are the main
things<00:04:33.350> I've<00:04:33.530> been<00:04:33.560> working<00:04:33.710> on<00:04:33.979> with<00:04:34.130> the

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
things I've been working on with the

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.270 
things I've been working on with the
game<00:04:34.370> while<00:04:35.330> it<00:04:36.259> feels<00:04:36.470> a<00:04:36.620> lot<00:04:36.740> nicer<00:04:36.949> now<00:04:37.130> to

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
game while it feels a lot nicer now to

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:44.770 
game while it feels a lot nicer now to
play<00:04:42.850> but<00:04:43.850> yeah<00:04:44.000> that's<00:04:44.300> what<00:04:44.419> we've<00:04:44.570> got<00:04:44.660> so

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
play but yeah that's what we've got so

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.210 
play but yeah that's what we've got so
far<00:04:44.810> it's<00:04:45.470> pretty<00:04:45.560> good<00:04:45.860> it's<00:04:46.039> gone<00:04:46.160> pretty

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
far it's pretty good it's gone pretty

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.860 
far it's pretty good it's gone pretty
well<00:04:46.370> obviously<00:04:46.610> obviously<00:04:47.090> there's<00:04:47.600> loads

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
well obviously obviously there's loads

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.900 
well obviously obviously there's loads
more<00:04:48.020> to<00:04:48.320> do<00:04:48.440> look<00:04:49.039> we<00:04:49.400> might<00:04:49.520> actually<00:04:49.639> move

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
more to do look we might actually move

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.310 
more to do look we might actually move
on<00:04:50.000> to<00:04:50.120> making<00:04:50.330> an<00:04:50.419> actual<00:04:50.570> level<00:04:51.050> rather<00:04:51.199> than

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
on to making an actual level rather than

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.279 
on to making an actual level rather than
useless<00:04:51.590> like<00:04:52.340> this<00:04:53.000> test<00:04:53.570> area<00:04:54.020> that<00:04:54.169> we've

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
useless like this test area that we've

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:55.420 
useless like this test area that we've
got<00:04:54.470> kind<00:04:54.680> of<00:04:54.710> going<00:04:54.949> on<00:04:55.039> here<00:04:55.100> at<00:04:55.340> the<00:04:55.400> moment

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
got kind of going on here at the moment

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.080 
got kind of going on here at the moment
but<00:04:56.229> yeah<00:04:57.310> that's<00:04:58.310> what's<00:04:58.580> going<00:04:58.729> on<00:04:58.820> here

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
but yeah that's what's going on here
