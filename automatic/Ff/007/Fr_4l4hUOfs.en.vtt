I'm<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.550> right<00:00:32.759> now<00:00:32.910> we've<00:00:33.450> got<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> mixed

I'm in right now we've got a mixed
lighting<00:00:34.350> situation<00:00:35.250> here<00:00:35.460> we've<00:00:35.670> got

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
lighting situation here we've got

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.180 
lighting situation here we've got
daylight<00:00:36.329> lights<00:00:37.110> mixed<00:00:37.680> with<00:00:37.860> tungsten

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
lights and the practical upshot is those

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.530 
lights and the practical upshot is those
flowers<00:00:41.370> back<00:00:41.579> there<00:00:41.820> which<00:00:42.120> are<00:00:42.239> supposed<00:00:42.480> to

be<00:00:42.629> white<00:00:43.050> are<00:00:43.350> looking<00:00:44.309> very<00:00:44.360> yellowish<00:00:45.360> or

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
be white are looking very yellowish or

be white are looking very yellowish or
orangish<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.680> that's<00:00:47.460> going<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.879> confuse<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
orangish and that's going to confuse the

orangish and that's going to confuse the

happening in camera you can see right

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
look white even to the camera they've

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.840 
look white even to the camera they've
got<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> real<00:01:07.110> yellowish<00:01:07.710> orange<00:01:08.040> look<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.670> them

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
got a real yellowish orange look to them

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.550 
got a real yellowish orange look to them
I'm<00:01:09.210> going<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.450> go<00:01:09.510> ahead<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.900> take<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.260> picture

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
I'm going to go ahead and take a picture

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.480 
I'm going to go ahead and take a picture
here<00:01:10.950> because<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.909> want<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.150> store<00:01:13.220> this<00:01:14.220> bad

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
here because I want to store this bad

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.130 
here because I want to store this bad
white<00:01:14.820> balance<00:01:15.210> scene<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.630> we've<00:01:15.780> got<00:01:15.960> here

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
white balance scene that we've got here

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.289 
white balance scene that we've got here
now<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.770> could<00:01:17.189> change<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> white<00:01:18.060> balance

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
now I could change to a white balance

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.289 
now I could change to a white balance
preset<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:19.409> could<00:01:20.070> change<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.549> tungsten<00:01:21.090> or

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
preset I could change to tungsten or

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.700 
preset I could change to tungsten or
daylight<00:01:21.659> or<00:01:21.840> something<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:22.530> none

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
daylight or something like that but none

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.050 
daylight or something like that but none
of<00:01:22.740> those<00:01:22.890> are<00:01:23.070> actually<00:01:23.430> going<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.700> be<00:01:23.790> right

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
of those are actually going to be right

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.609 
of those are actually going to be right
for<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.420> particular<00:01:24.659> lighting<00:01:25.170> instance

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
for this particular lighting instance

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.980 
for this particular lighting instance
what<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.830> need<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.189> do<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:27.180> completely

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
what I need to do here is a completely

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.050 
what I need to do here is a completely
manual<00:01:28.560> white<00:01:28.740> balance<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.790> always

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
manual white balance this is always

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.390 
manual white balance this is always
going<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.299> be<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.600> most<00:01:30.810> accurate<00:01:31.079> way<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.950> get

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
going to be the most accurate way to get

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.950 
going to be the most accurate way to get
white<00:01:32.579> balance<00:01:32.909> for<00:01:33.060> any<00:01:33.119> scene<00:01:33.509> but

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
white balance for any scene but

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.420 
white balance for any scene but
especially<00:01:34.140> for<00:01:34.590> one<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.130> that's

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
especially for one like this that's

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.740 
especially for one like this that's
confusing<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.360> auto<00:01:36.509> white<00:01:36.720> balance

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
confusing the auto white balance

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.140 
confusing the auto white balance
mechanism<00:01:37.340> so<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.579> manual<00:01:38.880> white<00:01:39.119> balance

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
mechanism so the manual white balance

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.649 
mechanism so the manual white balance
process<00:01:39.900> starts<00:01:40.409> by<00:01:40.799> pointing<00:01:41.610> at<00:01:41.880> something

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
process starts by pointing at something

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.050 
process starts by pointing at something
that<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> neutral<00:01:43.710> gray<00:01:44.100> or<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.430> white<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:44.970> I'm

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
that is a neutral gray or a white so I'm

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.639 
that is a neutral gray or a white so I'm
going<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.240> ask<00:01:45.390> Lauren<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.990> put<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.380> big

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
going to ask Lauren to put this big

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.100 
going to ask Lauren to put this big
piece<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.950> white<00:01:47.130> foam<00:01:47.430> core<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.840> scene

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
piece of white foam core in the scene

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.649 
piece of white foam core in the scene
and<00:01:49.439> if<00:01:50.189> Lauren<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.640> not<00:01:50.790> hanging<00:01:51.180> around<00:01:51.270> your

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
and if Lauren is not hanging around your

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.819 
and if Lauren is not hanging around your
scene<00:01:51.960> that's<00:01:52.140> okay<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.439> can<00:01:52.470> get<00:01:52.590> someone

to<00:03:23.560> say<00:03:23.680> yes<00:03:23.889> and<00:03:24.180> then<00:03:25.180> it's<00:03:25.299> reminding<00:03:25.569> me<00:03:25.780> to

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
to say yes and then it's reminding me to

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.349 
to say yes and then it's reminding me to
set<00:03:26.349> white<00:03:26.650> balance<00:03:27.069> to<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.519> custom<00:03:27.970> setting

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
set white balance to the custom setting

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.509 
set white balance to the custom setting
so<00:03:28.599> I'll<00:03:28.750> say<00:03:28.959> thank<00:03:29.709> you<00:03:29.829> for<00:03:30.040> reminding<00:03:30.280> me

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:31.860 
so I'll say thank you for reminding me
about<00:03:30.549> that<00:03:30.879> and<00:03:31.000> I'll<00:03:31.090> just<00:03:31.239> go<00:03:31.359> do<00:03:31.660> that

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
about that and I'll just go do that

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.050 
about that and I'll just go do that
right<00:03:32.109> now<00:03:32.139> with<00:03:32.560> this<00:03:33.129> very<00:03:33.340> menu<00:03:33.639> command

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
right now with this very menu command

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.909 
right now with this very menu command
I'll<00:03:34.510> come<00:03:34.720> up<00:03:34.840> here<00:03:35.019> and<00:03:35.109> change<00:03:35.410> from<00:03:35.650> auto

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:35.919 
I'll come up here and change from auto

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:37.979 
I'll come up here and change from auto
white<00:03:36.190> balance<00:03:36.220> over<00:03:37.030> to<00:03:37.329> custom<00:03:37.840> white

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
white balance over to custom white

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.030 
white balance over to custom white
balance<00:03:38.489> so<00:03:39.489> I<00:03:39.519> hit<00:03:39.879> set<00:03:40.209> there<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:40.750> say<00:03:41.620> okay

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
balance so I hit set there and say okay

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.460 
balance so I hit set there and say okay
and<00:03:42.310> now<00:03:43.180> right<00:03:43.510> away<00:03:43.629> in<00:03:43.840> live<00:03:44.019> view<00:03:44.230> I<00:03:44.260> can

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
and now right away in live view I can

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.869 
and now right away in live view I can
see<00:03:44.590> that<00:03:44.739> things<00:03:44.889> are<00:03:45.040> very<00:03:45.250> different<00:03:45.579> my

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
see that things are very different my

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.569 
see that things are very different my
white<00:03:46.209> flowers<00:03:46.720> are<00:03:47.019> back<00:03:47.349> to<00:03:47.650> being<00:03:47.980> white<00:03:48.190> so

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
white flowers are back to being white so

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.460 
white flowers are back to being white so
I'm<00:03:48.699> going<00:03:48.849> to<00:03:48.879> take<00:03:49.090> a<00:03:49.120> shot<00:03:49.480> here<00:03:52.139> and<00:03:53.139> now

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
I'm going to take a shot here and now

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.449 
I'm going to take a shot here and now
let's<00:03:53.650> go<00:03:53.769> back<00:03:53.919> and<00:03:53.949> compare<00:03:55.829> here<00:03:56.829> is<00:03:57.099> my

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
let's go back and compare here is my

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.420 
let's go back and compare here is my
image<00:03:58.209> shot<00:03:58.449> with<00:03:58.569> a<00:03:58.599> custom<00:03:58.959> white<00:03:59.139> balance

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
image shot with a custom white balance

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.740 
image shot with a custom white balance
here<00:04:00.430> is<00:04:00.579> the<00:04:00.730> image<00:04:00.970> shot<00:04:01.180> with<00:04:01.359> auto<00:04:01.510> white

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
here is the image shot with auto white

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:02.970 
here is the image shot with auto white
balance<00:04:01.780> and<00:04:02.199> you<00:04:02.260> can<00:04:02.379> see<00:04:02.500> there's<00:04:02.680> a<00:04:02.739> big

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
balance and you can see there's a big

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.500 
balance and you can see there's a big
difference<00:04:03.159> between<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.730> two<00:04:03.849> a<00:04:03.879> huge<00:04:04.239> color

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
difference between the two a huge color

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.159 
difference between the two a huge color
shift<00:04:04.780> here

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.169 
shift here

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:07.890 
shift here
so<00:04:05.530> this<00:04:06.220> is<00:04:06.519> a<00:04:06.579> much<00:04:07.090> better<00:04:07.269> white<00:04:07.540> balance

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
so this is a much better white balance

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.500 
so this is a much better white balance
for<00:04:08.109> my<00:04:08.290> white<00:04:08.530> flowers<00:04:08.979> but<00:04:09.909> you<00:04:10.180> might<00:04:10.359> be

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
for my white flowers but you might be

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.059 
for my white flowers but you might be
saying<00:04:10.750> I<00:04:10.989> like<00:04:11.229> the<00:04:11.379> other<00:04:11.500> image<00:04:11.799> better

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
saying I like the other image better

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.740 
saying I like the other image better
because<00:04:12.400> it's<00:04:12.549> got<00:04:12.699> all<00:04:12.790> that<00:04:12.879> nice<00:04:13.060> warmth<00:04:13.510> to

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
because it's got all that nice warmth to

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.839 
because it's got all that nice warmth to
it<00:04:13.900> that's<00:04:14.470> fine<00:04:14.709> from<00:04:15.400> an<00:04:15.489> aesthetic

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
it that's fine from an aesthetic

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.339 
it that's fine from an aesthetic
standpoint<00:04:16.090> you<00:04:16.449> might<00:04:16.599> like<00:04:16.810> having<00:04:17.079> more

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.349 
standpoint you might like having more

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:19.229 
standpoint you might like having more
warmth<00:04:17.680> in<00:04:17.889> your<00:04:18.039> image<00:04:18.340> I<00:04:18.549> would<00:04:18.609> argue<00:04:18.880> that

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
warmth in your image I would argue that

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.870 
warmth in your image I would argue that
it's<00:04:19.539> better<00:04:19.659> though<00:04:20.409> to<00:04:20.470> shoot<00:04:20.919> for<00:04:21.159> accuracy

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
it's better though to shoot for accuracy

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.659 
it's better though to shoot for accuracy
you<00:04:22.510> can<00:04:22.630> always<00:04:22.840> warm<00:04:23.200> and<00:04:23.440> cool<00:04:23.889> an<00:04:24.280> image

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
you can always warm and cool an image

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:25.780 
you can always warm and cool an image
later<00:04:24.940> in<00:04:25.270> your<00:04:25.450> image

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
later in your image

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.270 
later in your image
it's<00:04:26.210> very<00:04:26.450> difficult<00:04:26.840> to<00:04:27.290> correct<00:04:27.770> a<00:04:28.070> bad

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
it's very difficult to correct a bad

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.100 
it's very difficult to correct a bad
white<00:04:28.580> balance<00:04:29.000> especially<00:04:29.540> if<00:04:29.630> it's<00:04:29.780> a<00:04:29.870> scene

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
white balance especially if it's a scene

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.900 
white balance especially if it's a scene
with<00:04:30.620> lots<00:04:30.830> of<00:04:30.920> different<00:04:31.040> colors<00:04:31.370> in<00:04:31.700> it<00:04:31.790> and

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
with lots of different colors in it and

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.270 
with lots of different colors in it and
especially<00:04:32.270> if<00:04:32.750> you're<00:04:32.870> shooting<00:04:32.990> JPEG<00:04:33.290> now

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
especially if you're shooting JPEG now

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.920 
especially if you're shooting JPEG now
if<00:04:34.370> you're<00:04:34.490> shooting<00:04:34.760> raw<00:04:34.970> you<00:04:35.600> can<00:04:35.630> always

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
if you're shooting raw you can always

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.900 
if you're shooting raw you can always
change<00:04:36.170> white<00:04:36.500> balance<00:04:36.530> after<00:04:37.130> the<00:04:37.250> fact<00:04:37.460> it

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
change white balance after the fact it

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.970 
change white balance after the fact it
would<00:04:38.030> be<00:04:38.150> very<00:04:38.300> easy<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:39.050> correct<00:04:39.320> this<00:04:39.650> raw

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
would be very easy to correct this raw

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.300 
would be very easy to correct this raw
file<00:04:40.340> in<00:04:40.700> my<00:04:40.850> image<00:04:41.150> editor<00:04:41.480> that<00:04:42.290> said<00:04:42.710> if<00:04:42.980> I

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
file in my image editor that said if I

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.370 
file in my image editor that said if I
get<00:04:43.490> white<00:04:43.700> balance<00:04:44.090> right<00:04:44.240> in<00:04:44.480> camera<00:04:44.840> it's

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
get white balance right in camera it's

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.230 
get white balance right in camera it's
going<00:04:45.500> to<00:04:45.560> save<00:04:45.770> me<00:04:45.800> a<00:04:45.980> lot<00:04:46.160> of<00:04:46.220> image<00:04:46.880> editing

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
going to save me a lot of image editing

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.450 
going to save me a lot of image editing
time<00:04:47.510> later<00:04:47.810> so<00:04:48.080> I<00:04:48.110> would<00:04:48.410> press<00:04:48.890> upon<00:04:49.130> you<00:04:49.280> to

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
time later so I would press upon you to

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.370 
time later so I would press upon you to
always<00:04:49.670> go<00:04:50.060> for<00:04:50.270> accurate<00:04:50.690> white<00:04:50.870> balance<00:04:51.230> in

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
always go for accurate white balance in

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.500 
always go for accurate white balance in
camera<00:04:51.740> both<00:04:52.190> because<00:04:52.580> it's<00:04:52.820> difficult<00:04:53.180> to

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
camera both because it's difficult to

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.930 
camera both because it's difficult to
correct<00:04:53.660> later<00:04:54.050> and<00:04:54.290> it's<00:04:54.860> a<00:04:55.040> time-saver<00:04:55.700> to

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
correct later and it's a time-saver to

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.550 
correct later and it's a time-saver to
get<00:04:56.090> it<00:04:56.210> right<00:04:56.330> in<00:04:56.480> camera<00:04:56.690> it's<00:04:57.020> less<00:04:57.230> editing

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
get it right in camera it's less editing

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.590 
get it right in camera it's less editing
than<00:04:57.830> you<00:04:58.010> need<00:04:58.190> to<00:04:58.220> do<00:04:58.400> later<00:04:58.610> one<00:04:59.450> of<00:04:59.480> the

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
than you need to do later one of the

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
than you need to do later one of the
most<00:04:59.750> important<00:05:00.140> things<00:05:00.290> to<00:05:00.350> know<00:05:00.470> about

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
most important things to know about

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
scene you need to learn to recognize

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.380 
scene you need to learn to recognize
when<00:05:09.590> you<00:05:09.740> are<00:05:09.860> facing<00:05:10.100> a<00:05:10.370> scene<00:05:10.610> that<00:05:10.850> might

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
when you are facing a scene that might

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.450 
when you are facing a scene that might
need<00:05:11.630> some<00:05:11.840> white<00:05:12.020> balance<00:05:12.350> attention<00:05:12.800> the

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
need some white balance attention the

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.220 
need some white balance attention the
problem<00:05:13.820> is<00:05:13.940> that<00:05:14.090> your<00:05:14.240> eye<00:05:14.270> is<00:05:14.480> constantly

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
problem is that your eye is constantly

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.710 
problem is that your eye is constantly
correcting<00:05:15.770> color<00:05:15.980> so<00:05:16.700> even<00:05:17.360> though<00:05:17.510> these

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
correcting color so even though these

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.700 
correcting color so even though these
flowers<00:05:18.620> look<00:05:18.650> very<00:05:19.220> red<00:05:19.790> and<00:05:19.820> yellow<00:05:20.710> less

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
flowers look very red and yellow less

subtle<00:05:22.130> lighting<00:05:22.340> shift<00:05:22.670> may<00:05:22.880> be<00:05:22.940> more

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
subtle lighting shift may be more

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.790 
subtle lighting shift may be more
difficult<00:05:23.360> to<00:05:23.720> detect<00:05:24.050> because<00:05:24.410> my<00:05:24.560> eye<00:05:24.590> is

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
difficult to detect because my eye is

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.950 
difficult to detect because my eye is
really<00:05:25.310> going<00:05:25.610> to<00:05:25.850> impress<00:05:26.300> upon<00:05:26.360> me<00:05:26.780> that

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
really going to impress upon me that

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.900 
really going to impress upon me that
they<00:05:27.080> are<00:05:27.110> white<00:05:27.560> so<00:05:28.340> it<00:05:28.460> takes<00:05:28.640> some<00:05:28.760> practice

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
they are white so it takes some practice

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.120 
they are white so it takes some practice
to<00:05:29.150> learn<00:05:29.360> to<00:05:29.570> really<00:05:29.930> get<00:05:30.470> in<00:05:30.590> the<00:05:30.710> habit<00:05:31.070> of

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
to learn to really get in the habit of

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.340 
to learn to really get in the habit of
recognizing<00:05:31.820> oh<00:05:32.030> I<00:05:32.330> think<00:05:32.780> the<00:05:32.840> flesh<00:05:33.050> tones

recognizing oh I think the flesh tones
in<00:05:33.560> this<00:05:33.650> image<00:05:33.950> are<00:05:34.100> too<00:05:34.220> cool<00:05:34.520> because<00:05:34.850> I'm
