00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 one got the impression 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.279
 actually that on Tuesday one 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.359
 deep satisfaction then ready 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.890
 you beat the next days the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.080
 newspaper on and it's all at once 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.559
 somehow here only frust of foot the 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.650
 speech 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.789
 how does that work ? 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.609
 but it seems to be that with us 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.230
 even if we at the present time 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.769
 bring in many positive results 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.920
 that is never so can be here with us 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.550
 that everyone is always satisfied 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.420
 of course you have to then of course 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.559
 already differentiate 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:38.219
 because after the game I questioned games 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.079
 the personal disappointment 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.969
 carry around with me I think that too 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.890
 It is important that the game is normal 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.910
 In the end too little is disappointing that I am 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.200
 I do not want any other players 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.700
 therefore, guess meditation already think 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.199
 I must also correct and in the reason must 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.860
 They say that they say then 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.719
 actually not that problematic 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.510
 as they were then 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.640
 actually how you thought that 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.710
 had that was rather harmless statements 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.030
 As before, it is important, as I said 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.970
 that the player is sitting on the bench 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.530
 dissatisfied is how to stop then 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.090
 as a club as a team but as a 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.380
 single player continues and allowed himself 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.380
 not satisfied with the situation 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.670
 and that one has an opportunity then 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.409
 also to play and then good ones too 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.860
 games deliver that then you stop too 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.360
 is asked about it and then would be 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.520
 expelling one would say 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.560
 Basically it does not matter if I play or 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.670
 not and everything is good that is too 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.329
 a false statement 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.220
 that's why it was full in the foliage forest but 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.500
 have it with him to testify, we do not 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.729
 problem , but maybe there is one 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.229
 Danger and not from this 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.250
 history but that now 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.740
 after the first defeat of the bavaria 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.640
 all want to construct a battle 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.770
 schalke bayern 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.630
 The danger is that you almost always too 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.579
 third in the place are the 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.829
 opponent and indesign imaginary bayern 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.040
 You have to fight against Munich 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.040
 approach 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.640
 we will not be able to do that 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.100
 we as pursuers or as hunters 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.490
 to be dubbed we do not see ourselves as 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.860
 Hunter I like this expression 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.569
 not because clemens tÃ¶nnies is in front of you 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.870
 Hunter 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.480
 but in connection with football I like 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.010
 not because I ever will we 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.810
 must and must look at us 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.989
 and and and try our tasks too 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.359
 meet and are too big for us 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.159
 hunters are hunted by anyone 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:28.700
 you should actually be in the woods and 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:30.530
 and not on the football field and from 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.450
 That's why we always have to 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.560
 little say against it because we are us 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.719
 because we do not feel anything we want to see 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.269
 that we continue to collect four points 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:40.849
 continue to play good football 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.939
 the combination is fun and there was 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.139
 less and less and with others 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.489
 compare or us somehow 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:49.000
 position that one says we are 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.000
 yes somehow
