00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.140
 woman who are going to give five finals in the 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.189
 today it is nothing absolutely everything 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.799
 which can 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:20.080
 this woman yesterday won three medals two 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:23.360

 a long panorama of finals ahead 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.820
 this is perhaps the most complicated these 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.600
 difficult difficult and disputed 400 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.580
 Styles 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.040

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.710
 We will also see to give proof of the 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.280
 400 free 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.690
 at the moment two and a half seconds 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.120
 katinka hosszu to mireia belmonte who 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.120
 is there in second position 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.330
 fighting next to anna male and the 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.910
 British street 5 a woman who

 she is also European champion in pool 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.240
 short 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.080
 tremendous the power where he held the 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.810
 step for the 200 25 89 for the Hungarian 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.239
 that continues to increase those differences 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.090
 Regarding Mireia Belmonte and Hannah 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.060
 miley does not have options the Spanish before 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.730
 the power of the world record holder 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.410
 that seeks to lower that record the world 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.140
 still no record has fallen 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.769
 world in this bucket pool of 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.110
 Beijing the world champion in Barcelona 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:39.549
 in a long pool doing a season 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:42.280
 extraordinary in virtual short pool 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.260
 winner already in this world cup and there 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.349
 we have mireia struggling with hannah 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.920
 miley for that silver medal in this 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.920
 test 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.359
 the 200 styles 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.480
 has reduced a little the differences 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:04.280
 now comes the good part of mirella 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:08.650
 with the square and the crawl little by little 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:11.349
 recovering that disadvantage 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.870
 about katinka hosszu and there we have 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.720
 already look and fighting for gold with the 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.760
 great katinka hosszu mireia belmonte who 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.010
 is doing an extraordinary braza 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.860
 there he is fighting for the first 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.079
 position also binds hannah miley 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.340
 go last 100 meters look already happens in 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.920
 first position 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.939
 go partial breaststroke 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.069
 spectacular 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.079
 let's see that hand in hand has put 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.629
 first look I already had it complicated 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:40.150
 had more than three and a half seconds of 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.579
 disadvantage compared to katinka hosszu in 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.319
 the first 200 meters but there we have 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:49.359
 to the swimmer of la fuensanta de murcia 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.989
 fighting for the gold medal at Katinka 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:55.269
 Hosszu now has that change that has 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:58.150
 given look and thanks to that 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.000
 extraordinary braza look since it has 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.700
 a spectacular crawl 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.810
 katinka hosszu that stays look since 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.490
 he goes in search of his gold medal the 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.620
 first of the three that will try 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.500
 mireia belmonte in this pool in this 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.330
 aquatic center of Beijing last meters 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.190
 already for mireia the mud has it 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.470
 practically insured let's see if 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.329
 they do not react nor katinka put a and 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.200
 hannah bad and there they have mireia 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:30.660
 spectacular ending getting 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:33.690
 this gold medal 4 25 23 and has been 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.810
 very close to a second just from his 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:40.530
 record of spain best brand of the year 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.690
 for mireia belmonte and large 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.630
 sensations in which he has left us 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.610
 I was looking at this test, which, as I was saying, was 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.460
 a priori the most complicated because there 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:54.150
 they have two world champions one in 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.800
 short pool and another in long pool 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.480
 Look, he has already eaten them at two o'clock 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:02.220
 with a breaststroke and a fantastic goal 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.750
 begins dramatically 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:10.160
 mireia belmonte in this world cup 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:13.400
 with this gold 400 styles that 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.410
 joins the gold that got yesterday in the 800 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.540
 meters 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.040
 fortunately there has finally been 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.800
 television coverage because in principle 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.810
 this test was not inside like 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.570
 that the 1,500 male of that coverage 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:30.800
 of this world cup we have been able 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:33.560
 enjoy with this deck and this corolla 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.480
 fantastic from mireia belmonte that also 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.160
 he has made a good time he has stayed 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.280
 a second of being Spain's record of 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.640
 2010 when he already won the gold in that 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.780
 worldwide in a 25-meter pool 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.780
 played in dubai 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:54.200
 4 25 23 for mireia 4 27 21 for hannah 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:58.300
 wrong and that has finally cleared up by very 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.300
 little hundredths to katinka hosszu
