00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.769
 etudes my ardales 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.240
 and this is my faction server is one 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.070
 minecraft pvp server in which 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.740
 different boxes and compete for 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.869
 as much as possible of course over the 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.150
 well minecraft world at the moment 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.359
 you have five it stretches the northern 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.359
 span 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.260
 you have the southern span 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.530
 the eastern span 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.200
 and then of course the western tension 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.250
 furthermore you also have the trader who 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.649
 is actually just outside the northern 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.600
 span but the is still a fork to him 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.070
 placed from there you can't either 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.769
 Built back to the spawn so go more 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.909
 was if you did go there 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.640
 of course my server also has one 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.019
 some larger factions that more 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.030
 determine your route on the server 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.729
 then goes smaller 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.320
 for example, you have the assassins that 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.789
 you probably won't go 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.860
 trust because they will be among the first 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:13.479
 chance they have down against 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.720
 and already have to bring things in the house 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.990
 blown up let believe then have 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.340
 you set the norm if that is my faction 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.259
 so I normally go in with jasper with bangs and 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.830
 we are not so giving kill you 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.200
 not just 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.960
 but if you have our stuff then 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.640
 we call your house soon 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.380
 in microsoft timepiece from the set 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.340
 of course already clean 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.340
 curt that kind of behavior is not good 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.179
 and furthermore you now also have the 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.869
 service that are like you in the previous one 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.759
 could see video 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:50.560
 my boss is a bit ruined 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.969
 and take all their members are also 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.530
 bit killed them and their stuff 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.509
 decreased 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.259
 there you have the last really big 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:02.289
 faction you now have the trader 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.020
 through the trader seti that you his advice 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.609
 how often channels are peaceful and not possible 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.200
 fight more 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:09.640
 you can't kill them so we can 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.959
 don't kill you you can their area 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.880
 not about claiming and certainly one more 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.220
 claiming area of ​​yours 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.030
 so just outside does northern spain 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.340
 can calmly what they act 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.510
 but have to be trusted too 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.510
 if you occasionally have a little high price 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.690
 she thinks it all sounds good 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.010
