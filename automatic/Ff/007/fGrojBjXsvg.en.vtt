00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
the last video or I was flabbergasted

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.760

you<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:54.780> played<00:00:54.899> levels<00:00:55.260> as<00:00:55.379> much<00:00:55.530> as<00:00:55.680> you

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
you just played levels as much as you

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.310

want the mass as much money as you like

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.569 
want the mass as much money as you like
the<00:00:58.320> idea<00:00:58.440> was<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.039> was<00:00:59.160> going<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.399> place

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
the idea was that I was going to place

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.360 
the idea was that I was going to place
through<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.879> underground<00:01:00.239> level<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:01.370> over

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
through the underground level and over

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.130 
through the underground level and over
and<00:01:02.460> over<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.670> over<00:01:02.760> again<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.270> get<00:01:03.840> max

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
and over and over again and get max

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.719 
and over and over again and get max
money<00:01:04.500> which<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.129> assuming<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.180> 99<00:01:06.689> million<00:01:07.729> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
money which I assuming is 99 million and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.429 
money which I assuming is 99 million and
that<00:01:09.450> would<00:01:09.570> take<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> couple<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.140> hours<00:01:10.409> of

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
that would take a couple of hours of

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.140 
that would take a couple of hours of
play<00:01:10.740> even<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.189> was<00:01:11.220> playing<00:01:11.549> at<00:01:11.640> super<00:01:11.909> speed

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
play even I was playing at super speed

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.109 
play even I was playing at super speed
one<00:01:12.330> hundred<00:01:12.540> fifty<00:01:12.600> percent<00:01:12.900> speed<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:14.090> so<00:01:15.090> I

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
one hundred fifty percent speed and so I

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.310 
one hundred fifty percent speed and so I
was<00:01:15.240> just<00:01:15.299> settled<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.930> then<00:01:15.960> after<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> few

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
was just settled in and then after a few

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.690 
was just settled in and then after a few
runs<00:01:16.770> at<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.009> underground<00:01:17.250> level<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:17.610> wait

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
runs at the underground level like wait

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
a minute I can speed this up a little

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.649 
a minute I can speed this up a little
bit<00:01:19.049> if<00:01:19.170> i<00:01:19.229> buy<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> safe<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.220> then<00:01:21.090> use<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.509> then

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
bit if i buy a safe and then use it then

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.300 
bit if i buy a safe and then use it then

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
i can play both paths of the underground

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.520 
i can play both paths of the underground
at<00:01:23.430> once<00:01:23.610> then<00:01:24.180> instead<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.570> clearing<00:01:24.990> four

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530

at once then instead of clearing four
hundred<00:01:25.799> thousand<00:01:26.280> dollars<00:01:26.930> per<00:01:27.930> run<00:01:28.170> i<00:01:28.200> could

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
hundred thousand dollars per run i could

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.350 
hundred thousand dollars per run i could
clear<00:01:28.740> just<00:01:29.250> about<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.460> million<00:01:29.729> dollars<00:01:29.880> per

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.850 

but<00:02:50.490> that's<00:02:50.670> okay<00:02:51.020> this<00:02:52.020> map<00:02:52.260> piece<00:02:52.470> now<00:02:52.590> turns

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
but that's okay this map piece now turns

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:05.660 
but that's okay this map piece now turns
into<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.099> gem<00:02:53.370> it's<00:02:54.180> all<00:02:54.300> good<00:03:00.440> hey<00:03:01.459> I<00:03:04.130> don't<00:03:05.130> I

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
into a gem it's all good hey I don't I

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.309 
into a gem it's all good hey I don't I
guess<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.150> reason<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.630> do<00:03:06.750> England<00:03:07.170> before

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
guess the reason to do England before

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.630 
guess the reason to do England before
Scotland<00:03:08.040> is<00:03:10.010> Scotland<00:03:11.010> is<00:03:11.100> a<00:03:11.130> much<00:03:11.340> more

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
Scotland is Scotland is a much more

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.900 
Scotland is Scotland is a much more
linear<00:03:12.420> level<00:03:12.900> like<00:03:13.200> England<00:03:14.160> is<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.310> very<00:03:14.520> it's

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
linear level like England is a very it's

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.670 
linear level like England is a very it's
much<00:03:15.090> more<00:03:15.209> involved<00:03:15.690> level<00:03:16.319> you<00:03:16.380> have<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.560> do

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
much more involved level you have to do

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.680 
much more involved level you have to do
a<00:03:16.709> little<00:03:17.130> bit<00:03:17.370> of<00:03:17.400> backtracking<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.269> clear

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
a little bit of backtracking to clear

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.949 
a little bit of backtracking to clear
all<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.319> money<00:03:19.560> out<00:03:19.620> of<00:03:19.739> it<00:03:19.980> so<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.750> guess<00:03:21.750> from

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
all the money out of it so I guess from

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.199 
all the money out of it so I guess from
that<00:03:22.050> standpoint<00:03:22.620> although<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.670> map<00:03:23.910> piece

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
that standpoint although the map piece

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.360 
that standpoint although the map piece
and<00:03:24.450> Egypt<00:03:25.440> is<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.590> lot<00:03:25.769> closer<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.280> the

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
and Egypt is a lot closer to the

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.470 
and Egypt is a lot closer to the
beginning<00:03:26.519> of<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.850> level<00:03:27.090> so<00:03:27.180> that's<00:03:27.420> a

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
beginning of the level so that's a

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.600 
beginning of the level so that's a
reason<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:27.780> do<00:03:27.930> england<00:03:28.230> i<00:03:28.319> don't<00:03:28.500> know<00:03:28.590> i<00:03:28.799> have
