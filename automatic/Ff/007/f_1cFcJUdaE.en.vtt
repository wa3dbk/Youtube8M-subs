00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.199 
to go ahead and get our carriage bolts
in<00:01:52.209> blocks<00:01:52.630> inside<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.380> frame<00:01:53.759> with<00:01:54.759> just<00:01:55.060> one

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
in blocks inside the frame with just one

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:57.359 
in blocks inside the frame with just one
of<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:55.390> 3/8<00:01:55.750> hole<00:01:55.959> as<00:01:56.170> opposed<00:01:56.679> to<00:01:57.009> having<00:01:57.250> to

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
of the 3/8 hole as opposed to having to

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.190 
of the 3/8 hole as opposed to having to
drill<00:01:57.610> to<00:01:57.849> so<00:01:58.239> if<00:01:58.330> that's<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.569> case<00:01:58.750> you<00:01:59.080> can

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
drill to so if that's the case you can

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.839 
drill to so if that's the case you can
stop<00:01:59.349> with<00:01:59.470> just<00:01:59.590> one<00:01:59.800> but<00:02:00.369> again<00:02:00.459> you<00:02:00.670> need<00:02:00.789> to

00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:00.849 
stop with just one but again you need to

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:01.830 
stop with just one but again you need to
do<00:02:00.910> that<00:02:01.000> on<00:02:01.119> both<00:02:01.209> the<00:02:01.360> drivers<00:02:01.720> and

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
do that on both the drivers and

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.779 
do that on both the drivers and
passenger<00:02:02.259> sides<00:02:02.500> okay<00:02:03.069> with<00:02:03.250> our<00:02:03.340> hole<00:02:03.610> in

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
passenger sides okay with our hole in

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.400 
passenger sides okay with our hole in
mark<00:02:03.970> and<00:02:04.179> go<00:02:04.270> ahead<00:02:04.360> start<00:02:04.629> fishing<00:02:05.289> our
