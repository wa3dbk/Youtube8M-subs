00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
at the hood roof and trunk now you can

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.289 
at the hood roof and trunk now you can
see<00:03:01.329> that<00:03:01.599> the<00:03:01.959> Hot<00:03:02.950> Wheels<00:03:03.189> has<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:03.790> red<00:03:04.090> light

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.610 
bar my stove has a clear white one I
prefer<00:03:09.159> the<00:03:09.810> design<00:03:10.810> of<00:03:11.049> this<00:03:11.200> light<00:03:11.409> bar

better<00:03:11.889> as<00:03:12.609> opposed<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.120> this<00:03:13.239> one<00:03:13.480> that's

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
better as opposed to this one that's

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.500 
better as opposed to this one that's
just<00:03:14.439> personal<00:03:14.889> preference<00:03:15.310> I<00:03:15.430> think<00:03:15.639> now<00:03:16.420> you

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
just personal preference I think now you

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.119 
just personal preference I think now you
can<00:03:16.629> see<00:03:16.810> there<00:03:16.959> is<00:03:17.079> no<00:03:17.200> Tampa<00:03:17.560> work<00:03:17.739> again<00:03:18.099> on

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129

the roof of in either hood or trunk of
either<00:03:20.560> of<00:03:20.650> these<00:03:20.799> vehicles<00:03:21.180> as<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:22.419> wouldn't

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.150 
either of these vehicles as you wouldn't
really<00:03:22.780> expect<00:03:22.959> well<00:03:23.379> I<00:03:23.410> guess<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:23.769> could<00:03:23.980> in

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
really expect well I guess you could in

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.589 
really expect well I guess you could in
some<00:03:24.340> states<00:03:24.669> they<00:03:24.819> would<00:03:24.940> have<00:03:25.030> a<00:03:25.090> number<00:03:25.269> on

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
some states they would have a number on

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.409 
some states they would have a number on
the<00:03:26.260> roof<00:03:26.440> of<00:03:26.829> the<00:03:27.519> vehicle<00:03:27.699> mark<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.359> the

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
the roof of the vehicle mark and the

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.349 
the roof of the vehicle mark and the
vehicle<00:03:28.900> may<00:03:29.230> be<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.459> emblem<00:03:30.459> or<00:03:30.879> something

from the police department but generally

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.009

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
I guess you wouldn't really expect too

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.930 
I guess you wouldn't really expect too
much<00:03:35.199> now<00:03:36.190> let's<00:03:36.370> take<00:03:36.489> a<00:03:36.519> look<00:03:36.609> at<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.790> backs
