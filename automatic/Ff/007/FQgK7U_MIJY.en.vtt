small thumb screw to hold them together
and<00:01:01.410> now<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:02.219> have<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.370> stop<00:01:02.550> here<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.820> point

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
and now you have a stop here and point

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.700 
and now you have a stop here and point
out<00:01:03.059> they<00:01:03.210> do<00:01:03.270> have<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.510> very<00:01:03.870> very<00:01:04.470> cool

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
out they do have a very very cool

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.700 
out they do have a very very cool
feature<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.129> that's<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.510> front<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
feature and that's on the front of the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.440 
feature and that's on the front of the
pole<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.189> can<00:01:08.369> see<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.640> there's<00:01:08.790> two<00:01:09.060> screw

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
pole you can see that there's two screw

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.710 
pole you can see that there's two screw
holes<00:01:09.479> one<00:01:10.229> farther<00:01:10.590> away<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.400> one<00:01:11.970> close<00:01:12.420> to

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
holes one farther away and one close to

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.200 
holes one farther away and one close to
the<00:01:12.930> point<00:01:13.890> there<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.340> then<00:01:14.729> looking<00:01:14.970> at<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the point there and then looking at the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.120 
the point there and then looking at the
other<00:01:15.240> extension<00:01:16.020> arm<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.350> can<00:01:16.500> see<00:01:16.740> it's<00:01:16.950> got

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
other extension arm you can see it's got

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.830 
other extension arm you can see it's got
these<00:01:17.310> notches<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.479> there's<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.720> little

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
these notches in it and there's a little

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.289 
these notches in it and there's a little
tooth<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:20.369> one<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.790> when<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.000> put<00:01:21.180> these

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
tooth on this one so when you put these

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.090 
tooth on this one so when you put these
together<00:01:21.479> if<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.020> want<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.259> use<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.619> back

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
together if you want to use that back

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.820 
together if you want to use that back
hole<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:24.180> notch<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.600> gonna<00:01:24.990> lock<00:01:25.320> out<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
hole that notch is gonna lock out the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.460 
hole that notch is gonna lock out the
mobility<00:01:26.490> for<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.820> mount<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.299> move<00:01:27.630> meaning

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
mobility for this mount to move meaning

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.310 
mobility for this mount to move meaning
that<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.189> theory<00:01:29.729> will<00:01:30.060> not<00:01:30.329> Bend<00:01:31.049> together

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
that it in theory will not Bend together

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.399 
that it in theory will not Bend together
and<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.340> do<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.549> either<00:01:32.700> straight

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
and you can do that either straight

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.499 
and you can do that either straight
inverted<00:01:34.409> or<00:01:34.560> with<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> little<00:01:35.640> bit<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.180> bend

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
inverted or with a little bit of a bend

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.649 
inverted or with a little bit of a bend
so<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.170> tooth<00:01:37.439> design<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.540> awesome<00:01:39.540> and

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
so that tooth design is awesome and

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.140 
so that tooth design is awesome and
that's<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.900> really<00:01:40.409> really<00:01:40.950> cool<00:01:41.159> way<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.970> a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
that's a really really cool way of a

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.230 
that's a really really cool way of a
overcoming<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.229> problem<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.890> these<00:01:44.240> putting

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
overcoming that problem of these putting

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.789 
overcoming that problem of these putting
weight<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.810> end<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.259> thing<00:01:46.560> and

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799

having<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.250> Bend<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.909> then<00:01:48.060> it's<00:01:48.210> also

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
having it Bend and then it's also

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.749 
having it Bend and then it's also
included<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.049> little<00:01:49.229> tiny<00:01:49.680> high<00:01:50.159> torque<00:01:50.520> thumb

screws<00:01:52.920> are<00:01:53.509> really<00:01:54.509> great<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.439> they<00:01:55.770> do<00:01:56.090> work

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
screws are really great and they do work

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.539 
screws are really great and they do work
well<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.680> they<00:01:58.860> are<00:01:58.979> great<00:01:59.159> for<00:01:59.369> locking

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
well so they are great for locking

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.789 
well so they are great for locking
things<00:01:59.880> out<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.240> then<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.659> get<00:02:00.780> two<00:02:01.079> more<00:02:01.290> of

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
things out and then you get two more of

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.410 
things out and then you get two more of
those<00:02:01.979> thumb<00:02:02.250> screws<00:02:02.579> one<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.149> mount<00:02:03.299> your

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
those thumb screws one to mount your

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.649 
those thumb screws one to mount your
camera<00:02:03.750> on<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.079> end<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.610> other<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.420> mount

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
camera on the end and the other to mount

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.859 
camera on the end and the other to mount
to<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.110> base<00:02:07.740> piece<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.879> there<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.209> it's<00:02:09.539> all

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
to a base piece so there it is it's all

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.559 
to a base piece so there it is it's all
mounted<00:02:10.860> put<00:02:11.250> together<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.910> mount<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.629> up

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
mounted put together and mount it up

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.170 
mounted put together and mount it up
and<00:02:13.689> now<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:15.790> whole<00:02:16.090> rigid<00:02:16.629> thing<00:02:16.900> isn't

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
and now that whole rigid thing isn't

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.360 
and now that whole rigid thing isn't
really<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.510> case<00:02:19.930> anymore<00:02:20.139> this<00:02:20.650> thing<00:02:20.889> has<00:02:21.129> a

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
really the case anymore this thing has a

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.910 
really the case anymore this thing has a
huge<00:02:22.299> amount<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.689> flex<00:02:22.959> side-to-side<00:02:23.439> that

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
huge amount of flex side-to-side that

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.670 
huge amount of flex side-to-side that
tooth<00:02:24.840> lots<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:25.989> quite<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.230> bit<00:02:26.379> of<00:02:26.499> mount

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
tooth lots so quite a bit of mount

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.599 
tooth lots so quite a bit of mount
movement<00:02:27.129> happen<00:02:27.489> in<00:02:27.609> there<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:29.260> doesn't

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
movement happen in there and it doesn't

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:33.300 
movement happen in there and it doesn't
really<00:02:30.689> seem<00:02:31.689> to<00:02:31.930> be<00:02:32.079> that<00:02:32.560> stable<00:02:33.010> now

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
really seem to be that stable now

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.520 
really seem to be that stable now
that<00:02:33.670> isn't<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.239> reflection<00:02:34.389> directly<00:02:35.200> on<00:02:35.379> the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
engineering that goes into this it's

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.699

more<00:02:36.969> of<00:02:37.239> a<00:02:37.420> problem<00:02:37.840> when<00:02:38.139> you<00:02:38.230> stick<00:02:38.530> your

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
more of a problem when you stick your

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.250 
more of a problem when you stick your
GoPro<00:02:39.189> like<00:02:39.849> a<00:02:40.000> foot<00:02:40.419> and<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.569> half<00:02:40.599> in<00:02:40.959> front<00:02:41.079> of

your head and expect the shot to be
stable<00:02:43.510> everything<00:02:44.469> adds<00:02:44.650> movement<00:02:45.069> and

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:45.189 
stable everything adds movement and

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:46.589 
stable everything adds movement and
unless<00:02:45.430> you're<00:02:45.579> gonna<00:02:45.669> be<00:02:45.909> building<00:02:46.209> some

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
unless you're gonna be building some

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.220 
unless you're gonna be building some

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
kind of huge fancy Stu stable rig for it

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.259 
kind of huge fancy Stu stable rig for it
trying<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.769> get<00:02:50.980> a<00:02:51.159> stable<00:02:51.430> shot<00:02:51.790> out<00:02:51.969> of<00:02:52.000> these

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
trying to get a stable shot out of these

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.869 
trying to get a stable shot out of these
two<00:02:52.540> extension<00:02:53.019> arms<00:02:53.230> is<00:02:53.439> not<00:02:53.859> going<00:02:54.669> to

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
two extension arms is not going to

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.869 
two extension arms is not going to
really<00:02:55.209> be<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:55.959> case<00:02:56.500> so<00:02:56.769> that<00:02:56.980> begs<00:02:57.699> a

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
really be the case so that begs a

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.339 
really be the case so that begs a
question<00:02:58.000> is<00:02:58.329> this<00:02:58.659> something<00:02:59.049> you<00:02:59.139> should

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
question is this something you should

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.319 
question is this something you should
get<00:02:59.469> or<00:02:59.650> is<00:02:59.769> it<00:02:59.859> a<00:02:59.949> complete<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.000> utter<00:03:01.180> waste

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
get or is it a complete and utter waste

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.869 
get or is it a complete and utter waste
of<00:03:01.870> money<00:03:02.049> well<00:03:02.379> there's<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.129> couple<00:03:03.430> of<00:03:03.730> places

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
of money well there's a couple of places

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.030 
of money well there's a couple of places
you<00:03:04.180> can<00:03:04.299> use<00:03:04.659> this<00:03:04.870> where<00:03:05.409> you<00:03:05.560> will<00:03:05.829> get

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
you can use this where you will get

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.459 
you can use this where you will get
decent<00:03:06.519> shots<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:07.060> first<00:03:07.359> is<00:03:07.659> you<00:03:08.169> can<00:03:08.349> use

Bowl<00:03:16.540> and<00:03:16.840> it's<00:03:17.169> smooth<00:03:17.620> going<00:03:18.069> shoot<00:03:18.819> at

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:18.939 
Bowl and it's smooth going shoot at

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:21.569 
Bowl and it's smooth going shoot at
60fps<00:03:19.389> and<00:03:20.019> then<00:03:20.470> slow<00:03:20.739> it<00:03:20.769> down<00:03:20.919> by<00:03:21.280> 50%

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
60fps and then slow it down by 50%

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.210 
60fps and then slow it down by 50%
you'll<00:03:22.090> get<00:03:22.209> a<00:03:22.239> really<00:03:22.840> silky<00:03:23.470> smooth<00:03:23.889> shot

you'll get a really silky smooth shot

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.619 
you'll get a really silky smooth shot
it'll<00:03:24.489> be<00:03:24.579> slow-motion<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.239> it'll<00:03:25.449> look

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
it'll be slow-motion and it'll look

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.740 
it'll be slow-motion and it'll look
awesome<00:03:25.840> in<00:03:26.439> that<00:03:26.500> case<00:03:27.060> really<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.359> movement

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
awesome in that case really the movement

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.330 
awesome in that case really the movement
that<00:03:29.019> this<00:03:29.139> is<00:03:29.229> going<00:03:29.349> to<00:03:29.439> produce<00:03:29.560> is<00:03:29.919> one

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
that this is going to produce is one

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.800 
that this is going to produce is one
going<00:03:30.729> to<00:03:30.819> be<00:03:30.909> slowed<00:03:31.209> down<00:03:31.239> because<00:03:31.659> you're

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
going to be slowed down because you're

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.809 
going to be slowed down because you're
shooting<00:03:31.930> with<00:03:32.169> slow<00:03:32.349> motion<00:03:32.500> and<00:03:32.799> two<00:03:33.159> isn't

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
shooting with slow motion and two isn't

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.339 
shooting with slow motion and two isn't
gonna<00:03:33.909> be<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.239> much<00:03:34.389> because<00:03:34.840> this<00:03:35.049> thing

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
gonna be that much because this thing

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.009 
gonna be that much because this thing
moves<00:03:35.620> under<00:03:35.859> impact<00:03:36.340> and<00:03:36.579> that's<00:03:37.060> not<00:03:37.629> really

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
moves under impact and that's not really

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.379 
moves under impact and that's not really
impact<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:38.979> would<00:03:39.430> not<00:03:39.579> be<00:03:39.759> trying<00:03:40.030> to<00:03:40.150> use<00:03:40.269> this

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
impact I would not be trying to use this

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.390 
impact I would not be trying to use this
in<00:03:40.509> the<00:03:40.599> park<00:03:40.959> I<00:03:41.049> think<00:03:41.259> landing<00:03:41.709> would<00:03:42.250> give

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
in the park I think landing would give

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.069 
in the park I think landing would give
it<00:03:42.489> a<00:03:42.549> fair<00:03:42.729> amount<00:03:42.790> of<00:03:42.970> vibration<00:03:43.479> but<00:03:43.840> it

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
it a fair amount of vibration but it

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.210 
it a fair amount of vibration but it
would<00:03:44.290> work<00:03:44.319> pretty<00:03:44.650> well<00:03:44.739> on<00:03:44.949> the<00:03:45.009> air

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
would work pretty well on the air

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.399 
would work pretty well on the air
because<00:03:45.669> again<00:03:45.909> there's<00:03:46.090> no<00:03:46.209> impact<00:03:46.629> so<00:03:47.259> it

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:47.409 
because again there's no impact so it

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.129 
because again there's no impact so it
again<00:03:47.650> shoot<00:03:47.889> at<00:03:47.979> 60fps<00:03:48.340> slow<00:03:49.180> it<00:03:49.299> down<00:03:49.329> and<00:03:50.019> if

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
again shoot at 60fps slow it down and if

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.110 
again shoot at 60fps slow it down and if
uses<00:03:50.470> in<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.650> air<00:03:50.829> and<00:03:51.129> it<00:03:51.189> would<00:03:51.310> look<00:03:51.519> pretty

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
uses in the air and it would look pretty

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.069 
uses in the air and it would look pretty
great<00:03:52.870> I<00:03:53.169> tried<00:03:53.889> it<00:03:54.099> out<00:03:54.250> as<00:03:54.579> an<00:03:55.030> extension<00:03:55.930> so

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
great I tried it out as an extension so

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.469 
great I tried it out as an extension so
I<00:03:56.109> mounted<00:03:56.469> this<00:03:56.530> on<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.739> back<00:03:56.889> of<00:03:57.069> my<00:03:57.189> boat

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:57.479 
I mounted this on the back of my boat

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:00.059 
I mounted this on the back of my boat
and<00:03:58.479> I<00:03:58.540> was<00:03:58.659> using<00:03:58.780> it<00:03:58.959> as<00:03:59.109> an<00:03:59.259> extension<00:03:59.650> arm

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
and I was using it as an extension arm

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.679 
and I was using it as an extension arm
much<00:04:00.400> like<00:04:00.609> how<00:04:00.790> they<00:04:00.939> advertise<00:04:01.090> on<00:04:01.479> the<00:04:01.509> back

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:01.689 
much like how they advertise on the back

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:04.649 
much like how they advertise on the back
of<00:04:01.840> surfboards<00:04:02.049> in<00:04:02.849> their<00:04:03.849> on<00:04:04.120> their<00:04:04.269> website

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:04.659 
of surfboards in their on their website

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.770 
of surfboards in their on their website
and<00:04:04.840> what<00:04:05.169> I<00:04:05.319> found<00:04:05.590> was<00:04:05.919> that<00:04:06.090> as<00:04:07.090> long<00:04:07.180> as<00:04:07.509> I

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
and what I found was that as long as I

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.069 
and what I found was that as long as I
slowed<00:04:08.109> the<00:04:08.259> footage<00:04:08.530> down<00:04:08.739> a<00:04:09.009> lot<00:04:09.669> and<00:04:10.079> used

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
slowed the footage down a lot and used

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.529 
slowed the footage down a lot and used
snippets<00:04:11.709> of<00:04:11.829> it<00:04:11.919> that<00:04:12.069> were<00:04:12.189> stable<00:04:12.519> it<00:04:12.939> was

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:13.539 
snippets of it that were stable it was

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:15.479 
snippets of it that were stable it was
pretty<00:04:14.079> good<00:04:14.439> so<00:04:14.500> it<00:04:14.799> becomes<00:04:15.189> one<00:04:15.310> of<00:04:15.340> these

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
pretty good so it becomes one of these

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.839 
pretty good so it becomes one of these
things<00:04:15.729> that<00:04:16.000> well<00:04:16.539> it<00:04:16.840> may<00:04:17.259> not<00:04:17.469> be<00:04:18.039> perfect

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:18.849 
things that well it may not be perfect

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.330 
things that well it may not be perfect
when<00:04:19.570> you<00:04:19.719> work<00:04:20.049> with<00:04:20.289> how<00:04:20.560> it<00:04:20.769> works<00:04:21.070> and<00:04:21.280> you

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
when you work with how it works and you

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.879 
when you work with how it works and you
start<00:04:21.579> to<00:04:21.669> understand<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:22.930> product<00:04:23.469> for<00:04:23.650> what

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
start to understand the product for what

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:24.450 
start to understand the product for what
it<00:04:23.979> is

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
it is

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.370 
it is
if<00:04:25.150> you<00:04:25.690> can<00:04:25.930> get<00:04:26.139> some<00:04:26.440> very

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
if you can get some very

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.410 
if you can get some very
usable<00:04:27.740> shots<00:04:28.250> out<00:04:28.460> of<00:04:28.520> it<00:04:28.640> so<00:04:28.790> do<00:04:28.970> not<00:04:29.120> think

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
usable shots out of it so do not think

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.050 
usable shots out of it so do not think
that<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.780> go<00:04:29.990> pull<00:04:30.260> arm<00:04:30.620> too<00:04:30.950> is<00:04:31.190> going<00:04:31.730> to<00:04:31.940> be

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
that the go pull arm too is going to be

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.160 
that the go pull arm too is going to be
something<00:04:32.390> which<00:04:32.510> you<00:04:32.600> can<00:04:32.750> stick<00:04:32.960> on<00:04:33.080> your

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
something which you can stick on your

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.720 
something which you can stick on your
helmet<00:04:33.500> and<00:04:33.650> hang<00:04:33.950> out<00:04:34.040> in<00:04:34.100> front<00:04:34.340> of<00:04:34.430> you<00:04:34.550> and

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
helmet and hang out in front of you and

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.820 
helmet and hang out in front of you and
get<00:04:35.210> gorgeous<00:04:35.570> footage<00:04:36.050> all<00:04:36.290> day<00:04:36.590> long

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
get gorgeous footage all day long

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.110 
get gorgeous footage all day long
because<00:04:37.190> there<00:04:37.310> will<00:04:37.400> be<00:04:37.460> a<00:04:37.550> huge<00:04:37.850> amount<00:04:38.000> of

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
because there will be a huge amount of

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.020 
because there will be a huge amount of
vibration<00:04:38.510> in<00:04:38.600> it<00:04:38.720> but<00:04:39.590> know<00:04:40.160> that<00:04:40.580> if<00:04:40.700> you<00:04:40.850> are

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
vibration in it but know that if you are

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.760 
vibration in it but know that if you are
willing<00:04:41.270> to<00:04:41.600> work<00:04:41.900> with<00:04:41.960> the<00:04:42.260> footage<00:04:42.500> and

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
willing to work with the footage and

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.550 
willing to work with the footage and
understand<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.610> limitations<00:04:44.150> of<00:04:44.300> the<00:04:45.230> arm

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
understand the limitations of the arm

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.730 
understand the limitations of the arm
2.0<00:04:46.370> you<00:04:46.550> will<00:04:46.820> get<00:04:47.060> some<00:04:47.450> decent<00:04:47.660> footage<00:04:48.560> out

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
2.0 you will get some decent footage out

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.860 
2.0 you will get some decent footage out
of<00:04:48.860> it<00:04:48.950> and<00:04:49.130> it<00:04:49.280> will<00:04:49.460> take<00:04:49.700> a<00:04:49.880> little<00:04:50.420> bit<00:04:50.630> of<00:04:50.690> a

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
of it and it will take a little bit of a

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.720 
of it and it will take a little bit of a
learning<00:04:51.110> curve<00:04:51.320> to<00:04:51.920> figure<00:04:52.160> out<00:04:52.280> how<00:04:52.460> to<00:04:52.520> use

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
learning curve to figure out how to use

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.690 
learning curve to figure out how to use
this<00:04:52.940> thing<00:04:53.150> to<00:04:53.360> its<00:04:53.390> full<00:04:53.840> potential<00:04:54.830> and<00:04:55.250> I

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
this thing to its full potential and I

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.130 
this thing to its full potential and I
think<00:04:55.970> that<00:04:56.150> brings<00:04:56.570> us<00:04:56.780> to<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:56.990> conclusion

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
think that brings us to the conclusion

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.820 
think that brings us to the conclusion
so<00:04:57.710> overall<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.850> arm<00:04:59.060> 2.0<00:04:59.990> produces

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
so overall the arm 2.0 produces

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.370 
so overall the arm 2.0 produces
basically<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.610> same<00:05:01.880> kind<00:05:02.270> of<00:05:02.480> shots<00:05:02.750> as<00:05:03.020> the

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
basically the same kind of shots as the

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.770 
basically the same kind of shots as the
original<00:05:03.890> arm<00:05:04.160> with<00:05:04.760> maybe<00:05:05.000> even<00:05:05.120> a<00:05:05.540> little

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
original arm with maybe even a little

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.180 
original arm with maybe even a little
bit<00:05:05.990> more<00:05:06.170> movement<00:05:06.530> because<00:05:06.740> it<00:05:06.860> does<00:05:07.010> have

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
bit more movement because it does have

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.090 
bit more movement because it does have
that<00:05:07.430> center<00:05:07.820> point<00:05:08.120> which<00:05:08.750> allows<00:05:09.140> for<00:05:09.170> just

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
that center point which allows for just

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.240 
that center point which allows for just
more<00:05:10.430> movement<00:05:11.210> to<00:05:11.330> come<00:05:11.510> into<00:05:11.750> the<00:05:11.990> shot<00:05:12.320> but

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
more movement to come into the shot but

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.160 
more movement to come into the shot but
if<00:05:13.550> you<00:05:13.760> work<00:05:14.000> with<00:05:14.030> it<00:05:14.330> you<00:05:14.570> do<00:05:14.840> get<00:05:15.050> it

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
if you work with it you do get it

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.510 
if you work with it you do get it
farther<00:05:15.470> away<00:05:15.650> from<00:05:15.770> your<00:05:15.980> head<00:05:16.190> with<00:05:16.370> this

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
farther away from your head with this

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.480 
farther away from your head with this
arm<00:05:16.790> 2.0<00:05:17.330> which<00:05:17.570> is<00:05:17.720> really<00:05:18.140> great<00:05:18.380> and<00:05:18.650> I

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
arm 2.0 which is really great and I

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.220 
arm 2.0 which is really great and I
think<00:05:19.550> if<00:05:19.880> you're<00:05:20.150> willing<00:05:20.510> to<00:05:20.690> work<00:05:20.900> with<00:05:20.960> the

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
think if you're willing to work with the

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.650 
think if you're willing to work with the
limitations<00:05:21.890> of<00:05:22.070> it<00:05:22.400> you<00:05:22.940> will<00:05:23.210> be<00:05:23.360> able<00:05:23.510> to

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660
