works
I<00:01:04.860> found<00:01:05.850> extra<00:01:06.840> tires<00:01:07.369> extra<00:01:08.369> engines<00:01:09.439> at

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
I found extra tires extra engines at

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.080 
I found extra tires extra engines at
RadioShack<00:01:11.520> for<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> dollar<00:01:12.450> each<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:14.090> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
RadioShack for a dollar each so the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:23.840 
RadioShack for a dollar each so the
engines<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:22.159> orange<00:01:23.159> ones<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.520> turbo

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
engines and the orange ones the turbo

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.399 
engines and the orange ones the turbo
which<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.299> fastest<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.049> runs<00:01:25.229> out<00:01:25.380> of

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
which is the fastest but it runs out of

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.050 
which is the fastest but it runs out of
battery<00:01:25.770> power<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:26.220> like<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:27.140> minute<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.700> use

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
battery power in like a minute so I use

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.890 
battery power in like a minute so I use
the<00:01:31.100> performance<00:01:32.100> which<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.000> find<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.750> best

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
the performance which I find is the best

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.090 
the performance which I find is the best
one<00:01:34.759> so<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:36.180> already<00:01:36.930> charge<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.560> let's<00:01:37.799> give

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
one so I already charge it so let's give

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.210 
one so I already charge it so let's give
it<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.250> test<00:01:39.049> all<00:01:40.049> right

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:54.200 

so<00:01:47.120> here<00:01:48.120> we<00:01:48.210> go<00:01:48.740> get<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.830> turn<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.160> on<00:01:53.210> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
so here we go get it turn it on the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:05.630 
so here we go get it turn it on the
controller<00:01:54.600> on<00:02:03.800> so<00:02:04.800> no<00:02:04.950> problem<00:02:05.400> with<00:02:05.550> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
controller on so no problem with the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:19.960 
controller on so no problem with the
change<00:02:08.000> no<00:02:09.000> problem<00:02:09.450> with<00:02:09.570> that<00:02:09.810> either

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
let's just do some tricks with it where

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:54.800 
let's just do some tricks with it where
is<00:02:45.630> it<00:02:45.660> there<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:45.960> is

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.320 

outta<00:02:55.810> battery<00:02:56.050> power<00:02:56.380> already<00:02:57.600> okay<00:03:00.120> okay<00:03:01.120> a

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
outta battery power already okay okay a

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.270 
outta battery power already okay okay a
little<00:03:01.540> stick<00:03:02.050> around<00:03:02.170> going<00:03:02.770> to<00:03:02.860> do<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.100> rest

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
little stick around going to do the rest

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.620 
little stick around going to do the rest
of<00:03:03.460> these<00:03:04.470> all<00:03:05.470> right
