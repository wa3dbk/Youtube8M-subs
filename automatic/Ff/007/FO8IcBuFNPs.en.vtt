going to link to it and below hopefully

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.590 
going to link to it and below hopefully
there's<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.729> box<00:01:44.909> over<00:01:45.210> these<00:01:45.329> ingredients

right<00:01:45.899> now<00:01:46.049> but<00:01:46.979> really<00:01:47.250> that's<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.880> there<00:01:48.540> are

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
right now but really that's it there are

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.179 
right now but really that's it there are
other<00:01:48.720> things<00:01:49.110> which<00:01:49.530> would<00:01:49.710> probably<00:01:50.100> make

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
other things which would probably make

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.179 
other things which would probably make
lipstick<00:01:50.490> even<00:01:50.700> better<00:01:50.880> but<00:01:51.740> surprisingly<00:01:52.740> it
