not<00:00:37.410> going<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.649> make<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.040> very<00:00:38.309> extensive

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
not going to make this a very extensive

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.420 
not going to make this a very extensive
review<00:00:39.440> simply<00:00:40.440> because<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.739> honestly<00:00:41.010> don't

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
review simply because I honestly don't

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.040 
review simply because I honestly don't
think<00:00:41.460> there's<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.760> lot<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.210> say<00:00:42.450> about<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
think there's a lot to say about the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.330 
think there's a lot to say about the
figure<00:00:43.460> so<00:00:44.719> first<00:00:45.719> off<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.469> believe<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.129> was<00:00:47.309> a

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
figure so first off I believe this was a

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.110 
figure so first off I believe this was a
Captain<00:00:47.910> Marvel<00:00:48.270> mold<00:00:48.510> um<00:00:49.640> from<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.760> toy<00:00:50.910> biz

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.979 
has these treads on the bottom of his
feet<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:38.550> see<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:38.849> there<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.269> think<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:39.900> just

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
feet you see it there I think it just

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
he does have toe joints that stick up

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.830 
he does have toe joints that stick up
very<00:02:43.349> well<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:44.400> that's<00:02:44.819> very<00:02:45.060> nice<00:02:45.269> good<00:02:45.630> for

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
very well so that's very nice good for

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.600 
very well so that's very nice good for
pose<00:02:45.959> ability<00:02:46.380> so<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.069> isn't<00:02:47.340> one<00:02:47.459> of<00:02:47.489> the

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
pose ability so this isn't one of the

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.360 
pose ability so this isn't one of the
worst<00:02:47.790> Hasbro<00:02:48.569> figures<00:02:48.989> that<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:49.470> have<00:02:49.860> this<00:02:50.250> is

worst Hasbro figures that I have this is

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.430 
worst Hasbro figures that I have this is
one<00:02:50.519> of<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.670> better<00:02:50.819> ones<00:02:51.090> actually<00:02:51.360> but<00:02:52.350> the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
one of the better ones actually but the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.289 
one of the better ones actually but the
big<00:02:52.590> complaint<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.489> lack<00:02:53.670> of<00:02:53.700> coloring

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299
