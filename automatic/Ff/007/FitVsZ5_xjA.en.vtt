put this under the eyes the trick is to

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.210 
put this under the eyes the trick is to
not<00:03:49.570> put<00:03:49.840> too<00:03:49.870> much<00:03:50.260> under<00:03:50.590> your<00:03:50.709> eyes<00:03:50.830> that

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
not put too much under your eyes that

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.400 
not put too much under your eyes that
may<00:03:51.880> have<00:03:52.030> like<00:03:52.209> a<00:03:52.300> lot<00:03:52.450> to<00:03:52.630> some<00:03:52.780> of<00:03:52.900> you<00:03:53.019> but<00:03:53.260> I

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
may have like a lot to some of you but I

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.449 
may have like a lot to some of you but I
have<00:03:53.500> dark<00:03:53.739> circles<00:03:54.070> under<00:03:54.220> my<00:03:54.250> eyes<00:03:54.340> so

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
have dark circles under my eyes so

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.300 
have dark circles under my eyes so
that's<00:03:54.760> why<00:03:55.030> but<00:03:55.690> um<00:03:55.900> this<00:03:56.500> is<00:03:56.709> best<00:03:56.950> for

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
that's why but um this is best for

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.360 
that's why but um this is best for
covering<00:03:57.820> up<00:03:57.970> like<00:03:58.720> redness<00:03:59.230> or<00:03:59.440> spots<00:03:59.769> so<00:04:00.310> I'm

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
covering up like redness or spots so I'm

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.620 
covering up like redness or spots so I'm
gonna<00:04:00.489> put<00:04:00.700> some<00:04:00.730> up<00:04:01.030> there<00:04:01.269> on<00:04:01.690> my<00:04:02.230> chin<00:04:03.630> but

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
gonna put some up there on my chin but

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.110 
gonna put some up there on my chin but
I'm<00:04:04.840> actually<00:04:05.080> putting<00:04:07.680> not<00:04:08.820> like<00:04:09.820> a<00:04:09.850> very

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
I'm actually putting not like a very

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.770 
I'm actually putting not like a very
thin<00:04:10.390> layer<00:04:10.690> on<00:04:10.980> this<00:04:11.980> is<00:04:12.360> it<00:04:13.360> doesn't<00:04:13.630> have<00:04:13.750> a

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
thin layer on this is it doesn't have a

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.949 
thin layer on this is it doesn't have a
name<00:04:14.100> but<00:04:15.100> I<00:04:15.340> believe<00:04:15.730> it's<00:04:15.910> just<00:04:16.209> a<00:04:16.419> concealer

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
name but I believe it's just a concealer

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.010 
name but I believe it's just a concealer
brush<00:04:17.190> so<00:04:18.190> it<00:04:18.370> looks<00:04:18.519> like<00:04:18.730> this<00:04:19.020> these

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020
