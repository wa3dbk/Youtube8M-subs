the<00:00:54.530> control<00:00:54.829> screen<00:00:55.100> you<00:00:55.520> can<00:00:55.640> track<00:00:56.000> which

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
the control screen you can track which

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.640 
the control screen you can track which
is<00:00:56.690> kind<00:00:56.870> of<00:00:56.900> just<00:00:56.960> like<00:00:57.170> tracking<00:00:57.440> your

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
is kind of just like tracking your

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.290 
is kind of just like tracking your
finger<00:00:57.980> as<00:00:58.370> he<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:58.760> know<00:00:58.790> bounces<00:00:59.210> around

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
finger as he you know bounces around

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.910 
finger as he you know bounces around
with<00:00:59.540> the<00:00:59.630> tilt<00:00:59.870> you<00:00:59.989> can<00:01:00.110> use<00:01:00.230> accelerometer

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
with the tilt you can use accelerometer

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.890 
with the tilt you can use accelerometer
or<00:01:01.100> can<00:01:01.640> use<00:01:01.760> touch<00:01:01.970> which<00:01:02.180> I<00:01:02.300> find<00:01:02.510> to<00:01:02.630> be<00:01:02.690> much

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
or can use touch which I find to be much

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.049 
or can use touch which I find to be much
more<00:01:02.930> easier<00:01:03.920> to<00:01:04.009> use<00:01:04.129> let's<00:01:04.549> start<00:01:04.759> the<00:01:04.850> game

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
more easier to use let's start the game

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.210 
more easier to use let's start the game
and<00:01:05.360> as<00:01:05.810> we<00:01:05.840> can<00:01:06.079> see<00:01:06.229> here<00:01:06.259> the<00:01:06.770> whole<00:01:06.890> point

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
and as we can see here the whole point

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.490 
and as we can see here the whole point
is<00:01:07.430> pretty<00:01:07.670> much<00:01:07.820> to<00:01:08.509> keep<00:01:08.869> your<00:01:08.990> guy<00:01:09.110> alive

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
is pretty much to keep your guy alive

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.740 
is pretty much to keep your guy alive
from<00:01:10.430> by<00:01:10.850> staying<00:01:11.180> on<00:01:11.330> these<00:01:11.510> kind<00:01:11.720> of

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
from by staying on these kind of

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.120 
from by staying on these kind of
floating<00:01:12.080> platforms<00:01:12.590> that<00:01:12.650> coming<00:01:12.920> from<00:01:13.010> this

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
floating platforms that coming from this

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.040 
floating platforms that coming from this
fire<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:13.640> that<00:01:14.210> kind<00:01:14.510> of<00:01:14.540> disappear<00:01:14.900> into

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
fire and that kind of disappear into

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
fire and that kind of disappear into
those<00:01:15.260> spikes<00:01:15.500> so<00:01:15.650> you<00:01:15.710> don't<00:01:15.830> want<00:01:15.950> to<00:01:16.010> hit

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
those spikes so you don't want to hit

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.140 
those spikes so you don't want to hit
the<00:01:16.159> spikes<00:01:16.400> you<00:01:16.520> don't<00:01:16.700> want<00:01:16.820> to<00:01:16.880> drop<00:01:17.000> down

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
the spikes you don't want to drop down

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.430 
the spikes you don't want to drop down
to<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.390> fire<00:01:17.540> you<00:01:17.930> just<00:01:18.080> kind<00:01:18.200> of<00:01:18.229> want<00:01:18.409> to

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
to the fire you just kind of want to

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.870 
to the fire you just kind of want to
stay<00:01:18.620> in<00:01:18.650> this<00:01:18.800> little<00:01:19.040> sweet<00:01:19.370> spot<00:01:19.640> right

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
stay in this little sweet spot right

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.610 
stay in this little sweet spot right
here<00:01:20.530> and<00:01:21.530> as<00:01:21.799> the<00:01:22.159> platforms<00:01:22.760> as<00:01:23.630> um<00:01:24.049> increase

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
here and as the platforms as um increase

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.860 
here and as the platforms as um increase
as<00:01:24.799> the<00:01:24.830> time<00:01:25.130> goes<00:01:25.340> on<00:01:25.520> your<00:01:26.479> house<00:01:26.600> your

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
as the time goes on your house your

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.690 
as the time goes on your house your
score<00:01:27.170> will<00:01:27.260> increase<00:01:27.650> and<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:28.250> difficulty

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
score will increase and the difficulty

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.070 
score will increase and the difficulty
will<00:01:28.820> get<00:01:28.940> harder<00:01:29.120> and<00:01:29.450> you'll<00:01:29.510> actually

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
will get harder and you'll actually

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.960 
will get harder and you'll actually
start<00:01:30.290> to<00:01:30.530> see<00:01:30.799> that<00:01:31.190> these<00:01:31.310> platforms<00:01:31.549> did

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
start to see that these platforms did

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.100 
start to see that these platforms did
these<00:01:32.150> different<00:01:32.479> kinds<00:01:32.690> of<00:01:32.720> platforms<00:01:32.870> like

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
these different kinds of platforms like

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.289 
these different kinds of platforms like
some<00:01:33.290> are<00:01:33.409> moving<00:01:33.740> some<00:01:34.310> balance<00:01:34.700> you<00:01:34.850> some<00:01:35.210> I

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
some are moving some balance you some I

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:36.940 
some are moving some balance you some I

hard<00:03:28.239> for<00:03:28.329> me<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:28.750> II<00:03:29.049> guess<00:03:29.200> does<00:03:29.439> get<00:03:29.620> pretty

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
hard for me and II guess does get pretty

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.289 
hard for me and II guess does get pretty
very<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.250> feels<00:03:30.519> got<00:03:30.700> pretty<00:03:30.879> intense<00:03:31.000> them

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299
