little<00:02:44.480> bit<00:02:44.720> because<00:02:44.870> last<00:02:45.140> time<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:46.190> event

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
little bit because last time the event

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.400 
little bit because last time the event
itself<00:02:46.730> we<00:02:47.420> had<00:02:47.540> two<00:02:47.690> hours<00:02:47.810> of<00:02:47.959> building<00:02:48.290> and

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
itself we had two hours of building and

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
itself we had two hours of building and
then<00:02:48.500> two<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:48.650> a<00:02:48.769> half<00:02:48.890> hours<00:02:49.160> of<00:02:49.220> hunting

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
then two and a half hours of hunting

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.670 
then two and a half hours of hunting
which<00:02:50.239> is<00:02:50.390> why<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:50.540> didn't<00:02:50.900> make<00:02:50.989> it<00:02:51.049> to<00:02:51.290> youtube

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
which is why I didn't make it to youtube

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.500 
which is why I didn't make it to youtube
is<00:02:51.920> because<00:02:52.160> it<00:02:52.280> just<00:02:52.459> took<00:02:52.760> for<00:02:53.090> freaking

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
is because it just took for freaking

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.870 
is because it just took for freaking
ever<00:02:53.660> well<00:02:54.410> with<00:02:54.530> this<00:02:54.739> setup<00:02:55.040> hopefully<00:02:55.760> it

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
ever well with this setup hopefully it

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.900 
ever well with this setup hopefully it
won't<00:02:56.090> take<00:02:56.180> that<00:02:56.930> long<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:58.370> we<00:02:58.549> should<00:02:58.579> be

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
won't take that long so we should be

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.430 
won't take that long so we should be
able<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.120> finish<00:02:59.299> it<00:02:59.510> up<00:02:59.630> and<00:02:59.870> then<00:02:59.989> it<00:03:00.200> will<00:03:00.319> go

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
able to finish it up and then it will go

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.470

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.360 
up on YouTube after so those are you who
are<00:03:02.600> curious<00:03:02.780> on<00:03:03.049> how<00:03:03.139> it<00:03:03.260> works<00:03:03.470> out<00:03:03.739> or<00:03:04.190> who

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
are curious on how it works out or who

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.250 
are curious on how it works out or who
wins<00:03:04.609> etc<00:03:05.150> etc<00:03:05.209> will<00:03:05.569> be<00:03:05.690> able<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:05.840> find<00:03:05.930> out

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
wins etc etc will be able to find out

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.129 
wins etc etc will be able to find out
from<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.590> YouTube<00:03:06.859> video<00:03:07.690> but<00:03:08.690> I<00:03:08.870> guess

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139 
from the YouTube video but I guess

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:11.590 
from the YouTube video but I guess
that's<00:03:09.170> pretty<00:03:09.769> much<00:03:09.980> it<00:03:10.220> like<00:03:10.910> I<00:03:11.000> said<00:03:11.060> we<00:03:11.389> are

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
that's pretty much it like I said we are

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.509 
that's pretty much it like I said we are
going<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.840> be<00:03:11.930> switching<00:03:12.380> hosts<00:03:12.889> so<00:03:13.250> if<00:03:13.400> you

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
going to be switching hosts so if you

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.420 
going to be switching hosts so if you
are<00:03:13.670> not<00:03:13.880> familiar<00:03:14.799> with<00:03:15.799> what<00:03:16.220> all<00:03:16.310> that

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
are not familiar with what all that

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.890 
are not familiar with what all that
entails<00:03:16.489> there's<00:03:17.269> nothing<00:03:17.540> really<00:03:17.720> for<00:03:17.810> you

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
entails there's nothing really for you

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.590 
entails there's nothing really for you
to<00:03:17.959> worry<00:03:18.109> about<00:03:18.200> just<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:19.430> IP<00:03:19.579> address<00:03:19.790> may

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
to worry about just the IP address may
