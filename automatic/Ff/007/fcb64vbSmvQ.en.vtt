00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
you know you can stamp it or you can see

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.119 
you know you can stamp it or you can see
there<00:02:56.660> are<00:02:56.780> so<00:02:57.170> many<00:02:57.290> varieties<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:58.010> know

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
there are so many varieties you know

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.250 
there are so many varieties you know
like<00:02:58.609> a<00:02:58.640> whole<00:02:59.000> you<00:02:59.180> can<00:02:59.239> just<00:02:59.599> report<00:02:59.959> it<00:03:00.019> put

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
like a whole you can just report it put

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.740 
like a whole you can just report it put
the<00:03:00.379> whole<00:03:00.620> inside<00:03:01.129> like<00:03:01.430> that<00:03:01.700> now<00:03:02.359> you<00:03:02.420> can

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
the whole inside like that now you can

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.979 
the whole inside like that now you can
have<00:03:02.780> an<00:03:03.170> you<00:03:03.260> know<00:03:03.349> like<00:03:04.690> like<00:03:05.690> this

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
have an you know like like this

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.349 
have an you know like like this
templates<00:03:06.950> you<00:03:07.160> can<00:03:07.340> have<00:03:07.549> it<00:03:07.730> then<00:03:08.030> you<00:03:08.180> can

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
templates you can have it then you can

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.500 
templates you can have it then you can
you<00:03:09.079> know<00:03:09.109> you<00:03:10.040> can<00:03:10.250> do<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.700> paintings<00:03:11.239> like

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
you know you can do the paintings like

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.490 
you know you can do the paintings like
this<00:03:11.780> one<00:03:12.049> then<00:03:13.150> you<00:03:14.150> have<00:03:14.180> so<00:03:14.690> many<00:03:14.840> so<00:03:15.349> many

this one then you have so many so many
different<00:03:16.340> different<00:03:16.670> patterns<00:03:17.239> you<00:03:17.420> can<00:03:17.630> get

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
different different patterns you can get

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.140 
different different patterns you can get
it<00:03:18.019> in<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.349> shops<00:03:18.650> you<00:03:18.950> can<00:03:19.579> have<00:03:19.790> your<00:03:19.940> own

design you are going to take it it can
take<00:03:27.049> it<00:03:27.410> they<00:03:27.980> take<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.310> tracing<00:03:28.819> but<00:03:29.000> this<00:03:29.269> is

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
take it they take a tracing but this is

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.360 
take it they take a tracing but this is
a<00:03:29.450> tracing<00:03:29.989> paper<00:03:30.139> if<00:03:30.440> you<00:03:30.470> tickets<00:03:31.040> are<00:03:31.250> you

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
a tracing paper if you tickets are you

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.430 
a tracing paper if you tickets are you
can<00:03:31.549> go<00:03:31.849> straight<00:03:32.209> away<00:03:32.540> from<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.079> picture

can go straight away from the picture
you<00:03:33.470> can<00:03:33.829> do<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.220> okay<00:03:35.090> then<00:03:35.329> you<00:03:35.660> have<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:35.900> take

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
you can do it okay then you have to take

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:40.960 
you can do it okay then you have to take
the<00:03:36.260> carbon<00:03:36.970> okay<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.569> carbon<00:03:39.109> in<00:03:39.970> the

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
the carbon okay the carbon in the

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
carbonyl of different carbon paper okay

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.819 
carbonyl of different carbon paper okay
once<00:03:44.660> I<00:03:44.930> define<00:03:45.349> another<00:03:45.980> one<00:03:47.380> start<00:03:48.380> with<00:03:48.650> a

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
once I define another one start with a

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.870 
once I define another one start with a
shiny<00:03:49.130> spot<00:03:49.579> bottom<00:03:50.510> like<00:03:50.780> this<00:03:51.519> this<00:03:52.519> time

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
shiny spot bottom like this this time

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.670 
shiny spot bottom like this this time
design<00:03:53.510> is<00:03:53.660> much<00:03:53.840> much<00:03:54.169> code<00:03:56.319> then<00:03:57.319> you<00:03:57.500> have

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
design is much much code then you have

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.670 
design is much much code then you have
to<00:03:57.769> keep<00:03:57.859> the<00:03:58.010> tracing<00:03:58.489> paper<00:03:58.639> on<00:03:59.030> the<00:03:59.150> top<00:03:59.680> if

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
to keep the tracing paper on the top if

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.220

a small tip you take a small mask

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.840 
a small tip you take a small mask
instead<00:04:32.780> this<00:04:33.710> is<00:04:33.770> a<00:04:33.890> different<00:04:34.250> type<00:04:34.430> of<00:04:34.610> mass

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
instead this is a different type of mass

in<00:04:35.060> life<00:04:35.270> muscle<00:04:35.840> cake<00:04:36.080> we<00:04:36.860> can<00:04:36.890> take<00:04:37.370> it<00:04:37.550> then

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
in life muscle cake we can take it then

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.510 
in life muscle cake we can take it then
you<00:04:38.450> can<00:04:38.630> just<00:04:38.930> you<00:04:39.320> know<00:04:40.150> take<00:04:41.150> this<00:04:41.360> one<00:04:41.660> top

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.980 

just<00:04:46.520> to<00:04:46.640> put<00:04:46.940> it<00:04:47.090> in<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.450> corner<00:04:49.780> think<00:04:50.780> to

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
just to put it in the corner think to

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.530 
just to put it in the corner think to
two<00:04:51.650> corners<00:04:52.160> you<00:04:52.310> can<00:04:52.340> put<00:04:52.730> it<00:04:52.820> that<00:04:53.030> is<00:04:53.240> more

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
two corners you can put it that is more

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.320 
two corners you can put it that is more
than<00:04:53.810> enough<00:04:54.080> okay<00:04:54.740> it<00:04:55.460> won't<00:04:55.670> move<00:04:55.940> anyway

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
than enough okay it won't move anyway

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.210 
than enough okay it won't move anyway
you<00:04:56.570> can<00:04:56.780> go<00:04:56.960> out<00:04:57.140> and<00:04:57.350> uniform<00:04:57.920> color
