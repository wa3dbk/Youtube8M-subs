then on the opposite side I'm doing the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.370 
then on the opposite side I'm doing the
same<00:01:11.729> exact<00:01:12.090> thing<00:01:12.360> now<00:01:12.720> when<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.020> paint<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
same exact thing now when you paint the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.950 
same exact thing now when you paint the
two<00:01:13.560> loops<00:01:13.820> above<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.060> first<00:01:15.330> one<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.810> want

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
two loops above the first one you want

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.149 
two loops above the first one you want
to<00:01:16.020> make<00:01:16.110> sure<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.380> leave<00:01:16.470> some<00:01:16.680> space<00:01:16.799> in
