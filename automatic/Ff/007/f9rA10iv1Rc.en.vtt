okay<00:00:02.129> so<00:00:02.190> what<00:00:02.550> you<00:00:02.669> can<00:00:02.790> see<00:00:03.030> here<00:00:03.480> is<00:00:03.629> the

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
okay so what you can see here is the

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.470 
okay so what you can see here is the
beginnings<00:00:04.830> of<00:00:05.160> our<00:00:07.700> compost<00:00:08.700> heating<00:00:09.090> system

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
beginnings of our compost heating system

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.820 
beginnings of our compost heating system
so<00:00:10.050> basically<00:00:10.440> over

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
so basically over

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.870 
so basically over
on<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.670> left<00:00:12.300> here<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:13.670> container<00:00:14.670> that

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
on the left here is the container that

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.420 
on the left here is the container that
I'm<00:00:15.509> planning<00:00:15.870> on<00:00:16.080> heating<00:00:16.529> with<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.220> system

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
I'm planning on heating with this system

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.090 
I'm planning on heating with this system
and<00:00:17.960> what<00:00:18.960> I've<00:00:19.080> built<00:00:19.289> this<00:00:19.500> afternoon<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.510> a

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
and what I've built this afternoon is a

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.250 
and what I've built this afternoon is a
coil<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:24.170> compost<00:00:25.170> or<00:00:25.859> heat<00:00:26.310> exchange<00:00:26.789> coil<00:00:27.390> so

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
coil a compost or heat exchange coil so

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.220 
coil a compost or heat exchange coil so
I've<00:00:28.380> used<00:00:28.760> three-quarter<00:00:29.760> inch<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.720> medium

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
I've used three-quarter inch a medium

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.139 
I've used three-quarter inch a medium
density<00:00:31.380> poly<00:00:31.859> pipe<00:00:32.099> or<00:00:32.399> Green<00:00:32.640> Line

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
density poly pipe or Green Line

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.549 
density poly pipe or Green Line
there's<00:00:33.360> better<00:00:33.570> known<00:00:33.840> here<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.200> Australia

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
there's better known here in Australia

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.580 
there's better known here in Australia
and<00:00:35.520> I've<00:00:35.910> wrapped<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.360> around<00:00:36.590> some

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
and I've wrapped that around some

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.340 
and I've wrapped that around some
builders<00:00:38.280> Rio<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:39.420> I've<00:00:39.629> build<00:00:40.200> as<00:00:40.290> a

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
builders Rio that I've build as a

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.590 
builders Rio that I've build as a
reinforcing<00:00:40.829> mesh<00:00:41.010> which<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.790> can<00:00:41.969> see<00:00:42.180> in

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
reinforcing mesh which you can see in

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.270 
reinforcing mesh which you can see in
here<00:00:43.410> which<00:00:43.649> I've<00:00:43.829> formed<00:00:44.399> into<00:00:45.379> a<00:00:46.379> loop<00:00:47.010> and

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
here which I've formed into a loop and

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.310 
here which I've formed into a loop and
I've<00:00:47.640> sort<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.850> bent<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.570> itself<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.050> hold

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
I've sort of bent in on itself to hold

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.840 
I've sort of bent in on itself to hold
together<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.710> couple<00:00:49.829> cable<00:00:50.190> ties<00:00:50.340> held<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.760> in

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
together a couple cable ties held it in

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.750 
together a couple cable ties held it in
place<00:00:50.879> whilst<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.480> bent<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.530> metal<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.070> I've

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
place whilst I bent the metal and I've

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.729 
place whilst I bent the metal and I've
wrapped<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:55.020> green<00:00:55.829> line<00:00:56.570> around<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.590> a

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
wrapped the green line around that in a

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.189 
wrapped the green line around that in a
spiral<00:00:59.370> pattern<00:00:59.539> now<00:01:00.539> I've<00:01:00.719> tried<00:01:01.020> to

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
spiral pattern now I've tried to

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.770 
spiral pattern now I've tried to
maintain<00:01:01.760> as<00:01:02.760> much<00:01:02.969> as<00:01:03.090> possible

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
maintain as much as possible

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.899 
maintain as much as possible
oops<00:01:04.019> I've<00:01:04.769> tried<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.189> maintain<00:01:05.519> as<00:01:05.640> much<00:01:05.790> as

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
oops I've tried to maintain as much as

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.010 
oops I've tried to maintain as much as
possible<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:07.040> upward<00:01:08.040> spiral<00:01:08.880> because<00:01:09.810> I'm

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
possible a upward spiral because I'm

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.320 
possible a upward spiral because I'm
hoping<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.799> will<00:01:11.010> actually<00:01:11.220> flow<00:01:11.909> via

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
hoping that this will actually flow via

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.420 
hoping that this will actually flow via
thermo<00:01:12.750> siphon<00:01:13.080> but<00:01:13.979> I'm<00:01:14.040> not<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.189> hundred

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.530 
thermo siphon but I'm not a hundred
percent<00:01:14.490> certain<00:01:14.909> if<00:01:15.000> that's<00:01:15.150> going<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.330> work

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540

percent certain if that's going to work
or<00:01:15.810> there<00:01:15.990> will<00:01:16.140> need<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.560> pumped<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.630> have

or there will need to be pumped I have

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.910 
or there will need to be pumped I have
managed<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> squeeze<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:20.630> a<00:01:21.630> hundred<00:01:22.350> just

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
managed to squeeze on a hundred just

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.179 
managed to squeeze on a hundred just
just<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.460> touch<00:01:23.610> over<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.970> hundred<00:01:24.270> meters<00:01:24.630> of

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
just to touch over a hundred meters of

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.649 
just to touch over a hundred meters of
three-quarter<00:01:26.189> inch<00:01:26.310> poly<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.240> what<00:01:27.570> will

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
three-quarter inch poly and what will

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.060 
three-quarter inch poly and what will
happen<00:01:27.900> now<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.409> will<00:01:28.560> actually<00:01:28.680> put<00:01:28.950> that

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
happen now is we will actually put that

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.719 
happen now is we will actually put that
in<00:01:29.220> place<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.229> will<00:01:31.229> then<00:01:31.259> be<00:01:31.770> covered

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
in place and that will then be covered

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.600 
in place and that will then be covered
in<00:01:33.000> compost<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:34.079> approximately<00:01:34.610> five

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
in compost so it's approximately five

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.840 
in compost so it's approximately five
feet<00:01:35.640> tall<00:01:36.409> it's<00:01:37.409> sort<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.560> hard<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.799> judge<00:01:38.610> on

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
feet tall it's sort of hard to judge on

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.760 
feet tall it's sort of hard to judge on
camera<00:01:39.180> can<00:01:39.390> no<00:01:39.750> buts<00:01:40.020> about<00:01:40.049> five<00:01:40.350> feet<00:01:40.530> tall

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
camera can no buts about five feet tall

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.929 
camera can no buts about five feet tall
and<00:01:41.700> we<00:01:42.240> put<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.479> place<00:01:42.509> we<00:01:43.170> will<00:01:43.640> throw<00:01:44.640> mulch

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
and we put in place we will throw mulch

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.480 
and we put in place we will throw mulch
and<00:01:45.270> compost<00:01:45.840> material<00:01:46.649> down<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.070> center<00:01:47.369> and

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
and compost material down the center and

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.249 
and compost material down the center and
fill<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.790> right<00:01:47.970> up<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.329> then<00:01:48.990> we'll<00:01:49.140> build

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
fill it right up and then we'll build

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.859 
fill it right up and then we'll build
the<00:01:49.439> compost<00:01:50.070> around<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.640> outside<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.360> it's

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
the compost around the outside so it's

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.929 
the compost around the outside so it's
it's<00:01:52.259> 80<00:01:52.409> centimetres<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:52.920> diameter<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.820> I'm

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
it's 80 centimetres in diameter so I'm

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.149 
it's 80 centimetres in diameter so I'm
aiming<00:01:54.390> for<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.720> compost<00:01:55.409> heap<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.009> at

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
aiming for a compost heap that is at

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.380 
aiming for a compost heap that is at
least<00:01:56.189> 2<00:01:56.700> metres<00:01:57.680> in<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:59.399> width<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.909> 2<00:02:00.060> metres

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
two by two makes it about an eighth

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.240 
two by two makes it about an eighth
cubic<00:02:15.730> meter<00:02:15.940> pile<00:02:16.930> so<00:02:17.800> I'm<00:02:17.860> thinking<00:02:18.190> about

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
cubic meter pile so I'm thinking about

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.150 
cubic meter pile so I'm thinking about
you<00:02:18.580> actually<00:02:18.940> developing<00:02:19.360> this<00:02:19.480> with<00:02:20.160> with

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
you actually developing this with with

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.760 
you actually developing this with with
pallets<00:02:21.610> if<00:02:21.850> I<00:02:22.450> can<00:02:22.600> actually<00:02:22.750> get<00:02:22.960> some<00:02:23.260> some

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
pallets if I can actually get some some

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.840 
pallets if I can actually get some some
pallets<00:02:24.480> cheaper<00:02:25.480> or<00:02:25.690> very<00:02:26.380> even<00:02:26.680> better<00:02:26.890> so

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
pallets cheaper or very even better so

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.640 
pallets cheaper or very even better so
and<00:02:28.420> basically<00:02:28.540> what's<00:02:28.960> going<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.140> happen<00:02:29.470> is

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
and basically what's going to happen is

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.220 
and basically what's going to happen is
the<00:02:30.430> water<00:02:30.610> will<00:02:30.790> come<00:02:31.090> in<00:02:31.270> at<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.690> bottom<00:02:32.020> and

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
the water will come in at the bottom and

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.640 
the water will come in at the bottom and
it<00:02:33.130> will<00:02:33.160> run<00:02:34.090> up<00:02:34.360> through<00:02:34.720> this<00:02:34.990> in<00:02:35.350> amongst

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
it will run up through this in amongst

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.020 
it will run up through this in amongst
the<00:02:35.680> compost<00:02:36.100> to<00:02:36.370> heating<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.880> water

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
the compost to heating the water

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.940 
the compost to heating the water
hopefully<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.810> then<00:02:38.350> it'll<00:02:38.470> come<00:02:38.530> out<00:02:38.680> this

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
hopefully and then it'll come out this

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.830 
hopefully and then it'll come out this
top<00:02:39.310> pipe<00:02:39.880> here<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:40.510> flow<00:02:41.380> back<00:02:41.620> into<00:02:41.800> the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
top pipe here and flow back into the

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.540 
top pipe here and flow back into the
back<00:02:43.840> into<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.170> house<00:02:44.320> so<00:02:44.530> hopefully<00:02:45.430> this

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
back into the house so hopefully this

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.670 
back into the house so hopefully this
will<00:02:45.670> work<00:02:45.730> rather<00:02:46.120> world<00:02:46.420> but<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:47.140> guess<00:02:47.440> time

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
will work rather world but I guess time

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.100 
will work rather world but I guess time
will<00:02:47.709> tell<00:02:47.890> but<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.820> is<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:48.970> first<00:02:49.270> step<00:02:49.360> on<00:02:49.720> the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
will tell but it is a first step on the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.240 
will tell but it is a first step on the
gene<00:02:50.560> pain<00:02:50.770> method<00:02:51.300> of<00:02:52.530> heating<00:02:53.530> water<00:02:53.890> by<00:02:54.220> a

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
gene pain method of heating water by a
