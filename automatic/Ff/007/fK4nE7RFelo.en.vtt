00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
is that most of the areas in fact think

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.200 
is that most of the areas in fact think
all<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.480> areas<00:00:24.800> have<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:26.039> little<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.760> little

all of the areas have a little a little
camp<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:28.080> guess<00:00:28.470> which<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:28.920> sort<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.880> like<00:00:30.029> a

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
camp I guess which is sort of like a

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.780 
camp I guess which is sort of like a
very<00:00:30.420> mini<00:00:30.750> garrison<00:00:31.349> I'm<00:00:32.040> in<00:00:32.309> gore<00:00:32.550> Grande

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790

and the camp which you can create here
is<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.040> choice<00:00:35.790> between<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.239> lumber<00:00:36.630> mill<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.989> a

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
is a choice between a lumber mill and a

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.910 
is a choice between a lumber mill and a

i'm<00:02:51.570> pretty<00:02:52.019> sure<00:02:52.320> five<00:02:52.650> seconds<00:02:53.250> is<00:02:53.400> is<00:02:54.360> good

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
i'm pretty sure five seconds is is good

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.240 
i'm pretty sure five seconds is is good

locations<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:56.970> had<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.510> use<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.810> few<00:02:57.840> times

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
locations I had to use it a few times

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.050 
locations I had to use it a few times
but<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:58.650> managed<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.010> get<00:02:59.190> up<00:02:59.340> on<00:02:59.489> top<00:02:59.820> of<00:02:59.880> the

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
but I managed to get up on top of the

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.630 
but I managed to get up on top of the
cliffs<00:03:00.500> surrounding<00:03:01.500> gore<00:03:01.709> ground<00:03:01.980> it's<00:03:02.579> a

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
cliffs surrounding gore ground it's a

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.509 
cliffs surrounding gore ground it's a
very<00:03:02.850> nice<00:03:03.090> view<00:03:03.620> so<00:03:04.620> I'm<00:03:04.890> sure<00:03:05.100> this<00:03:05.250> can<00:03:05.430> be

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
very nice view so I'm sure this can be

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.569 
very nice view so I'm sure this can be
used<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.850> find<00:03:06.269> a<00:03:06.480> few<00:03:06.980> interesting<00:03:07.980> locations

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
used to find a few interesting locations

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.150 
used to find a few interesting locations
but<00:03:08.820> we<00:03:09.450> currently<00:03:09.810> have<00:03:10.079> one<00:03:10.560> instance<00:03:10.980> of

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
but we currently have one instance of

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.350 
but we currently have one instance of
flying<00:03:11.489> in<00:03:11.880> wall<00:03:12.390> onto<00:03:12.570> channel<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:14.360> there's

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
flying in wall onto channel so there's

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.650 
flying in wall onto channel so there's
hope<00:03:15.799> even<00:03:16.799> though<00:03:16.980> I'm<00:03:17.280> not<00:03:17.340> an<00:03:17.790> entire<00:03:18.360> fan

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
hope even though I'm not an entire fan

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.060 
hope even though I'm not an entire fan
that's<00:03:19.140> not<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.410> point<00:03:19.560> that's<00:03:19.769> not<00:03:19.980> the

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
that's not the point that's not the

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.979 
that's not the point that's not the

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
point we may get flying we may not

point we may get flying we may not
either<00:03:22.620> way<00:03:22.799> you<00:03:22.950> can<00:03:23.400> fly<00:03:23.730> if<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.299> choose<00:03:24.600> to
