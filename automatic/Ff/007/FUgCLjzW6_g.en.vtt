00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
seemed to break with this really slow

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.330 
seemed to break with this really slow
and<00:01:59.200> pathetic<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.350> emotion<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.039> it<00:02:01.159> always

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
and pathetic and emotion and it always

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.520 
and pathetic and emotion and it always
broke<00:02:01.700> in<00:02:01.849> the<00:02:01.940> same<00:02:02.179> way<00:02:02.450> no<00:02:03.110> matter<00:02:03.289> where

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
broke in the same way no matter where

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.229 
broke in the same way no matter where
you<00:02:03.560> shot<00:02:03.950> it<00:02:04.130> always<00:02:04.369> break<00:02:04.640> from<00:02:04.819> the<00:02:04.970> middle

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:05.239 
you shot it always break from the middle

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:08.080 
you shot it always break from the middle
down<00:02:05.539> and<00:02:06.160> looking<00:02:07.160> at<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.310> turtle<00:02:07.520> it<00:02:07.789> looks

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
down and looking at the turtle it looks

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.969 
down and looking at the turtle it looks
a<00:02:08.239> bit<00:02:08.360> different<00:02:08.420> now<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.470> looks<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.770> lot<00:02:09.920> more

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
a bit different now it looks a lot more

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.030 
a bit different now it looks a lot more
realistic<00:02:10.550> as<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.000> glass<00:02:11.239> smashes<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.920> I'm

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
realistic as the glass smashes and I'm

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.130 
realistic as the glass smashes and I'm
hoping<00:02:13.400> because<00:02:13.580> of<00:02:13.760> this<00:02:13.849> realism<00:02:14.239> will<00:02:15.020> have

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
hoping because of this realism will have

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.040 
hoping because of this realism will have
taken<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.560> step<00:02:15.920> towards<00:02:16.520> making<00:02:17.209> glass<00:02:17.720> that

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
taken the step towards making glass that

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.650 
taken the step towards making glass that
kind<00:02:18.260> of<00:02:18.349> breaks<00:02:18.650> in<00:02:19.060> different<00:02:20.060> animations

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
kind of breaks in different animations

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.720 
kind of breaks in different animations
depending<00:02:21.200> what<00:02:21.319> you<00:02:21.440> shoot<00:02:21.680> it<00:02:21.890> or<00:02:22.040> Knifer<00:02:22.550> if

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
depending what you shoot it or Knifer if

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.270 
depending what you shoot it or Knifer if
you<00:02:22.819> get<00:02:23.000> what<00:02:23.120> I'm<00:02:23.209> saying<00:02:23.480> in<00:02:24.349> terms<00:02:24.920> of

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
you get what I'm saying in terms of

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.089 
you get what I'm saying in terms of
gameplay<00:02:25.550> textures<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.599> graphics<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.379> don't

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
gameplay textures and graphics I don't

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.270 
gameplay textures and graphics I don't
think<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:28.580> is<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:29.060> big<00:02:29.270> of<00:02:29.390> a<00:02:29.450> step<00:02:29.690> up<00:02:29.930> from

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
think it is that big of a step up from

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.860 
think it is that big of a step up from
call<00:02:31.280> of<00:02:31.310> duty<00:02:31.700> ghosts<00:02:32.300> but<00:02:32.629> you<00:02:32.750> know

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
call of duty ghosts but you know

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.750 
call of duty ghosts but you know
hopefully<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.379> resolutions<00:02:33.950> are<00:02:34.190> better<00:02:34.430> on

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
hopefully the resolutions are better on

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.729 
hopefully the resolutions are better on
both<00:02:35.330> consoles<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.110> framerate<00:02:36.379> issues

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
both consoles and the framerate issues

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.740 
both consoles and the framerate issues
are<00:02:37.160> fixed<00:02:37.220> for<00:02:37.819> both<00:02:37.940> consoles<00:02:38.360> because<00:02:38.599> that

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
are fixed for both consoles because that

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.050 
are fixed for both consoles because that
was<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:38.900> little<00:02:39.080> bit<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.410> problem<00:02:40.030> now<00:02:41.030> I

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
was a little bit of a problem now I

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.580 
was a little bit of a problem now I
think<00:02:41.300> the<00:02:41.360> jetpack<00:02:41.810> is<00:02:41.989> quite<00:02:42.290> a<00:02:42.319> big

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
think the jetpack is quite a big

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.890 
think the jetpack is quite a big
advantage<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:43.370> big<00:02:43.670> thing<00:02:43.940> in<00:02:44.120> this<00:02:44.239> game<00:02:44.480> as

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
advantage and big thing in this game as

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.089 
advantage and big thing in this game as
you<00:02:45.050> can<00:02:45.170> see<00:02:45.260> in<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:45.410> gameplay<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:46.069> player

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
you can see in the gameplay the player

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.430 
you can see in the gameplay the player
always<00:02:46.970> uses<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:47.480> jetpack<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.140> best<00:02:48.349> of

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
always uses the jetpack to the best of

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.830 
always uses the jetpack to the best of
his<00:02:48.560> advantage<00:02:49.069> you<00:02:49.760> see<00:02:49.910> townsboy<00:02:50.330> kind<00:02:50.720> of

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
his advantage you see townsboy kind of

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.690 
his advantage you see townsboy kind of
jumps<00:02:51.500> up<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:51.800> then<00:02:51.950> goes<00:02:52.160> around<00:02:52.370> in<00:02:52.610> a

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
jumps up and then goes around in a

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.460 
jumps up and then goes around in a
circle<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:53.150> lunge<00:02:53.510> back<00:02:53.750> behind<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.260> enemy

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
circle a lunge back behind the enemy

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.290 
circle a lunge back behind the enemy
that<00:02:54.739> was<00:02:54.830> chasing<00:02:55.250> him<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:55.519> thought<00:02:56.090> that<00:02:56.209> was

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
that was chasing him I thought that was

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.910 
that was chasing him I thought that was
pretty<00:02:56.450> cool<00:02:56.810> but<00:02:57.080> in<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.349> you<00:02:57.470> know<00:02:57.590> kind<00:02:57.860> of

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
pretty cool but in the you know kind of

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.380 
pretty cool but in the you know kind of
practical<00:02:58.250> world<00:02:58.550> of<00:02:58.700> call<00:02:58.879> of<00:02:58.970> duty<00:02:59.209> that's

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
practical world of call of duty that's

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.509 
practical world of call of duty that's
not<00:02:59.540> going<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.840> happen<00:02:59.989> at<00:03:00.230> all<00:03:00.379> wait<00:03:01.160> do<00:03:01.310> shoot

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
not going to happen at all wait do shoot

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:02.800 
not going to happen at all wait do shoot
the<00:03:01.640> jetpack<00:03:01.940> a<00:03:01.970> lot<00:03:02.209> and<00:03:02.360> I<00:03:02.450> found<00:03:02.629> that

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
the jetpack a lot and I found that

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.589 
the jetpack a lot and I found that
really<00:03:02.870> really<00:03:03.260> cool<00:03:04.060> now<00:03:05.060> what<00:03:05.180> I<00:03:05.209> did<00:03:05.420> find

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
really really cool now what I did find

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.210 
really really cool now what I did find
really<00:03:05.900> interested<00:03:06.410> in<00:03:06.440> this<00:03:06.620> trailer<00:03:06.920> was

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
really interested in this trailer was

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.520 
really interested in this trailer was
the<00:03:07.370> use<00:03:07.580> of<00:03:07.610> tourists<00:03:08.450> there<00:03:08.810> appears<00:03:09.350> to<00:03:09.410> be

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
the use of tourists there appears to be

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.559 
the use of tourists there appears to be
torrents<00:03:10.160> that<00:03:10.310> are<00:03:10.400> planted

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
torrents that are planted

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.690 
torrents that are planted
on<00:03:11.599> the<00:03:11.749> ground<00:03:11.989> my<00:03:12.200> big<00:03:12.499> really<00:03:12.890> massive

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
on the ground my big really massive

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.030 
on the ground my big really massive
heavy<00:03:13.969> cannon<00:03:14.480> tablet<00:03:14.780> toilet<00:03:15.079> things<00:03:15.290> that

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
heavy cannon tablet toilet things that

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.069 
heavy cannon tablet toilet things that
are<00:03:16.189> on<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.609> ground<00:03:16.730> on<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.180> mouth<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:18.049> I

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
are on the ground on the mouth that I

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.410 
are on the ground on the mouth that I
either<00:03:18.379> team<00:03:18.799> can<00:03:19.069> use<00:03:19.370> I<00:03:19.609> found<00:03:20.120> this<00:03:20.269> really

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
either team can use I found this really

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.690 
either team can use I found this really
interesting<00:03:20.689> it<00:03:21.349> kind<00:03:21.650> of<00:03:21.739> opens<00:03:22.219> a<00:03:22.310> new<00:03:22.340> era

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
interesting it kind of opens a new era

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.020 
interesting it kind of opens a new era
for<00:03:23.709> aircraft<00:03:24.709> to<00:03:24.859> be<00:03:24.980> used<00:03:25.370> I<00:03:25.639> mean<00:03:25.879> this

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
for aircraft to be used I mean this

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.580 
for aircraft to be used I mean this
could<00:03:26.209> just<00:03:26.329> be<00:03:26.450> for<00:03:26.689> like<00:03:26.840> killing<00:03:27.230> and

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
could just be for like killing and

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.770 
could just be for like killing and
shooting<00:03:27.920> down<00:03:28.069> kill<00:03:28.370> streaks<00:03:28.700> or<00:03:29.450> it<00:03:29.599> could

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
shooting down kill streaks or it could

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.199 
shooting down kill streaks or it could
be<00:03:29.810> all<00:03:30.079> the<00:03:30.139> stuff<00:03:30.680> as<00:03:30.829> well<00:03:31.069> maybe<00:03:31.819> there<00:03:32.120> are

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
be all the stuff as well maybe there are

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.330 
be all the stuff as well maybe there are
aircraft<00:03:32.870> of<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.019> game<00:03:33.319> that<00:03:33.500> you<00:03:33.560> can<00:03:33.709> fly<00:03:33.980> it

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
aircraft of the game that you can fly it

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.300 
aircraft of the game that you can fly it
makes<00:03:34.969> sense<00:03:35.269> having<00:03:36.019> a<00:03:36.139> tour<00:03:36.349> in<00:03:36.620> so<00:03:37.010> you<00:03:37.159> can

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
makes sense having a tour in so you can

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.280 
makes sense having a tour in so you can
shoot<00:03:37.519> them<00:03:37.700> down<00:03:37.939> or<00:03:38.540> else<00:03:38.689> to<00:03:38.900> just<00:03:39.079> be<00:03:39.169> up

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
shoot them down or else to just be up

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.140 
shoot them down or else to just be up
there<00:03:39.469> ages<00:03:39.889> and<00:03:40.040> ages<00:03:40.129> and<00:03:40.370> ages<00:03:40.519> shooting

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
there ages and ages and ages shooting

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.809 
there ages and ages and ages shooting
people<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.980> think<00:03:42.980> there<00:03:43.129> could<00:03:43.280> be<00:03:43.340> you<00:03:43.700> know

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
people I think there could be you know

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.780 
people I think there could be you know
new<00:03:44.359> type<00:03:44.689> of<00:03:44.719> aircraft<00:03:45.340> of<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.370> game<00:03:46.609> that

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
new type of aircraft of the game that

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.729 
new type of aircraft of the game that
you<00:03:46.849> can<00:03:46.879> fly<00:03:47.209> out<00:03:47.480> of<00:03:47.510> a<00:03:47.780> really<00:03:48.079> cool<00:03:48.260> thing<00:03:48.530> I

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
you can fly out of a really cool thing I

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.349 
you can fly out of a really cool thing I
don't<00:03:49.250> know<00:03:49.370> there's<00:03:49.639> just<00:03:49.699> my<00:03:49.909> prediction

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
don't know there's just my prediction

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.119 
don't know there's just my prediction
but<00:03:50.930> there<00:03:51.049> are<00:03:51.199> toys<00:03:51.530> that<00:03:51.739> you<00:03:51.829> can<00:03:51.980> just

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
but there are toys that you can just

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:54.429 
but there are toys that you can just
jump<00:03:52.310> in<00:03:52.549> as<00:03:53.359> you<00:03:53.510> did<00:03:53.659> see<00:03:53.780> a<00:03:53.810> guy<00:03:54.019> just<00:03:54.230> jump

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:54.439 
jump in as you did see a guy just jump

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.800 
jump in as you did see a guy just jump
in<00:03:54.590> one<00:03:54.769> I<00:03:55.209> think<00:03:56.209> that's<00:03:56.329> a<00:03:56.389> pretty<00:03:56.480> nice

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
in one I think that's a pretty nice

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.309 
in one I think that's a pretty nice
addition<00:03:57.620> to<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.769> game<00:03:58.870> down<00:03:59.870> to<00:04:00.019> one<00:04:00.139> of<00:04:00.230> the

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
addition to the game down to one of the

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.069 
addition to the game down to one of the
most<00:04:00.349> exciting<00:04:01.010> but<00:04:01.609> also<00:04:01.639> weird<00:04:02.480> parts<00:04:02.989> of

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
most exciting but also weird parts of

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.659 
most exciting but also weird parts of
the<00:04:03.199> trailer<00:04:03.500> is<00:04:03.799> when<00:04:04.250> there's<00:04:04.400> a<00:04:04.459> big

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:04.669 
the trailer is when there's a big

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.240 
the trailer is when there's a big
tsunami<00:04:04.969> coming<00:04:05.810> in<00:04:06.049> to<00:04:06.439> land<00:04:06.650> and<00:04:06.980> he's<00:04:07.069> on

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
tsunami coming in to land and he's on

the Vox there's just a huge you know
with<00:04:09.560> I<00:04:09.739> think<00:04:10.040> looks<00:04:10.280> absolutely<00:04:10.730> epic<00:04:11.180> you

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
with I think looks absolutely epic you

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.800 
with I think looks absolutely epic you

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
know it just battlefield has l'évolution

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.810 
know it just battlefield has l'évolution
Call<00:04:15.290> of<00:04:15.319> Duty<00:04:15.650> has<00:04:15.739> this<00:04:15.919> big<00:04:16.130> tsunami<00:04:16.340> coming

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
Call of Duty has this big tsunami coming

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.490 
Call of Duty has this big tsunami coming
in<00:04:17.030> I<00:04:17.209> think<00:04:17.720> it<00:04:17.810> looked<00:04:17.989> really<00:04:18.109> good<00:04:18.320> I<00:04:18.380> think

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
in I think it looked really good I think

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.170 
in I think it looked really good I think
it<00:04:18.829> could<00:04:18.949> change<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.310> way<00:04:19.519> the<00:04:19.669> game<00:04:19.699> works

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
it could change the way the game works

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.659 
it could change the way the game works
and<00:04:20.930> he's<00:04:21.139> played<00:04:21.470> really<00:04:22.099> really<00:04:22.250> well

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
and he's played really really well

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.960 
and he's played really really well
although<00:04:23.659> why<00:04:24.229> I<00:04:24.590> think<00:04:24.740> it's<00:04:24.979> weird<00:04:25.280> is<00:04:25.610> that

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
although why I think it's weird is that

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.469 
although why I think it's weird is that
it<00:04:26.300> came<00:04:26.599> in<00:04:26.840> and<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:27.349> tsunami<00:04:27.830> is<00:04:28.039> kind<00:04:28.250> of

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
it came in and the tsunami is kind of

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.610 
it came in and the tsunami is kind of
dissipated<00:04:29.479> really<00:04:29.780> quick<00:04:29.960> it<00:04:30.289> is<00:04:30.380> kind<00:04:30.590> of

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
dissipated really quick it is kind of

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.430 
dissipated really quick it is kind of
disappeared<00:04:31.190> I<00:04:31.430> was<00:04:32.270> expected<00:04:32.750> in<00:04:32.840> the

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
disappeared I was expected in the

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.379 
disappeared I was expected in the
tsunami<00:04:33.889> to<00:04:34.009> like<00:04:34.159> knock<00:04:34.370> him<00:04:34.580> over<00:04:34.669> or<00:04:35.090> kill

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
tsunami to like knock him over or kill

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
him but it hit the Valk and then it kind

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.730

of just died I don't know why that
happened<00:04:39.979> that's<00:04:40.880> definitely<00:04:41.060> not<00:04:41.300> going<00:04:41.419> to

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
happened that's definitely not going to

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.600 
happened that's definitely not going to
happen<00:04:41.599> in<00:04:41.810> real<00:04:41.930> life<00:04:42.020> and<00:04:42.500> so<00:04:43.159> that<00:04:43.280> was<00:04:43.400> kind

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
happen in real life and so that was kind

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.670 
happen in real life and so that was kind
of<00:04:43.639> a<00:04:43.729> weird<00:04:44.030> part<00:04:44.389> to<00:04:44.630> wear<00:04:44.870> this<00:04:45.320> you<00:04:45.500> know

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
I'm a bit maybe it was a book if it is a

awesome though like if they could have
earthquakes<00:04:56.539> in<00:04:56.690> the<00:04:56.780> game<00:04:56.960> they<00:04:57.469> kind<00:04:57.740> of<00:04:57.860> had

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
always programmed like if you see like

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.800 
always programmed like if you see like
the<00:05:43.490> buildings<00:05:43.850> fall<00:05:44.060> down<00:05:44.240> in<00:05:44.360> battlefield

the buildings fall down in battlefield

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.930 
the buildings fall down in battlefield
you're<00:05:45.410> always<00:05:45.530> go<00:05:45.710> down<00:05:45.830> in<00:05:46.040> one<00:05:46.370> way<00:05:46.640> they

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
you're always go down in one way they

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.340 
you're always go down in one way they
always<00:05:47.060> get<00:05:47.240> down<00:05:47.420> when<00:05:47.630> someone<00:05:47.930> does<00:05:48.110> this

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
always get down when someone does this

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.980 
always get down when someone does this
you<00:05:49.040> know<00:05:49.220> the<00:05:49.910> water<00:05:50.120> always<00:05:50.390> comes<00:05:50.690> in<00:05:50.810> this

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
you know the water always comes in this

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.960 
you know the water always comes in this
way<00:05:51.170> it's<00:05:51.500> always<00:05:51.680> the<00:05:51.830> same<00:05:51.860> thing<00:05:52.040> but<00:05:52.550> I

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
way it's always the same thing but I

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.630 
way it's always the same thing but I
think<00:05:53.240> you<00:05:53.450> know<00:05:53.620> if<00:05:54.620> you<00:05:54.740> could<00:05:54.890> have<00:05:55.010> like

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
think you know if you could have like

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.200 
think you know if you could have like
dynamic<00:05:57.010> type<00:05:58.010> of<00:05:58.160> volcano<00:05:58.340> things<00:05:59.000> where

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
dynamic type of volcano things where

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.910 
dynamic type of volcano things where
they<00:05:59.330> go<00:05:59.480> off<00:05:59.630> in<00:05:59.780> random<00:06:00.140> directions<00:06:00.170> and

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:00.920 
they go off in random directions and

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.400 
they go off in random directions and
lava<00:06:01.460> can<00:06:01.700> go<00:06:01.820> anywhere<00:06:02.030> in<00:06:02.150> the<00:06:02.240> map<00:06:02.420> maybe

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
lava can go anywhere in the map maybe

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.870 
lava can go anywhere in the map maybe
not<00:06:03.560> cover<00:06:03.800> the<00:06:03.860> whole<00:06:04.100> the<00:06:04.280> map<00:06:04.430> was<00:06:04.640> covering

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
not cover the whole the map was covering

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.670 
not cover the whole the map was covering
certain<00:06:05.210> parts<00:06:05.600> so<00:06:05.780> it<00:06:05.810> just<00:06:06.260> randomly

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
certain parts so it just randomly

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.230 
certain parts so it just randomly
chooses<00:06:07.100> what<00:06:07.280> part<00:06:07.520> enough<00:06:07.730> to<00:06:07.820> cover<00:06:07.970> I

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
chooses what part enough to cover I

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.840 
chooses what part enough to cover I
think<00:06:09.080> that<00:06:09.290> would<00:06:09.410> be<00:06:09.530> a<00:06:09.650> key<00:06:09.980> feature<00:06:10.460> to

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
think that would be a key feature to

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.420 
think that would be a key feature to
call<00:06:11.000> duty<00:06:11.270> I<00:06:11.630> would<00:06:12.200> Excel<00:06:12.590> that<00:06:12.770> a<00:06:12.890> lot<00:06:13.220> lot

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
call duty I would Excel that a lot lot

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.660 
call duty I would Excel that a lot lot
further<00:06:13.700> than<00:06:13.880> what<00:06:14.600> it's<00:06:14.750> doing<00:06:14.960> right<00:06:15.200> now

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:15.670 
further than what it's doing right now

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.070 
further than what it's doing right now
I've<00:06:16.670> got<00:06:16.880> an<00:06:16.940> upcoming<00:06:17.150> video<00:06:17.360> or<00:06:17.810> where<00:06:18.050> I

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
I've got an upcoming video or where I

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.780 
I've got an upcoming video or where I
think<00:06:18.380> the<00:06:18.470> future<00:06:18.680> of<00:06:18.860> collagen<00:06:19.250> is<00:06:19.400> going

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:19.790 
think the future of collagen is going

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.520 
think the future of collagen is going
what's<00:06:20.510> going<00:06:20.660> to<00:06:20.750> it<00:06:20.840> this<00:06:20.960> video<00:06:21.230> but<00:06:21.440> I've

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
what's going to it this video but I've

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.890 
what's going to it this video but I've
decided<00:06:21.800> you<00:06:22.400> know<00:06:22.550> just<00:06:22.880> you<00:06:23.330> guys<00:06:23.510> might<00:06:23.780> not

decided you know just you guys might not

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.360 
decided you know just you guys might not
be<00:06:24.020> interested<00:06:24.170> in<00:06:24.380> that<00:06:24.410> type<00:06:24.620> of<00:06:24.680> thing<00:06:24.920> some
