00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
Galaxy Nexus this is for the gsm version

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.450 
Galaxy Nexus this is for the gsm version
the<00:00:08.970> i9250<00:00:09.599> this<00:00:09.929> will<00:00:10.110> not<00:00:10.349> fit<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.769> verizon

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
the i9250 this will not fit the verizon

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.789 
the i9250 this will not fit the verizon
version<00:00:11.630> of<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.809> nexus<00:00:12.960> 6<00:00:13.410> see<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.620> back

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
version of the nexus 6 see the back

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.450 
version of the nexus 6 see the back
there<00:00:14.179> fairly<00:00:15.179> standard<00:00:16.130> okay<00:00:17.130> let's<00:00:17.340> just

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
there fairly standard okay let's just

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.670 
there fairly standard okay let's just
pop<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.410> original<00:00:19.410> battery<00:00:19.680> cover<00:00:20.609> off<00:00:20.880> and

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
pop the original battery cover off and

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.730 
pop the original battery cover off and
compare<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.830> two<00:00:24.199> so<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.289> can<00:00:25.380> see<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
compare the two so you can see that the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.279 
compare the two so you can see that the
metal<00:00:26.220> one<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.580> actually<00:00:27.019> thicker<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.170> is

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
metal one is actually thicker this is

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.950 
metal one is actually thicker this is
because<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:28.680> actually<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:29.359> plastic<00:00:30.359> back

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
because it's actually a plastic back

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.010 
because it's actually a plastic back
cover<00:00:31.230> with<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> metal<00:00:31.949> sheet<00:00:32.279> on<00:00:32.489> top<00:00:32.870> so<00:00:33.870> it's

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
cover with a metal sheet on top so it's

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.360 
cover with a metal sheet on top so it's
just<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.230> bit<00:00:34.350> thicker<00:00:34.559> follows<00:00:34.860> all<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.010> bait

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
just a bit thicker follows all the bait

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.930 
just a bit thicker follows all the bait
same<00:00:36.030> basic<00:00:36.380> curves<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:37.739> on<00:00:37.950> now<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.850> is

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
same basic curves and so on now it is

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.910 
same basic curves and so on now it is
quite<00:00:39.329> hard<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.660> fit<00:00:39.930> because<00:00:40.290> usually<00:00:40.530> when<00:00:40.860> i

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
quite hard to fit because usually when i

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.209 
quite hard to fit because usually when i
put<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.930> standard<00:00:42.930> back<00:00:43.020> Sean<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.260> kind<00:00:44.160> of

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
put the standard back Sean I kind of

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.760 
put the standard back Sean I kind of
bend<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.879> clip<00:00:45.090> those<00:00:45.239> last<00:00:45.870> two<00:00:46.170> little

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
bend it in to clip those last two little

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.590 
bend it in to clip those last two little
clips<00:00:46.950> down<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.190> bottom<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:48.270> with<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
clips down the bottom in but with the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.000 
clips down the bottom in but with the
metal<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.020> can't<00:00:49.260> do<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:49.920> kind

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
metal you can't do that so you just kind

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.830 
metal you can't do that so you just kind
of<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.370> be<00:00:50.640> careful<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.180> work<00:00:51.480> around<00:00:51.750> a

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
of have to be careful that work around a

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.650 
of have to be careful that work around a
bit<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.370> as<00:00:53.370> you'll<00:00:53.520> see<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.789> second<00:00:54.149> not

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
bit and as you'll see in a second not

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.660 
bit and as you'll see in a second not
all<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> clips<00:00:55.289> fit<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.100> one<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.489> I

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
all of the clips fit on the one I have I

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.720 
all of the clips fit on the one I have I
don't<00:00:56.850> know<00:00:56.940> if<00:00:57.000> that's<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> scene<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.629> all

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
don't know if that's the scene with all

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
you can see fits perfectly when you're

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.899 
you can see fits perfectly when you're
looking<00:01:12.869> at<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.110> from<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.380> distance<00:01:13.830> or<00:01:14.700> cut

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
looking at it from this distance or cut

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.910 
looking at it from this distance or cut
some<00:01:15.119> macro<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.509> second<00:01:15.869> will<00:01:15.960> show<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.229> but

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
some macro in a second will show you but

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.130 
some macro in a second will show you but
it<00:01:17.009> isn't<00:01:17.250> actually<00:01:17.340> fit<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:18.000> well<00:01:18.080> okay<00:01:19.080> so

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
it isn't actually fit that well okay so

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.780 
it isn't actually fit that well okay so
here<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.500> go<00:01:19.530> here's<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.950> macro<00:01:20.280> now<00:01:20.400> one

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
here you go here's the macro now one

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.940 
here you go here's the macro now one
side<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.479> absolutely<00:01:22.229> fine<00:01:22.439> nothing

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
side of it is absolutely fine nothing

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.510 
side of it is absolutely fine nothing
wrong<00:01:23.070> with<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.250> at<00:01:23.460> all<00:01:24.080> as<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.520> fits

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
wrong with it at all as you can see fits

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.980 
wrong with it at all as you can see fits
perfectly<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.939> little<00:01:27.180> bit<00:01:27.270> raised<00:01:27.509> at<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.750> top

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
perfectly a little bit raised at the top

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.859 
perfectly a little bit raised at the top
there<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:28.380> that's<00:01:28.470> not<00:01:28.650> too<00:01:28.829> much<00:01:28.860> for<00:01:29.159> worry

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
there but that's not too much for worry

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.140 
there but that's not too much for worry
and<00:01:30.869> along<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> top<00:01:31.560> here<00:01:31.909> okay<00:01:32.909> with<00:01:33.060> this

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
and along the top here okay with this

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.399 
and along the top here okay with this
side<00:01:34.549> most<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.790> clips<00:01:36.060> won't<00:01:36.509> actually<00:01:36.990> go

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
side most of the clips won't actually go

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.580 
side most of the clips won't actually go
into<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.070> holes<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.600> bottom<00:01:39.869> one<00:01:40.049> which

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
into the holes so the bottom one which

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.370 
into the holes so the bottom one which
you'll<00:01:40.770> see<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.220> second<00:01:41.579> if<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:43.049> know<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
you'll see in a second if you know the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.990 
you'll see in a second if you know the
Nexus<00:01:43.740> you'll<00:01:43.950> know<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.430> bottom<00:01:44.670> one

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
Nexus you'll know that that bottom one

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.550 
Nexus you'll know that that bottom one
is<00:01:45.030> kind<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.570> hooked<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.140> should<00:01:46.290> slide

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
is kind of hooked and you should slide

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.200 
is kind of hooked and you should slide
it<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:46.799> from<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.009> top<00:01:47.250> now<00:01:47.759> no<00:01:47.909> matter<00:01:48.000> how

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
it in from the top now no matter how

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.609 
it in from the top now no matter how
many<00:01:48.360> times<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.630> trap<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.110> couldn't<00:01:49.409> get<00:01:49.560> it

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
many times a trap I just couldn't get it

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.340 
many times a trap I just couldn't get it
to<00:01:49.799> fit<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.299> goes<00:01:52.079> up<00:01:52.259> this

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
to fit in and it just goes up this

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.380 
to fit in and it just goes up this
hallway<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:52.950> then<00:01:52.979> as<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.610> result<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.090> think<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
hallway and then as a result I think the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.530 
hallway and then as a result I think the
whole<00:01:54.570> side<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:56.640> raised<00:01:56.880> as<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.360> see

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
whole side is just raised as you can see

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.060 
whole side is just raised as you can see
pushing<00:01:58.020> down<00:01:58.170> won't<00:01:58.409> get<00:01:58.590> them<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.770> clip<00:01:58.920> in

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
pushing down won't get them to clip in

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.380 
pushing down won't get them to clip in
and<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.640> can<00:01:59.759> see<00:01:59.850> actually<00:01:59.939> they're<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
and you can see actually they're the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.999 
and you can see actually they're the
metal<00:02:00.570> was<00:02:00.990> actually<00:02:01.320> separating<00:02:01.829> from<00:02:01.920> the

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
metal was actually separating from the

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.190 
metal was actually separating from the
plastic<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> little<00:02:02.610> bit<00:02:02.729> there<00:02:02.880> which<00:02:03.060> is

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
plastic a little bit there which is

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.510 
plastic a little bit there which is
worrying<00:02:04.200> okay<00:02:04.710> it's<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.950> samsung<00:02:05.130> logo

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
worrying okay it's the samsung logo

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.830 
worrying okay it's the samsung logo
there<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:08.280> google<00:02:08.580> one<00:02:08.670> as<00:02:08.819> well

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
there and the google one as well

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.059 
there and the google one as well
see<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.929> man's<00:02:11.080> got<00:02:11.260> a<00:02:11.290> nice<00:02:11.500> texture<00:02:11.920> to<00:02:11.950> it

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
see the man's got a nice texture to it

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.190 
see the man's got a nice texture to it
though<00:02:12.360> okay<00:02:13.360> but<00:02:13.510> here's<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.720> real<00:02:13.930> deal

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
though okay but here's the real deal

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.520 
though okay but here's the real deal
breaker<00:02:14.470> with<00:02:14.709> this<00:02:15.010> cover<00:02:15.489> now<00:02:16.360> being<00:02:17.170> metal

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
breaker with this cover now being metal

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.839 
breaker with this cover now being metal
you'd<00:02:17.680> expect<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.099> to<00:02:18.160> maybe<00:02:18.280> hamper<00:02:18.730> your

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
you'd expect it to maybe hamper your

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.240 
you'd expect it to maybe hamper your
signal<00:02:19.239> a<00:02:19.300> little<00:02:19.510> bit<00:02:19.739> it<00:02:20.739> doesn't<00:02:21.010> seem<00:02:21.099> to

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
signal a little bit it doesn't seem to

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.070 
signal a little bit it doesn't seem to
affect<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.640> signal<00:02:21.970> too<00:02:22.090> much<00:02:22.300> you<00:02:22.840> can<00:02:22.989> see

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
affect the signal too much you can see

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.930 
affect the signal too much you can see
I've<00:02:23.170> got<00:02:23.319> a<00:02:23.349> minus<00:02:23.739> ninety<00:02:24.040> nine<00:02:24.220> decibels

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
I've got a minus ninety nine decibels

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.740 
I've got a minus ninety nine decibels
per<00:02:25.000> meter<00:02:26.190> strength<00:02:27.190> there<00:02:27.510> which<00:02:28.510> at<00:02:28.690> the

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
per meter strength there which at the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.000 
per meter strength there which at the
moment<00:02:28.810> is<00:02:29.020> quite<00:02:29.230> good<00:02:29.410> considering<00:02:29.800> my

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
moment is quite good considering my

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.190 
moment is quite good considering my
carrots<00:02:30.430> having<00:02:30.819> problems<00:02:31.300> but<00:02:31.900> we'll<00:02:32.020> file

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
carrots having problems but we'll file

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.870 
carrots having problems but we'll file
out<00:02:32.319> the<00:02:32.380> GPS<00:02:32.830> test<00:02:33.160> here<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.550> you'll<00:02:33.670> see

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
out the GPS test here and you'll see

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.420 
out the GPS test here and you'll see
that<00:02:33.910> actually<00:02:34.480> what<00:02:34.660> this<00:02:34.900> metal<00:02:35.319> back<00:02:36.100> does

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
that actually what this metal back does

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.020 
that actually what this metal back does
is<00:02:36.700> completely<00:02:37.330> kill<00:02:37.600> your<00:02:37.989> GPS<00:02:38.849> so<00:02:39.849> as<00:02:39.910> you

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
is completely kill your GPS so as you

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.210 
is completely kill your GPS so as you
can<00:02:40.120> see<00:02:40.330> there<00:02:40.540> it's<00:02:40.690> got<00:02:40.900> four<00:02:41.680> satellites

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
can see there it's got four satellites

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.910 
can see there it's got four satellites
in<00:02:42.489> view<00:02:42.640> now<00:02:42.790> but<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:44.140> can't<00:02:44.380> look<00:02:44.500> on<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.800> them

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
in view now but it can't look on to them

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.050 
in view now but it can't look on to them
it<00:02:45.010> can't<00:02:45.190> do<00:02:45.310> anything<00:02:45.489> to<00:02:45.700> see<00:02:45.819> there's<00:02:46.000> a

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
it can't do anything to see there's a

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.120 
it can't do anything to see there's a
signal<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.420> noise<00:02:46.540> ratio<00:02:46.830> just<00:02:47.830> underneath

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
signal to noise ratio just underneath

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.130 
signal to noise ratio just underneath
those<00:02:48.549> are<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:49.360> bar<00:02:49.540> graph<00:02:49.750> they're<00:02:49.930> all<00:02:50.019> it's

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
those are the bar graph they're all it's

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.740 
those are the bar graph they're all it's
got<00:02:50.260> five<00:02:50.970> it's<00:02:51.970> not<00:02:52.090> even<00:02:52.209> on<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.420> scale<00:02:52.720> of

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
got five it's not even on the scale of

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.009 
got five it's not even on the scale of
anything<00:02:53.530> there<00:02:53.709> so<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:55.540> know<00:02:55.690> if<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:55.900> use

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
anything there so you know if you use

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.400 
anything there so you know if you use
GPS<00:02:56.500> at<00:02:56.739> all<00:02:56.980> you<00:02:57.700> can't<00:02:58.180> use<00:02:58.390> this<00:02:58.569> it<00:02:59.260> also

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
GPS at all you can't use this it also

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.470 
GPS at all you can't use this it also
kills<00:02:59.830> NFC<00:03:00.459> I<00:03:00.489> can't<00:03:00.850> show<00:03:01.060> you<00:03:01.120> that<00:03:01.180> right

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
kills NFC I can't show you that right

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.770 
kills NFC I can't show you that right
now<00:03:01.920> but<00:03:02.920> trust<00:03:03.280> me<00:03:03.459> NFC<00:03:04.120> will<00:03:04.420> not<00:03:04.600> work<00:03:04.750> with

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
now but trust me NFC will not work with

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.009 
now but trust me NFC will not work with
this<00:03:06.000> okay<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:07.090> we'll<00:03:07.450> just<00:03:07.480> leave<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:07.750> for<00:03:07.959> a

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
this okay so we'll just leave it for a

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.840 
this okay so we'll just leave it for a
while<00:03:08.110> just<00:03:08.140> see<00:03:08.470> if<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:08.650> can<00:03:08.830> pick<00:03:09.160> up<00:03:09.220> any

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
while just see if it can pick up any

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.729 
while just see if it can pick up any
kind<00:03:10.569> of<00:03:10.690> as<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.930> flash<00:03:11.230> there<00:03:11.410> as<00:03:11.500> I<00:03:11.560> took<00:03:11.620> a

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
kind of as a flash there as I took a

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.160 
kind of as a flash there as I took a
photo<00:03:11.980> so<00:03:12.910> if<00:03:12.970> we<00:03:13.030> can<00:03:13.180> pick<00:03:13.330> up<00:03:13.480> any<00:03:13.660> kind<00:03:13.989> of

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
photo so if we can pick up any kind of

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.940 
photo so if we can pick up any kind of
signal<00:03:15.130> from<00:03:15.280> these<00:03:15.489> satellites<00:03:16.060> but<00:03:16.950> yeah

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
signal from these satellites but yeah

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.920 
signal from these satellites but yeah
it's<00:03:18.310> not<00:03:18.430> going<00:03:18.519> to<00:03:18.609> do<00:03:18.700> much<00:03:18.850> so<00:03:19.540> if<00:03:19.750> you<00:03:19.840> use

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
it's not going to do much so if you use

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.800 
it's not going to do much so if you use
GPS<00:03:20.320> at<00:03:20.470> all<00:03:20.620> don't<00:03:21.130> get<00:03:21.310> this<00:03:24.390> ok<00:03:25.390> now<00:03:25.570> let's

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
GPS at all don't get this ok now let's

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.590 
GPS at all don't get this ok now let's
just<00:03:25.959> compare<00:03:26.290> with<00:03:26.890> the<00:03:27.570> extended<00:03:28.570> battery

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
just compare with the extended battery

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.920 
just compare with the extended battery
so<00:03:29.170> same<00:03:29.680> material<00:03:30.100> as<00:03:30.130> that's<00:03:30.310> normal<00:03:30.609> one

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
so same material as that's normal one

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.960 
so same material as that's normal one
this<00:03:31.930> is<00:03:32.079> exactly<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.680> same<00:03:32.859> spot<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:33.400> it's

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
this is exactly the same spot and it's

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.190 
this is exactly the same spot and it's

usually<00:03:55.930> the<00:03:56.079> GPS<00:03:56.530> is<00:03:56.709> quite<00:03:56.980> bad<00:03:57.190> but<00:03:57.579> you

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
usually the GPS is quite bad but you

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.610 
usually the GPS is quite bad but you
know<00:03:58.480> it's<00:03:58.720> actually<00:03:58.840> got<00:03:59.140> a<00:03:59.170> lock<00:03:59.380> on<00:03:59.470> them

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
know it's actually got a lock on them

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.220 
know it's actually got a lock on them
and<00:04:00.489> there<00:04:00.670> you<00:04:00.730> can<00:04:00.790> see<00:04:00.910> it's<00:04:01.180> thinks<00:04:02.109> I'm

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
and there you can see it's thinks I'm

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.930

going<00:04:02.410> at<00:04:02.560> one<00:04:02.680> mile<00:04:02.859> per<00:04:02.890> hour<00:04:03.100> there<00:04:03.730> goes

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
going at one mile per hour there goes

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.330 
going at one mile per hour there goes
back<00:04:04.150> to<00:04:04.269> zero<00:04:04.450> it's<00:04:04.600> got<00:04:04.780> 60<00:04:05.560> feet<00:04:05.680> accuracy

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
back to zero it's got 60 feet accuracy

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.229 
back to zero it's got 60 feet accuracy
and<00:04:06.660> you<00:04:07.660> it's<00:04:07.959> actually<00:04:08.290> working<00:04:08.470> so<00:04:09.030> it<00:04:10.030> just

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
and you it's actually working so it just

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.759 
and you it's actually working so it just
proves<00:04:10.510> that<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:10.780> metal<00:04:10.959> back<00:04:11.170> is<00:04:11.410> killing

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
proves that the metal back is killing

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.520 
proves that the metal back is killing
