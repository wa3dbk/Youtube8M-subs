journey<00:03:28.810> I<00:03:29.140> have<00:03:29.770> designed<00:03:30.160> my<00:03:30.400> backyard

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
journey I have designed my backyard

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.400 
journey I have designed my backyard
specifically<00:03:31.540> for<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.930> dogs

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
specifically for the dogs

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.430 
specifically for the dogs
I<00:03:33.180> believe<00:03:34.180> dogs<00:03:34.420> really<00:03:34.780> are<00:03:34.900> very<00:03:34.930> much

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
I believe dogs really are very much

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.800 
I believe dogs really are very much
survivors<00:03:36.070> and<00:03:36.340> I<00:03:36.400> think<00:03:36.640> that<00:03:36.850> when<00:03:37.630> they're

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
survivors and I think that when they're

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.120 
survivors and I think that when they're
faced<00:03:38.170> with<00:03:38.200> challenges<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:39.010> are

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
faced with challenges that are

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.460 
faced with challenges that are
uncomfortable<00:03:39.790> they're<00:03:40.210> really<00:03:40.630> adaptable

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
uncomfortable they're really adaptable

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.020 
uncomfortable they're really adaptable
to<00:03:41.680> new<00:03:41.830> situations<00:03:42.130> especially<00:03:42.610> when

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
to new situations especially when

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.480 
to new situations especially when
they're<00:03:43.150> being<00:03:43.300> well<00:03:43.930> loved<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:45.340> know<00:03:45.430> she
