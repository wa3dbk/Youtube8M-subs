now with the radio tray previous radio

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.380 
now with the radio tray previous radio
trays<00:00:46.250> we've<00:00:46.489> always<00:00:46.640> had<00:00:46.940> an<00:00:47.119> actual

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
trays we've always had an actual

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.390 
trays we've always had an actual
transponder<00:00:48.049> mount<00:00:48.229> but<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:48.920> majority<00:00:49.250> of

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
transponder mount but the majority of

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.820 
transponder mount but the majority of
our<00:00:49.580> drivers<00:00:50.030> always<00:00:50.390> end<00:00:50.600> up<00:00:50.750> putting<00:00:50.930> the

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
our drivers always end up putting the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.000 
our drivers always end up putting the
transponder<00:00:52.640> in<00:00:53.210> your<00:00:53.449> receiver<00:00:53.780> box<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.949> I'm

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
transponder in your receiver box so I'm

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.439 
transponder in your receiver box so I'm
going<00:00:55.129> to<00:00:55.190> show<00:00:55.339> you<00:00:55.400> kind<00:00:55.640> of<00:00:55.760> how<00:00:55.820> I<00:00:55.909> route<00:00:56.269> my

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
going to show you kind of how I route my

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.770 
going to show you kind of how I route my
wires<00:00:57.040> and<00:00:58.040> where<00:00:58.250> my<00:00:58.400> personal<00:00:59.150> transponder

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
wires and where my personal transponder

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:11.020 
wires and where my personal transponder
is<00:00:59.839> located

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.490 

as<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.240> see<00:01:12.420> here<00:01:12.660> it's<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:13.080> kind<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.410> a

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
as you see here it's it's kind of a

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.070 
as you see here it's it's kind of a
tight<00:01:13.710> fit

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
tight fit

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.540 
tight fit
especially<00:01:16.080> with<00:01:16.260> with<00:01:16.740> how<00:01:16.950> long<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.340> wires

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
especially with with how long the wires

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.730 
especially with with how long the wires
are<00:01:17.910> that<00:01:18.120> that<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.750> my<00:01:18.780> servos<00:01:19.230> but<00:01:19.530> I

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
are that that I have on my servos but I

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.290 
are that that I have on my servos but I
use<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.850> spectrum<00:01:21.240> 35:20<00:01:22.200> receiver<00:01:23.210> then<00:01:24.210> my

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
use the spectrum 35:20 receiver then my

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.480 
use the spectrum 35:20 receiver then my
personal<00:01:24.500> transponder<00:01:25.500> actually<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.340> this

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
personal transponder actually in this

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.010 
personal transponder actually in this
vehicle<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:27.120> it's<00:01:27.390> one<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.720> older

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
vehicle it's it's one of the older

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.320 
vehicle it's it's one of the older
larger<00:01:28.290> transponders<00:01:29.190> but<00:01:29.760> I<00:01:29.820> just<00:01:30.030> cut<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
larger transponders but I just cut the

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.240 
larger transponders but I just cut the
tabs<00:01:30.570> off<00:01:30.870> and<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.230> fits<00:01:31.410> nicely<00:01:31.740> right

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
tabs off and it fits nicely right

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.080 
tabs off and it fits nicely right
alongside<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:34.470> receiver<00:01:34.950> there<00:01:35.160> everything

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
alongside the receiver there everything

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.910 
alongside the receiver there everything
is<00:01:36.240> pretty<00:01:36.480> tight<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.960> secure<00:01:37.440> that<00:01:37.710> way<00:01:37.860> you

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
is pretty tight and secure that way you

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.620 
is pretty tight and secure that way you
don't<00:01:38.160> have<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.400> worry<00:01:38.550> about<00:01:38.670> any<00:01:38.910> vibration

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
don't have to worry about any vibration

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.320 
don't have to worry about any vibration
or<00:01:39.960> things<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:41.280> know<00:01:41.400> bouncing<00:01:41.850> or<00:01:41.970> banging

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
or things you know bouncing or banging

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.590 
or things you know bouncing or banging
into<00:01:42.570> one<00:01:42.720> another<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.370> then<00:01:44.370> here<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.330> have

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
into one another and then here I have

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.980 
into one another and then here I have
just<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:46.230> loose<00:01:46.440> tray<00:01:46.800> but<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:48.270> wires<00:01:48.510> come<00:01:48.840> out

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
just a loose tray but the wires come out

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.720 
just a loose tray but the wires come out
of<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.290> backside<00:01:49.800> of<00:01:49.980> the<00:01:50.070> servo<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.640> I've

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
of this backside of the servo and I've

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.310 
of this backside of the servo and I've
had<00:01:50.910> a<00:01:50.940> few<00:01:51.150> people<00:01:51.450> asked<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.870> they<00:01:51.990> run<00:01:52.230> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
had a few people asked you they run the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.770 
had a few people asked you they run the
wires<00:01:52.530> under<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.160> servo<00:01:53.730> I<00:01:53.940> actually<00:01:54.390> just

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
wires under the servo I actually just

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.080 
wires under the servo I actually just
wrapped<00:01:55.560> them<00:01:55.800> tightly<00:01:56.160> around<00:01:56.400> this<00:01:56.760> post

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
wrapped them tightly around this post

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.170 
wrapped them tightly around this post
here<00:01:58.070> that<00:01:59.070> way<00:01:59.220> it<00:01:59.340> can't<00:01:59.580> get<00:01:59.700> pinched

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
here that way it can't get pinched

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.420 
here that way it can't get pinched
underneath<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:00.870> the<00:02:01.500> wires<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:01.860> go<00:02:02.160> right

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
underneath so the wires just go right

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.030 
underneath so the wires just go right
around<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:02.820> post<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.420> then<00:02:03.510> into<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.770> slot

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
around this post and then into the slot

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.540 
around this post and then into the slot
that<00:02:05.070> we<00:02:05.370> have<00:02:05.490> cut<00:02:05.790> before<00:02:06.150> that<00:02:07.399> the<00:02:08.399> other

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
that we have cut before that the other

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.520 
that we have cut before that the other
thing<00:02:08.850> that<00:02:08.880> that<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.600> have<00:02:09.840> questions<00:02:10.410> about

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
thing that that I have questions about

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.010 
thing that that I have questions about
every<00:02:10.920> now<00:02:11.040> and<00:02:11.250> then<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:12.270> angle<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.870> the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
every now and then is the angle of the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.150 
every now and then is the angle of the
linkage<00:02:13.850> now<00:02:14.850> here<00:02:15.570> I<00:02:15.600> have<00:02:15.720> my<00:02:15.989> car<00:02:16.739> set<00:02:17.040> up

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
linkage now here I have my car set up

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
linkage now here I have my car set up
with<00:02:18.140> engine<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.320> everything<00:02:19.410> in<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:20.180> and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
with engine and everything in it and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.540 
with engine and everything in it and
you'll<00:02:21.480> notice<00:02:21.690> on<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.230> radio<00:02:22.500> tray<00:02:22.920> there's

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
you'll notice on the radio tray there's

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.750 
you'll notice on the radio tray there's
actually<00:02:24.060> an<00:02:24.180> indication<00:02:24.630> line<00:02:25.110> on<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.459> tray

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
actually an indication line on the tray

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.550 
actually an indication line on the tray
and<00:02:27.120> then<00:02:27.540> also<00:02:27.780> on<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.110> horn

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
and then also on the horn

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.090 
and then also on the horn
so<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:30.510> throttle<00:02:30.930> horn<00:02:31.170> will<00:02:31.350> actually<00:02:31.709> be<00:02:31.950> at

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
so the throttle horn will actually be at

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.190 
so the throttle horn will actually be at
a<00:02:32.130> slight<00:02:32.489> angle<00:02:32.970> but<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.540> just<00:02:33.780> want<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.050> make

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
a slight angle but you just want to make

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.770 
a slight angle but you just want to make
sure<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.739> these<00:02:35.459> this<00:02:35.880> indication<00:02:36.300> line<00:02:36.630> on

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
sure that these this indication line on

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.800 
sure that these this indication line on
the<00:02:36.870> horn<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.830> tray<00:02:38.070> line<00:02:38.340> up<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:39.600> then

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
the horn and the tray line up and then

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
here now what that will do is it starts

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.140 
here now what that will do is it starts
this<00:02:59.489> at<00:02:59.730> a<00:03:00.000> slight<00:03:00.390> angle<00:03:00.660> but<00:03:01.590> when<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:02.150> go

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
this at a slight angle but when you go

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.470 
this at a slight angle but when you go
to<00:03:03.180> full<00:03:03.630> throttle<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:05.250> will<00:03:05.580> pull<00:03:06.360> the

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
to full throttle it will pull the

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.710 
to full throttle it will pull the
carburetor<00:03:07.820> really<00:03:08.820> really<00:03:09.090> straight<00:03:09.450> where

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
carburetor really really straight where

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.710 
carburetor really really straight where
if<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:09.959> start<00:03:10.290> with<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.310> horn<00:03:11.550> straight<00:03:12.030> it

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
if you start with the horn straight it

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.560 
if you start with the horn straight it
starts<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.380> wrap<00:03:13.650> or<00:03:13.980> Bend<00:03:14.310> around<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:15.090> then

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
rub on the linkage a little bit so

there's<00:03:30.170> plenty<00:03:30.560> of<00:03:30.590> clearance<00:03:31.160> and<00:03:31.580> and

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
there's plenty of clearance and and

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.709 
there's plenty of clearance and and
that's<00:03:32.810> pretty<00:03:33.020> much<00:03:33.140> how<00:03:33.260> it<00:03:33.470> works
