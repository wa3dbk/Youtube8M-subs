then but also a ruggedized system as you

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.530 
then but also a ruggedized system as you
know<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:15.580> from<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.020> Panasonic<00:02:17.020> Toughbook<00:02:18.540> at

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.090 
know it from the Panasonic Toughbook at
the<00:02:19.720> inside<00:02:19.990> there's<00:02:20.230> an<00:02:20.380> Intel<00:02:20.680> Core<00:02:20.950> i5

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
the inside there's an Intel Core i5

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.300 
the inside there's an Intel Core i5
processor<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:22.270> about<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:23.050> RAM<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.590> storage

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
processor and about the RAM and storage

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.050 
processor and about the RAM and storage
there<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.270> course<00:02:25.570> several<00:02:27.060> configurations

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
there of course several configurations

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.820 
there of course several configurations
and<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:29.620> starting<00:02:30.040> price<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:31.110> $2,000<00:02:32.110> so<00:02:32.440> it's

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
and the starting price is $2,000 so it's

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.250 
and the starting price is $2,000 so it's
not<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.280> cheapest<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:34.480> if<00:02:34.600> you<00:02:34.750> want<00:02:35.080> some

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
not the cheapest so if you want some

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.690 
not the cheapest so if you want some
ruggedized<00:02:35.800> mobile<00:02:36.900> Ultrabook<00:02:37.930> maybe<00:02:38.860> should

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
ruggedized mobile Ultrabook maybe should

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.550 
ruggedized mobile Ultrabook maybe should
have<00:02:39.880> a<00:02:39.910> look<00:02:40.150> at<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.960> panasonic<00:02:41.530> CF<00:02:41.860> ax2
