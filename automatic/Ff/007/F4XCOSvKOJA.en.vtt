00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
some levels like dump the champ which

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.840 
some levels like dump the champ which
we'll<00:02:06.690> go<00:02:06.930> through<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.230> second<00:02:07.700> they<00:02:08.700> can

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
we'll go through in a second they can

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.190 
we'll go through in a second they can
actually<00:02:08.970> suck<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.480> into<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.840> water<00:02:10.050> and

kill you

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.940 
kill you
which<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:11.010> really<00:02:11.430> annoying<00:02:12.290> we'll<00:02:13.290> just<00:02:13.440> get

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
which is really annoying we'll just get

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.290 
which is really annoying we'll just get
these<00:02:14.100> stuff<00:02:14.880> out

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
these stuff out

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.000 
these stuff out
oh<00:02:15.330> we<00:02:15.960> missed<00:02:16.200> some<00:02:16.320> treasure<00:02:16.590> chests<00:02:16.890> down

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
oh we missed some treasure chests down

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.860 
oh we missed some treasure chests down
there<00:02:17.220> when<00:02:17.400> we<00:02:17.760> get<00:02:17.880> some<00:02:18.120> even<00:02:18.780> though

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
there when we get some even though

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.240 
there when we get some even though
probably<00:02:19.110> have<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.380> go<00:02:19.710> back<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.130> later

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
probably have to go back to that later

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.430 
probably have to go back to that later
if<00:02:20.430> we<00:02:20.520> miss<00:02:20.700> anything

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440

anyway<00:02:47.590> I'm<00:02:47.739> smashing<00:02:48.550> these<00:02:48.720> Jess<00:02:51.060> um<00:02:52.060> let's

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
anyway I'm smashing these Jess um let's

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.059 
anyway I'm smashing these Jess um let's
answer<00:02:52.690> some<00:02:52.840> questions<00:02:53.440> I<00:02:53.620> didn't<00:02:53.860> get<00:02:53.980> to

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
answer some questions I didn't get to

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.710 
answer some questions I didn't get to
answer<00:02:54.310> them<00:02:54.430> in<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.790> last<00:02:55.000> couple<00:02:55.239> of<00:02:55.390> parts

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
answer them in the last couple of parts

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.059 
answer them in the last couple of parts
all<00:02:55.930> of<00:02:56.050> them<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:58.780> easiest<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.349> control<00:02:59.470> spire

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
all of them the easiest to control spire

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.449 
all of them the easiest to control spire
the<00:03:00.340> game<00:03:00.489> with<00:03:00.640> easiest<00:03:01.030> to<00:03:01.090> control<00:03:01.209> spire<00:03:01.690> I

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
the game with easiest to control spire I

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.960 
the game with easiest to control spire I
say<00:03:03.459> that<00:03:04.209> that<00:03:04.900> would<00:03:05.019> be<00:03:05.080> probably<00:03:05.620> spire<00:03:06.610> to

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
say that that would be probably spire to

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.040 
say that that would be probably spire to
because<00:03:07.269> you<00:03:07.360> have<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.510> double<00:03:07.750> jump<00:03:07.900> I<00:03:08.019> think

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
because you have the double jump I think

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.290 
because you have the double jump I think
you<00:03:08.290> mentioned<00:03:08.440> something<00:03:08.920> like<00:03:08.950> that<00:03:09.300> but

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
you mentioned something like that but

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.960 
you mentioned something like that but
really<00:03:10.840> I<00:03:11.170> don't<00:03:11.410> really<00:03:11.790> see<00:03:12.790> much

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
really I don't really see much

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.370 
really I don't really see much
difference<00:03:13.390> to<00:03:13.510> be<00:03:13.569> honest<00:03:13.810> I've<00:03:13.989> noticed

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
difference to be honest I've noticed

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.110 
difference to be honest I've noticed
fire<00:03:14.530> one<00:03:14.739> sort<00:03:14.980> of<00:03:15.040> has<00:03:15.160> a<00:03:15.190> kind<00:03:15.970> of<00:03:16.060> different

types of chests in Safari one that they

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.560 
types of chests in Safari one that they
think<00:04:38.650> keep<00:04:38.920> at<00:04:39.130> all<00:04:39.280> Wichita's<00:04:40.090> ones<00:04:40.360> where

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
think keep at all Wichita's ones where

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.940

you are flying them and the crystal
comes<00:04:42.820> out<00:04:43.030> as<00:04:43.300> you<00:04:43.420> may<00:04:43.990> be<00:04:44.050> saying<00:04:44.290> if<00:04:44.470> the

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
comes out as you may be saying if the

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.300

jump<00:04:45.190> and<00:04:45.310> get<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:45.520> crystal<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:47.230> there<00:04:48.040> is

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
jump and get the crystal and there is

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.330

the<00:04:48.810> those<00:04:49.810> boxes<00:04:50.230> I<00:04:50.350> got<00:04:50.800> if<00:04:51.160> there's

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
with the super charge I guess that

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.430 
with the super charge I guess that
classifies<00:05:00.760> the<00:05:01.060> number<00:05:01.330> type<00:05:01.510> of<00:05:01.690> crate<00:05:02.200> or

um I think it triggers when you get this

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.740 
um I think it triggers when you get this
dragon<00:06:12.400> and<00:06:12.580> I<00:06:12.640> hadn't<00:06:12.940> got<00:06:13.060> it<00:06:13.150> yet<00:06:13.330> anyway
