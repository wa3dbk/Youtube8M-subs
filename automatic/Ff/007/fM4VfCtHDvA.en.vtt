00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.820
 one of the most important innovations of the 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:13.490
 latest versions of garageband for ipad e 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.190
 which is open to audio buses which is an app 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.590
 very particular that allows more ap 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.390
 audio to collaborate with each other and 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.820
 therefore they increase enormously 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.579
 possibility of working with the iPad 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.710
 let's see then as a bus official with 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:31.189
 a very simple project 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.050
 we will insert a track in the garage band 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.570
 played by an instrument that is not in 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.030
 garage band we will take for example a 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.660
 percussion loop I then tap 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.420
 audio bus icon and behold 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.920
 graphically the operation of this 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.899
 very linear 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.780
 there are apps that I can use as 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.660
 input the virtual instrument apps but 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.050
 there are also recorders for example 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.359
 app that I can use as an up effect 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.109
 those that process the sound produced 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.670
 dap input and then there are output apps 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.440
 as a garage band itself that me 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.210
 allow you to manage everything that is 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.240
 been produced by the processed input 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.610
 not all apps are from the httphs 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.680
 compatible with buses 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.560
 garageband up to a few versions do 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.630
 it was for example to know which apps 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.780
 we can use then load like 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.390
 fax input or output 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:31.000
 just do in the lower bar tap up 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:34.250
 acs here we would go to the site of 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.259
 bus and we will see the list of 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.090
 all apps compatible with the link 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.329
 to the psto to download it 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:46.369
 directly from there we tap on 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:48.469
 connections to return to audio bus one 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.700
 very convenient function of buses and that 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:54.700
 if we tap on the input or on effects 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.590
 of output is selected automatically 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.840
 all the apps in our ipad 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.560
 which we can then use if I do 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.759
 tap on the input plus I immediately get a 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.469
 list of apps I can use 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.990
 as input 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.150
 first there is the microphone and then there are 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.959
 the various apps for example that of honey 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.750
 mood that synthesizer q bases which is the 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.170
 ipad version 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.330
 bass and that has within the 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.170
 virtual tools that I could use like 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.830
 input and then there are two apps that are 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.780
 both 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.710
 percussion loops and they are both 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:37.360
 free indeed we will use these for the 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:42.220
 today's project I select look then 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.709
 mash free as input and then I go 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.200
 on the output you can also use another one 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:50.280
 of effects but just to simplify the 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.830
 project we will only use input and output 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.250
 I click output to see which ones 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.110
 app can use in this role and 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.630
 besides the speakers I have two 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.459
 q bases that we have seen before and 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.040
 There are indeed garageband 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.700
 apps that can act as input outputs 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.530
 or from input and has effects depending on 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.840
 of the characteristics of each for the 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.410
 I will find myself in one or more of these groups 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.160
 do not choose depends connect the gar 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.730
 two apps 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:26.680
 but I have to wake them up so to speak and there 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:28.510
 we reveal by tapping on the z for 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.850
 this is back to audio bus 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:36.720
 right tongue and I do nothing but 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:40.480
 tap on the icon and then on the arrow 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.070
 here I am back to the connections then 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:49.980
 I do the same with garageband for 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:53.620
 wake her up and take advantage of it too 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.810
 coming back to add a new one 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:02.200
 project by tapping on the plus sign in 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:04.209
 top left new song and choose between 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.549
 the tools available to you 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.799
 audio recorder because it is via audio 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:13.329
 recorder that records and resumes the sound 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:17.169
 produced by percussion asp then 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:22.419
 I choose this instrument and return audio 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:24.430
 bus by tapping on the relevant icon e 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.229
 so on the arrow we are here again 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.360
 we have connected our apps 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.249
 from the animation we see the flow of 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.839
 sound and we can start 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:34.509
 do our job and so if 

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:36.939
 no input app to open it 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:39.759
 start recording to record not 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:42.339
 I have to do is tap the icon 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:43.659
 by carl benz and at this point I will have no 

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:45.519
 only the icon with the arrow that 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:47.499
 we have seen before to pass 

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:50.079
 to the face but also the keys that I have 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:52.989
 allow you to record rewind 

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:55.659
 the execution to listen to it again without having to 

00:04:52.989 --> 00:04:57.669
 return to the garageband interface 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:01.089
 so if you tap on the button 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.619
 recording and play I will record 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:05.139
 exactly what I put into play 

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:08.919
 when I want to finish playback 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:11.969
 I stop both on and by pressing the 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.969
 recording button 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:21.309
 at this point I can see what I have 

00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:24.939
 registered by clicking on the arrow 

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:28.089
 to switch to the interface of 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:31.509
 garageband and if I tap on the fifth 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:33.579
 icon at the top from the left I will find mine 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:35.319
 track this is what i have 

00:05:33.579 --> 00:05:36.879
 recorded from this point on 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.069
 we work exactly as we have 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:41.049
 always done in the garage band for example 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:44.319
 in this case we can apply 

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:48.159
 effects by tapping on the fourth icon 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:50.439
 top left and I miss them 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:52.509
 just a couple of notes to see that 

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:56.009
 what to do once I've finished the 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:59.169
 work we have to unplug the apps 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:03.789
 first of all let's save the project 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:05.649
 with my songs we can also give a 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:09.549
 name to our project as usual 

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:12.039
 so let's go back to the audio interface 

00:06:09.549 --> 00:06:17.559
 bus and unplug by tapping on the icon 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:18.689
 of the igp under each app those that 

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:22.539
 we have connected 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:26.889
 now if I close what I will have is one 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:27.939
 red bar on the upper side of the del 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:29.499
 my ipad 

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:30.429
 and this because the connected apps of 

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:31.779
 have not yet been done 

00:06:30.429 --> 00:06:33.399
 completely closed 

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:36.999
 what I still have to do and press 

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:40.569
 hold down twice on the home button 

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:42.429
 an app and here they will begin to shake 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:46.239
 at this point I can really close them 

00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:49.079
 then clicking on the minus before audio 

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:52.209
 bush bodyguard band and then lumbar 

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:54.309
 touch the home button again 

00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:56.709
 and here is our bar has disappeared 

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:58.360
 because the apps are really closed with 

00:06:56.709 --> 00:07:00.610
 this overview of buses 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.159
 we're done but let me know what 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:07.079
 think in the comments you share put a 

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:07.079
 like let's keep in touch
