00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
like Call of Duty the problem is there

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:21.920 
like Call of Duty the problem is there
dammit<00:05:21.090> they're<00:05:21.240> doing<00:05:21.450> the<00:05:21.510> damned<00:05:21.720> if<00:05:21.870> they

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
dammit they're doing the damned if they

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.030 
dammit they're doing the damned if they
don't<00:05:22.140> which<00:05:22.290> I've<00:05:22.410> said<00:05:22.590> a<00:05:22.620> thousand<00:05:23.010> times

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
don't which I've said a thousand times

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.100 
don't which I've said a thousand times
it<00:05:23.340> it's<00:05:24.090> kind<00:05:24.300> of<00:05:24.390> hard<00:05:24.570> to<00:05:24.660> say<00:05:24.840> what<00:05:24.990> you

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
it it's kind of hard to say what you

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.840 
it it's kind of hard to say what you
want<00:05:25.380> from<00:05:25.500> one<00:05:25.710> more<00:05:25.890> for<00:05:26.100> three<00:05:26.280> because<00:05:26.580> the

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
want from one more for three because the

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.430 
want from one more for three because the
formula<00:05:27.390> is<00:05:27.420> there<00:05:27.840> and<00:05:28.140> they're<00:05:28.260> going<00:05:28.380> to

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
formula is there and they're going to

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.830 
formula is there and they're going to
copy<00:05:28.680> that<00:05:28.920> formula<00:05:29.160> until<00:05:29.820> the<00:05:29.940> days<00:05:30.390> of<00:05:30.630> you

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
copy that formula until the days of you

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.290 
copy that formula until the days of you
know<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:31.440> the<00:05:32.150> apocalypse<00:05:33.150> and

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
know the the the apocalypse and

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.060 
know the the the apocalypse and
nothing's<00:05:33.990> really<00:05:34.169> going<00:05:34.290> to<00:05:34.500> change<00:05:34.710> and

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
nothing's really going to change and

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.350 
nothing's really going to change and
it's<00:05:35.160> hard<00:05:35.370> to<00:05:35.430> say<00:05:35.610> well<00:05:35.790> what<00:05:35.940> do<00:05:36.060> you<00:05:36.150> want

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
it's hard to say well what do you want

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.640 
it's hard to say well what do you want
because<00:05:36.480> it's<00:05:36.720> pointless<00:05:36.930> because<00:05:37.320> none<00:05:37.620> of

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
because it's pointless because none of

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.280 
because it's pointless because none of
its<00:05:37.830> even<00:05:38.040> plausible<00:05:38.280> ah<00:05:39.710> man<00:05:40.710> ok<00:05:41.010> but<00:05:42.290> it's

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
its even plausible ah man ok but it's

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.630 
its even plausible ah man ok but it's
pretty<00:05:43.470> much<00:05:43.650> it<00:05:43.890> there's<00:05:44.040> really<00:05:44.220> nothing

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
pretty much it there's really nothing

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.980 
pretty much it there's really nothing
you<00:05:44.669> can<00:05:44.820> say<00:05:45.120> what<00:05:45.360> do<00:05:45.419> you<00:05:45.510> want<00:05:45.690> from<00:05:45.780> one
