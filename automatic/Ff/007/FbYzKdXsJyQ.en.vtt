00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.170
 recovery and an olive tree in the field 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:13.250
 in the following months germina is the 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.760
 beginning of a new life 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:20.430
 time influences the development of 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:24.170
 tree the heat the cold 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.170
 and also the animals 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.150
 on the side of the road 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:35.070
 next to a farm of the scales 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:40.010
 I was amazed soon saw its trunk 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:43.670
 slender and its almost perfect ramification 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.859
 70 centimeters tall by 20 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.859
 years and a single tube 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:57.500
 the structure of its branches is fine 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.500
 has a bulge in the trunk 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:06.090
 the olive trees belong to the variety 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.659
 European wave 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.770
 olive tree goes through three stages 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:17.070
 the child olive produces a bulge in 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.130
 the place of cotyledons 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.820
 when he is a teenager from the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:28.650
 cotyledons makes a second phase of 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:32.550
 fat roots as an adult roots 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:36.260
 fine and shape the cup the recovery of 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.260
 an olive tree is made like this 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.579
 the next step 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.579
 you have to remove the stones from the ground 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.640
 you have to make a perimeter strip and go 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.020
 removing the earth 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.380
 and the tree has 70 centimeters 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.539
 the hole will have 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.960
 30 centimeters deep as 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.960
 minimum 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.400
 you must also wet roots with a 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.200
 sprayer to avoid the 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.570
 dehydration 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.740
 you have to cut the fat roots by 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:33.190
 below and out of the ground 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.190
 Well, we have already taken the tree 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.950
 then water a little 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.780
 and cut the thickest roots leave 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.329
 always the antilles that are the most 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.969
 small ones that are what will make the 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.969
 tree grow and take fortress 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.720
 then transplant it as soon as 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.350
 possible 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.710
 in this case we are going to throw land of 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.710
 yard 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:31.090
 then we give it back copiously and 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.110
 we will not add it again until it 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.110
 I have dried the case 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.280
 then we will reduce all the branches 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.750
 From the tree 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.750
 do drastic pruning 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.550
 goal can can pull hard 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.320
 after the wedding the result is this 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.840
 every time the tree is more refined 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:08.310
 good and this is going to be the aspect that 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.280
 moment we are going to leave it 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.530
 the next step would be to seal the 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.579
 wounds of the olive tree one thing you have to have 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:22.659
 that the trees and inside of me 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:26.009
 and when we think about recovering a tree there 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:26.009
 to ask permission from the 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:36.240
 now with this we finalize 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.900
 I hope you like it 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.900
 until next time
