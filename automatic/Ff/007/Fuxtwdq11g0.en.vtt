00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
around through the snipers and you may

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.269 
around through the snipers and you may
recall<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.330> there<00:00:30.599> are<00:00:30.660> normally<00:00:31.529> snipers

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.069 
recall that there are normally snipers
here<00:00:32.520> but<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.090> went<00:00:33.360> ahead<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.719> took<00:00:33.809> care<00:00:34.020> of

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
here but I went ahead and took care of

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.020 
here but I went ahead and took care of
them<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.680> they<00:00:34.770> wouldn't<00:00:35.100> be<00:00:35.340> bothering

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
them so that they wouldn't be bothering

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.479 
them so that they wouldn't be bothering
us<00:00:36.239> while<00:00:36.480> I'm<00:00:36.570> explaining<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:37.250> that<00:00:38.250> was

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
us while I'm explaining this that was

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.810 
us while I'm explaining this that was
involved<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.670> so<00:00:41.670> if

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
involved in that and so is that so if

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.090 
involved in that and so is that so if
you<00:00:41.879> haven't<00:00:42.030> seen<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.329> skip<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:42.960> not<00:00:43.739> too

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
you haven't seen this skip it's not too

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.580 
you haven't seen this skip it's not too
hard<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.760> not<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.510> big<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:46.079> saves<00:00:46.350> I've

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
hard it's not that big it saves I've

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.549 
hard it's not that big it saves I've
heard<00:00:46.950> about<00:00:47.219> 15<00:00:47.969> seconds<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.840> haven't<00:00:49.379> time<00:00:49.500> to

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
heard about 15 seconds I haven't time to

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.709 
heard about 15 seconds I haven't time to
myself<00:00:49.890> but<00:00:50.430> after<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.789> explain<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.600> go

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
myself but after I explain this and go

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.750 
myself but after I explain this and go
through<00:00:51.930> everything<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.500> will<00:00:53.070> go<00:00:53.280> ahead<00:00:53.430> and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
through everything I will go ahead and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.490 
through everything I will go ahead and
show<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> comparison<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.960> normal<00:00:55.320> route

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
show a comparison of the normal route

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.450 
show a comparison of the normal route
versus<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.910> skip<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:58.320> basically<00:00:58.980> I'll<00:00:59.250> just

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
versus the skip so basically I'll just

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.220 
versus the skip so basically I'll just
show<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.670> what<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.940> do<00:01:00.210> for<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.719> first<00:01:00.960> part

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
show you what you do for the first part

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.900 
show you what you do for the first part
of<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.949> need<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.190> jump<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.520> top<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.850> this

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
of it you need to jump on top of this

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.399 
of it you need to jump on top of this
tree<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:04.070> then<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.309> get<00:01:06.030> up<00:01:06.180> here<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:07.260> grab

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
tree and then you get up here you grab

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.960 
tree and then you get up here you grab
on<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> light<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.460> go<00:01:08.610> right<00:01:08.640> here

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
on the light and you can go right here

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.390 
on the light and you can go right here
which<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.299> out<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.479> bounds<00:01:09.659> just<00:01:10.020> barely<00:01:10.650> and

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
which is out of bounds just barely and

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.210 
which is out of bounds just barely and
that<00:01:12.180> looks<00:01:12.450> easy<00:01:12.689> Alex<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.680> don't<00:01:13.950> know<00:01:14.100> it

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
that looks easy Alex I don't know it

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.850 
that looks easy Alex I don't know it
probably<00:01:14.520> looks<00:01:14.640> easy<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.560> pretty

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
probably looks easy and it is pretty

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.499 
probably looks easy and it is pretty
easy<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.340> almost<00:01:17.610> as<00:01:17.820> easy<00:01:17.850> as<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.299> looks

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
easy it's almost as easy as it looks

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.260 
easy it's almost as easy as it looks
there's<00:01:19.259> only<00:01:19.470> one<00:01:19.770> trick<00:01:20.070> involved<00:01:20.640> which

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
there's only one trick involved which

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.210 
there's only one trick involved which
took<00:01:21.750> me<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> little<00:01:22.080> bit<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.500> get<00:01:22.619> used<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.040> when

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
took me a little bit to get used to when

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.920 
took me a little bit to get used to when
I<00:01:23.250> first<00:01:23.490> saw<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.939> skip<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.509> tried<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.869> I

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
I first saw the skip and tried it I

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.570 
I first saw the skip and tried it I
didn't<00:01:25.590> know<00:01:25.619> how<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.799> do<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.250> couldn't<00:01:26.430> get

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
didn't know how to do it I couldn't get

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.880 
didn't know how to do it I couldn't get
it<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.729> work<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.150> actually<00:01:27.390> had<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.869> ask<00:01:27.900> grey

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
it to work so I actually had to ask grey

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.469 
it to work so I actually had to ask grey
star<00:01:29.189> for<00:01:29.400> some<00:01:29.549> advice<00:01:29.820> which<00:01:30.060> really<00:01:30.299> helped

the<00:01:34.860> way<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.579> game<00:01:35.790> works<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:37.380> wall

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
the way that this game works is to wall

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.240 
the way that this game works is to wall
climb<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.610> have<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:39.000> be<00:01:39.090> holding<00:01:39.509> W<00:01:40.250> moving

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
climb you have to be holding W moving

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.410 
climb you have to be holding W moving
forward<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.579> have<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.820> holding<00:01:42.090> forward

forward you have to be holding forward

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.940 
forward you have to be holding forward
to<00:01:42.540> wall<00:01:42.689> climb<00:01:42.869> if<00:01:43.259> not<00:01:43.470> you'll<00:01:43.649> just<00:01:43.799> be

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
to wall climb if not you'll just be

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.749 
to wall climb if not you'll just be
jumping<00:01:44.310> against<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.610> wall<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.229> if<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.979> hold<00:01:47.280> W

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
jumping against a wall and if you hold W

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.270 
jumping against a wall and if you hold W
and<00:01:48.000> then<00:01:48.210> jump<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.079> wall<00:01:49.259> climb<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.770> won't<00:01:50.130> be

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
and then jump to wall climb you won't be

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.410 
and then jump to wall climb you won't be
able<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.460> get<00:01:50.610> high<00:01:50.759> enough<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.119> grab<00:01:51.270> this

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
able to get high enough to grab this

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.639 
able to get high enough to grab this
light<00:01:51.659> here<00:01:52.880> so<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.450> actually<00:01:54.659> have<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.229> delay

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
light here so you actually have to delay

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.700 
light here so you actually have to delay
pressing<00:01:56.340> W<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.909> little<00:01:57.420> bit<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:58.380> press

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
pressing W a little bit you press

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.350 
pressing W a little bit you press
spacebar<00:01:59.130> while<00:01:59.579> you're<00:01:59.729> just<00:02:00.030> standing

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
spacebar while you're just standing

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.420 
spacebar while you're just standing
still<00:02:00.869> against<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.380> wall<00:02:01.560> like<00:02:01.740> right<00:02:02.070> on

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
still against the wall like right on

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.310 
still against the wall like right on
this<00:02:02.790> line<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.360> I'm<00:02:03.540> pointing<00:02:03.899> at<00:02:03.990> or<00:02:04.259> a

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
little bit to the left of it so like not

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.190 
little bit to the left of it so like not

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
this black line the line right here so

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.920 
this black line the line right here so
just<00:02:10.649> stand<00:02:10.800> against<00:02:11.069> this

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
just stand against this

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.420 
just stand against this
you<00:02:12.349> can<00:02:12.469> be<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:12.590> little<00:02:12.739> bit<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.099> left<00:02:13.280> of

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
you can be a little bit to the left of

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.679 
you can be a little bit to the left of
it<00:02:13.519> problem<00:02:13.819> a<00:02:13.849> B<00:02:13.969> to<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.120> right<00:02:14.299> I<00:02:14.329> don't<00:02:14.480> know

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:14.689 
it problem a B to the right I don't know

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.440 
it problem a B to the right I don't know
but<00:02:15.079> it's<00:02:15.230> not<00:02:15.379> that<00:02:15.620> precise<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:16.370> then<00:02:17.269> you

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
but it's not that precise and then you

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.839 
but it's not that precise and then you
you<00:02:18.049> press<00:02:18.260> space<00:02:18.650> without<00:02:18.859> holding<00:02:19.340> w<00:02:19.640> and

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
you press space without holding w and

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.080 
you press space without holding w and
then<00:02:20.060> about<00:02:20.959> half<00:02:21.260> way<00:02:21.500> up<00:02:21.530> your<00:02:21.739> jump<00:02:22.099> you

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
then about half way up your jump you

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.970 
then about half way up your jump you
press<00:02:23.420> W<00:02:23.629> so<00:02:23.959> you<00:02:24.049> all<00:02:24.230> climb<00:02:24.439> like<00:02:24.620> that

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
press W so you all climb like that

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.319 
press W so you all climb like that
so<00:02:25.129> you're<00:02:25.280> just<00:02:25.310> delay<00:02:25.700> it<00:02:25.760> by<00:02:25.939> a<00:02:25.969> little<00:02:26.239> bit

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
so you're just delay it by a little bit

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.449 
so you're just delay it by a little bit
maybe<00:02:26.540> like<00:02:26.780> half<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:27.079> second<00:02:27.379> or<00:02:27.500> less<00:02:27.739> it's

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
maybe like half a second or less it's

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.149 
maybe like half a second or less it's
pretty<00:02:29.030> fast<00:02:29.389> it's<00:02:29.989> not<00:02:30.170> really<00:02:30.469> fast<00:02:30.739> but

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159 
pretty fast it's not really fast but

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.420 
pretty fast it's not really fast but
don't<00:02:31.909> like<00:02:32.319> present<00:02:33.319> really<00:02:33.530> late<00:02:33.859> like<00:02:34.129> like

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
don't like present really late like like

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.000 
don't like present really late like like
that<00:02:34.670> it's<00:02:35.030> hard<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.299> explain<00:02:35.829> they're<00:02:36.829> just

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
that it's hard to explain they're just

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.770 
that it's hard to explain they're just
kind<00:02:37.189> of<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.340> timing<00:02:37.730> I<00:02:37.849> have<00:02:38.000> down<00:02:38.239> for<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.629> and

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
kind of a timing I have down for it and

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.729 
kind of a timing I have down for it and
then<00:02:39.709> about<00:02:40.719> at<00:02:41.719> the<00:02:41.870> top<00:02:42.109> of<00:02:42.230> your<00:02:42.319> jump<00:02:42.530> you

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
then about at the top of your jump you

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.500 
then about at the top of your jump you
do<00:02:42.859> a<00:02:42.889> side<00:02:43.189> jump<00:02:43.430> off<00:02:43.549> the<00:02:43.670> wall<00:02:43.790> so<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.209> hold

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
do a side jump off the wall so you hold

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.830 
do a side jump off the wall so you hold
a<00:02:44.720> and<00:02:44.810> jump<00:02:45.409> or<00:02:45.620> you<00:02:45.709> hold<00:02:45.859> left<00:02:46.189> and<00:02:46.489> jump<00:02:46.840> and

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
a and jump or you hold left and jump and

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.979 
a and jump or you hold left and jump and
if<00:02:48.769> you<00:02:48.829> do<00:02:48.919> it<00:02:49.010> right<00:02:49.159> you'll<00:02:49.340> grab<00:02:49.549> the<00:02:49.700> light

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
if you do it right you'll grab the light

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.259 
if you do it right you'll grab the light
so<00:02:50.989> I<00:02:51.349> have<00:02:51.799> like<00:02:51.919> a<00:02:51.980> timing<00:02:52.459> for<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.879> it's<00:02:53.060> just

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
so I have like a timing for it it's just

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.500 
so I have like a timing for it it's just
like<00:02:53.419> space<00:02:53.780> W<00:02:54.260> jump<00:02:54.560> it's<00:02:55.370> like<00:02:55.909> that<00:02:56.209> timing

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
like space W jump it's like that timing

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.440 
like space W jump it's like that timing
however<00:02:57.049> I<00:02:57.079> just<00:02:57.349> said<00:02:57.560> that<00:02:57.739> so<00:02:57.879> space<00:02:58.879> W<00:02:59.239> jump

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
however I just said that so space W jump

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.500 
however I just said that so space W jump
and<00:02:59.689> then<00:02:59.810> you<00:02:59.870> grab<00:03:00.079> it<00:03:00.349> it's<00:03:01.120> about<00:03:02.120> that

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
and then you grab it it's about that

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.300 
and then you grab it it's about that
easy<00:03:02.750> it'll<00:03:03.079> take<00:03:03.349> a<00:03:03.379> few<00:03:03.500> times<00:03:03.889> to<00:03:04.069> get<00:03:04.159> used

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
easy it'll take a few times to get used

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.580 
easy it'll take a few times to get used
to<00:03:04.459> but<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:04.760> think<00:03:05.000> once<00:03:05.299> you<00:03:05.480> have<00:03:05.689> this<00:03:05.959> down

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
to but I think once you have this down

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.770 
to but I think once you have this down
you<00:03:07.189> probably<00:03:07.489> won't<00:03:07.609> miss<00:03:07.939> this<00:03:08.180> part<00:03:08.510> too

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
you probably won't miss this part too

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.709 
you probably won't miss this part too
much<00:03:09.019> after<00:03:09.889> that<00:03:10.099> so<00:03:10.340> space<00:03:10.579> W<00:03:10.909> jump<00:03:11.180> just

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:11.719 
much after that so space W jump just

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:13.899 
much after that so space W jump just
remember<00:03:11.989> to<00:03:12.109> delay<00:03:12.349> the<00:03:12.500> W<00:03:12.859> and<00:03:13.099> then<00:03:13.310> jump

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
remember to delay the W and then jump

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.300 
remember to delay the W and then jump
shortly<00:03:14.689> after<00:03:14.989> that<00:03:15.169> and<00:03:15.889> you'll<00:03:16.040> get<00:03:16.159> up

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
shortly after that and you'll get up

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.759 
shortly after that and you'll get up
here<00:03:16.780> that<00:03:17.780> might<00:03:17.900> be<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.169> hardest<00:03:18.290> part<00:03:18.500> to

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
here that might be the hardest part to

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.879 
here that might be the hardest part to
learn<00:03:19.129> but<00:03:19.699> this<00:03:19.970> next<00:03:20.329> part<00:03:20.540> is<00:03:20.629> probably<00:03:20.930> the

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
learn but this next part is probably the

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.449 
learn but this next part is probably the
hardest<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.459> do<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.889> right<00:03:24.889> next<00:03:25.190> to<00:03:25.340> me

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
hardest to do and right next to me

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.699 
hardest to do and right next to me
there's<00:03:25.639> a<00:03:25.699> short<00:03:26.120> invisible<00:03:26.989> wall<00:03:27.199> right

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
there's a short invisible wall right

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.339 
there's a short invisible wall right
here<00:03:27.919> but<00:03:28.669> it's<00:03:28.819> so<00:03:29.060> thin<00:03:29.479> that<00:03:29.720> you<00:03:29.959> can't

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
here but it's so thin that you can't

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.339 
here but it's so thin that you can't
stand<00:03:30.889> on<00:03:31.069> it<00:03:31.280> normally<00:03:31.699> and<00:03:31.970> it<00:03:32.599> extends<00:03:33.199> all

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
stand on it normally and it extends all

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.890 
stand on it normally and it extends all
the<00:03:33.409> way<00:03:33.680> over<00:03:34.099> to<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.489> door<00:03:34.819> at<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.389> end<00:03:35.569> of

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
the way over to the door at the end of

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.159 
the way over to the door at the end of
the<00:03:36.079> sniper<00:03:36.349> section<00:03:37.510> but<00:03:38.510> since<00:03:38.780> you<00:03:38.900> can't

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:39.169 
the sniper section but since you can't

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:40.839 
the sniper section but since you can't
stand<00:03:39.560> on<00:03:39.769> this<00:03:39.949> wall<00:03:40.189> the<00:03:40.400> way<00:03:40.519> you<00:03:40.579> have<00:03:40.819> to

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
stand on this wall the way you have to

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:42.849 
stand on this wall the way you have to
get<00:03:41.090> over<00:03:41.329> there<00:03:41.479> is<00:03:41.689> to<00:03:41.870> jump<00:03:42.199> onto<00:03:42.409> it<00:03:42.620> and

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
get over there is to jump onto it and

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.839 
get over there is to jump onto it and
then<00:03:43.069> keep<00:03:43.340> jumping<00:03:43.970> because<00:03:44.979> if<00:03:45.979> he<00:03:46.159> jump<00:03:46.430> she

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
then keep jumping because if he jump she

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.629 
then keep jumping because if he jump she
can<00:03:47.060> stay<00:03:47.359> on<00:03:47.389> it<00:03:47.750> oh<00:03:48.590> my<00:03:49.129> god<00:03:49.310> I<00:03:49.340> don't<00:03:49.519> know

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
can stay on it oh my god I don't know

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.999 
can stay on it oh my god I don't know
what<00:03:49.759> just<00:03:49.819> happened<00:03:50.209> but<00:03:51.139> you<00:03:51.500> have<00:03:51.650> to<00:03:51.799> keep

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:52.009 
what just happened but you have to keep

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:53.649 
what just happened but you have to keep
jumping<00:03:52.310> across<00:03:52.669> basically<00:03:53.329> and<00:03:53.449> I'll<00:03:53.509> just

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:53.659 
jumping across basically and I'll just

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.379 
jumping across basically and I'll just
show<00:03:53.840> you<00:03:53.900> so<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:55.009> way<00:03:55.129> I<00:03:55.159> do<00:03:55.310> it<00:03:55.519> is<00:03:55.849> I<00:03:56.150> get

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
show you so the way I do it is I get

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.899 
show you so the way I do it is I get
against<00:03:57.079> the<00:03:57.139> wall<00:03:57.470> at<00:03:57.799> the<00:03:57.859> back<00:03:58.370> edge<00:03:58.699> of

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:58.909 
against the wall at the back edge of

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.949 
against the wall at the back edge of
this<00:03:59.030> little<00:03:59.239> platform<00:03:59.389> and<00:04:00.879> then<00:04:01.879> I<00:04:02.269> just<00:04:02.569> run

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
this little platform and then I just run

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.129 
this little platform and then I just run
forward<00:04:03.409> and<00:04:03.439> then<00:04:03.949> jump<00:04:04.459> so<00:04:04.970> that<00:04:05.299> I<00:04:05.329> land<00:04:05.810> on

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
forward and then jump so that I land on

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.199 
forward and then jump so that I land on
the<00:04:06.439> wall<00:04:06.590> so<00:04:07.220> I'm<00:04:07.340> against<00:04:07.699> the<00:04:07.759> wall<00:04:07.909> so<00:04:08.060> that

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
the wall so I'm against the wall so that

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.569 
the wall so I'm against the wall so that
I<00:04:08.269> don't<00:04:08.479> have<00:04:08.659> to<00:04:08.810> jump<00:04:09.169> that<00:04:10.009> far<00:04:10.340> to<00:04:10.489> the

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
I don't have to jump that far to the

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.129 
I don't have to jump that far to the
right<00:04:10.790> and<00:04:11.030> end<00:04:11.180> up<00:04:11.299> falling<00:04:11.750> off<00:04:11.870> the<00:04:12.019> wall

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
right and end up falling off the wall

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.140 
right and end up falling off the wall
because<00:04:12.439> it's<00:04:12.590> remember<00:04:13.250> really<00:04:13.819> really<00:04:14.209> thin

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
because it's remember really really thin

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.159 
because it's remember really really thin
so<00:04:16.040> you'll<00:04:17.040> have<00:04:17.220> to<00:04:17.370> use<00:04:17.400> your<00:04:17.489> scroll<00:04:18.030> wheel

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
so you'll have to use your scroll wheel

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.539 
so you'll have to use your scroll wheel
here<00:04:19.169> you<00:04:19.500> don't<00:04:19.769> have<00:04:19.889> to<00:04:20.010> but<00:04:20.340> it'd<00:04:20.459> be

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
here you don't have to but it'd be

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.430 
here you don't have to but it'd be
easiest<00:04:20.910> to<00:04:21.120> use<00:04:21.329> your<00:04:21.630> scroll<00:04:21.989> wheel<00:04:22.019> while

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
easiest to use your scroll wheel while

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.689 
easiest to use your scroll wheel while
you're<00:04:22.590> jumping<00:04:22.740> across<00:04:23.160> it<00:04:23.400> just<00:04:23.550> keep

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
you're jumping across it just keep

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.750 
you're jumping across it just keep
scrolling<00:04:24.000> every<00:04:24.389> time<00:04:24.540> you<00:04:24.660> land<00:04:24.860> and<00:04:25.860> jump

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
scrolling every time you land and jump

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.820 
scrolling every time you land and jump
across<00:04:26.930> like<00:04:27.930> I<00:04:28.050> said<00:04:28.229> this<00:04:28.350> is<00:04:28.500> probably<00:04:28.590> the

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
across like I said this is probably the

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.140 
across like I said this is probably the
hardest<00:04:29.100> part<00:04:29.160> to<00:04:29.400> do<00:04:29.610> because<00:04:29.970> it's<00:04:30.090> really

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
hardest part to do because it's really

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.689 
hardest part to do because it's really
easy<00:04:30.510> to<00:04:30.690> mess<00:04:30.810> up<00:04:31.070> and<00:04:32.070> while<00:04:32.340> you're<00:04:32.490> jumping

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
easy to mess up and while you're jumping

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.820 
easy to mess up and while you're jumping
across<00:04:33.060> make<00:04:33.479> sure<00:04:33.690> that<00:04:33.840> you're<00:04:34.050> like

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
across make sure that you're like

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.390 
across make sure that you're like
pointing<00:04:35.400> at<00:04:35.639> the<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:37.080> seem<00:04:37.440> that<00:04:37.710> my<00:04:37.889> reticle

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
pointing at the the seem that my reticle

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.110 
pointing at the the seem that my reticle
is<00:04:38.520> that<00:04:38.669> right<00:04:38.880> now<00:04:39.030> it's<00:04:39.440> between<00:04:40.440> like<00:04:41.130> the

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
is that right now it's between like the

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.900 
is that right now it's between like the
blue<00:04:42.960> building<00:04:43.199> and<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.740> grayish<00:04:44.280> building

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
blue building and the grayish building

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.159 
blue building and the grayish building
where<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.270> door<00:04:45.479> is<00:04:45.660> you<00:04:45.810> know<00:04:45.900> I<00:04:45.930> don't<00:04:46.110> know

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
where the door is you know I don't know

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.840 
where the door is you know I don't know
like<00:04:46.290> right<00:04:46.500> where<00:04:46.650> my<00:04:46.740> reticle<00:04:47.130> reticle<00:04:47.699> is

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
like right where my reticle reticle is

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.270 
like right where my reticle reticle is
that<00:04:48.120> some<00:04:48.479> that's<00:04:49.260> like<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:49.590> seam<00:04:49.860> you<00:04:50.070> look

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
that some that's like the seam you look

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.189 
that some that's like the seam you look
at<00:04:50.430> to<00:04:50.610> make<00:04:50.760> sure<00:04:50.880> that<00:04:51.060> you're<00:04:51.300> in<00:04:51.419> line<00:04:51.720> and

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
at to make sure that you're in line and

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.300 
at to make sure that you're in line and
you<00:04:52.590> might<00:04:52.740> have<00:04:52.860> to<00:04:52.949> make<00:04:53.039> some<00:04:53.100> adjustments

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
you might have to make some adjustments

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.189 
you might have to make some adjustments
left<00:04:54.090> and<00:04:54.270> right<00:04:54.449> just<00:04:54.780> so<00:04:54.930> you<00:04:54.990> know<00:04:55.080> just

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
left and right just so you know just

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.659 
left and right just so you know just
make<00:04:55.650> sure<00:04:55.740> you<00:04:55.830> stay<00:04:56.039> on<00:04:56.070> the<00:04:56.250> wall<00:04:56.400> it's<00:04:56.580> uh

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
make sure you stay on the wall it's uh

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.480 
make sure you stay on the wall it's uh
it's<00:04:57.630> pretty<00:04:57.720> weird<00:04:58.139> so<00:04:58.500> you<00:04:58.590> just<00:04:58.830> jump<00:04:59.220> and

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
it's pretty weird so you just jump and

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.659 
it's pretty weird so you just jump and
then<00:05:00.389> jump<00:05:01.320> across<00:05:01.650> like<00:05:01.860> this<00:05:02.039> you<00:05:02.220> can<00:05:02.370> coil

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
then jump across like this you can coil

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.219 
then jump across like this you can coil
if<00:05:02.820> you<00:05:02.940> want<00:05:03.150> which<00:05:03.330> I've<00:05:03.510> seen<00:05:03.720> a<00:05:03.750> few<00:05:04.199> people

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
if you want which I've seen a few people

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.930 
if you want which I've seen a few people
do<00:05:04.620> I<00:05:04.740> just<00:05:05.010> jump<00:05:05.070> normally<00:05:07.070> so<00:05:08.070> and<00:05:08.400> then<00:05:08.729> oh

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
do I just jump normally so and then oh

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.290 
do I just jump normally so and then oh
and<00:05:09.240> then<00:05:09.330> I<00:05:09.389> fell<00:05:09.570> off<00:05:10.220> okay<00:05:11.220> well<00:05:11.460> well<00:05:12.060> I<00:05:12.090> get

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
and then I fell off okay well well I get

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.640 
and then I fell off okay well well I get
back<00:05:12.449> up<00:05:12.600> there<00:05:12.750> remember<00:05:13.199> that<00:05:13.229> there<00:05:13.620> are

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
back up there remember that there are

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.020 
back up there remember that there are
snipers<00:05:14.400> in<00:05:14.850> this<00:05:15.000> area<00:05:15.500> so<00:05:16.500> and<00:05:17.370> when<00:05:17.699> you<00:05:17.789> do

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
snipers in this area so and when you do

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.570 
snipers in this area so and when you do
this<00:05:18.210> normally<00:05:18.720> you<00:05:18.870> will<00:05:19.110> have<00:05:19.349> to<00:05:19.620> get<00:05:20.430> up

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
this normally you will have to get up

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.550 
this normally you will have to get up
here<00:05:20.820> in<00:05:20.940> like<00:05:21.150> one<00:05:21.450> or<00:05:21.599> two<00:05:21.630> tries<00:05:22.169> or<00:05:22.410> else

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
here in like one or two tries or else

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.930 
here in like one or two tries or else
they<00:05:22.740> can<00:05:22.889> shoot<00:05:23.130> you<00:05:23.220> to<00:05:23.340> death<00:05:23.370> but<00:05:23.700> once

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
they can shoot you to death but once

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.670 
they can shoot you to death but once
you're<00:05:24.120> up<00:05:24.150> here<00:05:24.270> they<00:05:24.780> won't<00:05:24.990> actually<00:05:25.260> shoot

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
you're up here they won't actually shoot

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.320 
you're up here they won't actually shoot
you<00:05:25.830> so<00:05:25.979> it's<00:05:26.099> probably<00:05:26.310> good<00:05:26.460> I<00:05:26.490> died<00:05:26.849> to<00:05:27.120> show

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
you so it's probably good I died to show

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.290 
you so it's probably good I died to show
that<00:05:27.599> let's<00:05:28.530> actually<00:05:28.770> pay<00:05:29.669> attention<00:05:29.700> here

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
that let's actually pay attention here

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.390 
that let's actually pay attention here
and<00:05:30.450> make<00:05:30.599> it<00:05:30.750> across<00:05:31.050> so<00:05:31.680> this<00:05:31.860> is<00:05:32.010> what<00:05:32.280> it

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
and make it across so this is what it

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.469 
and make it across so this is what it
looks<00:05:32.639> just<00:05:33.000> okay<00:05:33.750> so<00:05:34.280> this<00:05:35.280> is<00:05:35.820> what<00:05:36.330> it

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
looks just okay so this is what it

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.070 
looks just okay so this is what it
actually<00:05:36.510> looks<00:05:37.320> like<00:05:37.560> normally<00:05:38.720> see<00:05:39.720> that's

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
actually looks like normally see that's

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.080 
actually looks like normally see that's
the<00:05:40.229> wall<00:05:40.410> that<00:05:40.590> I'm<00:05:40.710> jumping<00:05:40.950> on<00:05:41.250> if<00:05:41.729> you<00:05:41.880> see

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
the wall that I'm jumping on if you see

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.370 
the wall that I'm jumping on if you see
the<00:05:42.240> wall<00:05:42.389> like<00:05:42.570> that<00:05:42.599> you<00:05:42.900> might<00:05:43.080> want<00:05:43.260> to<00:05:43.289> aim

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
the wall like that you might want to aim

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.719 
the wall like that you might want to aim
a<00:05:43.440> little<00:05:43.650> bit<00:05:43.800> to<00:05:43.919> the<00:05:44.130> left<00:05:44.340> to<00:05:44.490> make<00:05:44.580> sure

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
a little bit to the left to make sure

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.670 
a little bit to the left to make sure
you<00:05:44.820> don't<00:05:44.910> jump<00:05:45.270> too<00:05:45.510> far<00:05:45.539> there<00:05:45.900> right<00:05:46.080> but

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
you don't jump too far there right but

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.350 
you don't jump too far there right but
yep<00:05:46.830> just<00:05:47.130> keep<00:05:47.340> jumping<00:05:47.520> across<00:05:47.910> like<00:05:48.180> this

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
yep just keep jumping across like this

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.080 
yep just keep jumping across like this
and<00:05:49.099> then<00:05:50.099> once<00:05:50.280> you're<00:05:50.430> here<00:05:50.610> you<00:05:50.760> can<00:05:50.880> fall

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
and then once you're here you can fall

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.430 
and then once you're here you can fall
down<00:05:51.120> and<00:05:51.570> go<00:05:51.630> through<00:05:51.810> the<00:05:51.900> red<00:05:52.020> door<00:05:52.050> and

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
down and go through the red door and

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.820 
down and go through the red door and
that<00:05:52.889> is<00:05:53.039> the<00:05:53.190> skip<00:05:53.460> I<00:05:54.289> may<00:05:55.289> have<00:05:55.380> messed<00:05:55.620> up

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
that is the skip I may have messed up

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.040 
that is the skip I may have messed up
like<00:05:56.160> the<00:05:56.520> hard<00:05:56.760> part<00:05:57.090> a<00:05:57.300> few<00:05:57.599> times<00:05:57.840> but

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
like the hard part a few times but

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.850 
like the hard part a few times but
that's<00:05:58.229> what<00:05:58.530> it<00:05:58.650> looks<00:05:58.919> like<00:05:59.190> and<00:05:59.550> that<00:05:59.660> is

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
that's what it looks like and that is

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.890 
that's what it looks like and that is
that<00:06:01.860> is<00:06:02.130> the<00:06:02.190> skip<00:06:02.849> right<00:06:03.090> there<00:06:03.330> so<00:06:03.599> I'll

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
that is the skip right there so I'll

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.200 
that is the skip right there so I'll
show<00:06:04.199> it<00:06:04.410> all<00:06:05.190> the<00:06:05.430> way<00:06:05.520> through<00:06:05.820> and<00:06:06.060> then

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
show it all the way through and then

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.990 
show it all the way through and then
I'll<00:06:06.330> show<00:06:06.510> a<00:06:06.539> comparison<00:06:07.320> okay

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
I'll show a comparison okay

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.610 
I'll show a comparison okay
so<00:06:09.270> when<00:06:09.449> you're<00:06:09.570> over<00:06:09.750> here<00:06:09.870> this<00:06:10.320> is<00:06:10.500> the

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
so when you're over here this is the

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.020 
so when you're over here this is the
whole<00:06:10.770> skip<00:06:11.270> space<00:06:12.270> W<00:06:12.630> jump<00:06:12.900> grab<00:06:13.620> the<00:06:13.770> thing

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
whole skip space W jump grab the thing

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.730 
whole skip space W jump grab the thing
come<00:06:15.030> up<00:06:15.060> here

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
come up here

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.320 
come up here
you're<00:06:17.340> in<00:06:17.490> here<00:06:19.640> and<00:06:20.640> then<00:06:20.910> you<00:06:20.970> jump<00:06:21.120> across

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
you're in here and then you jump across

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.960 
you're in here and then you jump across
and<00:06:21.630> the<00:06:21.840> snipers<00:06:22.260> don't<00:06:22.710> usually<00:06:23.040> shoot<00:06:23.760> you

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
and the snipers don't usually shoot you

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.910 
and the snipers don't usually shoot you
here<00:06:24.180> if<00:06:24.390> they<00:06:24.540> do<00:06:24.600> it's<00:06:24.870> not<00:06:25.050> enough<00:06:25.560> to<00:06:25.710> kill

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:25.920 
here if they do it's not enough to kill

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.760 
here if they do it's not enough to kill
you<00:06:26.070> so<00:06:26.250> don't<00:06:26.400> worry<00:06:26.550> and<00:06:27.380> that's<00:06:28.380> that's<00:06:28.590> the

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
you so don't worry and that's that's the

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.260 
you so don't worry and that's that's the
whole<00:06:28.890> skip<00:06:29.190> then<00:06:29.520> you<00:06:29.610> skip<00:06:29.910> the<00:06:30.030> sniper

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
whole skip then you skip the sniper

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.260 
whole skip then you skip the sniper
sections<00:06:30.810> it's<00:06:31.110> pretty<00:06:31.410> weird<00:06:31.620> at<00:06:31.770> first<00:06:32.270> you

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
sections it's pretty weird at first you

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.940 
sections it's pretty weird at first you
could<00:06:33.450> also<00:06:33.570> get<00:06:33.810> out<00:06:33.930> of<00:06:34.080> bounds<00:06:34.350> upon<00:06:34.620> this

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 
could also get out of bounds upon this

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.530 
could also get out of bounds upon this
part<00:06:35.490> of<00:06:35.580> the<00:06:35.640> building<00:06:36.000> but<00:06:36.210> there's<00:06:36.420> not

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:36.540 
part of the building but there's not

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.200 
part of the building but there's not
really<00:06:36.600> anything<00:06:36.900> you<00:06:37.020> can<00:06:37.140> do<00:06:37.790> as<00:06:38.790> far<00:06:39.000> as<00:06:39.120> I

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
really anything you can do as far as I

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.600 
really anything you can do as far as I
know<00:06:39.270> there<00:06:39.660> is<00:06:39.810> a<00:06:40.080> really<00:06:40.440> weird<00:06:40.680> transparent

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
know there is a really weird transparent

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.520 
know there is a really weird transparent
object<00:06:42.150> here<00:06:42.420> I'm<00:06:42.600> not<00:06:42.720> sure<00:06:42.960> what<00:06:43.170> this<00:06:43.320> is

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
object here I'm not sure what this is

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.800 
object here I'm not sure what this is
maybe<00:06:43.920> one<00:06:44.220> of<00:06:44.250> you<00:06:44.430> does<00:06:44.640> who<00:06:45.300> knows<00:06:45.330> it's

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:45.810 
maybe one of you does who knows it's

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.570 
maybe one of you does who knows it's
solid<00:06:46.350> you<00:06:46.500> has<00:06:46.650> collision<00:06:47.100> you<00:06:47.130> can<00:06:47.370> get<00:06:47.490> on

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
solid you has collision you can get on

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.730 
solid you has collision you can get on
top<00:06:47.730> of<00:06:47.790> it<00:06:48.030> and<00:06:48.180> it's<00:06:48.690> like<00:06:48.870> invisible<00:06:49.260> it's

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
top of it and it's like invisible it's

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.070 
top of it and it's like invisible it's
really<00:06:49.980> weird<00:06:50.300> so<00:06:51.300> I<00:06:51.330> just<00:06:51.720> thought<00:06:51.900> I<00:06:51.960> would

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
really weird so I just thought I would

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.220 
really weird so I just thought I would
point<00:06:52.440> that<00:06:52.560> out<00:06:53.450> and<00:06:54.450> you<00:06:54.540> can<00:06:54.780> run<00:06:54.990> all<00:06:55.110> the

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.230 
point that out and you can run all the

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.540 
point that out and you can run all the
way<00:06:55.260> down<00:06:55.530> to<00:06:55.710> the<00:06:55.800> elevator<00:06:56.070> shaft<00:06:56.160> but<00:06:56.460> you

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
way down to the elevator shaft but you

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.320 
way down to the elevator shaft but you
can't<00:06:56.760> really<00:06:56.940> do<00:06:57.600> anything<00:06:58.080> here<00:06:58.560> so<00:06:59.330> but

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.330 
can't really do anything here so but

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.340 
can't really do anything here so but
that's<00:07:00.690> a<00:07:00.780> skip<00:07:01.050> so<00:07:01.380> I<00:07:01.770> am<00:07:02.220> going<00:07:02.580> to<00:07:03.320> show<00:07:04.320> a

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 
that's a skip so I am going to show a

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.620 
that's a skip so I am going to show a
comparison<00:07:04.860> of<00:07:05.160> the<00:07:05.610> skip<00:07:05.910> versus<00:07:06.360> the<00:07:06.480> normal

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630 
comparison of the skip versus the normal

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.010 
comparison of the skip versus the normal
route<00:07:07.020> and<00:07:07.380> then<00:07:07.620> that<00:07:07.830> will<00:07:08.040> be<00:07:08.190> it<00:07:08.220> for<00:07:08.340> this

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:09.020 
route and then that will be it for this

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:59.700 
route and then that will be it for this
so<00:07:10.790> here<00:07:11.790> we<00:07:11.940> go

00:07:59.700 --> 00:07:59.710 

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.440 

there's<00:08:00.710> an<00:08:00.860> elevator<00:08:01.280> ahead<00:08:01.610> I've<00:08:02.060> managed

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:02.450 
there's an elevator ahead I've managed

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.300 
there's an elevator ahead I've managed
to<00:08:02.480> unlock<00:08:02.720> it<00:08:03.050> take<00:08:03.590> it<00:08:03.740> to<00:08:03.830> the<00:08:03.919> server<00:08:04.190> room

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:04.310 
to unlock it take it to the server room

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.980 
to unlock it take it to the server room
you<00:08:04.820> should<00:08:04.850> be<00:08:05.120> able<00:08:05.240> to<00:08:05.389> get<00:08:05.570> to<00:08:05.690> the<00:08:05.780> top

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:05.990 
you should be able to get to the top

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.190 
you should be able to get to the top
floor<00:08:06.169> the<00:08:06.530> gates<00:08:06.800> there
