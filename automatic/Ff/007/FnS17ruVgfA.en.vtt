00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.450
 hello if Sanchez succeeds in this I'm going to 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.000
 make a video also of this product 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.769
 I also have it in my supernova store 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.929
 if they do not get it if they leave me with 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.600
 rather they can get it by ebay 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.670
 or online in your memory has about 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.199
 super good the little animals 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.900
 these are super brands and they are not 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.550
 applied false eyelashes those that 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.769
 have used as they are possible 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.179
 so super difficult to put them with this 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.610
 applicator is much easier than 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.290
 makes the process much easier and I'm going to 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.050
 show how it works I hope that they 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.000
 like it and people can follow 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.020
 false eyelashes and I recommend them a lot 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.750
 for eyes like torn or sciatica 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.809
 or almond or that are encapotados because 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.100
 they help a lot to open more the look 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.000
 then it goes very well for that kind of 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.530
 love 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.770
 well the lashes that I'm going to use are 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.700
 these 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:00.910
 they are also supernova and they are only 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.200
 about one third of the eye currently 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.610
 where is it set apart for iu these me 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.740
 they like it a lot because they look super 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.510
 natural things that I do to myself is like very 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.910
 little boy then moves the fire 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.240
 as here beside gives me an effect like 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.640
 more cat eye I do not know how in the form of 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.410
 cat a cult yes and I like that effect 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.670
 that gives me also but not without 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.440
 transmitting to find all the 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.570
 tab forms there are these are like 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.880
 I tell them only for a corner there 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.320
 complete and everything you want and good 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.909
 here I already put one so that you notice the 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.460
 difference I put in our eye 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.140
 and I put as much more disgust that everything did not 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.109
 proceeds much nicer and as much 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.630
 bigger more alive and now let's see 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:41.390
 how can this eye first when 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.219
 remove the little eyelash and well have in 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.689
 account that the longest part goes in the 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.149
 part of the outside obviously the most 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.590
 criticism on the inside as well 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.020
 they were complete people also they 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.289
 note that the side is that side towards between 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.700
 what side out and we are going to put 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.490
 glue for eyelashes 2 west that 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.500
 llama duo get it in places 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.310
 where they sell things for super beauty 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.310
 easy to get 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.660
 we put it on the edge quoted 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.660
 and let the adhesive dry a little 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.160
 so that it gets more detached 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.360
 list what we are going to do is catch 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.740
 this as the clamp 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.740
 and the tab like that 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.480
 and put the tab 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.989
 she put the first side 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.920
 the second and the good thing about this is that 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.400
 we can 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.319
 to grab lashes and press 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.490
 and this is going to make them combine a lot 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.200
 better to make it more natural 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.900
 any size younger than the couple 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.010
 that they can see that they almost start notes 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.010
 makes supernatural 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.720
 good in my next trick for the 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.299
 False eyelashes is to delineate over 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.700
 tabs with them are put because 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.890
 some eyelashes have like the little boat 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.379
 something a little bit white then it 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.350
 you can notice these have nothing but 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:28.050
 I'm going to show you how to outline the 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.550
 then the normal one begins as the eye 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.550
 from you 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.970
 as I tell you, it is necessary, but 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:39.430
 if suddenly you are noticing a lot 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.380
 tab what they can do and what error 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.590
 what can I do what I 'm doing 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.590
 I 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.239
 i 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.320
 and if carrying these bills it seems already 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.780
 very strong and has something softer what 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:06.440
 can do with shadow I'm going to use this 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.110
 brochita is super nova also did 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.870
 account the form is super different to the 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.060
 other because this is the one we designed it was 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.820
 to work for this part of 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.959
 Finished perfectly and for this part 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.299
 of quality also perfectly 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.270
 then I love how the cut that 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:27.940
 has many is already put a shadow 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.940
 how you need and the operation without it 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:39.080
 they are made for kids as if not 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:41.270
 They have a lot of practice with brushes 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.370
 because it already has the form as a list of 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.000
 the edges of the eyes then it's super 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.000
 fast too 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.680
 and this obviously can be the most 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.140
 dark will show you what they want 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.970
 it depends on you 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.950
 and so we're going to talk or we throw more than 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.680
 away because you had not seen it super 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.320
 linda are black are matesi the pÃ³sito is 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.050
 bright and to finish they can put 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.830
 a little bit of blink and I'm going to use a 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:20.560
 that is well livianita at least as 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:21.940
 a layer comes out because white because I 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.130
 they liked what you want 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.490
 as well as more naturalists then and without 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.960
 not so heavy better said but then 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.000
 if sometimes it's necessary because it 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.100
 combine natural lashes more with 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.720
 the others especially if they are using 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.720
 as that is only about half 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.270
 I do not know if they notice any change 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.280
 and well this was the whole tutorial I hope 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.170
 I really liked them 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.270
 how were the eyes remember that 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:52.030
 This is called as a lash applicator 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.860
 supernodes and the brochita is like the one 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.110
 has forms and for the section of the 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.430
 eyes and the one above a cup but that 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.090
 they have liked me to serve them 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.090
 all cha cha
