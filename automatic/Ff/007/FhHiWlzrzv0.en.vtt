alright this video is in response to a

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.700 
alright this video is in response to a
challenge<00:00:05.520> on<00:00:05.700> reddit<00:00:06.180> yesterday<00:00:06.710> the

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
challenge on reddit yesterday the

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.400 
challenge on reddit yesterday the
challenge<00:00:08.370> kind<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:08.969> came<00:00:09.150> about<00:00:09.180> due<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:09.929> this

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
challenge kind of came about due to this

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.450 
challenge kind of came about due to this
post<00:00:10.849> that<00:00:11.849> was<00:00:12.000> talking<00:00:12.360> about<00:00:12.740> the<00:00:13.740> length

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
post that was talking about the length

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.030 
post that was talking about the length
that<00:00:14.849> various<00:00:15.809> types<00:00:16.110> of<00:00:16.290> boosters<00:00:16.650> would<00:00:16.920> be

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.040 
that various types of boosters would be

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.320 
that various types of boosters would be
able<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.430> send<00:00:17.960> mine<00:00:18.960> carts<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.800> as<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:21.090> see

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
able to send mine carts and as you see

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.480 
able to send mine carts and as you see
the<00:00:22.050> initial<00:00:22.439> conclusion<00:00:22.949> was<00:00:23.160> with<00:00:23.369> the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
the initial conclusion was with the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.980 
the initial conclusion was with the
double<00:00:23.789> blue<00:00:23.939> sphere<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.180> originally<00:00:24.510> showed

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
double blue sphere I originally showed

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.099 
double blue sphere I originally showed
in<00:00:25.369> kind<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.430> my<00:00:26.519> first<00:00:26.760> video<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.420> we<00:00:28.019> were

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
in kind of my first video that we were

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.970 
in kind of my first video that we were
able<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.529> send<00:00:29.010> an<00:00:29.310> occupied<00:00:29.880> minecart<00:00:30.980> 328

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
able to send an occupied minecart 328

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.700 
able to send an occupied minecart 328
units<00:00:32.519> of<00:00:32.699> track<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.330> the<00:00:33.899> challenge<00:00:34.380> was<00:00:34.649> to

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
units of track and the challenge was to

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.790 
units of track and the challenge was to
see<00:00:35.190> if<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.760> could<00:00:35.790> build<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.329> booster<00:00:36.870> that

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
see if we could build a booster that

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.240 
see if we could build a booster that
would<00:00:38.070> be<00:00:38.910> able<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.210> beat<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.719> now<00:00:40.559> initially

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
would be able to beat that now initially

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.700 
would be able to beat that now initially
the<00:00:41.370> challenge<00:00:41.790> was<00:00:42.110> somewhere<00:00:43.110> around<00:00:43.170> a

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
the challenge was somewhere around a

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.200 
the challenge was somewhere around a
thousand<00:00:44.719> track<00:00:45.719> pieces<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.829> I've<00:00:47.039> actually

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
thousand track pieces but I've actually

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.000 
thousand track pieces but I've actually
managed<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.300> beat<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.840> by<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> fair<00:00:49.350> amount<00:00:49.469> so

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
managed to beat that by a fair amount so

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.990 
managed to beat that by a fair amount so
this<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.430> my<00:00:50.579> setup<00:00:50.820> here<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:52.670> you<00:00:53.670> can<00:00:53.730> see<00:00:53.910> we

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
this is my setup here and you can see we

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.979 
this is my setup here and you can see we
have<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.420> pretty<00:00:54.660> long<00:00:54.870> booster<00:00:55.410> here<00:00:55.910> with<00:00:56.989> 15

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
have a pretty long booster here with 15

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.950 
have a pretty long booster here with 15
blocks<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.949> common<00:00:59.370> track<00:00:59.670> right<00:01:00.030> here<00:01:00.090> so

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
blocks of common track right here so

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.329 
blocks of common track right here so
that's<00:01:01.170> from<00:01:02.570> this<00:01:03.570> slope<00:01:04.559> right<00:01:04.739> here<00:01:05.009> all

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
that's from this slope right here all

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.920 
that's from this slope right here all
the<00:01:05.700> way<00:01:05.729> back<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:07.760> this<00:01:08.760> final<00:01:09.030> slope<00:01:09.689> back

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
the way back to this final slope back

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.500 
the way back to this final slope back
here<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.500> that's<00:01:10.680> 15<00:01:11.130> blocks<00:01:11.340> now<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.119> second

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
here so that's 15 blocks now the second

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.940 
here so that's 15 blocks now the second
thing<00:01:12.540> I've<00:01:12.780> done<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:13.110> kind<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.380> modified<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
thing I've done is kind of modified the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.210 
thing I've done is kind of modified the
original<00:01:13.979> design<00:01:14.670> for<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.860> double<00:01:16.860> booster

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
original design for the double booster

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.370 
original design for the double booster
and<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.850> actually<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.210> quadruple<00:01:18.990> booster

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
and this is actually a quadruple booster

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.320 
and this is actually a quadruple booster
there<00:01:19.590> are<00:01:19.650> actually<00:01:19.920> four<00:01:20.220> cards<00:01:20.759> stacked

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
there are actually four cards stacked

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.990 
there are actually four cards stacked
right<00:01:21.659> here<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.100> would<00:01:23.460> stack<00:01:23.729> them<00:01:23.939> in

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
right here so you would stack them in

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.210 
right here so you would stack them in
exactly<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.570> same<00:01:24.600> way<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.710> described<00:01:26.100> in

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
exactly the same way that I described in

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.310 
exactly the same way that I described in
my<00:01:26.250> other<00:01:26.460> video<00:01:26.610> but<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.720> booster<00:01:28.140> will

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
my other video but this booster will

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.890 
my other video but this booster will
actually<00:01:28.740> like<00:01:29.220> us<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.520> beat<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:30.060> thousand

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
actually like us a beat a thousand

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.719 
actually like us a beat a thousand
pretty<00:01:31.110> easily<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:31.979> fact<00:01:32.189> we<00:01:32.310> are<00:01:32.520> going

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
pretty easily and in fact we are going

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.880 
pretty easily and in fact we are going
to<00:01:32.820> go<00:01:34.430> 6144<00:01:35.450> track<00:01:36.450> pieces<00:01:36.689> off<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.530> single

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
to go 6144 track pieces off of a single

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.429 
to go 6144 track pieces off of a single
booster<00:01:38.450> now<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.479> probably<00:01:39.930> could<00:01:40.229> have<00:01:40.259> built

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
booster now I probably could have built

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.890 
booster now I probably could have built
one<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.829> would<00:01:40.950> go<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> little<00:01:41.610> farther<00:01:41.900> than

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
one that would go a little farther than

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.300 
one that would go a little farther than
that<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.320> frankly<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:43.979> got<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> little

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
that but frankly I just got a little

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.520 
that but frankly I just got a little
tired<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.210> laying<00:01:45.750> track<00:01:47.990> 6144<00:01:48.990> took<00:01:49.290> quite<00:01:49.470> a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
tired of laying track 6144 took quite a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.480 
tired of laying track 6144 took quite a
while<00:01:50.119> but<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.780> eventual<00:01:52.649> goal<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:52.950> had<00:01:53.340> in

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
while but the eventual goal I had in

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.730 
while but the eventual goal I had in
mind<00:01:53.700> when<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.850> started<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.479> was<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:55.140> be<00:01:55.470> able

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
mind when I started this was to be able

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.249 
mind when I started this was to be able
to<00:01:56.869> essentially<00:01:57.869> go<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.290> full<00:01:58.469> length<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.860> the

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
to essentially go the full length of the

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.050 
to essentially go the full length of the
minecraft<00:02:01.280> intercontinental<00:02:02.280> railway<00:02:02.759> which

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
minecraft intercontinental railway which

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.260 
minecraft intercontinental railway which
as<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:04.619> last<00:02:04.799> video<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.310> saw<00:02:05.670> was<00:02:05.939> something

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
as of the last video I saw was something

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.199 
as of the last video I saw was something
around<00:02:06.479> 9,000<00:02:07.259> track<00:02:07.439> pieces<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:08.130> I<00:02:08.910> haven't

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
around 9,000 track pieces and I haven't

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.010 
around 9,000 track pieces and I haven't
quite<00:02:09.390> done<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:09.869> but<00:02:11.569> I'm<00:02:12.569> pretty<00:02:12.750> sure

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
quite done that but I'm pretty sure

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.809 
quite done that but I'm pretty sure
that's<00:02:13.260> possible<00:02:13.530> based<00:02:14.010> on<00:02:14.220> what<00:02:14.640> I

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
that's possible based on what I

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.449 
that's possible based on what I
found<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.450> importantly<00:02:16.079> the<00:02:16.950> guy<00:02:17.099> who<00:02:17.159> does

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
found and importantly the guy who does

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.509 
found and importantly the guy who does
the<00:02:17.489> Intercontinental<00:02:18.450> railroad<00:02:18.599> actually

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
the Intercontinental railroad actually

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.660 
the Intercontinental railroad actually
edited<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.639> game<00:02:20.849> files<00:02:21.829> to<00:02:22.829> just<00:02:23.400> send<00:02:23.609> a

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
edited the game files to just send a

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.610 
edited the game files to just send a
cart<00:02:23.939> that<00:02:24.120> far<00:02:24.450> without<00:02:25.049> any<00:02:25.260> additional

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
cart that far without any additional

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.759 
cart that far without any additional
boosters<00:02:26.280> on<00:02:26.459> there<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:27.450> what<00:02:28.109> this<00:02:28.290> will

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
boosters on there so what this will

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.709 
boosters on there so what this will
allow<00:02:29.010> us<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.159> do<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.670> basically<00:02:30.269> achieve

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:30.719 
allow us to do is basically achieve

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.720 
allow us to do is basically achieve
those<00:02:30.959> kinds<00:02:31.349> of<00:02:31.409> distances<00:02:31.980> without

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
those kinds of distances without

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.179 
those kinds of distances without
modifying<00:02:33.329> any<00:02:33.569> game<00:02:33.780> files<00:02:34.079> so<00:02:34.680> I'm<00:02:34.889> going<00:02:35.129> to

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.189 
modifying any game files so I'm going to

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.289 
modifying any game files so I'm going to
be<00:02:35.579> quiet<00:02:35.939> now<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.530> just<00:02:37.579> hop<00:02:38.579> on<00:02:38.819> and<00:02:39.120> let<00:02:39.269> it

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
be quiet now and just hop on and let it

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.050 
be quiet now and just hop on and let it
run<00:02:39.540> is<00:02:39.870> just<00:02:40.079> kind<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.319> a<00:02:40.409> proof<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.650> concept

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
run is just kind of a proof of concept

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.970 
run is just kind of a proof of concept
now<00:02:42.060> I'm<00:02:42.209> going<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.599> speed<00:02:42.900> up<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.109> video<00:02:43.379> so

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
now I'm going to speed up the video so

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.209 
now I'm going to speed up the video so
if<00:02:44.189> it<00:02:44.310> looks<00:02:44.489> like<00:02:44.549> I'm<00:02:44.730> going<00:02:44.969> a<00:02:45.150> lot<00:02:45.299> faster

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:46.219 
if it looks like I'm going a lot faster

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:48.589 
if it looks like I'm going a lot faster
that's<00:02:47.219> why<00:02:47.430> I've<00:02:47.669> actually<00:02:47.909> sped<00:02:48.450> up<00:02:48.569> the

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
that's why I've actually sped up the

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.349 
that's why I've actually sped up the
video<00:02:48.810> otherwise<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.560> takes<00:02:50.060> you<00:02:51.060> know<00:02:51.090> get

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
video otherwise it takes you know get

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.929 
video otherwise it takes you know get
10-15<00:02:52.049> minutes<00:02:52.379> to<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.919> reach<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.280> end<00:02:53.459> of<00:02:53.609> all

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:53.939 
10-15 minutes to to reach the end of all

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.740 
10-15 minutes to to reach the end of all
this<00:02:53.969> track<00:02:54.389> piece<00:02:54.629> so<00:02:55.400> for<00:02:56.400> now<00:02:56.519> let's<00:02:56.790> get

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
this track piece so for now let's get

00:02:57.750 --> 00:06:23.680 
this track piece so for now let's get
started

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.650 

alright<00:06:24.690> so<00:06:25.530> there<00:06:25.830> we<00:06:25.949> go<00:06:25.979> I<00:06:26.460> know<00:06:27.300> it<00:06:27.449> got

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 
alright so there we go I know it got

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.530 
alright so there we go I know it got
dark<00:06:27.930> on<00:06:28.139> us<00:06:28.169> there<00:06:28.440> but<00:06:28.770> we<00:06:29.550> have<00:06:29.729> reached<00:06:30.360> the

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
dark on us there but we have reached the

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:35.570 
dark on us there but we have reached the
end<00:06:30.870> of<00:06:30.960> our<00:06:31.080> track<00:06:31.940> that<00:06:32.940> is<00:06:33.150> like<00:06:33.389> say<00:06:34.580> 6144

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
end of our track that is like say 6144

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.550 
end of our track that is like say 6144
track<00:06:36.270> pieces<00:06:36.449> long<00:06:37.520> now<00:06:38.520> I<00:06:38.940> just<00:06:39.810> want<00:06:40.470> to

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
track pieces long now I just want to

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.230 
track pieces long now I just want to
point<00:06:40.740> out<00:06:40.860> a<00:06:40.919> couple<00:06:41.010> more<00:06:41.430> things<00:06:41.460> first<00:06:42.090> of

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
point out a couple more things first of

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.560 
point out a couple more things first of
all<00:06:42.300> my<00:06:42.540> world<00:06:42.870> here<00:06:43.530> is<00:06:43.710> a<00:06:43.970> test<00:06:44.970> world<00:06:45.210> I<00:06:45.360> made

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:45.570 
all my world here is a test world I made

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.590 
all my world here is a test world I made
specifically<00:06:46.110> for<00:06:46.199> this<00:06:46.590> using<00:06:47.010> a<00:06:47.100> map<00:06:47.310> editor

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 
specifically for this using a map editor

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.939 
specifically for this using a map editor
and<00:06:48.600> the<00:06:48.900> kind<00:06:49.500> of<00:06:49.560> test<00:06:49.860> area<00:06:50.370> here<00:06:50.880> is<00:06:51.000> I<00:06:51.990> have

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:52.949 
and the kind of test area here is I have

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:59.659 
and the kind of test area here is I have
something<00:06:53.430> like<00:06:55.520> 2071<00:06:56.520> blocks<00:06:57.419> long<00:06:58.669> 71

00:06:59.659 --> 00:06:59.669 
something like 2071 blocks long 71

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:03.350 
something like 2071 blocks long 71
blocks<00:06:59.910> wide<00:07:00.180> and<00:07:00.600> 25<00:07:01.139> blocks<00:07:01.350> high<00:07:02.030> so<00:07:03.030> that's

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
blocks wide and 25 blocks high so that's

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.610 
blocks wide and 25 blocks high so that's
why<00:07:03.510> I<00:07:03.539> had<00:07:03.780> to<00:07:03.810> kind<00:07:03.990> of<00:07:04.139> double<00:07:04.440> back<00:07:04.590> and

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620 
why I had to kind of double back and

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.050 
why I had to kind of double back and
forth<00:07:05.070> there<00:07:05.970> but<00:07:07.100> that<00:07:08.100> is<00:07:08.280> about<00:07:08.430> it<00:07:08.550> you<00:07:08.940> can

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 
forth there but that is about it you can

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.430 
forth there but that is about it you can
see<00:07:09.210> we<00:07:09.419> made<00:07:09.570> it<00:07:09.780> all<00:07:09.870> the<00:07:09.990> way<00:07:10.020> to<00:07:10.110> the<00:07:10.320> end

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 
see we made it all the way to the end

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.850 
see we made it all the way to the end
without<00:07:11.130> any<00:07:11.460> discernible<00:07:12.389> loss<00:07:12.539> of<00:07:12.720> speed<00:07:13.050> so

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 
without any discernible loss of speed so

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.340 
without any discernible loss of speed so
i'm<00:07:14.460> pretty<00:07:14.639> sure<00:07:14.940> that<00:07:14.970> using<00:07:15.780> a<00:07:16.020> combination

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:16.350 
i'm pretty sure that using a combination

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.550 
i'm pretty sure that using a combination
of<00:07:16.770> a<00:07:16.949> longer<00:07:17.280> common<00:07:18.030> section<00:07:18.840> on<00:07:19.020> the<00:07:19.050> the

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 
of a longer common section on the the

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.129 
of a longer common section on the the
booster<00:07:19.950> and<00:07:20.280> more<00:07:20.669> stacked<00:07:21.150> minecarts<00:07:21.930> we

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:22.139 
booster and more stacked minecarts we

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:23.360 
booster and more stacked minecarts we
could<00:07:22.289> probably<00:07:22.410> achieve<00:07:22.860> much<00:07:23.099> greater

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.370 
could probably achieve much greater

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.640 
could probably achieve much greater
links<00:07:23.729> than<00:07:23.880> this<00:07:24.060> but<00:07:25.020> like<00:07:25.139> say<00:07:25.410> that's

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:25.650 
links than this but like say that's

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.279 
links than this but like say that's
about<00:07:25.889> all<00:07:25.919> the<00:07:26.780> tracking<00:07:27.780> i<00:07:27.990> had<00:07:28.169> the

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:28.289 
about all the tracking i had the

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:32.420 
about all the tracking i had the
patience<00:07:28.680> for<00:07:28.880> but<00:07:29.880> anyway<00:07:30.889> i'm<00:07:31.889> not<00:07:32.099> sure<00:07:32.280> how

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:32.430 
patience for but anyway i'm not sure how

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.820 
patience for but anyway i'm not sure how
practical<00:07:32.849> this<00:07:33.120> is<00:07:33.330> I<00:07:33.630> know<00:07:34.080> I<00:07:34.229> certainly

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:34.830 
practical this is I know I certainly

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.490 
practical this is I know I certainly
don't<00:07:35.130> have<00:07:35.370> any<00:07:35.780> basis<00:07:36.780> separated<00:07:37.380> by

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 
don't have any basis separated by

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.879 
don't have any basis separated by
anything<00:07:38.220> near<00:07:38.610> that<00:07:38.940> many<00:07:39.539> track<00:07:39.780> pieces<00:07:39.960> but

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:40.889 
anything near that many track pieces but

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:44.480 
anything near that many track pieces but
it<00:07:41.760> is<00:07:42.229> possible<00:07:43.229> without<00:07:43.560> doing<00:07:44.099> any<00:07:44.250> kind<00:07:44.400> of

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:44.490 
it is possible without doing any kind of

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:48.219 
it is possible without doing any kind of
editing<00:07:44.849> and<00:07:45.000> i<00:07:45.539> will<00:07:45.810> upload<00:07:46.199> the<00:07:46.320> save<00:07:46.830> file

00:07:48.219 --> 00:07:48.229 
editing and i will upload the save file

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:51.740 
editing and i will upload the save file
so<00:07:49.229> you<00:07:49.560> can<00:07:49.680> certainly<00:07:50.370> play<00:07:50.580> around<00:07:50.849> and<00:07:51.270> see

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:51.750 
so you can certainly play around and see

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.260 
so you can certainly play around and see
for<00:07:51.870> yourself<00:07:52.199> but<00:07:53.070> thanks<00:07:53.910> a<00:07:53.970> lot<00:07:54.090> for

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:54.270 
for yourself but thanks a lot for

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.360 
for yourself but thanks a lot for
watching
