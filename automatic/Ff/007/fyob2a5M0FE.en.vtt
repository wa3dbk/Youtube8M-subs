I'm<00:04:31.870> sure<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.110> chocolate<00:04:32.260> is<00:04:32.560> you<00:04:33.220> know

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
I'm sure the chocolate is you know

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.450 
I'm sure the chocolate is you know
influencing<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.150> flavor<00:04:34.419> of<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:34.990> caramel

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
influencing the flavor of the caramel

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.640 
influencing the flavor of the caramel
but<00:04:36.460> you<00:04:37.240> bite<00:04:37.419> into<00:04:37.690> this<00:04:37.840> you're<00:04:38.470> biting

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
but you bite into this you're biting

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.170 
but you bite into this you're biting
into<00:04:38.889> the<00:04:39.130> caramel<00:04:39.520> that's<00:04:39.790> what<00:04:40.060> you're

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
into the caramel that's what you're

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.900 
into the caramel that's what you're
tasting<00:04:40.360> that's<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:41.110> real<00:04:41.380> payoff<00:04:42.010> here<00:04:42.430> so

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
tasting that's the real payoff here so

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.930 
tasting that's the real payoff here so
caramel<00:04:43.660> fans<00:04:43.870> out<00:04:44.080> there<00:04:44.190> this<00:04:45.190> is<00:04:45.430> great

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
caramel fans out there this is great

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.640 
caramel fans out there this is great
this<00:04:46.450> is<00:04:46.600> this<00:04:46.840> is<00:04:46.930> definitely<00:04:47.350> one<00:04:47.500> you'd

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
this is this is definitely one you'd

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.810 
this is this is definitely one you'd
want<00:04:47.860> to<00:04:47.919> try<00:04:48.160> it's<00:04:48.880> uh<00:04:50.160> it's<00:04:51.160> got<00:04:51.280> a<00:04:51.340> strong

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
want to try it's uh it's got a strong

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.520 
want to try it's uh it's got a strong
strong<00:04:52.660> caramel<00:04:53.290> to<00:04:53.830> it<00:04:53.979> and<00:04:54.610> I<00:04:55.320> think<00:04:56.320> it's

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
strong caramel to it and I think it's

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.159 
strong caramel to it and I think it's
good<00:04:56.680> for<00:04:56.710> that<00:04:56.979> reason<00:04:57.419> is<00:04:58.419> it<00:04:58.810> something<00:04:58.990> I'm

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
good for that reason is it something I'm

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.219 
good for that reason is it something I'm
gonna<00:04:59.320> go<00:04:59.500> seek<00:04:59.770> out<00:05:00.120> too<00:05:01.120> often<00:05:01.330> probably<00:05:01.900> not

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
gonna go seek out too often probably not

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.250 
gonna go seek out too often probably not
I<00:05:02.530> wouldn't<00:05:03.070> pass<00:05:03.250> it<00:05:03.490> up<00:05:03.639> if<00:05:04.210> it<00:05:04.720> was<00:05:04.930> right<00:05:05.169> in

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
I wouldn't pass it up if it was right in

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.210 
I wouldn't pass it up if it was right in
front<00:05:05.320> of<00:05:05.500> me<00:05:05.729> but<00:05:07.590> for<00:05:08.590> my<00:05:08.740> money<00:05:08.950> I'd

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
front of me but for my money I'd

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.440 
front of me but for my money I'd
probably<00:05:09.490> rather<00:05:09.729> go<00:05:09.940> with<00:05:10.030> a<00:05:10.090> different<00:05:10.240> kind

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
probably rather go with a different kind
