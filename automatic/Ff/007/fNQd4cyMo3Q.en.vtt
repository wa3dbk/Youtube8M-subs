pretty<00:00:42.570> good<00:00:42.960> staying<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.980> trade<00:00:44.280> with<00:00:44.460> i

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
pretty good staying to trade with i

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.490 
pretty good staying to trade with i
found<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.149> few<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.629> were<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:46.140> over<00:00:46.440> a

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
found that a few that were just over a

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.440 
found that a few that were just over a
thousand<00:00:46.950> coins<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.489> i<00:00:47.550> would<00:00:47.760> try<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.210> sell

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
thousand coins and i would try and sell

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.400 
thousand coins and i would try and sell
them<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:48.690> for<00:00:48.840> about<00:00:48.930> 1.2<00:00:49.710> 1.3<00:00:50.160> k<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.090> see<00:00:51.930> if<00:00:52.199> i

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
them on for about 1.2 1.3 k and see if i

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.500 
them on for about 1.2 1.3 k and see if i
can<00:00:52.590> make<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> little<00:00:53.100> bit<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.280> profit<00:00:53.579> now<00:00:53.969> i

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
can make a little bit of profit now i

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.660 
can make a little bit of profit now i
finally<00:00:55.020> found<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.500> hard<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.800> make<00:00:56.039> any<00:00:56.370> big

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
finally found it hard to make any big

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.180 
finally found it hard to make any big
profits<00:00:57.149> with<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.510> method<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:58.230> some<00:00:58.620> for

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
profits with this method but some for

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.729 
profits with this method but some for
sure<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.579> can<00:00:59.789> make<00:00:59.969> maybe<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.750> hundred<00:01:00.989> 200

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
sure you can make maybe a hundred 200

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.750 
sure you can make maybe a hundred 200
coins<00:01:03.409> you<00:01:04.409> know<00:01:04.530> just<00:01:04.920> by<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.129> know<00:01:05.430> spending

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
coins you know just by you know spending

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.670 
coins you know just by you know spending
a<00:01:05.820> bit<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:05.970> time<00:01:06.060> checking<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:07.170> stadium's

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
a bit of time checking the stadium's

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.350 
a bit of time checking the stadium's
price<00:01:07.979> checking<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.549> lowest<00:01:08.850> bin<00:01:09.090> and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
price checking the lowest bin and

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.149 
price checking the lowest bin and
because<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.080> can't<00:01:10.290> do<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.500> direct<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.040> it

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
because you can't do it direct so it

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.770 
because you can't do it direct so it
does<00:01:11.340> take<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.610> bit<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.790> time<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.390> isn't<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
does take a bit of time so it isn't the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.170 
does take a bit of time so it isn't the
best<00:01:12.990> method<00:01:13.439> but<00:01:14.130> if<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.729> do<00:01:14.939> have<00:01:15.150> that

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
best method but if you do have that

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.910 
best method but if you do have that
extra<00:01:15.570> bit<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.810> time<00:01:16.049> then<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.439> worth<00:01:16.650> doing

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
extra bit of time then it is worth doing

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.950 
extra bit of time then it is worth doing
i<00:01:17.159> would<00:01:17.250> say<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.790> second<00:01:18.150> methods<00:01:18.450> which

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
i would say so the second methods which

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.510 
i would say so the second methods which
is<00:01:19.170> probably<00:01:19.439> my<00:01:19.680> favorite<00:01:19.710> method<00:01:20.400> out

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
is probably my favorite method out

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.980 
is probably my favorite method out
before<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.030> i'm<00:01:21.150> going<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.479> show<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.720> today

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
before that i'm going to show you today

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.030 
before that i'm going to show you today
and<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.920> actually<00:01:23.570> putting<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:25.040> minimum

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
and this is actually putting the minimum

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.260 
and this is actually putting the minimum
price<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.670> max<00:01:27.000> price<00:01:27.330> now<00:01:27.770> i<00:01:28.770> would<00:01:29.640> say<00:01:29.880> turn

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
price and max price now i would say turn

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.330 
price and max price now i would say turn
the<00:01:30.299> minimum<00:01:30.689> price<00:01:30.900> if<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.320> over<00:01:31.530> 10k<00:01:31.799> i

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
the minimum price if you have over 10k i

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.640 
the minimum price if you have over 10k i
would<00:01:32.700> say<00:01:32.850> put<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.210> minimum<00:01:33.509> price<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.990> 1k

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
would say put the minimum price of 1k

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.760 
would say put the minimum price of 1k
and<00:01:34.979> then<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.880> maximum<00:01:36.420> price<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:37.020> whatever

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
and then a maximum price of whatever

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.520 
and then a maximum price of whatever
your<00:01:38.130> budget<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.570> if<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:39.930> 10,000

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
your budget is so if you have 10,000

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.010 
your budget is so if you have 10,000
coins<00:01:40.619> put<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.670> max<00:01:41.909> price<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.299> 10,000

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
coins put it to a max price of 10,000

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.920 
coins put it to a max price of 10,000
coins<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:44.280> see<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.850> works<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.570> this

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
coins and see if that works and this

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.899 
coins and see if that works and this
it's<00:01:46.470> something<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.070> certainly<00:01:47.369> did<00:01:47.729> do<00:01:47.880> a

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
it's something that I certainly did do a

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.600 
it's something that I certainly did do a
lot<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.390> fever<00:01:49.049> 14<00:01:49.530> when<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> lot<00:01:50.159> more<00:01:50.310> coins

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
lot in fever 14 when I a lot more coins

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.719 
lot in fever 14 when I a lot more coins
and<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.909> was<00:01:51.119> very<00:01:51.840> very<00:01:52.020> effective<00:01:52.729> even

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
and it was very very effective even

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.520 
and it was very very effective even
still<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.570> know<00:01:54.689> with<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> low<00:01:55.200> amount<00:01:55.409> of

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
still you know with a low amount of

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.730 
still you know with a low amount of
coins<00:01:55.770> like<00:01:56.040> I've<00:01:56.340> here<00:01:56.729> I've<00:01:57.689> only<00:01:57.869> got<00:01:58.049> 2k<00:01:58.290> at

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
coins like I've here I've only got 2k at

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.440 
coins like I've here I've only got 2k at
the<00:01:58.829> minute<00:01:59.100> because<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.430> was<00:01:59.579> obviously

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
the minute because I was obviously

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.899 
the minute because I was obviously
buying<00:02:00.840> other<00:02:01.110> things<00:02:01.770> at<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> same<00:02:02.250> time<00:02:02.579> I

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
buying other things at the same time I

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.870 
buying other things at the same time I
did<00:02:03.420> find<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:03.810> battery<00:02:04.590> Sonia<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.250> pretty

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
did find this battery Sonia and pretty

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.249 
did find this battery Sonia and pretty
cheap<00:02:06.180> he<00:02:06.329> was<00:02:06.479> going<00:02:06.719> for<00:02:06.810> like<00:02:07.049> 1.8<00:02:08.090> on<00:02:09.090> bid<00:02:09.959> I

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
cheap he was going for like 1.8 on bid I

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.290 
cheap he was going for like 1.8 on bid I
think<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.649> was<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.129> his<00:02:11.459> lows<00:02:11.670> by<00:02:11.940> now<00:02:12.120> was

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
think it was and his lows by now was

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.230 
think it was and his lows by now was
like<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.629> point<00:02:12.750> for<00:02:12.930> each

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
like to point for each

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.510 
like to point for each
forward<00:02:13.690> so<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:13.840> thought<00:02:14.080> I<00:02:14.320> would<00:02:14.590> bag<00:02:15.280> that

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
forward so I thought I would bag that

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.640 
forward so I thought I would bag that
one<00:02:15.820> point<00:02:16.090> nine<00:02:16.150> actually<00:02:16.570> did<00:02:16.900> win<00:02:17.140> that<00:02:17.350> as

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
one point nine actually did win that as

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.220 
one point nine actually did win that as
well<00:02:17.950> banging<00:02:18.370> me<00:02:18.490> a<00:02:18.790> 300-point<00:02:19.660> profit<00:02:20.140> at

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
well banging me a 300-point profit at

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.470 
well banging me a 300-point profit at
least<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:21.130> that<00:02:21.160> is<00:02:21.550> pretty<00:02:21.760> good<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.360> an

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
least so that is pretty good it is it an

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.370 
least so that is pretty good it is it an
effective<00:02:23.290> training<00:02:23.590> methods<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:24.900> yeah<00:02:25.900> it

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
effective training methods and yeah it

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.600 
effective training methods and yeah it
should<00:02:26.620> work<00:02:26.770> throughout<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.250> year<00:02:27.400> whatever

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
should work throughout the year whatever

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.400 
should work throughout the year whatever
budget<00:02:28.150> you<00:02:28.270> have<00:02:28.300> as<00:02:28.600> long<00:02:28.750> as<00:02:28.900> you've<00:02:29.020> got<00:02:29.050> I

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
budget you have as long as you've got I

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.100 
budget you have as long as you've got I
would<00:02:29.800> say<00:02:30.010> maybe<00:02:30.220> over<00:02:30.520> 5k<00:02:31.030> over<00:02:31.420> 10,000

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
would say maybe over 5k over 10,000

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.200 
would say maybe over 5k over 10,000
coins<00:02:32.290> something<00:02:33.220> like<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.370> just<00:02:33.550> so<00:02:34.180> you

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
coins something like that just so you

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.390 
coins something like that just so you
have<00:02:34.360> a<00:02:34.420> bit<00:02:34.660> of<00:02:34.690> bit<00:02:35.350> of<00:02:35.470> variation<00:02:35.860> with<00:02:36.280> the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
have a bit of bit of variation with the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.490 
have a bit of bit of variation with the
with<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:36.940> minimum<00:02:37.300> price<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.780> maximum<00:02:38.290> price

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
with the minimum price and maximum price

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.590 
with the minimum price and maximum price
as<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:38.800> can<00:02:38.950> see<00:02:39.070> I<00:02:39.100> did<00:02:39.370> by<00:02:39.640> quite<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.510> few

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
as you can see I did by quite a few

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.420 
as you can see I did by quite a few
other<00:02:40.900> players<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.620> did<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:41.950> same<00:02:42.160> effort

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
other players and did the same effort

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.280 
other players and did the same effort
and<00:02:42.760> made<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.210> know<00:02:43.300> 200<00:02:43.540> friend<00:02:44.020> record

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
and made you know 200 friend record

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.170 
and made you know 200 friend record
profit<00:02:44.590> it's<00:02:44.710> not<00:02:44.890> massive<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:45.790> it's<00:02:46.000> quite

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
profit it's not massive and it's quite

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.210 
profit it's not massive and it's quite
hard<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.540> find<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:47.140> know<00:02:47.260> really<00:02:47.530> you<00:02:48.130> know

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
hard to find you know really you know

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.370 
hard to find you know really you know
good<00:02:48.460> deals<00:02:48.670> where<00:02:48.910> you<00:02:48.970> makin<00:02:49.270> 500<00:02:49.750> 600<00:02:50.230> coins

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
good deals where you makin 500 600 coins

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.260 
good deals where you makin 500 600 coins
like<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.740> was<00:02:50.860> in<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.070> last<00:02:51.250> episode<00:02:51.520> because

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
like I was in the last episode because

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.660 
like I was in the last episode because
people<00:02:53.230> are<00:02:53.320> now<00:02:53.440> are<00:02:53.590> not<00:02:53.860> put<00:02:54.220> in<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.460> for

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
people are now are not put in it for

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.180 
people are now are not put in it for
crazy<00:02:55.060> low<00:02:55.240> prices<00:02:55.780> as<00:02:56.200> they<00:02:56.830> were<00:02:57.010> before

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
crazy low prices as they were before

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.490 
crazy low prices as they were before
I've<00:02:57.520> never<00:02:57.550> ready<00:02:58.090> you<00:02:58.390> know<00:02:58.540> getting<00:02:59.320> used

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
I've never ready you know getting used

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.170 
I've never ready you know getting used
to<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.710> market<00:03:00.130> seeing<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.490> prices<00:03:00.970> and

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
to the market seeing the prices and

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.820 
to the market seeing the prices and
putting<00:03:01.420> it<00:03:01.510> just<00:03:01.750> below<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.230> lowest<00:03:02.380> bin<00:03:02.680> and

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
putting it just below the lowest bin and

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.410 
putting it just below the lowest bin and
not<00:03:02.950> putting<00:03:03.250> it<00:03:03.400> really<00:03:03.790> really<00:03:04.000> cheap<00:03:04.210> so

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
not putting it really really cheap so

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.570 
not putting it really really cheap so
it's<00:03:04.660> hard<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:04.990> to<00:03:05.590> do<00:03:05.710> the<00:03:05.830> method<00:03:06.160> that<00:03:06.280> I<00:03:06.340> did

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
it's hard to to do the method that I did

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.840 
it's hard to to do the method that I did
do<00:03:06.730> in<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:06.940> last<00:03:07.180> episode<00:03:08.100> even<00:03:09.100> if<00:03:09.280> you<00:03:09.670> did

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
do in the last episode even if you did

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.180 
do in the last episode even if you did
spend<00:03:10.120> quite<00:03:10.210> a<00:03:10.390> bit<00:03:10.450> of<00:03:10.570> time<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.290> then<00:03:11.770> yes

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
spend quite a bit of time and then yes

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.190 
spend quite a bit of time and then yes
it<00:03:12.400> probably<00:03:12.610> could<00:03:12.880> work<00:03:13.120> but<00:03:13.480> like<00:03:13.900> I<00:03:14.020> said<00:03:14.080> I

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
it probably could work but like I said I

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.480 
it probably could work but like I said I
didn't<00:03:14.440> really<00:03:14.560> have<00:03:14.710> a<00:03:14.740> lot<00:03:14.920> of<00:03:14.980> time<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.430> I

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
didn't really have a lot of time and I

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.880 
didn't really have a lot of time and I
try<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.090> use<00:03:16.570> trade<00:03:17.230> methods<00:03:17.380> that<00:03:17.680> i<00:03:17.770> have

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
try to use trade methods that i have

and the final one is to do with invest

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.660 
and the final one is to do with invest
in<00:05:10.600> the<00:05:10.660> final<00:05:10.990> method<00:05:11.140> and<00:05:11.560> I<00:05:11.920> try<00:05:12.280> to<00:05:12.310> do<00:05:12.550> this

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
in the final method and I try to do this

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.910 
in the final method and I try to do this
with<00:05:12.880> Raphael<00:05:14.760> what<00:05:15.760> I<00:05:15.790> did<00:05:16.030> was<00:05:16.690> searched<00:05:17.440> for

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
with Raphael what I did was searched for

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.650 
with Raphael what I did was searched for
his<00:05:18.130> lowest<00:05:18.550> bin<00:05:18.760> which<00:05:18.970> was<00:05:19.180> actually<00:05:19.420> I

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
his lowest bin which was actually I

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.580 
his lowest bin which was actually I
think<00:05:19.750> 2.2<00:05:20.710> k<00:05:21.070> so<00:05:21.130> I<00:05:21.370> thought<00:05:21.640> I<00:05:21.700> would<00:05:21.850> try<00:05:22.150> and

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
think 2.2 k so I thought I would try and

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.170 
think 2.2 k so I thought I would try and
buying<00:05:23.590> for<00:05:23.860> around<00:05:24.130> about<00:05:24.250> two<00:05:24.640> thousand

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
buying for around about two thousand

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.430 
buying for around about two thousand
coins<00:05:25.300> and<00:05:25.600> take<00:05:25.750> a<00:05:25.780> little<00:05:25.990> bit<00:05:26.170> of<00:05:26.230> a<00:05:26.290> risk

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
coins and take a little bit of a risk

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.030 
coins and take a little bit of a risk
this<00:05:26.710> is<00:05:26.890> a<00:05:27.160> risky<00:05:27.880> method<00:05:28.210> because<00:05:28.540> they<00:05:29.040> may

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
this is a risky method because they may

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.710 
this is a risky method because they may
not<00:05:30.070> go<00:05:30.370> up<00:05:30.490> in<00:05:30.610> price<00:05:30.640> but<00:05:31.030> I<00:05:31.060> chose<00:05:31.300> a<00:05:31.360> player
