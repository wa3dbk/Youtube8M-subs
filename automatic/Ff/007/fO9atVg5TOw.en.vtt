on how to store wine and first let's go

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.259 
on how to store wine and first let's go
over<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.440> three<00:00:13.679> most<00:00:13.860> important<00:00:14.549> factors<00:00:15.030> on

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
over the three most important factors on

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.259 
over the three most important factors on
what<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.780> consider<00:00:16.170> with<00:00:16.379> wine<00:00:16.560> storage

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:18.269 
what to consider with wine storage

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:20.329 
what to consider with wine storage
the<00:00:18.810> most<00:00:19.019> important<00:00:19.500> factor<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.189> actually

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:20.339 
the most important factor is actually

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.400 
the most important factor is actually
temperature<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.269> ideas<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.869> stay<00:00:22.050> cool<00:00:22.380> and

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
temperature and ideas to stay cool and

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.249 
temperature and ideas to stay cool and
consistent<00:00:23.279> about<00:00:24.089> 12<00:00:24.660> or<00:00:24.839> 13<00:00:24.869> degrees

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:25.259 
consistent about 12 or 13 degrees

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.859 
consistent about 12 or 13 degrees
Celsius<00:00:25.980> or<00:00:26.160> 55<00:00:26.640> Fahrenheit<00:00:27.239> for<00:00:27.809> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
Celsius or 55 Fahrenheit for the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.779 
Celsius or 55 Fahrenheit for the
temperature<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.500> consistent<00:00:29.399> in<00:00:29.489> the<00:00:29.550> sense

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
temperature and consistent in the sense

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.429 
temperature and consistent in the sense
that<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.029> just<00:00:30.149> don't<00:00:30.390> want<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.809> fluctuate

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
that you just don't want it to fluctuate

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.770 
that you just don't want it to fluctuate
between<00:00:31.559> warm<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.129> cold<00:00:32.369> by<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.640> time<00:00:32.780> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
between warm and cold by the time the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.149 
between warm and cold by the time the
reason<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.110> don't<00:00:34.260> want<00:00:34.379> it<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.620> be<00:00:34.739> too<00:00:34.890> warm

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:35.159 
reason you don't want it to be too warm

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:36.560 
reason you don't want it to be too warm
is<00:00:35.339> because<00:00:35.519> it<00:00:35.640> accelerates<00:00:36.269> the<00:00:36.390> aging

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
is because it accelerates the aging

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.720 
is because it accelerates the aging
process<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.470> the<00:00:37.559> bottle<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.040> not<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.699> good

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
process in the bottle and not in a good

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.259 
process in the bottle and not in a good
way

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
way

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:41.329 
way
so<00:00:40.079> when<00:00:40.350> they're<00:00:40.530> stirring<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.979> wine<00:00:41.159> at

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
so when they're stirring the wine at

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:43.750 
so when they're stirring the wine at
home<00:00:41.579> try<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.390> keep<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.750> away<00:00:42.839> from<00:00:43.170> any<00:00:43.350> heat

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
home try to keep it away from any heat

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.889 
home try to keep it away from any heat
definitely<00:00:44.760> away<00:00:44.940> from<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> radiators<00:00:45.870> that

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
definitely away from the radiators that

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.069 
definitely away from the radiators that
are<00:00:46.470> going<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.769> warm<00:00:47.010> up<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.280> wine<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.930> other

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
are going to warm up the wine the other

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.080 
are going to warm up the wine the other
factor<00:00:49.470> to<00:00:49.589> consider<00:00:49.769> is<00:00:50.190> light<00:00:50.429> as<00:00:50.789> then<00:00:50.969> you

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
factor to consider is light as then you

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.000 
factor to consider is light as then you
want<00:00:51.269> to<00:00:51.300> stay<00:00:51.510> away<00:00:51.780> from<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.230> whether<00:00:52.710> it's

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
want to stay away from it whether it's

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.160 
want to stay away from it whether it's
sunlight<00:00:53.519> or<00:00:53.789> even<00:00:54.179> light<00:00:54.359> from<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.660> lamp<00:00:54.840> all

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
sunlight or even light from the lamp all

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.439 
sunlight or even light from the lamp all
those<00:00:55.620> things<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:56.070> adversely<00:00:56.699> react<00:00:57.149> with

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
those things can adversely react with

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.970 
those things can adversely react with
the<00:00:57.539> phenolic<00:00:57.899> compounds<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> wine<00:00:58.949> and

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
the phenolic compounds in the wine and

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.130 
the phenolic compounds in the wine and
break<00:00:59.429> it<00:00:59.609> down<00:00:59.730> further<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.750> want<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.019> keep

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
break it down further so I want to keep

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.660 
break it down further so I want to keep
it<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.440> dark<00:01:01.679> place<00:01:01.769> and<00:01:02.339> that's<00:01:02.399> actually

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
it in a dark place and that's actually

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.270 
it in a dark place and that's actually
why<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.719> see<00:01:03.929> a<00:01:03.960> lot<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.170> ones<00:01:04.470> packaged

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
why you see a lot of ones packaged

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.810 
why you see a lot of ones packaged
in<00:01:05.369> kind<00:01:06.149> of<00:01:06.270> dark<00:01:06.690> glass<00:01:07.429> bottles<00:01:08.429> to<00:01:08.610> kind<00:01:08.789> of

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
in kind of dark glass bottles to kind of

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.430 
in kind of dark glass bottles to kind of
protect<00:01:09.090> from<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.330> UV<00:01:09.659> filters<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.229> come

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
protect from the UV filters that come

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.730 
protect from the UV filters that come
through<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.890> break<00:01:11.250> down<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.520> wine<00:01:12.740> final

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
through and break down the wine final

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.830 
through and break down the wine final
factor<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.190> consider<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.820> humidity<00:01:15.300> so<00:01:15.780> you

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
factor to consider is humidity so you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.960 
factor to consider is humidity so you
don't<00:01:16.200> want<00:01:16.619> your<00:01:16.830> storage<00:01:17.159> space<00:01:17.429> to<00:01:17.460> be<00:01:17.759> too

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
don't want your storage space to be too

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.330 
don't want your storage space to be too
dry<00:01:18.300> what<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:18.810> happen<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.319> the<00:01:19.800> cork<00:01:20.100> will

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
dry what can happen is the cork will

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.859 
dry what can happen is the cork will
draw<00:01:20.550> it<00:01:20.610> out<00:01:20.789> it'll<00:01:21.090> crumble<00:01:21.509> when<00:01:21.780> you're

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
draw it out it'll crumble when you're

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.749 
draw it out it'll crumble when you're
going<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.050> open<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.340> don't<00:01:23.520> have

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
going to open it and you just don't have

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.660 
going to open it and you just don't have
that<00:01:23.820> happen<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:25.259> fridge<00:01:25.500> space<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:26.070> okay<00:01:26.430> but

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
that happen the fridge space is okay but

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.520 
that happen the fridge space is okay but
it's<00:01:26.790> actually<00:01:27.210> very<00:01:27.240> dry<00:01:27.720> air<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.350> there<00:01:28.500> so

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
it's actually very dry air in there so

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.980 
it's actually very dry air in there so
it's<00:01:28.860> okay<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> keep<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.579> wine<00:01:29.759> just<00:01:30.630> before

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
it's okay to keep the wine just before

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.810 
it's okay to keep the wine just before
serving<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.619> but<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.070> really<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.520> ideal

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
serving it but it's really that ideal

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.600 
serving it but it's really that ideal
for<00:01:33.119> long-term<00:01:33.600> wine<00:01:34.140> storage<00:01:34.469> so<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.399> now

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
for long-term wine storage so you now

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.010 
for long-term wine storage so you now
know<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.850> most<00:01:36.210> important<00:01:36.630> factors<00:01:36.990> to

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
know the most important factors to

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.749 
know the most important factors to
consider<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.740> want<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.040> store<00:01:38.250> your<00:01:38.369> wine<00:01:38.549> in

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
consider you want to store your wine in

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.789 
consider you want to store your wine in
a<00:01:38.820> cool<00:01:39.060> place<00:01:39.390> away<00:01:39.630> from<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:40.140> direct<00:01:40.500> sunlight

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
a cool place away from a direct sunlight

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.950 
a cool place away from a direct sunlight
and<00:01:41.189> not<00:01:41.430> anywhere<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.820> drive<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.750> court

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
you say but they're generally the cost

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
of one of these is a lot less than the

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.580 
of one of these is a lot less than the
value<00:02:40.940> of<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.210> one<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:41.630> absolutely<00:02:42.350> yeah

and<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.250> difference<00:02:43.580> is<00:02:43.730> that<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:44.680> normal

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680
