00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hi to all Egyptians not density 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.760
 I was doing a video for a week and 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:11.360
 so today I have to contribute to mine 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.580
 weekly pain in the ass 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:19.800
 today I will explain you some goals 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:24.240
 special that you can put with the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.539
 player I will explain to you how to remove 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.590
 weapons is like talking on the phone then 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.660
 let's start with oar comes everything 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.430
 logically to show the effect of 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:42.390
 this I must first put up weapons 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.480
 then to put the weapons we are 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.050
 all cases to web pick up 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.590
 we choose the weapon with y on 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:59.670
 we select it with space we choose the 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:02.520
 number of ammunition and then we put spa 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.860
 with mons if we want to spread soil 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.960
 one or if you spasm infinitely 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.380
 for example if we want only one 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:18.270
 armor or endless armor and us 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.560
 we are sporting mons ok how we put a 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.560
 any goal 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.530
 here then we can never plan 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:34.189
 the goal that will allow us to 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:37.880
 remove all weapons and we will know who 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.880
 let's put another hole 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.240
 let's pretend we have to mention a 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.240
 other 6 j 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.800

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:17.000
 Saturday he was on the weapon but he broke me 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:21.709
 your ass anyway you can see fiction 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.290
 this is useful if for example you want that 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.560
 the player after a certain goal does not 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:40.540

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:43.730
 function ie talking on the phone ok 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.300

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:52.370

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:55.480

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:02.390

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:07.900

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.900
 what we want should always then 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:17.829

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:39.620

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:43.980
