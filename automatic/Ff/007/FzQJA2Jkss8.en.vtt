00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
conversations and they're like we get

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.380 
conversations and they're like we get
both<00:01:15.750> sides<00:01:16.020> now<00:01:16.619> from<00:01:16.860> their<00:01:17.040> aspect<00:01:17.970> you

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
both sides now from their aspect you

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.450 
both sides now from their aspect you
know<00:01:18.420> if<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:19.320> don't<00:01:19.560> have<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.950> laws<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.430> place

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
know if you don't have the laws in place

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.760 
know if you don't have the laws in place
then<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.360> bigger<00:01:21.780> picture<00:01:22.170> will<00:01:22.350> suffer

then the bigger picture will suffer

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.070 
then the bigger picture will suffer
right<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.580> it's<00:01:23.729> an<00:01:23.850> excuse<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.540> discriminate

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
that particular case I would have worked

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.929 
that particular case I would have worked

if I'm the flower shop owner I would try
to<00:01:59.969> find<00:02:00.210> some<00:02:00.540> solution<00:02:01.229> rather<00:02:01.560> than

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
to find some solution rather than

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.370 
to find some solution rather than
letting<00:02:03.030> me<00:02:03.210> get<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.689> legal<00:02:04.020> perspective

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380

figure out how to solve those conflicts
