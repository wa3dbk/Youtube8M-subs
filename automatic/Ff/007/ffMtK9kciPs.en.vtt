hey everybody and welcome back today we

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.220 
hey everybody and welcome back today we
wanted<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.790> take<00:00:09.000> just<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.420> quick<00:00:09.660> second<00:00:10.139> to

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
wanted to take just a quick second to

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.980 
wanted to take just a quick second to
show<00:00:10.679> you<00:00:10.740> how<00:00:11.190> we<00:00:11.250> have<00:00:11.790> learned<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.420> do<00:00:12.599> the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
show you how we have learned to do the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.849 
show you how we have learned to do the
knockdown<00:00:13.440> texture<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:15.450> ceiling<00:00:16.080> when<00:00:16.619> you

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
knockdown texture on a ceiling when you

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.740 
knockdown texture on a ceiling when you
are<00:00:17.130> doing<00:00:17.580> new<00:00:17.820> construction<00:00:17.850> or

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
are doing new construction or

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.620 
are doing new construction or
reconstruction<00:00:19.250> I<00:00:20.250> have<00:00:21.000> looked<00:00:21.210> everywhere

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
reconstruction I have looked everywhere

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.810 
reconstruction I have looked everywhere
online<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.619> found<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.160> few<00:00:23.430> videos<00:00:23.789> that

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
online and found a few videos that

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.070 
online and found a few videos that
didn't<00:00:24.510> help<00:00:24.720> us<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.320> learn<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.859> process<00:00:26.400> and

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
didn't help us to learn the process and

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.810 
didn't help us to learn the process and
now<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.140> are<00:00:28.500> trying<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.920> apply<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.670> it's

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
now we are trying to apply it and it's

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.400 
now we are trying to apply it and it's
actually<00:00:30.240> going<00:00:30.420> pretty<00:00:30.810> well

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
actually going pretty well

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.799 
actually going pretty well
so<00:00:31.830> we<00:00:32.099> thought<00:00:32.340> we<00:00:32.640> would<00:00:32.790> let<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.239> see<00:00:33.540> how

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
so we thought we would let you see how

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.870 
so we thought we would let you see how
we<00:00:33.870> are<00:00:34.290> doing<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:34.950> case<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.399> want<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.670> save

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
we are doing it in case you want to save

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.479 
we are doing it in case you want to save
yourself<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.450> little<00:00:36.600> bit<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.110> do<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:38.010> your

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
yourself a little bit and do it your

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.139 
yourself a little bit and do it your
self<00:00:39.079> as<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.559> can<00:00:40.770> see<00:00:41.040> right<00:00:41.280> now<00:00:41.309> my<00:00:41.700> husband

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
self as you can see right now my husband

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.229 
self as you can see right now my husband
is<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.420> taking<00:00:43.290> some<00:00:43.559> drywall<00:00:43.890> wall<00:00:44.579> mud<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
is just taking some drywall wall mud and

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.010 
is just taking some drywall wall mud and
just<00:00:45.780> placing<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.350> up<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.129> ceiling<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.020> in

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
just placing it up on the ceiling and in

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.639 
just placing it up on the ceiling and in
no<00:00:49.440> particular<00:00:50.219> pattern<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.570> he's<00:00:52.350> putting

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
no particular pattern and he's putting

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.500 
no particular pattern and he's putting
it<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:52.890> very<00:00:53.129> thick<00:00:53.430> we<00:00:53.610> have<00:00:53.789> found<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.300> as

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
it on very thick we have found that as

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.029 
it on very thick we have found that as
we<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.870> been<00:00:54.989> going<00:00:55.199> along<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.620> hallways

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
we have been going along the hallways

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.209 
we have been going along the hallways
and<00:00:56.280> trying<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.820> perfect<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.980> system<00:00:58.980> here

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
and trying to perfect this system here

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.220 
and trying to perfect this system here
that<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.730> thicker<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.300> drywall<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.989> better

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
that the thicker the drywall the better

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.009 
that the thicker the drywall the better
and<00:01:01.559> as<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.460> see<00:01:02.730> he<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.180> not<00:01:03.210> worrying

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
and as you can see he is not worrying

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.710 
and as you can see he is not worrying
about<00:01:04.260> putting<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.920> on<00:01:05.010> neatly<00:01:05.420> except<00:01:06.420> right

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
about putting it on neatly except right

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.990 
about putting it on neatly except right
near<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.350> walls<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:08.280> need<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.549> try<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.760> keep

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
near the walls you need to try to keep

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.520 
near the walls you need to try to keep
that<00:01:09.150> off<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.689> walls<00:01:09.900> as<00:01:10.140> much<00:01:10.320> as

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
that off of the walls as much as

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.859 
that off of the walls as much as
possible<00:01:10.770> because<00:01:11.670> at<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.390> point<00:01:12.720> you

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
possible because at this point you

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.719 
possible because at this point you
should<00:01:12.900> have<00:01:13.170> probably<00:01:13.770> already<00:01:14.100> sanded

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
should have probably already sanded

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.450 
should have probably already sanded
those<00:01:15.119> down<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.750> gotten<00:01:16.500> them<00:01:16.830> ready<00:01:17.189> for

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
those down and gotten them ready for

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.380 
those down and gotten them ready for
your<00:01:18.180> painting<00:01:18.840> um<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:20.130> consistency<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
your painting um the consistency of the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.749 
your painting um the consistency of the
mud<00:01:21.600> needs<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.350> pretty<00:01:22.680> thin<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.580> will

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
mud needs to be pretty thin you will

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.609 
mud needs to be pretty thin you will
probably<00:01:24.000> notice<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.720> as<00:01:24.900> he<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.110> trying<00:01:25.409> to

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
probably notice that as he is trying to

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.530 
probably notice that as he is trying to
apply<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.189> he<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.880> having<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.299> hard<00:01:27.479> time

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
apply that he is having a hard time

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.890 
apply that he is having a hard time
keeping<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:29.040> knife<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.640> we<00:01:30.479> actually

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
keeping it on the knife and we actually

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.840 
keeping it on the knife and we actually
probably<00:01:31.350> have<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.950> even<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.220> little<00:01:32.250> thicker

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
probably have it even a little thicker

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.080 
probably have it even a little thicker
than<00:01:33.150> we<00:01:33.720> probably<00:01:34.259> should<00:01:35.009> but<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:35.790> very

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
than we probably should but it's very

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.880 
than we probably should but it's very
difficult<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.840> work<00:01:36.960> with<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.409> thinner<00:01:37.650> that

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
difficult to work with the thinner that

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.280 
difficult to work with the thinner that
you<00:01:38.130> get<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:39.119> consistency<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.020> really

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
you get it the consistency is really

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.109 
you get it the consistency is really
just<00:01:40.500> going<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:40.829> up<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.400> what<00:01:41.880> look

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
just going to be up to you and what look

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.039 
just going to be up to you and what look
you<00:01:42.630> are<00:01:42.899> going<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:44.369> step<00:01:44.670> one<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.210> just<00:01:45.720> to

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
you are going for so step one is just to

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.670 
you are going for so step one is just to
get<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.920> mud<00:01:47.340> up<00:01:47.579> onto<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.540> ceiling<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.049> then

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
get the mud up onto the ceiling and then

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.100 
get the mud up onto the ceiling and then
we<00:01:49.890> will<00:01:50.100> show<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.369> what<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.030> do<00:01:51.390> next<00:01:51.630> for

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
we will show you what to do next for

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.219 
we will show you what to do next for
step<00:01:53.009> number<00:01:53.040> two<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.939> only<00:01:54.149> kind<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.750> fancy

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.200 
step number two the only kind of fancy
equipment<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.100> need<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:56.880> simply

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
now as you can see we are working on

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.900 
now as you can see we are working on
sections<00:03:18.959> that<00:03:19.170> are<00:03:19.380> probably<00:03:20.010> about<00:03:20.550> four

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
sections that are probably about four

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.280 
sections that are probably about four
feet<00:03:21.150> by<00:03:21.600> four<00:03:22.080> feet<00:03:22.400> there<00:03:23.400> abouts<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.420> we

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
feet by four feet there abouts and we

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.350 
feet by four feet there abouts and we
are<00:03:25.440> only<00:03:25.620> letting<00:03:25.950> this<00:03:26.280> set<00:03:26.640> for<00:03:26.850> just<00:03:27.120> about

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
are only letting this set for just about

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.870 
are only letting this set for just about
two<00:03:27.810> minutes<00:03:28.110> before<00:03:28.500> we<00:03:28.830> go<00:03:29.010> in<00:03:29.280> with<00:03:29.550> step

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
two minutes before we go in with step

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.449 
two minutes before we go in with step
three<00:03:30.239> as<00:03:30.480> you<00:03:30.540> can<00:03:31.500> see<00:03:31.770> there<00:03:32.040> are<00:03:32.220> some

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
three as you can see there are some

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.840 
three as you can see there are some
pretty<00:03:32.760> sharp<00:03:33.239> Peaks<00:03:33.690> now<00:03:34.050> where<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:34.920> put<00:03:35.640> the

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
pretty sharp Peaks now where I put the

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.390 
pretty sharp Peaks now where I put the
plastic<00:03:36.390> in<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:37.110> mud<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.650> then<00:03:37.890> pulled<00:03:38.250> it

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
plastic in the mud and then pulled it

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.880 
plastic in the mud and then pulled it
away<00:03:38.580> and<00:03:38.940> that<00:03:39.000> does<00:03:39.330> create<00:03:39.570> some<00:03:39.989> peace<00:03:40.200> now

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
away and that does create some peace now

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.460 
away and that does create some peace now
step<00:03:41.400> three<00:03:41.730> is<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.330> take<00:03:42.630> your<00:03:42.810> spackling

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
step three is to take your spackling

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.060 
step three is to take your spackling
knife<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:44.070> you<00:03:44.850> just<00:03:45.150> want<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.630> gently<00:03:46.070> knock

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
knife and you just want to gently knock

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.900 
knife and you just want to gently knock
down<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:48.720> tip<00:03:49.050> of<00:03:49.320> those<00:03:49.680> points<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.550> is<00:03:50.700> why

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
down the tip of those points that is why

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.080 
down the tip of those points that is why
is<00:03:50.970> called<00:03:51.209> a<00:03:51.720> knockdown<00:03:52.020> as<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:53.310> can<00:03:53.520> see<00:03:53.790> he

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
is called a knockdown as you can see he

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.690 
is called a knockdown as you can see he
is<00:03:54.209> not<00:03:54.239> putting<00:03:54.840> much<00:03:55.170> pressure<00:03:55.739> at<00:03:56.130> all<00:03:56.400> on

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
is not putting much pressure at all on

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.660 
is not putting much pressure at all on
that

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
that

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.870 
that
and<00:03:57.880> he<00:03:58.690> is<00:03:58.810> just<00:03:59.080> barely<00:03:59.550> dragging<00:04:00.550> it<00:04:00.670> across

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
and he is just barely dragging it across

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.440 
and he is just barely dragging it across
the<00:04:01.540> tip<00:04:01.840> of<00:04:02.110> those<00:04:02.680> Peaks<00:04:03.100> and<00:04:03.310> see<00:04:03.880> how<00:04:04.090> much

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
the tip of those Peaks and see how much

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.940 
the tip of those Peaks and see how much
is<00:04:04.660> an<00:04:04.750> angle<00:04:05.140> do<00:04:05.260> you<00:04:05.380> think<00:04:05.620> that<00:04:05.800> you're

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
is an angle do you think that you're

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.750 
is an angle do you think that you're
holding<00:04:06.130> that<00:04:06.310> s<00:04:07.800> maybe<00:04:08.800> about<00:04:09.069> a<00:04:09.130> five<00:04:09.459> degree

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
holding that s maybe about a five degree

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.330 
holding that s maybe about a five degree
angle<00:04:10.450> that<00:04:10.660> way<00:04:11.020> it<00:04:11.170> keeps<00:04:11.410> the<00:04:11.680> pressure<00:04:11.950> too

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
angle that way it keeps the pressure too

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.880 
angle that way it keeps the pressure too
much<00:04:12.550> and<00:04:12.819> you<00:04:13.600> can<00:04:13.840> see<00:04:14.080> right<00:04:14.320> there<00:04:14.350> you<00:04:14.740> can

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
much and you can see right there you can

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.849 
much and you can see right there you can
step<00:04:15.100> in<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.430> give<00:04:15.520> us<00:04:15.640> a<00:04:15.760> shadow<00:04:16.440> Steve<00:04:17.440> step

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
step in and give us a shadow Steve step

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.500 
step in and give us a shadow Steve step
in<00:04:18.010> and<00:04:18.160> give<00:04:18.250> us<00:04:18.280> a<00:04:18.489> shadow<00:04:18.790> on<00:04:19.090> this<00:04:19.209> that<00:04:19.480> you

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
in and give us a shadow on this that you

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.810 
in and give us a shadow on this that you
can<00:04:19.750> see<00:04:19.959> now<00:04:20.200> or<00:04:20.530> the<00:04:20.680> shadow<00:04:20.980> is<00:04:21.250> you<00:04:21.459> can<00:04:21.640> see

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
can see now or the shadow is you can see

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.659 
can see now or the shadow is you can see
a<00:04:21.850> little<00:04:22.030> bit<00:04:22.210> better<00:04:22.450> the<00:04:23.169> texture<00:04:23.890> that<00:04:24.460> it

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
a little bit better the texture that it

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.210 
a little bit better the texture that it
is<00:04:24.940> creating<00:04:25.690> on<00:04:25.840> that<00:04:26.230> wall<00:04:26.500> and<00:04:26.800> it<00:04:27.010> is

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
is creating on that wall and it is

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.870 
is creating on that wall and it is
driving<00:04:27.730> to<00:04:28.150> a<00:04:28.180> really<00:04:28.990> beautiful<00:04:29.650> knock<00:04:30.490> down

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
driving to a really beautiful knock down

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.970 
driving to a really beautiful knock down
so<00:04:31.270> he<00:04:31.450> is<00:04:31.570> just<00:04:31.810> going<00:04:31.930> to<00:04:31.990> continue<00:04:32.230> pulling

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
so he is just going to continue pulling

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.270 
so he is just going to continue pulling
this<00:04:33.840> section<00:04:34.840> like<00:04:35.200> I<00:04:35.380> said<00:04:35.650> it<00:04:35.830> is<00:04:35.950> about<00:04:36.100> a

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
this section like I said it is about a

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.659 
this section like I said it is about a
four<00:04:36.700> by<00:04:36.940> four<00:04:36.970> now<00:04:37.930> some<00:04:38.410> people<00:04:38.860> are<00:04:39.100> waiting

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
four by four now some people are waiting

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.850 
four by four now some people are waiting
and<00:04:40.090> letting<00:04:40.360> their<00:04:40.570> mud<00:04:40.810> set<00:04:41.140> for<00:04:41.380> about<00:04:41.560> 10

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
and letting their mud set for about 10

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.040 
and letting their mud set for about 10
to<00:04:42.070> 15<00:04:42.220> minutes<00:04:42.820> before<00:04:43.030> they<00:04:43.510> start<00:04:43.870> the

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
to 15 minutes before they start the

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.220 
to 15 minutes before they start the
knockdown<00:04:44.320> process<00:04:45.190> we<00:04:46.180> tried<00:04:46.540> that<00:04:46.810> we've

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
knockdown process we tried that we've

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.140 
knockdown process we tried that we've
experimented<00:04:47.680> several<00:04:48.310> different<00:04:48.669> ways<00:04:48.820> in

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
experimented several different ways in

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.080 
experimented several different ways in
this<00:04:49.480> hallway<00:04:49.780> areas<00:04:50.500> and<00:04:50.770> we<00:04:51.610> find<00:04:51.880> that

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
this hallway areas and we find that

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.820 
this hallway areas and we find that
going<00:04:52.300> ahead<00:04:52.480> and<00:04:52.720> doing<00:04:52.870> it<00:04:53.260> while<00:04:53.500> it<00:04:53.740> is

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
going ahead and doing it while it is

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.600 
going ahead and doing it while it is
more<00:04:54.430> wet<00:04:54.669> see<00:04:55.120> so<00:04:55.840> as<00:04:56.169> you<00:04:56.590> can<00:04:56.770> see<00:04:56.830> this<00:04:57.340> is

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
more wet see so as you can see this is

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.240 
more wet see so as you can see this is
what<00:04:57.850> our<00:04:58.060> knockdown<00:04:58.810> finish<00:04:59.320> is<00:04:59.560> looking

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
what our knockdown finish is looking

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.030 
what our knockdown finish is looking
like<00:05:00.430> it<00:05:00.700> is<00:05:01.150> not<00:05:01.390> completely<00:05:01.990> dry<00:05:02.320> yet<00:05:02.560> it<00:05:02.830> is

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
like it is not completely dry yet it is

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.640 
like it is not completely dry yet it is
still<00:05:03.310> dry<00:05:03.640> but<00:05:04.120> it<00:05:04.330> is<00:05:04.630> looking<00:05:05.169> really

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
still dry but it is looking really

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.460 
still dry but it is looking really
really<00:05:06.310> good<00:05:06.550> and<00:05:07.060> we<00:05:07.330> have<00:05:07.540> done<00:05:07.810> this<00:05:08.050> for
