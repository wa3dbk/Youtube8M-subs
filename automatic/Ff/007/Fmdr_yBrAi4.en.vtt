00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
nineteen ninety 90 to something like

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.440 
nineteen ninety 90 to something like
that<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.929> map<00:02:11.170> was<00:02:11.410> good<00:02:11.709> in<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:11.950> 90s<00:02:12.519> man<00:02:12.760> and

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
that the map was good in the 90s man and

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.750 
that the map was good in the 90s man and
you<00:02:14.140> know<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.319> was<00:02:14.650> back<00:02:14.860> when<00:02:15.670> the

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
you know I was back when the

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.380 
you know I was back when the
x-files<00:02:16.269> were<00:02:16.629> going<00:02:17.110> in<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:19.180> thought

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
x-files were going in and so I thought

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.949 
x-files were going in and so I thought
up<00:02:19.660> like<00:02:19.870> at<00:02:20.019> the<00:02:20.200> end<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.560> Snapseed<00:02:21.099> on<00:02:21.310> me<00:02:21.550> I

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
up like at the end and Snapseed on me I

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.530 
up like at the end and Snapseed on me I
should<00:02:22.959> probably<00:02:23.110> get<00:02:23.349> some<00:02:23.500> rest<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:25.360> I

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
should probably get some rest and I

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.059 
should probably get some rest and I
ended<00:02:25.720> up<00:02:25.840> with<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.200> thing<00:02:26.530> after<00:02:27.010> a

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
ended up with that thing after a

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.059 
ended up with that thing after a
three-day<00:02:27.340> bender<00:02:28.590> while<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.709> ups<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:29.980> downs

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
three-day bender while the ups and downs

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.490 
three-day bender while the ups and downs
that<00:02:30.370> he's<00:02:30.519> had<00:02:30.670> in<00:02:30.790> his<00:02:30.819> life<00:02:30.910> man<00:02:31.500> he's

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
that he's had in his life man he's

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.110 
that he's had in his life man he's
pulled<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.129> this<00:02:33.250> point<00:02:33.340> where<00:02:33.819> I<00:02:33.849> think

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
pulled it to this point where I think

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.550 
pulled it to this point where I think
he's<00:02:34.269> getting<00:02:34.480> better<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.019> he's<00:02:35.110> rather<00:02:35.319> than

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
he's getting better and he's rather than
