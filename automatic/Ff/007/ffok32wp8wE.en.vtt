00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
so I can get to sprite clutch which is

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:37.549 
so I can get to sprite clutch which is
this<00:00:24.779> kind<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:28.189> something<00:00:29.189> down<00:00:29.460> there<00:00:36.440> to<00:00:37.440> get

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
this kind of something down there to get

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.819 
this kind of something down there to get
to<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.860> engine<00:00:38.129> needs<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.550> come<00:00:38.700> off<00:00:39.710> and<00:00:40.710> to

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
to that engine needs to come off and to

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.770 
to that engine needs to come off and to
get<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.070> engine<00:00:41.340> off<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.670> need<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.090> get<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
get the engine off I need to get the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.130 
get the engine off I need to get the
exhaust<00:00:43.230> off<00:00:43.680> because<00:00:44.010> it's<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.370> bolt<00:00:45.300> down

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
exhaust off because it's a bolt down

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.760 
exhaust off because it's a bolt down
there<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.739> need<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.289> so<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.350> get<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
there I need to get to so to get the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.110 
there I need to get to so to get the
exhaust<00:00:50.010> off<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:51.469> need<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.590> get<00:00:52.770> these<00:00:53.120> header

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
exhaust off I need to get these header

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.340 
exhaust off I need to get these header
pipes<00:00:54.420> out<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> engine<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:57.020> pipe<00:00:58.020> right

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
pipes out of the engine so pipe right

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.689 
pipes out of the engine so pipe right
there<00:01:00.469> this<00:01:01.469> pipe<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.070> goes<00:01:02.219> into<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
there this pipe that goes into the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.550 
there this pipe that goes into the
silver<00:01:03.059> portion<00:01:03.480> he's<00:01:04.470> like<00:01:04.619> well<00:01:05.369> bit<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.790> I

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
silver portion he's like well bit in I

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.960 
silver portion he's like well bit in I
guess<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.650> must<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:07.830> carbon<00:01:08.460> buildup<00:01:08.790> or

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
guess it must be carbon buildup or

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:09.429 
guess it must be carbon buildup or
something

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
something

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.719 
something
so<00:01:10.790> because<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.180> engine<00:01:12.710> comes<00:01:13.710> out<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.159> far<00:01:14.430> I

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
so because the engine comes out so far I

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.260 
so because the engine comes out so far I
can't<00:01:15.119> get<00:01:15.299> any<00:01:15.740> anything<00:01:16.740> any<00:01:17.460> down<00:01:17.970> would

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
can't get any anything any down would

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.359 
can't get any anything any down would
purchase<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.930> them<00:01:19.049> properly<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:22.250> I've<00:01:23.250> been

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
purchase on them properly so I've been

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.109 
purchase on them properly so I've been
trying<00:01:23.640> with<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.869> huge<00:01:25.140> stick<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.590> wood<00:01:26.119> and

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
trying with this huge stick of wood and

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.910 
trying with this huge stick of wood and
trying<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.450> come<00:01:27.600> down<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.470> with

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
trying to come down on it like this with

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.980 
trying to come down on it like this with
the<00:01:29.040> hammer<00:01:29.450> but<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.570> not<00:01:30.689> really<00:01:30.869> doing

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
the hammer but it's not really doing

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.289 
the hammer but it's not really doing
much<00:01:32.180> tried<00:01:33.180> coming<00:01:33.990> across<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.920> way<00:01:35.299> that

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
much tried coming across this way that

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.640 
much tried coming across this way that
doesn't<00:01:36.570> seem<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.930> be<00:01:36.990> doing<00:01:37.229> much

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
doesn't seem to be doing much

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.219 
doesn't seem to be doing much
I<00:01:38.450> even<00:01:39.450> tried<00:01:41.030> wedging<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.119> wood<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:43.049> I'm

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
I even tried wedging the wood in and I'm

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.590 
I even tried wedging the wood in and I'm
sticking<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:44.670> top<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.000> brick<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.509> then

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
sticking it on top of a brick and then

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.319 
sticking it on top of a brick and then
bringing<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.990> hammer<00:01:46.170> down<00:01:46.490> here<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.640> bring

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
bringing the hammer down here to bring

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.840 
bringing the hammer down here to bring
the<00:01:48.540> downforce<00:01:49.220> but<00:01:50.220> that's<00:01:50.369> not<00:01:50.520> doing<00:01:50.729> much

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the downforce but that's not doing much

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.639 
the downforce but that's not doing much
either<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:52.670> I<00:01:53.960> thought<00:01:54.960> about<00:01:55.079> taking<00:01:55.560> the

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
either and I thought about taking the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.039 
either and I thought about taking the
muffler<00:01:56.040> off<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:57.060> then<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.240> could<00:01:57.450> twist<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
muffler off and then I could twist the

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.709 
muffler off and then I could twist the
pipes<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.920> try<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.189> break<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.399> seal<00:01:59.579> but<00:01:59.909> you

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
pipes to try and break the seal but you

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.740 
pipes to try and break the seal but you
know<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.710> muffler<00:02:02.040> either

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
know the muffler either

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.480 
know the muffler either
so<00:02:04.260> advice<00:02:04.940> is<00:02:05.940> very<00:02:06.060> much<00:02:06.480> appreciated

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
so advice is very much appreciated

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.330 
so advice is very much appreciated
also<00:02:08.600> if<00:02:09.600> you<00:02:09.750> see<00:02:09.860> mediators<00:02:10.860> got<00:02:11.040> pretty

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
also if you see mediators got pretty

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.400 
also if you see mediators got pretty
badly<00:02:11.520> Kinnison<00:02:12.060> where<00:02:12.210> all<00:02:13.050> those<00:02:13.230> little

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
badly Kinnison where all those little

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.450 
badly Kinnison where all those little
white<00:02:13.530> especially<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.130> bits<00:02:14.310> are<00:02:15.260> crystals<00:02:16.260> of

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
white especially a bits are crystals of

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:22.010 
white especially a bits are crystals of
coolant<00:02:19.010> anyway
