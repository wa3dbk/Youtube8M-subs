Lemoine anymore added significance

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.299 
Lemoine anymore added significance
because<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.809> happened<00:00:40.079> there<00:00:40.200> um<00:00:40.410> well<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.100> mean

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
because it happened there um well I mean

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.280 
because it happened there um well I mean
that's<00:00:41.460> also<00:00:41.820> my<00:00:42.180> hometown<00:00:42.540> right<00:00:43.020> outside<00:00:43.230> of

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
that's also my hometown right outside of

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.110 
that's also my hometown right outside of
Syracuse<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:43.980> all<00:00:44.250> my<00:00:44.430> family<00:00:44.789> members<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
Syracuse so all my family members and

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.970 
Syracuse so all my family members and
friends<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:46.140> were<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.260> town<00:00:46.440> were<00:00:46.590> there<00:00:46.739> so

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
friends that were in town were there so

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.950 
friends that were in town were there so
I<00:00:47.250> guess<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.030> does<00:00:48.180> make<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.629> little<00:00:48.840> more

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
I guess that does make it a little more

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.049 
I guess that does make it a little more
