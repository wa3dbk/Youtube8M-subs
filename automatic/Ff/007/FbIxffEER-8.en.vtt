00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
now the beets they seem to be going a

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.080 
now the beets they seem to be going a
bit<00:00:42.180> slow<00:00:42.650> the<00:00:43.650> radishes<00:00:44.190> took<00:00:44.640> off<00:00:44.820> like

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
bit slow the radishes took off like

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.070 
bit slow the radishes took off like
crazy<00:00:45.650> and<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:47.820> spinach<00:00:48.210> took<00:00:48.570> off<00:00:48.750> really

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
crazy and the spinach took off really

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.080 
crazy and the spinach took off really
good<00:00:49.110> too<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.070> started<00:00:50.400> bolting<00:00:50.610> right

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
good too but it started bolting right

good too but it started bolting right
away<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.559> think<00:00:52.830> it's<00:00:53.010> just<00:00:53.250> because<00:00:53.489> I

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
away and I think it's just because I

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.910 
away and I think it's just because I
planted<00:00:54.330> it<00:00:54.449> too<00:00:54.660> late<00:00:54.900> in<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.050> season<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.770> it

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920

the prize of my garden my stinging

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.449 
the prize of my garden my stinging
nettle<00:03:21.820> now<00:03:22.810> I<00:03:22.840> harvested<00:03:23.560> these<00:03:23.739> seeds<00:03:24.130> from

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
nettle now I harvested these seeds from

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.020 
nettle now I harvested these seeds from
the<00:03:24.640> wild<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:26.310> sold<00:03:27.310> them<00:03:27.430> this<00:03:27.610> spring

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
the wild and sold them this spring

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.400 
the wild and sold them this spring
outside<00:03:29.610> I<00:03:30.610> suppose<00:03:31.420> you<00:03:31.660> could<00:03:31.810> say<00:03:32.050> they<00:03:32.260> had

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
outside I suppose you could say they had

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.699 
outside I suppose you could say they had
a<00:03:32.440> slight<00:03:32.920> amount<00:03:33.280> of<00:03:33.519> cold<00:03:33.850> stratification

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
a slight amount of cold stratification

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.320 
a slight amount of cold stratification
but<00:03:35.709> it<00:03:35.860> didn't<00:03:36.160> get<00:03:36.250> below<00:03:36.519> freezing<00:03:36.850> and

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
but it didn't get below freezing and

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.600 
but it didn't get below freezing and
I've<00:03:38.140> read<00:03:38.560> that<00:03:38.830> you<00:03:38.920> have<00:03:39.130> to<00:03:39.280> cold<00:03:39.550> stratify

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
I've read that you have to cold stratify

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.980 
I've read that you have to cold stratify
stinging<00:03:42.610> nettle<00:03:42.910> seeds<00:03:43.180> to<00:03:43.540> get<00:03:43.690> them<00:03:43.840> to

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
stinging nettle seeds to get them to

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.500 
stinging nettle seeds to get them to
sprout<00:03:44.290> but<00:03:44.820> obviously<00:03:45.820> they<00:03:46.000> don't<00:03:46.150> require

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
sprout but obviously they don't require

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.780 
sprout but obviously they don't require
much<00:03:46.810> cold<00:03:47.230> stratification<00:03:47.710> if<00:03:48.190> any<00:03:48.370> because

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
much cold stratification if any because

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.930 
much cold stratification if any because
that's<00:03:49.030> really<00:03:49.450> doing<00:03:49.630> well<00:03:50.790> extremely<00:03:51.790> well

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
that's really doing well extremely well

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.350 
that's really doing well extremely well
I<00:03:52.270> had<00:03:53.110> that<00:03:53.320> in<00:03:53.380> a<00:03:53.440> smaller<00:03:53.740> pot<00:03:54.360> transferred

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
I had that in a smaller pot transferred

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.270 
I had that in a smaller pot transferred
it<00:03:55.450> to<00:03:55.480> a<00:03:55.600> bigger<00:03:55.870> one<00:03:58.470> now<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.560> deal<00:03:59.890> that<00:04:00.190> I

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
it to a bigger one now the deal that I

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.080 
it to a bigger one now the deal that I
had<00:04:00.490> in<00:04:00.610> a<00:04:00.670> smaller<00:04:00.940> power<00:04:01.240> pot<00:04:02.460> it's<00:04:03.460> just<00:04:03.790> off

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
had in a smaller power pot it's just off

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.070 
had in a smaller power pot it's just off
the<00:04:04.150> hook<00:04:05.280> there's<00:04:06.280> five<00:04:06.970> or<00:04:07.150> six<00:04:07.180> plants<00:04:07.750> in

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
the hook there's five or six plants in

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.660 
the hook there's five or six plants in
here<00:04:08.500> and<00:04:10.650> it's<00:04:11.650> hard<00:04:11.860> for<00:04:11.920> me<00:04:12.070> to<00:04:12.250> bring<00:04:12.550> the

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
here and it's hard for me to bring the

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.340 
here and it's hard for me to bring the
camera<00:04:13.240> back<00:04:13.270> far<00:04:13.720> enough<00:04:13.750> for<00:04:14.140> you<00:04:14.230> to

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
camera back far enough for you to

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.300 
camera back far enough for you to
actually<00:04:14.470> see<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:15.010> whole<00:04:15.160> thing<00:04:15.190> but<00:04:15.900> it's

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
actually see the whole thing but it's

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.630 
actually see the whole thing but it's
one<00:04:18.310> of<00:04:18.340> my<00:04:18.489> best<00:04:19.680> container<00:04:20.680> plants<00:04:21.160> so<00:04:21.340> far

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
one of my best container plants so far

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.560 
one of my best container plants so far
and<00:04:22.110> again<00:04:23.110> I<00:04:23.140> put<00:04:23.440> it<00:04:23.560> in<00:04:23.680> a<00:04:23.770> big<00:04:23.980> pot<00:04:24.570> because

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
and again I put it in a big pot because

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.250 
and again I put it in a big pot because
I'm<00:04:25.780> hoping<00:04:26.110> that<00:04:26.290> it<00:04:26.440> will<00:04:26.590> self<00:04:27.040> seed<00:04:28.110> and<00:04:29.110> if

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
I'm hoping that it will self seed and if

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.740 
I'm hoping that it will self seed and if
it<00:04:29.380> doesn't<00:04:29.830> I<00:04:29.980> can<00:04:30.160> always<00:04:30.340> just<00:04:30.610> save<00:04:30.880> seeds

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.530 

now<00:04:34.750> this<00:04:35.170> container<00:04:36.000> again<00:04:37.000> I<00:04:37.030> had<00:04:37.330> some

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
now this container again I had some

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:44.060 
now this container again I had some
leftover<00:04:37.960> herbs<00:04:38.880> this<00:04:39.880> is<00:04:41.070> oregano<00:04:42.390> and

broadleaf sage hey we're just leftover

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.920 
broadleaf sage hey we're just leftover
herbs<00:04:48.370> so<00:04:48.640> I<00:04:48.670> took<00:04:48.970> two<00:04:49.180> of<00:04:49.300> each<00:04:49.450> and<00:04:49.720> stuck

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
herbs so I took two of each and stuck

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.750 
herbs so I took two of each and stuck
them<00:04:50.080> in<00:04:50.170> this<00:04:50.260> big<00:04:50.530> pot<00:04:53.160> and<00:04:54.160> we're<00:04:54.640> getting

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
them in this big pot and we're getting

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.659 
them in this big pot and we're getting
pretty<00:04:55.030> close<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.450> the<00:04:55.690> end<00:04:55.990> I<00:04:56.470> want<00:04:57.460> to<00:04:57.490> give

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
pretty close to the end I want to give

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.470 
pretty close to the end I want to give
you<00:04:57.760> an<00:04:57.850> update<00:04:58.000> on<00:04:58.240> the<00:04:58.860> lettuce<00:05:00.270> this<00:05:01.270> was

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
you an update on the lettuce this was

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.700 
you an update on the lettuce this was
that<00:05:01.690> lettuce<00:05:02.110> blend<00:05:02.560> that<00:05:03.010> I<00:05:03.070> grew<00:05:04.500> it<00:05:05.500> looks

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
that lettuce blend that I grew it looks

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.980 
that lettuce blend that I grew it looks
real<00:05:05.919> nice<00:05:06.100> and<00:05:06.340> healthy<00:05:06.700> but<00:05:07.630> it's<00:05:07.810> not

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
real nice and healthy but it's not

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.570 
real nice and healthy but it's not
getting<00:05:08.200> very<00:05:08.500> big<00:05:08.800> and<00:05:09.100> it's<00:05:09.220> probably

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
getting very big and it's probably

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.880 
getting very big and it's probably
because<00:05:09.910> I<00:05:10.000> didn't<00:05:10.330> thin<00:05:10.540> it<00:05:10.660> out<00:05:10.890> I've

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
because I didn't thin it out I've

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.210 
because I didn't thin it out I've
already<00:05:12.190> harvested<00:05:12.850> most<00:05:13.120> of<00:05:13.390> the<00:05:13.480> radishes

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
already harvested most of the radishes

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.580 
already harvested most of the radishes
that<00:05:15.220> were<00:05:15.370> in<00:05:15.490> here<00:05:15.820> they<00:05:16.240> they<00:05:17.080> didn't<00:05:17.440> get<00:05:17.530> a

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
that were in here they they didn't get a

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.710 
that were in here they they didn't get a
lot<00:05:17.830> of<00:05:17.860> leaf<00:05:18.160> on<00:05:18.430> them<00:05:18.669> but<00:05:18.910> the<00:05:19.210> actual

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
lot of leaf on them but the actual

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.230 
lot of leaf on them but the actual
radish<00:05:20.169> itself<00:05:20.650> was<00:05:20.890> pretty<00:05:21.130> good-sized<00:05:21.730> and

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
radish itself was pretty good-sized and

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.920 
radish itself was pretty good-sized and
had<00:05:23.020> a<00:05:23.050> really<00:05:23.350> good<00:05:23.650> mild<00:05:24.010> flavor<00:05:24.630> here's<00:05:25.630> one

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
had a really good mild flavor here's one

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.260 
had a really good mild flavor here's one
I<00:05:25.960> can<00:05:26.520> pop<00:05:27.520> out<00:05:27.760> of<00:05:27.790> there

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
I can pop out of there

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.230 
I can pop out of there
so<00:05:29.140> not<00:05:29.680> huge<00:05:30.070> compared<00:05:30.580> to<00:05:30.640> the<00:05:30.700> other<00:05:30.970> ones

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
so not huge compared to the other ones

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.520 
so not huge compared to the other ones
but<00:05:31.950> again<00:05:32.950> I<00:05:32.980> think<00:05:33.190> it's<00:05:33.430> just<00:05:33.669> been

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
but again I think it's just been

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.040 
but again I think it's just been
probably<00:05:35.530> just<00:05:35.890> over<00:05:36.250> 30<00:05:36.580> days<00:05:36.910> maybe<00:05:37.360> 40<00:05:37.870> days

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
probably just over 30 days maybe 40 days

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.920 
probably just over 30 days maybe 40 days
on<00:05:38.320> these<00:05:38.530> radishes

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
on these radishes

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.370 
on these radishes
those<00:05:40.930> are<00:05:41.110> icicle<00:05:41.710> radish<00:05:42.720> good<00:05:43.720> companion

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
those are icicle radish good companion

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.450 
those are icicle radish good companion
plant<00:05:44.620> for<00:05:44.830> squash<00:05:45.130> if<00:05:45.610> you're<00:05:45.790> curious

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.040 

but<00:05:49.460> I<00:05:49.490> wanted<00:05:49.910> to<00:05:50.060> do<00:05:50.180> an<00:05:50.300> experiment<00:05:50.870> with

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
but I wanted to do an experiment with

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.700 
but I wanted to do an experiment with
this<00:05:51.200> lettuce<00:05:51.530> and<00:05:51.860> it<00:05:52.040> it<00:05:52.700> is<00:05:53.030> definitely

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
this lettuce and it it is definitely

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.980 
this lettuce and it it is definitely
staying<00:05:54.710> kind<00:05:55.130> of<00:05:55.250> small

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
staying kind of small

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.130 
staying kind of small
this<00:05:56.990> red<00:05:57.290> variety<00:05:57.890> is<00:05:58.010> kind<00:05:58.340> of<00:05:58.900> growing<00:05:59.900> up

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140 
this red variety is kind of growing up

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:07.540 
this red variety is kind of growing up
so<00:06:01.040> I<00:06:01.070> would<00:06:01.340> assume<00:06:01.610> it's<00:06:01.850> the<00:06:02.000> strongest<00:06:06.550> so

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
so I would assume it's the strongest so

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.200 
so I would assume it's the strongest so
that's<00:06:07.730> it<00:06:07.970> for<00:06:08.150> the<00:06:08.240> container<00:06:08.630> gardens<00:06:09.110> oh

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
that's it for the container gardens oh

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.390 
that's it for the container gardens oh
except<00:06:11.210> for<00:06:11.240> this<00:06:11.510> one<00:06:11.570> right<00:06:11.870> here<00:06:12.260> which<00:06:13.040> is

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
except for this one right here which is

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.440 
except for this one right here which is
again<00:06:13.910> I<00:06:13.940> just<00:06:14.360> had<00:06:14.510> Oh<00:06:14.980> an<00:06:15.980> old<00:06:16.160> the<00:06:16.580> container

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.450 
again I just had Oh an old the container

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.480 
again I just had Oh an old the container
that<00:06:17.780> was<00:06:17.960> starting<00:06:18.470> to<00:06:18.530> get<00:06:18.980> brittle<00:06:19.400> and

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
that was starting to get brittle and

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.210 
that was starting to get brittle and
break<00:06:19.810> so<00:06:20.810> I<00:06:20.840> just<00:06:21.170> converted<00:06:21.710> it<00:06:21.830> into<00:06:21.950> a

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
break so I just converted it into a

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.510 
break so I just converted it into a
container<00:06:22.760> garden<00:06:23.530> for<00:06:24.530> this<00:06:24.680> one<00:06:24.920> I<00:06:25.130> didn't

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
container garden for this one I didn't

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.030 
container garden for this one I didn't
even<00:06:25.700> drill<00:06:25.940> holes<00:06:26.210> or<00:06:26.630> anything<00:06:26.870> one<00:06:27.740> thing<00:06:27.950> I

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
even drill holes or anything one thing I

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.830 
even drill holes or anything one thing I
did<00:06:28.250> do<00:06:28.430> with<00:06:28.610> this<00:06:28.760> one<00:06:29.000> is<00:06:29.030> I<00:06:29.330> kind<00:06:29.600> of<00:06:29.660> made

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
did do with this one is I kind of made

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.900 
did do with this one is I kind of made
it<00:06:29.960> into<00:06:30.730> a<00:06:31.730> Hebrew<00:06:32.420> culture<00:06:32.840> but<00:06:33.040> because<00:06:34.040> I

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:34.910 
it into a Hebrew culture but because I

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.950 
it into a Hebrew culture but because I
had<00:06:35.420> some<00:06:35.630> old<00:06:35.810> punky<00:06:36.350> firewood<00:06:37.540> that<00:06:38.540> was<00:06:38.810> on

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
had some old punky firewood that was on

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.520 
had some old punky firewood that was on
the<00:06:39.110> bottom<00:06:39.470> of<00:06:39.590> my<00:06:39.800> woodpile<00:06:40.370> and<00:06:40.970> I<00:06:41.690> layered

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
the bottom of my woodpile and I layered

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.950 
the bottom of my woodpile and I layered
it<00:06:42.770> in<00:06:42.920> the<00:06:43.070> bottom<00:06:43.490> instead<00:06:44.240> of<00:06:44.390> gravel

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 
it in the bottom instead of gravel

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.660 
it in the bottom instead of gravel
because<00:06:45.200> I<00:06:45.320> didn't<00:06:45.590> have<00:06:45.710> any<00:06:45.920> gravel<00:06:46.370> and

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:46.670 
because I didn't have any gravel and

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.370 
because I didn't have any gravel and
then<00:06:47.510> I<00:06:48.200> had<00:06:48.830> some<00:06:49.160> old<00:06:49.490> bark<00:06:50.030> and<00:06:50.390> small<00:06:50.900> bits

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.380 
then I had some old bark and small bits

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.040 
then I had some old bark and small bits
of<00:06:51.700> tree<00:06:52.700> matter<00:06:52.940> that<00:06:53.210> I<00:06:53.360> crumbled<00:06:53.780> up<00:06:53.840> real

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050 
of tree matter that I crumbled up real

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.680 
of tree matter that I crumbled up real
small<00:06:54.290> and<00:06:54.560> piled<00:06:54.770> on<00:06:54.980> top<00:06:55.220> of<00:06:55.280> that<00:06:55.610> and<00:06:56.240> then

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.690 
small and piled on top of that and then

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.720 
small and piled on top of that and then
I<00:06:56.720> just<00:06:56.840> filled<00:06:57.290> it<00:06:57.410> with<00:06:57.440> garden<00:06:57.920> dirt<00:06:58.130> and

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:58.730 
I just filled it with garden dirt and

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.210 
I just filled it with garden dirt and
I'm<00:06:59.240> hoping<00:06:59.570> that<00:06:59.630> that<00:06:59.930> wood<00:07:00.680> will<00:07:00.980> help

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:01.220 
I'm hoping that that wood will help

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.250 
I'm hoping that that wood will help
retain<00:07:01.580> moisture<00:07:01.850> when<00:07:02.390> it<00:07:02.480> gets<00:07:02.630> dry<00:07:02.870> in<00:07:03.170> the

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:03.260 
retain moisture when it gets dry in the

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.920 
retain moisture when it gets dry in the
summer<00:07:03.530> and<00:07:04.280> I<00:07:04.850> went<00:07:05.030> ahead<00:07:05.120> and<00:07:05.240> planted<00:07:05.720> this

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:05.930 
summer and I went ahead and planted this

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.100 
summer and I went ahead and planted this
with<00:07:06.200> the<00:07:06.470> market<00:07:07.040> more<00:07:07.810> slicing<00:07:08.810> cucumbers

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.110 
with the market more slicing cucumbers

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.270 
with the market more slicing cucumbers
and<00:07:09.800> as<00:07:10.550> they<00:07:10.760> grow<00:07:11.060> I'll<00:07:11.810> just<00:07:12.080> I'll<00:07:12.980> probably

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 
and as they grow I'll just I'll probably

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.790 
and as they grow I'll just I'll probably
end<00:07:13.490> up<00:07:13.640> trellising<00:07:14.300> them<00:07:14.480> along<00:07:15.290> this<00:07:15.500> pea

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 
end up trellising them along this pea

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.850 
end up trellising them along this pea
trellis<00:07:16.280> here<00:07:16.840> or<00:07:17.840> I<00:07:17.870> may<00:07:18.170> just<00:07:18.200> let<00:07:18.530> them<00:07:18.680> grow

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860 
trellis here or I may just let them grow
