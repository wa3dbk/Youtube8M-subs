00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
correct part numbers to give this blade

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.850 
correct part numbers to give this blade
today<00:01:55.690> and<00:01:56.690> it's<00:01:56.840> got<00:01:56.990> a<00:01:57.020> side<00:01:57.259> shoot<00:01:57.650> they've

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
today and it's got a side shoot they've

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.540 
today and it's got a side shoot they've
only<00:01:58.040> use<00:01:58.280> this<00:01:58.430> for<00:01:58.640> mulch<00:01:58.820> so<00:01:59.150> the<00:01:59.900> bag<00:02:00.550> and

only use this for mulch so the bag and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.529 
only use this for mulch so the bag and
the<00:02:01.759> side<00:02:01.970> shoots<00:02:02.180> never<00:02:02.479> been<00:02:02.660> used<00:02:04.420> so<00:02:05.420> I'm

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
the side shoots never been used so I'm

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.960 
the side shoots never been used so I'm
hoping<00:02:05.810> this<00:02:05.960> blade<00:02:06.200> will<00:02:06.410> fit<00:02:06.729> this<00:02:07.729> lawn

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970

if<00:02:17.090> we<00:02:17.180> can<00:02:17.330> mount<00:02:17.480> this<00:02:17.660> up<00:02:18.220> but<00:02:19.220> first<00:02:19.370> I'll

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
if we can mount this up but first I'll

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.400 
if we can mount this up but first I'll
show<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.820> how<00:02:19.910> bad<00:02:20.209> it's<00:02:20.420> hitting<00:02:21.260> under

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
show you how bad it's hitting under

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.560 
show you how bad it's hitting under
there<00:02:21.680> I'm<00:02:22.459> gonna<00:02:22.550> pull<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.880> spark<00:02:23.150> plug<00:02:23.390> off

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
there I'm gonna pull the spark plug off

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.820 
there I'm gonna pull the spark plug off
because<00:02:23.690> I<00:02:23.840> do<00:02:23.900> not<00:02:24.140> want<00:02:24.380> this<00:02:24.470> thing<00:02:24.650> to

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
because I do not want this thing to

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:32.580 
because I do not want this thing to
start<00:02:25.100> at<00:02:25.310> all<00:02:30.010> but<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.310> has<00:02:31.550> really<00:02:32.090> got<00:02:32.330> a

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
start at all but it has really got a

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:40.000 
start at all but it has really got a
colorful<00:02:33.590> noise<00:02:38.320> now<00:02:39.320> they<00:02:39.470> said<00:02:39.680> they'd<00:02:39.769> use

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
colorful noise now they said they'd use

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.500 
colorful noise now they said they'd use
this<00:02:40.190> I<00:02:40.340> just<00:02:40.580> cannot<00:02:40.790> hardly<00:02:41.209> believe<00:02:41.480> that

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
this I just cannot hardly believe that

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.900 
this I just cannot hardly believe that
so<00:02:42.080> with<00:02:42.530> that<00:02:42.680> noise<00:02:42.860> like<00:02:43.220> that<00:02:43.400> can't

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
so with that noise like that can't

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.090 
so with that noise like that can't
hardly<00:02:44.120> turn<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:44.540> well<00:02:45.530> it's<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.709> high<00:02:45.860> wheel

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
hardly turn it well it's a high wheel

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.509 
hardly turn it well it's a high wheel
rear<00:02:46.880> wheel<00:02:47.090> very<00:02:48.049> nice<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.500> not<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.310> very

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
cheap lawnmower let's get this blade

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.759 
cheap lawnmower let's get this blade
swapped<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.510> try<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:53.570> give<00:02:53.750> this<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:53.959> start<00:02:56.769> so

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
swapped and try to give this a start so

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.530 
swapped and try to give this a start so
the<00:02:57.860> blade<00:02:58.040> came<00:02:58.250> off<00:02:58.430> easy<00:02:58.790> thank<00:02:59.090> goodness

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
the blade came off easy thank goodness

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.680 
the blade came off easy thank goodness
but<00:03:00.079> look<00:03:00.230> how<00:03:00.380> badly<00:03:00.650> this<00:03:00.980> is<00:03:01.190> bent<00:03:01.690> my

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
but look how badly this is bent my

but look how badly this is bent my
goodness<00:03:03.579> he<00:03:04.579> said<00:03:04.790> he<00:03:04.910> had<00:03:05.150> hit<00:03:05.390> a<00:03:05.570> root<00:03:05.810> in

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
goodness he said he had hit a root in

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.580 
goodness he said he had hit a root in
the<00:03:06.079> yard<00:03:06.320> from<00:03:07.280> a<00:03:07.430> tree<00:03:08.019> just<00:03:09.019> look<00:03:09.230> at<00:03:09.380> how

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
the yard from a tree just look at how

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.430 
the yard from a tree just look at how
badly<00:03:09.920> this<00:03:10.250> is<00:03:10.430> bent<00:03:10.989> probably<00:03:11.989> had<00:03:12.140> a<00:03:12.170> lot<00:03:12.410> of

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
badly this is bent probably had a lot of

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.039 
badly this is bent probably had a lot of
heat<00:03:12.680> from<00:03:12.799> the<00:03:12.950> acetylene<00:03:13.370> torch<00:03:13.730> well

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
heat from the acetylene torch well

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.150 
heat from the acetylene torch well
straighten<00:03:15.049> it<00:03:15.140> out<00:03:15.260> but<00:03:15.530> it<00:03:15.829> was<00:03:15.950> never

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
straighten it out but it was never

straighten it out but it was never
balanced<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:18.560> it<00:03:18.769> looks<00:03:18.950> like<00:03:19.130> it's<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.489> same

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
balanced and it looks like it's the same

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.910 
balanced and it looks like it's the same
as<00:03:19.880> what<00:03:20.000> I<00:03:20.030> got<00:03:20.350> so<00:03:21.350> we're<00:03:21.470> gonna<00:03:21.590> go<00:03:21.829> ahead

and<00:03:22.130> put<00:03:22.250> this<00:03:22.400> on<00:03:22.579> this<00:03:22.880> is<00:03:23.140> not<00:03:24.140> a<00:03:24.380> om<00:03:24.799> bow

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
and put this on this is not a om bow

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.720 
and put this on this is not a om bow
blade<00:03:25.430> but<00:03:25.700> as<00:03:25.820> part<00:03:26.030> number<00:03:26.440> one<00:03:27.440> four<00:03:27.769> one

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730

one<00:03:28.760> one<00:03:29.299> four<00:03:30.820> so<00:03:31.820> let's<00:03:32.000> put<00:03:32.150> that<00:03:32.239> on<00:03:32.299> give

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
one one four so let's put that on give

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.250 
one one four so let's put that on give
the<00:03:32.750> Honda<00:03:33.049> its<00:03:33.230> first<00:03:33.470> start<00:03:34.989> all<00:03:35.989> right<00:03:36.049> the

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
the Honda its first start all right the

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.990 
the Honda its first start all right the
new<00:03:36.410> blade<00:03:36.620> is<00:03:36.799> on<00:03:36.949> that<00:03:37.310> looks<00:03:37.549> like<00:03:37.699> it's<00:03:37.880> in

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
new blade is on that looks like it's in

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.430 
new blade is on that looks like it's in
really<00:03:38.030> good<00:03:38.329> shape<00:03:38.389> here<00:03:38.870> in<00:03:38.959> this<00:03:39.049> pulleys

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
really good shape here in this pulleys

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.760 
really good shape here in this pulleys
in<00:03:39.590> good<00:03:39.739> shape<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.220> these<00:03:40.760> pins<00:03:41.090> were<00:03:41.299> not

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
in good shape and these pins were not

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.430 
in good shape and these pins were not
Okin<00:03:42.010> that<00:03:42.190> held<00:03:42.490> the<00:03:42.670> blade<00:03:42.880> in<00:03:43.170> let's<00:03:44.170> try<00:03:44.380> to

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
Okin that held the blade in let's try to

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.560 
Okin that held the blade in let's try to
give<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.740> honda<00:03:45.190> engine<00:03:45.550> and<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.910> Husqvarna

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
give the honda engine and the Husqvarna

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.090 
give the honda engine and the Husqvarna
more<00:03:47.080> it's<00:03:47.200> for<00:03:47.410> a<00:03:47.440> start<00:03:49.710> okay<00:03:50.710> I<00:03:50.740> believe

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
more it's for a start okay I believe

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.430 
more it's for a start okay I believe
that<00:03:51.280> fuel<00:03:51.490> is<00:03:51.520> on<00:03:51.880> we<00:03:52.450> got<00:03:52.630> a<00:03:52.980> choke<00:03:53.980> here

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
that fuel is on we got a choke here

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:02.280 
that fuel is on we got a choke here
there<00:03:56.440> we<00:03:56.530> go<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:59.070> I<00:04:00.070> did<00:04:00.280> put<00:04:00.460> the<00:04:01.230> spark<00:04:02.230> plug

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
there we go and I did put the spark plug

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.650 
there we go and I did put the spark plug
back<00:04:02.500> on<00:04:03.780> so<00:04:04.780> let's<00:04:04.990> give<00:04:05.140> it<00:04:05.170> a<00:04:05.320> try<00:04:05.470> here<00:04:06.660> can

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
back on so let's give it a try here can

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:27.840 
back on so let's give it a try here can
you<00:04:07.750> believe<00:04:07.990> it<00:04:08.080> on<00:04:11.610> here<00:04:12.610> we<00:04:12.700> go<00:04:26.760> put<00:04:27.760> the

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
you believe it on here we go put the

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.650 
you believe it on here we go put the
choke<00:04:28.090> off

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
choke off

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.820 
choke off
I<00:04:28.690> mean<00:04:28.960> it's<00:04:29.080> put<00:04:29.230> a<00:04:29.260> little<00:04:29.380> carburetor

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
I mean it's put a little carburetor

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:43.370 
I mean it's put a little carburetor
cleaner<00:04:29.950> in<00:04:30.250> here

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:06:19.200 

it<00:04:44.380> does<00:04:44.560> have<00:04:44.770> gas<00:04:44.950> in<00:04:45.220> it

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.270
