 hello everyone we meet today 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.390
 for a new episode of my series the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.230
 guys I hope you all go very 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.960
 very well listen to me 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.410
 for my part everything goes flawless and in 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.340
 this episode I built a team for 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.190
 show you some players 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.770
 interesting and especially neymar who has 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.719
 been had at 87 that I had in a no 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.370
 that I will put you the link of the pack 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.100
 opening in question in the description 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.660
 and I also put botha case that was 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.210
 supported at the level of technical gestures 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.059
 a player I've tested the blow by 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.440
 same opportunity at the base in these matches 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.390
 I wanted to review both 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.890
 players but saw that I did not have the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.199
 phases of gameplay that I wanted I 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.940
 decided to make a beautiful game and 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.859
 you'll see we're really going 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.390
 to provide great opportunities 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.040
 there will be interesting things 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.979
 I also have things to tell you 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.880
 guys and in this match 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.110
 clearly we fell against a beautiful 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.610
 adversary we did not have much 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.490
 we'll score a goal 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.840
 really not bad here with neymar so 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.979
 I have a small drop in level 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.689
 moment it's true that I play a little 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.670
 little less I have not if you noticed 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.130
 right now I'm working a little bit 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.450
 more my videos at the editing of the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.280
 blow we will say that I spend a little 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.500
 little more time on sony vegas than on 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.960
 the console and necessarily it feels 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.820
 at level 2 at the level of my game everything 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.610
 just after that is not it either 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.020
 catastrophic but but I feel that 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.970
 I have a little lost level so that 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.060
 will come back will a little bit that I 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.890
 rework all this so inevitably when 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.560
 of these matches in these games forgiveness 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.689
 I especially wanted to win this 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.790
 so I tried a lot of things 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.710
 it's not disgusting either but I 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.780
 especially wanted to win the matches so I 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.969
 will give you my feeling on neymar 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.290
 I think first of all that if you 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.799
 interested guys I 'll do a review 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.439
 on the player 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.909
 after your case I do not think I'll do 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.140
 a review I was really disappointed 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.149
 player besides proof I 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.770
 twice during the match on 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.410
 you will see it is at the first and the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.270
 second 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.660
 dance in the second and third 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.160
 match I made replacements 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.950
 so here it is a player who at 66.2 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.510
 general who has a finish to you will see 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.490
 in the episode will give you an overview 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.860
 after this is a healthy paella player 5 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.620
 stars but he has a finish really 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.790
 which leaves something to be desired and especially in these 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.520
 matches there I fell against 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.890
 big armadas so blow often 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.200
 cantat in duel against the goal and you 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.530
 loupes stuff is not 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.780
 the moment 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.600
 and necessarily I direct outputs 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.950
 because the error is often the mistake 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.900
 is unforgivable and when you take yourself 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.910
 a goal was after you rage and suddenly 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.970
 I did not take any risk I went out 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.260
 and watch it will fall against it 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.810
 the first time I fall against 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.760
 ronaldo totti and I fell against a 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.680
 guy but typically the guy who has 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.140
 ronaldo fact that not know how to use 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.120
 he was doing that all right and the worst 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.530
 it's the guy who's raging and I've never seen 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.750
 that then I would put you an extra 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.210
 end the guy actually they surely had 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.430
 his kinect who were hooked where his 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.770
 helmet I do not know and he was doing that 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.970
 rage and a moment I will put you the end 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.350
 I will put you in the end I cut the 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.850
 its for the episode but in the end I you 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.350
 would put a small bonus 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.240
 the guy when I put him the second goal 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.400
 he fart a lead he does not he had to 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.810
 to hit our ranks frankly on the 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.520
 I was dead laughing because the 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.840
 dude really literally farted a 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.400
 cable it was that rage and in the 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.080
 match then inevitably we could not get there 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.670
 not to play so suddenly he was angry 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.500
 more and more and that was it that was 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.560
 really funny and suddenly me 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.720
 necessarily ronaldo ch who would really 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.130
 tested it is really unaffordable a 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.090
 again this year I do not have the 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.560
 credits to take it 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.940
 I made a big team from elsewhere 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.170
 true i want to bounce on that you 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.430
 but you have been many to me 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.260
 ask to present it this 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.400
 big team that I spoke to you in 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.860
 a previous video 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.880
 I 'll do it very soon I'm waiting for a 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.320
 little tight at the level of 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.900
 creations as soon as they did a little me 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.300
 calm down usually I do one by 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.830
 week or one every two weeks 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.110
 there I did two this week 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.090
 good good I'll wait surely monday 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.920
 next or maybe next Tuesday 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.840
 for you present it a very big 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.989
 team 1 equals the budget looked at it 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.400
 botha that at its finishing an example 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.230
 typical two players who lack 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.299
 finish 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.560
 so I found the post and in a 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.970
 match like that it's annoying so the 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.440
 wanna I decided to change it 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.350
 I will put my good old mac and 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.750
 steven inform and sturridge and sturridge 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.030
 there goes the winning coaching clearly and 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.190
 so I told you a pure for the team 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.080
 the big team is a team 3 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.370
 million 5.2 budget good for some 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.020
 it's not a lot for others 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.419
 huge for me perso it's huge because 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.919
 that it's true that I rarely do 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.320
 very big teams so that's it 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.940
 heavy this team so among others he 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.250
 there are 87 marks that I had in a 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.510
 pack after I tell you no more this 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.240
 team I will present it to you 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.400
 shortly and here we go 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.440
 come back a little bit to the gameplay 3 busin 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.450
 we have there by cons I enjoy and a3 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.229
 busin the job you're really over there 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.729
 can actually cheap 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.490
 his thing is that they get upset and too 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:03.070
 and I heard him behind are behind 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.360
 are his kinect he was only farting 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.919
 bridges of the blow it was more to play 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.930
 even his ronaldo he was doing nothing was 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.280
 transparent and suddenly we will prevail 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.350
 in this match so note that I have 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.110
 forgot to put there at the end of the match on 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.690
 ended this match on three buses 1 and the 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:20.200
 third match guys we're going to fall 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:23.950
 against against an opponent with 71 76 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.970
 78 of notes so necessarily that for me 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.979
 it was an average team 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.140
 but as often this year and as 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.690
 often in football we will fall against a 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.470
 guy who tanned are good after that 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.600
 he does as he wants 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.370
 I confess sometimes it happens to me 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.080
 put one or two bronzes but these 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.419
 stories in fact to balance the team 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.850
 I usually do not cheat on it 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.169
 I try to be honest and to 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.580
 it's true that it's something that makes me 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.020
 can a rager after the dishes what they 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.820
 do what they want is not 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.310
 necessarily what they are going to 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.539
 save away from there as long as you 're 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.500
 banks on the ground this is what 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.990
 that's what matters 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.660
 and before this match we will get you 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.669
 some opportunities without more shyly 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.130
 but there will be beautiful game look 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:04.349
 botha case here a fine shot repelled 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.669
 by his guardian 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:09.729
 the opponent will react just before mid 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:11.560
 time the center on doumbia that has more 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.479
 than to push it at the bottom so a goal 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.310
 logical because here it was all 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:18.099
 only after I wanted to react directly from 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.270
 languages a nice action neymar we're going 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:20.890
 dribble we will dribble a lot 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.289
 of adversaries in this in this 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.120
 action and to watch we will approach 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:28.030
 of the repair area 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.979
 we will go inside right foot alas 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.330
 the 87 finish that is not put the 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:33.550
 contribution roof I was a little bit 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.860
 disgusted with the blow it's a pity we would have 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.240
 could score the equalizing goal just 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.070
 before the half-time I'm going to make 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.180
 Changes 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.460
 I'm going to make some changes and here we 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.500
 will make a nice passing game and we will 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.479
