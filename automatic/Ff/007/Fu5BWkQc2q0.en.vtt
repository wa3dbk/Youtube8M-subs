00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
I do want to explain to you guys how I

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.290 
I do want to explain to you guys how I
made<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> selection<00:00:50.070> now<00:00:50.250> on<00:00:50.640> foot<00:00:51.120> head

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
made the selection now on foot head

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.420 
made the selection now on foot head
there's<00:00:51.570> actually<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> sort<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.829> way<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.070> can

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
there's actually a sort of way you can

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.299 
there's actually a sort of way you can
sort<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.510> players<00:00:54.899> by<00:00:55.230> their<00:00:55.440> beast<00:00:55.800> rating

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
sort the players by their beast rating

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.160 
sort the players by their beast rating
and<00:00:56.489> essentially<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.600> like<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.780> combination

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
and essentially it's like a combination

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.279 
and essentially it's like a combination
of<00:00:58.649> their<00:00:59.039> strengths<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.789> pays<00:01:00.289> shooting

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
of their strengths that pays shooting

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.720 
of their strengths that pays shooting
and<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.590> few<00:01:01.829> other<00:01:01.980> attributes<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.670> are

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
and a few other attributes that are

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.549 
and a few other attributes that are
really<00:01:03.090> important<00:01:03.510> FIFA<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.409> actually

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
really important FIFA and it actually

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.170 
really important FIFA and it actually
shows<00:01:04.769> up<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.280> best<00:01:05.430> play<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.850> believe<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
shows up the best play so I believe the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.520 
shows up the best play so I believe the
best<00:01:06.360> one<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.720> whole<00:01:06.810> game<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.260> some<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.439> my
