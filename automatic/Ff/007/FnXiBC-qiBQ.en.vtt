00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.000 

Robert<00:01:08.250> really<00:01:08.729> takes<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.240> different<00:01:09.680> view<00:01:10.680> on

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
Robert really takes a different view on

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.930 
Robert really takes a different view on
how<00:01:11.850> Mozart<00:01:12.479> would<00:01:12.690> have<00:01:12.780> continued<00:01:13.470> working

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
how Mozart would have continued working

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.550 
how Mozart would have continued working
given<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.090> kind<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.960> compositional

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
given the kind of compositional

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.530 
given the kind of compositional
techniques<00:01:16.979> he<00:01:17.130> was<00:01:17.280> using<00:01:17.490> at<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.970> time<00:01:18.000> and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
techniques he was using at the time and

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.410 
techniques he was using at the time and
I<00:01:19.050> think<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:19.979> have<00:01:20.190> here<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:21.000> true

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
I think what we have here is a true

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.660 
I think what we have here is a true
masterpiece<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.470> something<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.520> very

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
masterpiece and something that is very

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.660 
masterpiece and something that is very
fitting<00:01:24.240> with<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> style<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.619> music<00:01:26.250> writing

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
fitting with the style of music writing

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:40.179 
fitting with the style of music writing
that<00:01:26.910> Mozart<00:01:27.090> was<00:01:27.450> undertaking<00:01:28.140> at<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.350> time

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.740 

it<00:01:41.189> was<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.520> last<00:01:41.729> work<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.210> Mozart<00:01:42.600> wrote

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
it was the last work that Mozart wrote

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.399 
it was the last work that Mozart wrote
before<00:01:43.229> he<00:01:43.409> died<00:01:43.650> and<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:45.360> give<00:01:45.540> contrast<00:01:46.170> I

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
before he died and to give contrast I

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.190 
before he died and to give contrast I
wanted<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.799> pick<00:01:46.979> one<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> very<00:01:47.610> earliest

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
wanted to pick one of the very earliest

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.719 
wanted to pick one of the very earliest
choral<00:01:49.200> works<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.770> he<00:01:49.920> wrote<00:01:50.130> as<00:01:50.310> well<00:01:50.520> and

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
choral works that he wrote as well and

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.410 
choral works that he wrote as well and
so<00:01:50.880> we<00:01:50.909> have<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> very<00:01:51.509> early<00:01:51.750> kiri<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.610> k33<00:01:53.610> for

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
so we have a very early kiri a k33 for

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.539 
so we have a very early kiri a k33 for
orchestra<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.320> chorus<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.340> will<00:01:56.460> be

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
orchestra and chorus that will be

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.730 
orchestra and chorus that will be
performed<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.299> before<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.720> Requiem<00:01:58.020> just

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
performed just before the Requiem just

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.789 
performed just before the Requiem just
to<00:01:58.860> give<00:01:58.979> our<00:01:59.130> ears<00:01:59.580> a<00:01:59.750> different<00:02:00.750> view<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
to give our ears a different view of the

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.740 
to give our ears a different view of the
worlds<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.610> Mozart<00:02:02.850> was<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.299> happening

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
worlds that Mozart was in happening

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:22.290 
worlds that Mozart was in happening
throughout<00:02:04.020> his<00:02:04.320> very<00:02:05.310> impressive<00:02:05.880> life

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.710 

on<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:24.400> first<00:02:24.640> half<00:02:24.880> of<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.090> concert<00:02:25.540> I

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
on the first half of the concert I

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.090 
on the first half of the concert I
wanted<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.380> find<00:02:26.560> something<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:27.070> little

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
wanted to find something a little

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.930 
wanted to find something a little
unusual<00:02:27.850> but<00:02:28.360> still<00:02:28.720> spoke<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.940> romantic

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
unusual but still spoke to the romantic

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.520 
unusual but still spoke to the romantic
sense<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.840> longing<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:34.540> human<00:02:34.930> spirit<00:02:35.410> as
