your<00:03:25.470> knife<00:03:25.620> but<00:03:25.920> you<00:03:26.040> could<00:03:26.280> use<00:03:26.549> the

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
your knife but you could use the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.610 
your knife but you could use the
particular<00:03:27.360> leather<00:03:27.930> level<00:03:28.410> because<00:03:28.590> that

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
particular leather level because that

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.650 
particular leather level because that
will<00:03:28.890> actually<00:03:29.070> position<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:29.850> exactly<00:03:30.000> I

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
will actually position it exactly I

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.840 
will actually position it exactly I
think<00:03:31.350> I<00:03:31.440> do<00:03:31.500> pretty<00:03:31.620> well<00:03:31.950> maybe<00:03:32.459> this<00:03:32.670> is<00:03:32.820> a

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
think I do pretty well maybe this is a

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.370 
think I do pretty well maybe this is a
little<00:03:33.120> bit<00:03:33.239> flatter<00:03:33.510> layer<00:03:33.780> but<00:03:34.049> you<00:03:34.290> know

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
little bit flatter layer but you know

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.830 
little bit flatter layer but you know
it's<00:03:34.560> kind<00:03:34.769> of<00:03:34.890> like<00:03:35.070> a<00:03:35.250> noel<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:36.450> does<00:03:36.660> smell

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
it's kind of like a noel it does smell

going to damn it with just some of the
icing<00:03:42.989> that<00:03:43.019> I<00:03:43.380> would<00:03:43.709> actually<00:03:43.980> put<00:03:44.760> on<00:03:45.030> top

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
icing that I would actually put on top

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.160 
icing that I would actually put on top
of<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:47.040> cake<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:48.209> this<00:03:48.359> is<00:03:48.540> our<00:03:48.690> batter<00:03:48.930> dance

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
of the cake so this is our batter dance

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.289 
of the cake so this is our batter dance
again<00:03:49.500> Rice's<00:03:50.070> buttercream<00:03:50.609> and<00:03:50.790> this<00:03:50.970> is<00:03:51.150> to

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
again Rice's buttercream and this is to

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.360 
again Rice's buttercream and this is to
secure<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.200> keep<00:03:52.380> this<00:03:52.680> whipping<00:03:53.010> cream

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
secure and keep this whipping cream

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.640 
secure and keep this whipping cream
inside<00:03:54.269> right<00:03:54.720> so<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:54.959> doesn't<00:03:55.200> run<00:03:55.320> outside

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
inside right so it doesn't run outside

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.830 
inside right so it doesn't run outside
absolutely<00:03:56.549> so<00:03:57.030> you<00:03:57.090> can<00:03:57.239> just<00:03:57.359> kind<00:03:57.570> of<00:03:57.630> put<00:03:57.810> a

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
absolutely so you can just kind of put a

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.789 
absolutely so you can just kind of put a
little<00:03:58.049> bit<00:03:58.140> in<00:03:58.260> there<00:03:58.380> you<00:03:58.470> don't<00:03:58.560> have<00:03:58.650> to

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
little bit in there you don't have to

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.319 
little bit in there you don't have to
spend<00:03:59.010> a<00:03:59.130> whole<00:03:59.160> lot<00:03:59.280> of<00:03:59.459> time<00:03:59.700> spreading<00:04:00.120> it

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
spend a whole lot of time spreading it

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.090 
spend a whole lot of time spreading it
because<00:04:00.630> when<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:00.870> actually<00:04:01.320> come<00:04:01.500> along<00:04:01.799> and

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
because when you actually come along and

because when you actually come along and
put<00:04:02.670> this<00:04:02.820> other<00:04:03.060> layer<00:04:03.390> on<00:04:03.630> top<00:04:03.959> it<00:04:04.799> will<00:04:05.600> and

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
put this other layer on top it will and

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.930 
put this other layer on top it will and
you<00:04:06.720> press<00:04:06.989> it<00:04:07.170> down<00:04:07.320> it<00:04:07.829> will<00:04:08.010> actually<00:04:08.190> move

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
you press it down it will actually move

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.050 
you press it down it will actually move
into<00:04:09.320> where<00:04:10.320> your<00:04:10.769> icing<00:04:11.220> is<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.549> that's<00:04:11.850> how

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
into where your icing is and that's how

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.610 
into where your icing is and that's how
you<00:04:12.120> torte<00:04:12.510> it<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:12.840> our<00:04:12.989> finished<00:04:13.290> cake<00:04:13.440> it

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
you torte it and our finished cake it

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.800 
you torte it and our finished cake it
actually<00:04:14.040> has<00:04:14.280> these<00:04:14.579> four<00:04:14.970> layers<00:04:15.299> which<00:04:15.690> is

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
actually has these four layers which is

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.390 
actually has these four layers which is
actually<00:04:16.140> two<00:04:16.320> layers<00:04:16.350> but<00:04:16.890> since<00:04:17.100> it's<00:04:17.220> been

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
actually two layers but since it's been

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.789 
actually two layers but since it's been
sliced<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.209> toward<00:04:18.479> it<00:04:18.570> it's<00:04:18.720> for<00:04:18.989> you<00:04:19.500> stack

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
sliced and toward it it's for you stack

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.949 
sliced and toward it it's for you stack
it<00:04:20.010> up<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:20.400> it<00:04:21.000> looks<00:04:21.150> really<00:04:21.570> decadent

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
it up and it looks really decadent

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.800 
it up and it looks really decadent
because<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:22.770> have<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.159> height<00:04:23.370> on<00:04:23.669> it<00:04:23.810> and

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
because you have the height on it and

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.270 
because you have the height on it and
when<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:25.680> cut<00:04:25.950> it

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
when you cut it

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.920 
when you cut it
see<00:04:26.460> all<00:04:26.700> of<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:27.000> layers<00:04:27.210> and<00:04:27.540> it<00:04:27.630> just<00:04:27.780> looks

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
see all of the layers and it just looks

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.330 
see all of the layers and it just looks
really<00:04:28.560> really<00:04:28.950> good

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
really really good

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.010 
really really good
and<00:04:29.430> we<00:04:29.520> might<00:04:29.700> mention<00:04:29.940> that<00:04:30.150> once<00:04:30.540> you<00:04:30.750> have

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
and we might mention that once you have

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.280 
and we might mention that once you have
those<00:04:31.680> two<00:04:31.740> you<00:04:32.400> actually<00:04:32.760> put<00:04:33.270> one<00:04:33.630> layer<00:04:33.960> of

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
those two you actually put one layer of

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.290 
those two you actually put one layer of
the<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.950> filling<00:04:35.340> in<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.520> middle<00:04:35.639> so<00:04:36.180> they

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
the the filling in the middle so they

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.970 
the the filling in the middle so they
adhere<00:04:36.720> together<00:04:36.930> you<00:04:37.320> make<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:37.590> two<00:04:37.740> layers

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
adhere together you make the two layers

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.320 
adhere together you make the two layers

I<00:06:38.699> don't<00:06:39.210> think<00:06:39.360> that's<00:06:39.509> why<00:06:39.629> they<00:06:39.780> use<00:06:39.960> it<00:06:40.110> I

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 
I don't think that's why they use it I

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:42.739 
I don't think that's why they use it I
was<00:06:40.740> thinking<00:06:40.770> about<00:06:41.249> that<00:06:41.789> I<00:06:41.849> remember<00:06:42.270> my<00:06:42.479> 9

00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:42.749 
was thinking about that I remember my 9

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:45.379 
was thinking about that I remember my 9
months<00:06:43.110> but<00:06:43.349> worth<00:06:44.159> every<00:06:44.370> minute<00:06:44.879> of<00:06:44.999> it<00:06:45.150> so

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:45.389 
months but worth every minute of it so

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:46.730 
months but worth every minute of it so
you<00:06:45.449> would<00:06:45.659> just<00:06:45.689> keep<00:06:46.020> going<00:06:46.349> around<00:06:46.469> with

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
you would just keep going around with

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.350 
you would just keep going around with
that<00:06:46.889> so<00:06:47.039> you<00:06:47.099> squeeze<00:06:47.340> stop<00:06:47.729> squeezing<00:06:48.060> in

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
that so you squeeze stop squeezing in

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.360 
that so you squeeze stop squeezing in
left<00:06:48.629> and<00:06:49.139> you<00:06:49.289> see<00:06:49.439> I<00:06:49.469> have<00:06:49.560> a<00:06:49.650> couple<00:06:49.889> tips<00:06:50.159> so

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 
left and you see I have a couple tips so

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:51.860 
left and you see I have a couple tips so
then<00:06:50.550> after<00:06:50.789> that<00:06:50.879> kind<00:06:51.120> of<00:06:51.180> dried<00:06:51.419> out

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
then after that kind of dried out

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.989 
then after that kind of dried out
I<00:06:51.900> would<00:06:52.319> Pat<00:06:52.560> that<00:06:52.800> down<00:06:53.069> and<00:06:53.490> now<00:06:53.669> this<00:06:53.789> is

00:06:53.989 --> 00:06:53.999 
I would Pat that down and now this is

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:55.550 
I would Pat that down and now this is
your<00:06:54.150> ruffle<00:06:54.389> is<00:06:54.449> this<00:06:54.599> a<00:06:54.629> leaf<00:06:54.960> tip<00:06:55.259> that

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 
your ruffle is this a leaf tip that

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.029 
your ruffle is this a leaf tip that
you're<00:06:55.710> using

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 
you're using

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:58.969 
you're using
it's<00:06:56.819> a<00:06:56.969> petal<00:06:57.330> tip<00:06:57.509> or<00:06:57.749> a<00:06:57.810> leaf<00:06:58.199> tip<00:06:58.439> I'm

00:06:58.969 --> 00:06:58.979 
it's a petal tip or a leaf tip I'm

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:00.559 
it's a petal tip or a leaf tip I'm
actually<00:06:59.129> going<00:06:59.340> to<00:06:59.400> start<00:06:59.610> on<00:06:59.789> this<00:06:59.969> side<00:07:00.029> and

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:00.569 
actually going to start on this side and

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:02.659 
actually going to start on this side and
with<00:07:01.080> that<00:07:01.259> you're<00:07:01.499> just<00:07:01.650> holding<00:07:01.949> it<00:07:01.979> at<00:07:02.129> a<00:07:02.189> 45

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:02.669 
with that you're just holding it at a 45

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:06.200 
with that you're just holding it at a 45
degree<00:07:02.699> angle<00:07:03.120> and<00:07:03.840> you<00:07:04.650> just<00:07:04.889> keep<00:07:05.400> going<00:07:05.460> up

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.210 
degree angle and you just keep going up

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.200 
degree angle and you just keep going up
and<00:07:06.509> down<00:07:06.749> like<00:07:06.810> your<00:07:07.229> zigzag<00:07:07.529> and<00:07:08.279> you<00:07:09.060> just

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.210 
and down like your zigzag and you just

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.909 
and down like your zigzag and you just
put<00:07:09.419> the<00:07:09.509> ruffle<00:07:09.870> around<00:07:10.229> the<00:07:10.379> outside<00:07:10.889> of

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:10.919 
put the ruffle around the outside of

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:15.050 
put the ruffle around the outside of
that<00:07:12.529> so<00:07:13.529> that<00:07:13.949> looks<00:07:14.159> pretty<00:07:14.250> easy<00:07:14.639> this<00:07:14.909> is

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 
that so that looks pretty easy this is

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.369 
that so that looks pretty easy this is
still<00:07:15.240> buttercream<00:07:15.779> and<00:07:15.870> then<00:07:16.020> you<00:07:16.110> can<00:07:16.259> just

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:16.379

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:18.230 
still buttercream and then you can just
say<00:07:16.529> yes<00:07:16.889> you<00:07:17.129> could<00:07:17.279> just<00:07:17.460> continue<00:07:17.759> doing

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 
say yes you could just continue doing

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.119 
say yes you could just continue doing
that<00:07:18.449> but<00:07:19.020> what<00:07:19.199> I<00:07:19.229> also<00:07:19.379> want<00:07:19.710> to<00:07:19.740> do<00:07:19.860> is<00:07:19.949> show

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 
you're kind of at a 45 degree angle but

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.800 
you're kind of at a 45 degree angle but
you<00:07:25.860> should<00:07:26.189> normally<00:07:26.520> be<00:07:26.580> a<00:07:26.669> 90<00:07:26.969> degree<00:07:27.210> if<00:07:27.629> I

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:27.810 
you should normally be a 90 degree if I

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.360 
you should normally be a 90 degree if I
was<00:07:27.960> at<00:07:28.080> the<00:07:28.169> top<00:07:28.379> of<00:07:28.529> my<00:07:28.650> cake<00:07:28.710> but<00:07:29.069> you<00:07:29.189> just
