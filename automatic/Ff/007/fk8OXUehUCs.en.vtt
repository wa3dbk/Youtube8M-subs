00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.069
hello

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.870
Namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another session

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.480
with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. Today we're going to enter the

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.759
world of pastas

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.300
the most important thing when you think
about pasta his how to boil them

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.840
so dear friends we're going to learn how to boil these pastas

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.890
perfectly, so that we get al dente.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.820
Al dente means to the bite. There are
various kinds of pasta to choose from

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.180
we got some spaghetti from Italy and we have some fusellini

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.320
this is also made in Italy but we got our good old

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.500
bambino pasta this is penni pasta

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.370
from India. Even in India we get various
kinds of pasta nowadays

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.500
more than spaghetti, pastas like penni pasta and the twisters are very popular in

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.030
India

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.820
and you can Indianize various kinds of
sauces to make this

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.539
what is it so great about boiling pasta
how many of you can make biryani

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.140
where rice is cooked perfectly with each
grain

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.540
shining like pearls each one of you can
do it

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.200
but you need to pay a lot of attention
saw isn't cooking pasta

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.260
use lot of water in a deep pot

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.369
pasta needs to literally dance in this hot
boiling water

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.150
with the right amount of salt so the
first thing we need to do is

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.180
bring this water to boil add

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.950
right amount of salt just 10 grams of
salt for

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.400
100 grams of pasta. After adding salt wait

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.790
till the water comes to a boil again
that's when you add

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.490
pasta again, i added 25 grams of salt

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.090
so I'm going to add 250 grams of pasta into it. After you add pasta

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.119
as soon as possible just stir it because
you don't want this pasta

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.250
to stick together specially if you're
using spaghetti

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.520
we're going to let it boil. Now we're going to add some oil

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.930
Dear friends this would be the most
stupidest thing to do

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.119
with pasta. when ever we boil chinese noodles

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.920
in the restaurant we're going to cool them
and use it for cooking later

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.009
that's when we add oil but for Italian pasta you add oil

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.370
that's as good as murdering this pasta
so never add oil

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.470
every minute or so mix the pasta, this spaghetti says

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.620
10 minutes, this bambino pass 10-20 minutes

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.430
and here another pasta says again 12
minutes

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.500
so dear friends how do you know if the
pasta is cooked well I never follow

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.950
the time that's mentioned on this
package. I just take a strand of pasta

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.360
break it and see if the inside is still whitish that means the pasta is still

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.970
not cooked

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.390
ones the core of the strand has lost its
whiteness

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.629
that is the time for draining so what is Al dente. Al dente is when you

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:46.340
take a bite

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.410
you should feel the bite it should not
be overcooked

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.400
then it's not good, the pasta is as good
as ready to throw in the garbage

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.360
so when you take a bite, you should feel the bite, that's what is al dente.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.129
I just take one pasta

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:06.170
bite I think it needs one more minute

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.610
this is almost done wow perfect

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.940
once the pasta is cooked before draining add a glass of cold water

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.230
to stop it from cooking further. Here I've
got my

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.019
sauce ready I'm just going to add some more basil to it . wow

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.459
it smells good, see professional chefs
what we do is we take the pasta

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:25.940
drain it out

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.000
and immediately put in the sauce so
while this pasta is cooking

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.720
I already made the pasta sauce here
which is just done

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:40.720
so i'm going to add this pasta into my sauce

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.510
this pasta is ready. This is awesome. I'm going to transfer it into

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.090
hahahahahahaha put in some

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:58.090
grated cheese on top if you want

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.400
by the time the pasta is cooked my sauce
is ready i drain it

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.190
immediately I add pasta into up sauce. The reason why I add

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.750
hot pasta into hot sauces always serve
your pasta

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.280
piping hot never luke warm or cold. One of the main reasons why we don't

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.780
add oil into boiling pasta is because
sauce will not stick to the pasta

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.260
if you add oil while boiling. Make sure you
cook the pasta right

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.250
but sauce make it to your taste, if you want to indianize the pasta sauce

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.210
please go ahead do it the way you like
it. Today we just learn how to

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.290
boil this pasta but in another session we  will definitely learn various kinds of

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.990
pasta sauces. Dear friends I hope you enjoyed today's session of learning how to make
