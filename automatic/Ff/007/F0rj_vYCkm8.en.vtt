00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hi all bob 777 welcome in 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.660
 this new episode of the series of 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.030
 transfers have passed two weeks 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.250
 since the last episode I was on vacation are 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.960
 back there are so many transfers though 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.000
 anyway we go to see a dozen 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.640
 yes 10 let's go and see though since 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.130
 there were so many during the next one 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.689
 week to release another mini 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.869
 episode that happens to me is not because of the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.029
 end will be used true with transfers 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.859
 let's say minor teams why 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.109
 you are right I always do those of 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.910
 main teams it seems to me right to do 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.980
 see also those of teams not 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.420
 however main we are ready to 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.219
 start but sooner or later put me 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.079
 like this video and recommended live 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.890
 under other transfers that I have 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.870
 escaped 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.390
 I never once forgot all are 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.120
 here, however, well now let's start e 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.550
 let's start with a wonderful shot of 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.620
 maria that from the united step paris saint 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.780
 germain for 63 million euros 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.030
 and here there would really be so much to 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.190
 have as you know it repeats one more 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.370
 sometimes pictures of the match are given 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.080
 well me and mary and miss them a 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.090
 player as of maria to lose so much 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.610
 above all then also going to get lost 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.010
 money, however, let's say that the Argentine doesn't 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.770
 he never settled in he always played a 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.600
 this has never been true of maria 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.820
 that if he saw c with the argentina that 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.100
 with real can paris saint germain in 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.520
 France to say that it will do well is little and 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.560
 obvious that a championship made on purpose 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.930
 you will practically slaughter in france and 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.030
 ok, finals that lose a great deal 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.150
 player however always staying in 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.759
 somehow in Manchester we see jacko 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.680
 that hurts city ​​goes to Rome for 4 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.250
 million plus 11 million loan 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.700
 redemption 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.180
 peuterey of any bonuses then jacko 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.369
 a total of 15 million was paid 15 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.049
 millions and for those who at other times had 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.030
 having said that whoever there is not a shot because 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.280
 is not a player said ste robe 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.159
 here someone had not written well it is 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.590
 blind to 15 if this is not a blow 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.210
 game that immediately did very well already 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.820
 the presentation of the match with 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.890
 seville strengthens Rome so much 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.649
 the attacker who served just the 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.759
 physical point to the striker from to Rome 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.150
 right in series 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.150
 and who knows this headmaster 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.269
 more is born maybe it will weigh and to help 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.459
 weigh there is also room that from chelsea 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.870
 then it seems that Europe is going to Rome 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.290
 second transfer in this episode 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.980
 Room 5 million loan for 15 more 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.170
 redemption 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.239
 he 20 in total has already shown with 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.609
 the Florentine that in series to us however 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.310
 can do can you make rome you are 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.329
 he hadn't done much better 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.000
 a lot at the beginning but now these 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:40.220
 two more ger are also that among other things 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.780
 he is paying more than gecko but I don't know 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.599
 not even if there's paper so I don't 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.030
 I put it okay that now I wo n't play 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.859
 the real nothing I don't have right now is you are 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.049
 improving both the roma always in 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:53.840
 italy now we move to Milan we have 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.569
 shaqiri that from the interval stoke city 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.930
 for 17 million and followed someone yes 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.670
 reinforces someone I think we lose 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.010
 I don't know how well Inter has done 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.959
 give shaqiri sincerely sorry 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.000
 Milanese merit that a player like 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.430
 shaqiri if you left me in milan 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.889
 they would have quiet network but oh well not 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.870
 now that is not the case though if how 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:15.440
 lose a player as shaqiri for 17 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.449
 millions 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.030
 well i never even gave up time 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:22.549
 they downloaded it immediately i'm sorry a 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.349
 but if someone leaves from the inter 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.019
 someone else comes as an example 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.669
 jovetic that everything is said here because he 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.159
 leave manchester we've seen 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:33.590
 now to go to milan then pass 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:35.720
 from the serial the inter for 3 million for the 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.209
 two-year classic plus 12 million per 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.489
 the obligation of redemption and he also in 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.129
 total a total of 15 best for 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.709
 you like jacko very good shot here too 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:48.349
 Inter strengthens the objects we 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.470
 back to Italy and many beautiful things 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:53.930
 then we have swifts passing by 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.329
 Zenith in West Bromwich for 17 million 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.069
 and here is a whole speech because from 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.049
 here we see that the premier league a 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.060
 best world championship in fact 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.340
 also teams that are not top class 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.919
 however of second peace of third band 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.829
 such as the west bromwich do 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:12.709
 first level purchases the first floor 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:15.789
 rondon would have here and guide for the 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:18.680
 national 17 million goes to west bromwich 

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:20.690
 man and from here you can see just the level 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.090
 the difference between the premier league and 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.430
 the others 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.199
 championships will certainly reinforce west 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.120
 browmich and now many teams of 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.280
 premieres have so many attackers at least one 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.560
 strong striker for each team 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.760
 just fillon their player from 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.800
 cover 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.169
 then we have filipe luis from chelsea 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.750
 the athletic madrid returns for 16 million 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.030
 therefore the dedication practically had 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.650
 seems to have gained about 20 million 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.540
 now he does not remember about 20 million 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:50.850
 last year more liberal poison 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:53.130
 now back and buy it 16 then 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.900
 day also earned on bomber jackets 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.340
 compliments to chelsea and two fi but 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.830
 giving them the money who cares 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.570
 no oh well here we are not even saying anymore 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.000
 I have often played here on 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.490
 athletic is simply a return from 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.800
 a very good return now we see a 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.750
 po buena who also has this return 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.940
 let 's say okay but go back to france where 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.340
 have been to the fly dynamo for only 5 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.979
 millions betrays in quotation marks 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.510
 marseille passes to the lyon lyon that 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.970
 who knows if this year will succeed in 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.220
 undermining paris saint in some way 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.320
 germain could be valbuena the man 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.370
 right who knows boh 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.310
 but now let's see the last ones 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.870
 two shots the first and romagnoli 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.460
 I don't know why I put it so low 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.070
 oh well but in the end it doesn't mean anything 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.020
 already put them norine scattered simo 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.580
 romagnoli passing from rome to milan 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.960
 for 25 million 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.250
 I had already talked so much about him not me 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.080
 I remember the numbers that 25 best videos are 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.610
 it's so much 25 million and a huge one 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.310
 investment especially for a 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.650
 95 player that is as even 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.260
 compare it to nesta compare so much 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:58.320
 players is exaggerated we see that we know 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:01.050
 do technical things so many things though 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.970
 at the moment it is exaggerated in my opinion the 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.979
 price is quite exaggerated though 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.690
 compare it so many players that one 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.430
 has yet to show so much me 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.669
 obviously from Milan I hope I don't know 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:14.039
 how that is the name nesta but is a 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.419
 account is to say it in the account then to do it to 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:17.370
 finish this episode instead we have 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:20.070
 rafael that from the minds of pasta a 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.479
 3 million lions is true then I have 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.639
 said I still had someone there 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:26.250
 he said why 12 when you say united 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:28.139
 you do n't say manchester united instead with dc 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.610
 the city says of manchester city why 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.349
 for me the match 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.530
 not just the manchester to the united e 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:39.180
 the other is enough to the city the manchester allo 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:41.460
 united is enough just by raffaelli 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.349
 also he and lyon speech similar to 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.449
 that of valbuena will be him ad 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:46.169
 help recover ground on the paris 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:49.469
 saint germain 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:52.319
 I don't know, he runs for a bit harder 

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:54.719
 a little more incisive valbuena then depends 

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:57.300
 what a fan you will see if one of the first 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:59.430
 raffael of united or one of the last 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.800
 for the lion I hope to see one of the 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.500
 first, however, 3 million and very little 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.210
 how good is good and therefore these are 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.550
 the 10 transfers we went to 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.039
 see today I remember you another time 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.449
 that the week there was another episode 

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:13.800
 with with smaller teams then 

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:15.689
 let me know some below 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.520
 transfer however of teams not of 

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:18.449
 very close up I say minors though 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.180
 you have understood 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:23.400
 but it seems right a little to vary 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.050
 let me know below then and if there is 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.750
 liked puts I like written to mine 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:30.740
 channel and comments from boeing 777 everything 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.740
 hello to all
