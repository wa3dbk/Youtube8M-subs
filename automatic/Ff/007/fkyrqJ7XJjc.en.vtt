00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.030 
number two this is going to be the
toughest<00:00:06.150> drill<00:00:06.390> I<00:00:06.420> think<00:00:06.839> I've<00:00:07.080> ever<00:00:07.470> done<00:00:07.830> or

my biggest skating embarrassment yes I

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.410 
my biggest skating embarrassment yes I
can<00:00:18.000> barely<00:00:18.330> stop<00:00:18.600> on<00:00:18.869> my<00:00:19.020> last<00:00:19.260> dominant<00:00:19.770> side

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
can barely stop on my last dominant side

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.700 
can barely stop on my last dominant side
because<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.449> have<00:00:21.720> not<00:00:21.869> drilled<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.350> my<00:00:22.529> weak

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
because I have not drilled it my weak

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.160 
because I have not drilled it my weak
side<00:00:22.980> has<00:00:23.279> never<00:00:23.580> thrilled<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.150> let<00:00:25.140> alone

side has never thrilled it let alone

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.950 
side has never thrilled it let alone
killed<00:00:25.710> it

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
killed it

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.480 
killed it
so<00:00:27.960> take<00:00:28.410> ten<00:00:28.619> minutes<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.980> warm<00:00:29.160> up<00:00:29.340> before

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
so take ten minutes to warm up before

of the ankle I also attempt to invert
that<00:01:07.920> back<00:01:08.400> foot<00:01:08.670> by<00:01:08.909> bowing<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.630> leg<00:01:09.990> and

of<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.720> pelvis<00:01:15.930> I'm<00:01:16.680> really<00:01:17.070> better<00:01:17.340> off

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
of the pelvis I'm really better off

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.859 
of the pelvis I'm really better off
we're<00:01:17.790> getting<00:01:18.030> about<00:01:18.119> backi<00:01:18.570> and

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
we're getting about backi and

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.200 
we're getting about backi and
concentrating<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.920> front<00:01:20.670> foot<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
concentrating on that front foot and

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.760 
concentrating on that front foot and
getting<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.659> way<00:01:21.810> out<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.080> front<00:01:22.110> for<00:01:22.439> light

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
getting it way out in front for light

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.270 
getting it way out in front for light
even<00:01:23.400> friction<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.119> mean<00:01:24.509> way<00:01:25.320> out<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.740> front<00:01:26.009> so

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
even friction I mean way out in front so

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.760 
even friction I mean way out in front so
because<00:01:27.240> my<00:01:27.420> weak<00:01:27.600> side<00:01:27.840> has<00:01:28.110> come<00:01:28.350> along<00:01:28.590> I

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
because my weak side has come along I

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.210 
because my weak side has come along I
try<00:01:29.100> some<00:01:29.369> low-speed<00:01:29.880> stops<00:01:30.380> okay<00:01:31.380> now<00:01:31.560> faster

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
try some low-speed stops okay now faster

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.990 
try some low-speed stops okay now faster
must<00:01:33.150> get<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.570> front<00:01:33.840> foot<00:01:34.140> out<00:01:34.320> more<00:01:34.680> no<00:01:35.490> now

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
must get that front foot out more no now

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.940 
must get that front foot out more no now
this<00:01:36.180> one<00:01:36.390> here<00:01:36.540> was<00:01:36.689> almost<00:01:37.049> perfect<00:01:37.650> but<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
this one here was almost perfect but the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.160 
this one here was almost perfect but the
back<00:01:38.220> foot<00:01:38.579> needs<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.090> be<00:01:39.210> under<00:01:39.479> its<00:01:39.630> own<00:01:39.840> half

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
back foot needs to be under its own half

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.630 
back foot needs to be under its own half
of<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.619> pelvis<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:41.549> over<00:01:41.880> there

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
of the pelvis like over there

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.399 
of the pelvis like over there
the<00:01:44.640> phone<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.330> hand<00:01:45.540> can't<00:01:45.990> be<00:01:46.200> good<00:01:46.350> for

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
the phone in hand can't be good for

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.719 
the phone in hand can't be good for
tensional<00:01:47.070> dedication<00:01:47.759> either<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:49.310> do<00:01:50.310> make

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
tensional dedication either I do make

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.850 
tensional dedication either I do make
some<00:01:50.939> progress<00:01:51.150> here<00:01:51.570> but<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:52.080> still<00:01:52.590> plan<00:01:52.799> to

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
some progress here but I still plan to

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.920 
some progress here but I still plan to
use<00:01:53.190> the<00:01:53.430> dominant<00:01:54.030> side<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.540> street<00:01:54.780> when

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
use the dominant side on the street when

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.600 
use the dominant side on the street when
it<00:01:55.049> matters<00:01:55.350> who<00:01:55.619> knows<00:01:55.830> though<00:01:56.040> maybe<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
it matters who knows though maybe the

or<00:02:02.399> weeks<00:02:02.700> I'd<00:02:02.940> dedicated<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:04.049> would<00:02:04.289> even<00:02:04.830> out

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
or weeks I'd dedicated it would even out

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.670

and<00:02:05.250> there<00:02:05.460> would<00:02:05.729> also<00:02:06.000> be<00:02:06.380> applications<00:02:07.380> for

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
and there would also be applications for

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.639 
and there would also be applications for
the<00:02:07.799> strong<00:02:08.160> side<00:02:08.429> from<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.660> re-examination

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610

drill<00:02:14.850> if<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.120> feel<00:02:15.450> your<00:02:15.660> skates<00:02:16.050> skittering

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
drill if you feel your skates skittering

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.220 
drill if you feel your skates skittering
harshly<00:02:17.160> with<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.730> friction<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.750> need<00:02:18.989> to

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
harshly with the friction you need to

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.190 
harshly with the friction you need to
flex<00:02:19.620> your<00:02:19.830> ankles<00:02:20.069> even<00:02:20.730> more<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:21.239> hope

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
flex your ankles even more I hope

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.140 
flex your ankles even more I hope
someday<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.680> even<00:02:23.280> sound<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.730> same<00:02:23.910> when

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
someday to even sound the same when

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.000 
someday to even sound the same when

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
stopping on either side and I think that

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.960 
stopping on either side and I think that
comes<00:02:26.220> down<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.970> flex<00:02:27.330> in<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.600> ankle<00:02:28.019> I

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
comes down to the flex in the ankle I

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.610 
comes down to the flex in the ankle I
would<00:02:29.970> suggest<00:02:30.120> only<00:02:30.810> four<00:02:31.050> down<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.290> backs
