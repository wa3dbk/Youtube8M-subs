it'll<00:01:01.469> pretty<00:01:01.620> much<00:01:01.710> depend<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.280> what<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.550> get

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
it'll pretty much depend on what I get

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.179

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
because that's where you get a majority

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.810 
because that's where you get a majority
