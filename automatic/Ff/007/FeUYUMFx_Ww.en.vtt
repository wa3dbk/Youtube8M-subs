it's by me by means of just not doing
enough<00:02:06.600> work<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:07.710> know<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:08.099> rest<00:02:08.369> is

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
enough work you know that rest is

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.680 
enough work you know that rest is
extremely<00:02:08.910> important<00:02:09.239> for<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
extremely important for the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.780 
extremely important for the
the<00:02:10.200> other<00:02:10.380> thing<00:02:10.650> would<00:02:10.800> be<00:02:11.010> that<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.640> know

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
the other thing would be that you know

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.090 
the other thing would be that you know
UV<00:02:12.510> light<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.960> not<00:02:13.110> very<00:02:13.470> good<00:02:13.650> for<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:13.950> eyes

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
UV light is not very good for the eyes

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.130 
UV light is not very good for the eyes
it<00:02:14.730> can<00:02:14.910> cause<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.120> lot<00:02:15.270> of<00:02:15.330> problems<00:02:15.870> in<00:02:16.020> the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
it can cause a lot of problems in the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.110 
it can cause a lot of problems in the
eye<00:02:16.170> right<00:02:16.260> from<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.520> know<00:02:17.610> those<00:02:17.760> problems

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
eye right from you know those problems

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.730 
eye right from you know those problems
can<00:02:18.270> vary<00:02:18.480> from<00:02:18.660> something<00:02:19.050> related<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.470> the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
can vary from something related to the

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.220 
can vary from something related to the
something<00:02:20.700> some<00:02:21.300> problems<00:02:21.660> on<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.870> surface

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
something some problems on the surface

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.840 
something some problems on the surface
of<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.500> eye<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.860> increase<00:02:23.190> cataract<00:02:23.670> to

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
of the eye to increase cataract to

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.340 
of the eye to increase cataract to
increase<00:02:24.120> problems<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.750> retina<00:02:25.140> so

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
increase problems in the retina so

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.010 
increase problems in the retina so
wearing<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.190> good<00:02:26.460> pair<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:26.820> sunglasses<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.900> is

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
wearing a good pair of sunglasses it is

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.570 
wearing a good pair of sunglasses it is
extremely<00:02:28.620> important<00:02:28.980> especially<00:02:29.040> when<00:02:29.430> we

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
extremely important especially when we

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.520 
extremely important especially when we
are<00:02:29.700> stepping<00:02:29.940> out<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.570> there<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.290> bright

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
are stepping out and there is a bright

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.860 
are stepping out and there is a bright
sunlight<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.310> what<00:02:32.970> we<00:02:33.090> have<00:02:33.210> to<00:02:33.330> ensure<00:02:33.630> when

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
sunlight and what we have to ensure when

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.420 
sunlight and what we have to ensure when
we<00:02:33.990> say<00:02:34.170> sunglasses<00:02:34.740> is<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.100> there<00:02:35.310> is<00:02:35.400> a

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
we say sunglasses is that there is a

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.270 
we say sunglasses is that there is a
good<00:02:35.700> UV<00:02:36.150> protection<00:02:36.570> in<00:02:36.870> those<00:02:37.020> sunglasses

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
good UV protection in those sunglasses

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.950 
good UV protection in those sunglasses
just<00:02:38.280> anything<00:02:38.700> which<00:02:38.820> is<00:02:38.940> black<00:02:39.240> is<00:02:39.540> not<00:02:39.720> a

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
just anything which is black is not a

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.110 
just anything which is black is not a
good<00:02:40.200> sunglass<00:02:40.650> actually<00:02:41.340> in<00:02:41.400> fact<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.820> can<00:02:41.970> be

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
good sunglass actually in fact it can be

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.180 
good sunglass actually in fact it can be
more<00:02:42.300> harmful<00:02:42.600> because<00:02:43.530> when<00:02:43.680> we<00:02:43.860> are<00:02:43.890> wearing

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
more harmful because when we are wearing

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.160 
more harmful because when we are wearing
something<00:02:44.700> which<00:02:44.850> is<00:02:45.000> black<00:02:45.330> but<00:02:45.810> does<00:02:45.990> not

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
something which is black but does not

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.590 
something which is black but does not
have<00:02:46.230> UV<00:02:46.770> protection<00:02:46.940> can<00:02:47.940> actually<00:02:48.360> allow

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
have UV protection can actually allow

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.360 
have UV protection can actually allow
more<00:02:48.900> UV<00:02:49.290> light<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.650> enter<00:02:49.920> into<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.340> eye

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
more UV light to enter into the eye

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.730 
more UV light to enter into the eye
because<00:02:51.030> with<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.330> dark<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.870> pupils<00:02:52.350> dilate

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
because with the dark the pupils dilate

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.830 
because with the dark the pupils dilate
and<00:02:52.770> more<00:02:53.040> lights<00:02:53.280> enter<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.790> eye<00:02:53.820> so<00:02:54.660> that's

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
and more lights enter the eye so that's

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.090 
and more lights enter the eye so that's
why<00:02:54.960> it's<00:02:55.080> very<00:02:55.170> important<00:02:55.650> that<00:02:55.800> when<00:02:55.920> we<00:02:56.070> are

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
why it's very important that when we are

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.860 
why it's very important that when we are
burying<00:02:56.610> something<00:02:57.090> which<00:02:57.240> is<00:02:57.390> dark<00:02:57.660> like<00:02:57.840> a

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
burying something which is dark like a

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.930 
burying something which is dark like a
sunglass<00:02:58.410> there<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.800> enough<00:02:59.070> UV<00:02:59.430> protective

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
sunglass there is enough UV protective

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.780 
sunglass there is enough UV protective
covering<00:03:00.390> on<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.600> so<00:03:01.440> that<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.860> UV<00:03:02.460> light

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
covering on it so that the UV light

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.120 
covering on it so that the UV light
don't<00:03:03.180> enter<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.570> eye<00:03:03.690> at<00:03:04.020> all<00:03:04.230> when<00:03:04.860> we<00:03:05.040> are

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
don't enter the eye at all when we are

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.580 
don't enter the eye at all when we are
wearing<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.520> sunglasses
