were to nil Daniels and we went to the
San<00:01:48.090> Siro<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.750> was<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.049> massive<00:01:49.500> shot<00:01:49.740> they<00:01:49.890> beat

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
San Siro it was a massive shot they beat

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.490 
San Siro it was a massive shot they beat
us<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.369> nil<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.180> was<00:01:51.299> all<00:01:51.450> about<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:52.290> we

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
us to nil and it was all about can we

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.870 
us to nil and it was all about can we
turn<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.860> around<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.189> second<00:01:53.579> leg<00:01:53.670> at<00:01:53.790> that

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.490 
turn it around in the second leg at that
stage<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.360> think<00:01:54.540> in<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.689> Champions<00:01:55.079> League<00:01:55.170> in

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
stage I think in the Champions League in

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.560 
stage I think in the Champions League in
the<00:01:55.829> knockout<00:01:56.130> runs<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.729> had<00:01:57.090> never<00:01:57.270> been<00:01:57.420> done

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570

different<00:02:14.160> team<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.910> one<00:02:15.060> that<00:02:15.240> played

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
different team to the one that played

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.470 
different team to the one that played
last<00:02:16.680> match<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.400> that's<00:02:17.760> not<00:02:17.880> simply<00:02:18.270> because

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
last match and that's not simply because

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.880 
last match and that's not simply because
he's<00:02:18.600> admitting<00:02:18.870> his<00:02:18.959> mistake<00:02:18.990> that's<00:02:19.560> also

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
because those players that now had a lot

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.240 
because those players that now had a lot
longer<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.810> recover<00:02:22.080> from<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.890> hundred<00:02:23.160> and

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
longer to recover from the hundred and

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.500

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.810 
magical nights where everything comes
together<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:50.010> really<00:02:50.280> will<00:02:50.459> be<00:02:50.550> special

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
together and it really will be special

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.150 
together and it really will be special
if<00:02:51.090> we<00:02:51.150> can<00:02:51.330> pull<00:02:51.510> this<00:02:51.540> off<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.050> I<00:02:52.590> think<00:02:53.100> we

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
if we can pull this off and I think we

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.280 
if we can pull this off and I think we
can<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.610> really<00:02:54.540> do<00:02:54.690> believe<00:02:54.810> I'm<00:02:55.140> in<00:02:55.260> a

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
can I really do believe I'm in a

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.050 
can I really do believe I'm in a
straight<00:02:55.860> after<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.160> game<00:02:56.370> if<00:02:56.640> you'd<00:02:56.940> have

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
straight after the game if you'd have

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.940 
straight after the game if you'd have
asked<00:02:57.300> me<00:02:57.360> can<00:02:57.900> we<00:02:58.080> turn<00:02:58.230> this<00:02:58.380> around<00:02:58.560> I

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
asked me can we turn this around I

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.440 
asked me can we turn this around I
probably<00:02:59.340> would<00:02:59.550> have<00:02:59.610> said<00:02:59.790> have<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:00.269> not

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
look at it in the sense that it's going

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.270 
look at it in the sense that it's going
to<00:03:04.019> be<00:03:04.140> two<00:03:04.350> different<00:03:04.500> teams<00:03:04.890> it's<00:03:05.100> going<00:03:05.220> to

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
off a seven nil scoreline what I would

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.060 
off a seven nil scoreline what I would
say<00:05:13.810> though<00:05:13.990> is<00:05:14.020> if<00:05:14.350> we<00:05:14.470> can<00:05:14.560> get<00:05:14.680> that<00:05:14.800> goal

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070
