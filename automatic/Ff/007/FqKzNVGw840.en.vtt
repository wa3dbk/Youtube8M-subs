00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.789 
just it's this warm beautiful tone on
this<00:04:11.689> tritium<00:04:12.169> and<00:04:12.289> that's<00:04:12.409> that's<00:04:12.620> the

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
this tritium and that's that's the

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.509 
this tritium and that's that's the
newest<00:04:13.189> color<00:04:13.489> from<00:04:13.969> MB<00:04:14.780> micro<00:04:15.139> tip<00:04:15.289> so<00:04:15.949> you're

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
is and then here's the stadium for the

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.140 
is and then here's the stadium for the
deep<00:04:43.770> dish<00:04:43.950> you<00:04:44.160> can<00:04:44.280> see<00:04:44.460> just<00:04:44.610> how<00:04:44.730> deep<00:04:44.970> dish

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
deep dish you can see just how deep dish

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.820 
deep dish you can see just how deep dish
it<00:04:45.300> is<00:04:45.360> now<00:04:45.750> I<00:04:45.810> brought<00:04:46.110> this<00:04:46.320> one<00:04:46.530> this<00:04:46.650> way

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
it is now I brought this one this way

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.830 
it is now I brought this one this way
without<00:04:46.980> the<00:04:47.460> tubes<00:04:47.760> in<00:04:48.120> it<00:04:48.420> on<00:04:48.570> purpose

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840

because what I wanted to show is that
these<00:04:53.010> tubes<00:04:53.460> are<00:04:53.670> actually<00:04:54.060> all<00:04:54.270> hand

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
these tubes are actually all hand

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.930 
these tubes are actually all hand
applied<00:04:55.970> into<00:04:56.970> these<00:04:57.480> spaces<00:04:57.990> on<00:04:58.670> the<00:04:59.670> dial

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
applied into these spaces on the dial

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.630 
applied into these spaces on the dial
that's<00:05:00.450> there's<00:05:01.320> just<00:05:01.560> so<00:05:01.890> much<00:05:02.130> that<00:05:02.460> goes

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
that's there's just so much that goes

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.680 
that's there's just so much that goes
into<00:05:03.150> the<00:05:03.720> actual<00:05:04.880> assembly<00:05:05.880> of<00:05:06.360> these

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
into the actual assembly of these

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.350 
into the actual assembly of these
watches<00:05:07.290> you<00:05:07.650> know<00:05:07.740> and<00:05:07.980> and<00:05:08.430> when<00:05:08.460> I<00:05:08.610> say<00:05:09.000> hand
