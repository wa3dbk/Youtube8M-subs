00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.330
 Food makes a difference when taking advantage of work 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.129
 muscular 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:09.349
 we are what we eat 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.610
 you can not create muscle if you do not follow a balanced diet that contributes 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.960
 enough energy for exercise and healthy proteins to create the new 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:17.339
 muscle tissue 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:21.219
 achieving a protein-rich diet that combines health with diversity is the 

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:23.710
 big problem of sports dietetics 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.769
 the muscle is made up of proteins mainly 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.279
 but we should not fall into the typical mistake of the beginner who counts his 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.550
 proteins in the supermarket with protein foods such as meat or 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.300
 fish 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.340
 in the muscle diet the word protein is written with letters 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.270
 capital letters 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.270
 proteins form in the tissues and organs of living beings 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.640
 to build your muscles the proteins that take the food 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.180
 break down into small parts called amino acids that work like the 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.140
 pieces of a construction game 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.930
 When you do strength training the amino acids are sorted again 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.260
 new proteins that fill your muscles until they are visible 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.070
 that you can brag about them 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.480
 therefore to create muscle you do not only need to train with weights 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.690
 you also need to take enough proteins or essential amino acids 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.010
 how many proteins do you need 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.850
 this is one of the most controversial questions in the world of nutrition 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.380
 sports the human body does not have a protein reserve comparable to 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.620
 fat deposits 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.980
 the proteins of the tissues have a plastic function to form 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.330
 structures like muscles or form molecules like hemoglobin or the 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.580
 albumin of blood 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.880
 in general the western diet from 2,500 to three thousand calories a day 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.720
 usually exceeds the recommended amount of protein 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.280
 athletes need to increase their protein intake from the dose to 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.550
 a sedentary person who are 0 points 4 to 0 point 8 grams of protein 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.720
 by 1 points 6 to 1 point 8 grams per kilogram of body weight per day 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.060
 that in very intense training can reach 2 points 5 grams per 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.690
 kilograms of weight per day 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.690
 so a person weighing 70 kilograms should take about 112 to 126 grams of 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.750
 protein a day 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.530
 think that a meal with turkey breast of 200 grams that brings almost the 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.700
 half 48 point 2 grams 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.390
 with only two grams of fat 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.130
 and if you eat a rice salad with 150 grams of tuna you contribute another 42 grams 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.129
 of protein 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.540
 each glass of skimmed milk or fat-free milk that you drink daily 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.949
 contributes between 4 and 15 grams of protein 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:17.549
 There is not enough 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.769
 the intake of high amounts of protein more than 2 grams per 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.939
 kilograms of weight per day causes exhaustion of the liver and kidneys 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.909
 for the extra work involved in removing the remains of nitrogen and ammonium in the 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.709
 urinate these overloads 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.629
 They punish the body and can cause kidney damage 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.489
 liver and alterations in the nitrogen cycle 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.030
 anabolism against catabolism there are two key words to understand how 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:42.029
 it works the food in the musculature anabolism the catabolism 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:45.869
 the turnip is the paradise of the muscular sportsman 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:49.399
 in biochemistry, anabolism is the process of manufacturing tissues 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:53.279
 starting from food in our case is the process of creating new mass 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:54.039
 muscular 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:56.800
 the catabolism corresponds to the hell of every athlete 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.140
 is the reverse process to anabolism and occurs when there is a lack of energy and 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.850
 They break down tissues like muscle to supply nutrients to the blood 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.489
 in conclusion a good diet high in protein is a big factor 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.199
 importance to achieve success
