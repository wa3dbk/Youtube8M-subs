00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.910 
but there is no magical formula quite
frankly

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
frankly

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.950 
frankly
though<00:01:59.130> isn't<00:01:59.490> any<00:01:59.970> particular<00:02:00.659> player

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
though isn't any particular player

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.200 
though isn't any particular player
that's<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.710> number<00:02:02.009> one<00:02:02.400> that<00:02:02.640> we've<00:02:02.759> seen<00:02:03.030> in

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
that's a number one that we've seen in

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.530 
that's a number one that we've seen in
prior<00:02:04.080> years<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.710> stands<00:02:05.009> out<00:02:05.420> that's<00:02:06.420> a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
prior years that stands out that's a

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.410 
prior years that stands out that's a
given<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.259> i<00:02:07.530> think<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.819> position<00:02:09.119> that

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
given so i think that the position that

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.330 
given so i think that the position that
we<00:02:09.599> are<00:02:09.720> taking<00:02:09.989> with<00:02:10.349> our<00:02:10.530> number<00:02:10.950> one<00:02:11.130> and

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
we are taking with our number one and

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.220 
we are taking with our number one and
number<00:02:11.370> three<00:02:12.060> overall<00:02:12.239> pick<00:02:12.540> which<00:02:12.989> is<00:02:13.140> a

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
number three overall pick which is a

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.410 
number three overall pick which is a
great<00:02:13.470> position<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.950> be<00:02:14.160> in<00:02:14.190> it's<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.090> look<00:02:15.300> at

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
great position to be in it's to look at

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.080 
great position to be in it's to look at
the<00:02:15.510> talent<00:02:15.900> here<00:02:16.190> look<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.370> may<00:02:17.520> be<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.850> best

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
the talent here look it may be the best

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.830 
the talent here look it may be the best
overall<00:02:19.160> player<00:02:20.160> look<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:21.060> may<00:02:21.209> be<00:02:21.270> positioned

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
overall player look it may be positioned

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.290 
overall player look it may be positioned
specific<00:02:22.770> where<00:02:23.100> we<00:02:23.220> really<00:02:23.400> need<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.060> feel

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
specific where we really need to feel

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.790 
specific where we really need to feel
some<00:02:24.569> some<00:02:25.500> holes<00:02:26.160> within<00:02:26.550> our<00:02:26.790> own<00:02:27.120> team

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
some some holes within our own team

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.080 
some some holes within our own team
trade<00:02:28.800> options<00:02:29.040> are<00:02:29.370> always<00:02:29.700> are<00:02:30.030> always

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
trade options are always are always

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
trade options are always are always
there<00:02:31.370> so<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.400> think<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:33.000> we<00:02:33.720> do<00:02:33.870> our<00:02:33.989> due

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
there so I think that we do our due

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.620 
there so I think that we do our due
diligence<00:02:34.640> which<00:02:35.640> we've<00:02:35.819> done<00:02:36.030> already<00:02:36.269> prior

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
diligence which we've done already prior

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.330 
diligence which we've done already prior
to<00:02:36.660> this<00:02:36.930> one<00:02:37.170> here<00:02:37.350> I'm<00:02:37.530> very<00:02:37.560> familiar<00:02:38.010> with

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
to this one here I'm very familiar with

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.789 
to this one here I'm very familiar with
every<00:02:38.819> player<00:02:39.060> in<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.330> draft<00:02:39.540> I've<00:02:40.110> seen<00:02:40.410> most

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
every player in the draft I've seen most

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.949 
every player in the draft I've seen most
of<00:02:40.950> them<00:02:41.100> myself<00:02:41.610> which<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:42.239> very<00:02:42.450> important

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
of them myself which is very important

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.680 
of them myself which is very important
so<00:02:43.440> it's<00:02:43.560> not<00:02:43.709> just<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:43.980> snapshot<00:02:44.569> but<00:02:45.569> it's

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
so it's not just a snapshot but it's

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.270 
so it's not just a snapshot but it's
important<00:02:46.049> for<00:02:46.140> us<00:02:46.260> now<00:02:46.470> in<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:46.950> competitive
