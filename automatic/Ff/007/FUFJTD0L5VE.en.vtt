00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.139
 six and today is I know you can 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.509
 be happy to see two black pokémon 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.309
 here on the channel but unfortunately bring me 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.900
 a terrible news for you is the 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:22.020
 next there is today 7th of August I 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.810
 I decided to re-record pokémon black 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.920
 because I missed you and 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.420
 huh 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.359
 It's time to stop the concierge and 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.750
 to record soon, just like that, guys 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.700
 I switched computers in the mean time 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.260
 within the right episodes remembers that had 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.550
 basically stopped because the computer 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.600
 I was no longer able to run the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:46.379
 games I changed computer well fuck this 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.690
 And now I have the black pokémon and such. 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.000
 my half, I was afraid because 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.309
 I almost lost my save but let's go 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.610
 leaving another hd on we have one 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.250
 I do not know why the problem is 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.120
 Game well I 'm playing here, right? 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.899
 pressãozinha I run it ó there it hangs 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.000
 out of the blue 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.110
 now it is not the deviation is locking the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.790
 can see I'm moving here the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.619
 his or her settings is not tithe 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.590
 methanol an emulator to your state charge 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.390
 here and I realized that it only hangs 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.220
 your walk here for example does not hang 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.210
 now face a house for example 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.210
 Come in, you see, it's if I come here. 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.070
 here where it for rain I think I 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.990
 I remember that I remembered the city did 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.600
 so much time but if I'm not mistaken there 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.610
 Where will the rain stop here, sir? 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.560
 Here you are going to enter the forest. 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.450
 change scenery so every time he 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.630
 have to change the scene the game hangs 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.520
 because I did not know he did not catch the 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.560
 This comes into what it is when you enter. 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.119
 There he technically up a 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.470
 you're watching my mouse 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.720
 but if you are in an attack where you are 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.240
 But this plane here was supposed to be a 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.860
 plaquinha is the name of the place where I 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.420
 here is the case and the airport for example 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.240
 so every time I go change 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:09.720
 scenario he catches it is okay I believe 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.709
 or because I changed the way I 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.870
 computer 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.840
 maybe the settings 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:22.170
 I know vis I do not know what he has to 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:28.739
 to do but I think it 's always the same 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:30.450
 this is and why maybe you have to be 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.409
 through the computer server itself 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.379
 type save here and your download in this 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:39.480
 website here you have what happens there already 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.010
 bears caught and is neither and 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.599
 even if you find the Bible 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.299
 nothing the same game 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:50.910
 the rohm that is locking that can 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:53.069
 mean that he needs me 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.410
 has played the whole game realize that 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.390
 is missing is the game does not understand how 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.220
 I just came out of nowhere and understood 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.290
 that only has this fire is that on the plate 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.739
 lytha paulo understood the type I really 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.750
 fight like guys then the headquarters pokémon 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.799
 black 2 unfortunately will have to stay 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.260
 This is the way it is, it 's not my choice. 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.650
 I came to record for you, I know, you can swear. 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.430
 Fuck, I took too many registrations. 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.930
 but I tried it and old ones are 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.819
 seeing in Congo I 'm not doing anything 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.099
 loose walking here today not him 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:37.079
 simply finds you now have the following 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:39.660
 I want you to comment so it's for 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:43.290
 to compensate, you comment below 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:48.120
 Which Pokémon do you suggest I play? 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:51.419
 It is preferable if you have had the 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.010
 hands hard candy x would be better 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.760
 to me I can not challenge me 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.120
 tambourine 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.879
 but if you are a fan a background game is 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.690
 as the pokémon white platinum flowers drops 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:06.090
 and others who are the mayor by fans is 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.970
 one can also have been looking for such goes that 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.340
 I'll get people or something, and that 's all. 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.419
 pokémons can be less of course than 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.570
 3ds that oxeyeeo omega club of fire 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:21.349
 that will leave not even come out yet but 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.630
 if it's not the 3ds i can gravitate it 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:26.090
 so folks 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.920
 and then I promise I'll do a series 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.330
 game you choose a game was more 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:34.100
 voted is and to compensate because the 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.890
 pokémon black 2 and the last of the channel 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:40.430
 probably from Pokémon it 's just that as 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.380
 I will not make it so I did not comment that 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.990

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.150
 I swear to you that I will not fail you. 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.490
 because the black man I swore I would finish 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.250
 I was just sad that it was not 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.380

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.040
