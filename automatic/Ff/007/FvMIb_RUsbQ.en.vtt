00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 the first located on the same street 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.200
 here we have the back of the 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.630
 marrow and anterior 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.309
 in the previous part we have the future 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:17.130
 previous median 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.990
 the anterior lateral juices that are 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.029
 these depressions lines that took advantage of 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.170
 here on this right side 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:29.400
 later we have the juices 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:35.300
 posterior side of a medium juice 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.469
 posterior and intermediate juices 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.030
 posterior 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.980
 it is sissoko is to interconnect the later 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.390
 they are represented only in the marrow 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.739
 cervical in white matter to people 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.079
 have some friends 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.539
 previously we telephoned 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.600
 that are delimited by the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.030
 anterior medial cleft and juice 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.489
 anterior lateral 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:06.330
 of course we have the cute ones 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:10.439
 that are delimited by the super 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.409
 both anterior and posterior lateral 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.869
 and later we have the only 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.009
 which are delimited by the 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.439
 the middle ear and I was the 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.600
 better by posterior medial juice and 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.420
 by the south with the median and by the huc 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.409
 lateral posterior two single 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.820
 posterior 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.330
 Besides that 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.990
 is in the union part this film and 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.420
 posterior is divided in face with grace 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.970
 which is the most mediatic and fascicle 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.520
 cuneiform now in substance needs to 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.750
 I'm fine, we have the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.640
 previous plans 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.160
 those were the sides and even the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.229
 later plans being that the doors 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.590
 are represented only in the 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.300
 part makes with spine girl 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.210
 besides what we can see here 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:07.250
 with more property is the forest that the 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:12.440
 meningitis more due to the arac 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:16.770
 the sensitive gain the subarachnoid space 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.160
 through the bride and the ligature of this 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.160
 plan
