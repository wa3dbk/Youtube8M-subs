I'm<00:00:29.000> just<00:00:29.239> kind<00:00:29.419> of<00:00:29.480> go<00:00:29.630> down<00:00:29.660> a<00:00:29.869> road<00:00:30.110> real

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
I'm just kind of go down a road real

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.560 
I'm just kind of go down a road real
quick<00:00:30.590> right<00:00:30.800> here<00:00:30.860> we<00:00:31.669> have<00:00:31.790> the<00:00:31.910> radars<00:00:32.329> in

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
quick right here we have the radars in

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.020 
quick right here we have the radars in
wheel<00:00:32.810> this<00:00:33.410> wheel<00:00:33.860> pretty<00:00:34.250> much<00:00:34.430> has<00:00:34.610> 85

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
wheel this wheel pretty much has 85

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.690 
wheel this wheel pretty much has 85
hardness<00:00:35.780> on<00:00:35.930> it<00:00:36.079> with<00:00:36.290> a<00:00:36.320> 62<00:00:36.920> drummer<00:00:37.250> on<00:00:37.550> it

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
hardness on it with a 62 drummer on it

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.770 
hardness on it with a 62 drummer on it
the<00:00:38.270> system<00:00:38.600> is<00:00:38.750> a<00:00:38.780> 62<00:00:39.410> by<00:00:39.950> 85<00:00:40.489> and<00:00:40.850> the<00:00:41.540> heart

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
the system is a 62 by 85 and the heart

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.950 
the system is a 62 by 85 and the heart
the<00:00:41.960> 85<00:00:42.559> is<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.730> number<00:00:44.059> of<00:00:44.090> the<00:00:44.270> hardness<00:00:44.630> of

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
the 85 is the number of the hardness of

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.160 
the 85 is the number of the hardness of
the<00:00:45.470> wheel<00:00:45.740> so<00:00:46.460> this<00:00:46.880> wheel<00:00:47.150> pretty<00:00:47.660> much<00:00:47.960> can

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
the wheel so this wheel pretty much can

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.720 
the wheel so this wheel pretty much can
be<00:00:48.290> used<00:00:48.500> indoor<00:00:49.100> or<00:00:49.460> outdoor<00:00:50.090> okay<00:00:50.900> now<00:00:51.770> we

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
be used indoor or outdoor okay now we

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.110 
be used indoor or outdoor okay now we
have<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:53.420> shoe<00:00:53.780> grip<00:00:54.140> this<00:00:54.740> is<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.310> motion

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
have the shoe grip this is the motion

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.300 
have the shoe grip this is the motion
wheel<00:00:56.570> now<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:57.200> way<00:00:57.530> I<00:00:57.560> look<00:00:57.890> at<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:58.100> motion

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
wheel now the way I look at the motion

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.280 
wheel now the way I look at the motion
will<00:00:58.700> the<00:00:58.910> sort<00:00:59.180> of<00:00:59.270> like<00:00:59.420> the<00:00:59.600> New<00:00:59.750> Krypton

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
will the sort of like the New Krypton

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.140 
will the sort of like the New Krypton
Krypton<00:01:00.980> expen<00:01:01.400> around<00:01:01.670> for<00:01:01.850> a<00:01:01.910> very<00:01:02.030> long

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
Krypton expen around for a very long

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.370 
Krypton expen around for a very long
time<00:01:02.600> but<00:01:03.290> Krypton<00:01:03.800> extorted<00:01:04.309> making<00:01:04.670> or

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.380 
time but Krypton extorted making or

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.219 
time but Krypton extorted making or
wheels<00:01:06.380> that<00:01:07.189> we<00:01:07.369> use<00:01:07.579> for<00:01:07.790> outdoor<00:01:08.210> usage<00:01:08.689> now

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
wheels that we use for outdoor usage now

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.319 
wheels that we use for outdoor usage now
this<00:01:09.740> wheel<00:01:09.979> can<00:01:10.159> also<00:01:10.340> be<00:01:10.610> used<00:01:10.820> for<00:01:10.939> indoor

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
this wheel can also be used for indoor

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.960 
this wheel can also be used for indoor
as<00:01:11.509> well<00:01:11.540> but<00:01:12.409> then<00:01:12.619> again<00:01:12.770> it's<00:01:13.250> a<00:01:13.369> soft<00:01:13.670> wheel

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
as well but then again it's a soft wheel

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.300 
as well but then again it's a soft wheel
pretty<00:01:14.390> much<00:01:14.659> designed<00:01:15.110> for<00:01:15.590> outdoor

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
pretty much designed for outdoor

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.800 
pretty much designed for outdoor
rollerskating<00:01:17.860> we<00:01:18.860> have<00:01:19.010> the<00:01:19.159> brake<00:01:19.370> wheel

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
rollerskating we have the brake wheel

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.780 
rollerskating we have the brake wheel
it's<00:01:20.810> like<00:01:20.990> new<00:01:21.260> hardness<00:01:21.830> wheel<00:01:22.100> hardness

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
it's like new hardness wheel hardness

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.940 
it's like new hardness wheel hardness
and<00:01:23.390> this<00:01:23.690> wheel<00:01:23.930> right<00:01:23.960> here<00:01:24.260> is<00:01:24.560> one<00:01:24.770> of<00:01:24.860> the

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
and this wheel right here is one of the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.440 
and this wheel right here is one of the
new<00:01:25.100> wheels<00:01:25.400> that's<00:01:25.610> on<00:01:25.790> the<00:01:25.909> market<00:01:26.300> right

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
new wheels that's on the market right

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.560 
new wheels that's on the market right
now<00:01:26.510> and<00:01:26.690> it's<00:01:26.960> very<00:01:27.350> very<00:01:27.680> it's<00:01:28.580> used<00:01:29.000> a<00:01:29.479> lot

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
now and it's very very it's used a lot

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.100 
now and it's very very it's used a lot
in<00:01:29.900> roller<00:01:30.380> derby<00:01:30.500> and<00:01:31.010> a<00:01:31.820> lot<00:01:32.090> of<00:01:32.120> the<00:01:32.420> skaters

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
in roller derby and a lot of the skaters

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.410 
in roller derby and a lot of the skaters
use<00:01:33.290> it<00:01:33.470> for<00:01:33.799> different<00:01:34.040> reasons<00:01:34.670> some<00:01:35.180> like

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
use it for different reasons some like

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.270 
use it for different reasons some like
it<00:01:35.630> because<00:01:35.990> of<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.200> grips<00:01:36.620> I'm<00:01:37.070> using

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
it because of the grips I'm using

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.910 
it because of the grips I'm using
because<00:01:37.549> they're<00:01:37.940> jammers<00:01:38.540> so<00:01:39.260> on<00:01:39.409> and<00:01:39.560> so<00:01:39.740> on

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
because they're jammers so on and so on

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.550 
because they're jammers so on and so on
so<00:01:40.070> you<00:01:40.130> get<00:01:40.370> the<00:01:40.520> idea<00:01:40.580> that<00:01:41.240> each<00:01:41.810> wheel<00:01:42.140> has

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
so you get the idea that each wheel has

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.359 
so you get the idea that each wheel has
a<00:01:42.590> specific<00:01:43.520> purpose<00:01:44.320> we<00:01:45.320> have<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:45.530> GT<00:01:45.920> 50

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
a specific purpose we have the GT 50

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.760 
a specific purpose we have the GT 50
which<00:01:46.580> comes<00:01:46.820> off<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.180> rock<00:01:47.390> skate<00:01:47.780> well<00:01:48.470> this

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
which comes off the rock skate well this

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.800 
which comes off the rock skate well this
is<00:01:48.950> pretty<00:01:49.100> much<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.400> generally<00:01:50.000> used<00:01:50.479> wheel

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
is pretty much a generally used wheel

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.260 
is pretty much a generally used wheel
for<00:01:51.110> indoor<00:01:51.470> roller<00:01:51.680> skating<00:01:52.159> it<00:01:52.760> can<00:01:52.970> be<00:01:53.090> also

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
for indoor roller skating it can be also

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.660 
for indoor roller skating it can be also
used<00:01:53.479> for<00:01:53.720> Jam<00:01:54.140> skating<00:01:54.680> Jam<00:01:54.979> skating<00:01:55.490> is<00:01:55.640> a

skaters<00:02:00.860> use

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
skaters use

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.560 
skaters use
it's<00:02:01.840> a<00:02:01.960> wider<00:02:02.260> wheel<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:02.920> it<00:02:03.670> also<00:02:03.820> has<00:02:04.180> grip

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
it's a wider wheel and it also has grip

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.469 
it's a wider wheel and it also has grip
okay<00:02:05.350> so<00:02:05.950> this<00:02:06.580> is<00:02:06.790> like<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.270> jam<00:02:08.399> skating

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
okay so this is like the jam skating

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.120 
okay so this is like the jam skating
type<00:02:10.479> of<00:02:10.660> wheel<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:11.140> a<00:02:11.200> lot<00:02:11.410> of<00:02:11.560> stages<00:02:11.890> are

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
type of wheel that a lot of stages are

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.490 
type of wheel that a lot of stages are
using<00:02:12.490> out<00:02:12.610> there<00:02:12.820> today<00:02:13.290> we're<00:02:14.290> going<00:02:14.410> to

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
using out there today we're going to

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.110 
using out there today we're going to
jump<00:02:14.740> over<00:02:14.980> here<00:02:15.010> very<00:02:15.340> quickly<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.940> the

premier the full mag wheel this wheel

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.760 
premier the full mag wheel this wheel
has<00:02:18.610> been<00:02:18.640> around<00:02:19.000> forever<00:02:19.330> now<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:20.230> could<00:02:20.620> say

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
has been around forever now I could say

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.500 
has been around forever now I could say
a<00:02:20.800> lot<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.070> things<00:02:21.160> about<00:02:21.520> this<00:02:21.820> wheel<00:02:22.090> but<00:02:22.300> one

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
a lot of things about this wheel but one

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.510 
a lot of things about this wheel but one
of<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.720> things<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.110> is<00:02:23.260> very<00:02:23.530> used<00:02:23.860> for<00:02:24.250> is

of the things that is very used for is
used<00:02:24.760> for<00:02:25.000> a<00:02:25.060> lot<00:02:25.300> it's<00:02:25.840> for<00:02:26.140> sliding<00:02:26.770> a<00:02:26.920> lot<00:02:27.430> of

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
used for a lot it's for sliding a lot of

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.750 
used for a lot it's for sliding a lot of
skaters<00:02:27.880> in<00:02:28.030> different<00:02:28.480> styles<00:02:29.050> of<00:02:29.760> where

they skate in all over the United States
use<00:02:33.250> this<00:02:33.490> wheel<00:02:33.700> because<00:02:34.510> for<00:02:34.720> one<00:02:34.959> is<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.650> very

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
use this wheel because for one is a very

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.340 
use this wheel because for one is a very
hard<00:02:36.730> wheel<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.270> found<00:02:37.510> out<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:37.840> about<00:02:38.050> a

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
hard wheel I found out is about a

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.530 
hard wheel I found out is about a
hundred<00:02:38.709> hardness<00:02:39.430> on<00:02:39.850> this<00:02:40.120> wheel<00:02:40.300> so<00:02:40.510> you

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
hundred hardness on this wheel so you

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.600 
hundred hardness on this wheel so you
could<00:02:40.780> slide<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.560> see<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:41.890> lot<00:02:42.070> of<00:02:42.100> skaters

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
could slide so you see a lot of skaters

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.790 
could slide so you see a lot of skaters
using<00:02:42.940> this<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.300> slide<00:02:43.600> been<00:02:44.260> around<00:02:44.500> for<00:02:44.739> a

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
using this to slide been around for a

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.370 
using this to slide been around for a
very<00:02:44.830> long<00:02:45.220> time<00:02:45.250> but<00:02:46.180> again<00:02:46.720> it's<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.200> wheel

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
very long time but again it's the wheel

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.860 
very long time but again it's the wheel
of<00:02:47.560> choice<00:02:47.770> for<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.070> lot<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.340> skaters<00:02:48.600> I'm<00:02:49.600> going

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
of choice for a lot of skaters I'm going

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.600 
of choice for a lot of skaters I'm going
to<00:02:49.930> jump<00:02:50.050> over<00:02:50.320> here<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.800> crip<00:02:51.040> tonic<00:02:51.459> now

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
to jump over here to the crip tonic now

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.550 
to jump over here to the crip tonic now
krypton<00:02:52.120> it<00:02:52.300> goes<00:02:52.450> back<00:02:52.720> a<00:02:52.750> very<00:02:52.870> long<00:02:53.260> time

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
krypton it goes back a very long time

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.220 
krypton it goes back a very long time
the<00:02:54.220> crip<00:02:54.459> tonic<00:02:54.820> will<00:02:55.030> was<00:02:55.450> pretty<00:02:55.750> much<00:02:55.930> that

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
the crip tonic will was pretty much that

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.229 
the crip tonic will was pretty much that
got<00:02:56.470> this<00:02:56.650> whole<00:02:56.890> outdoors<00:02:57.340> thing<00:02:57.700> started

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
got this whole outdoors thing started

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.509 
got this whole outdoors thing started
because<00:02:58.420> of<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.320> softness<00:02:59.769> of<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.040> wheel<00:03:00.250> the

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
because of the softness of the wheel the

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.340 
because of the softness of the wheel the
shape<00:03:00.760> of<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.060> wheel<00:03:01.300> and<00:03:01.570> as<00:03:02.110> I<00:03:02.200> had

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
shape of the wheel and as I had

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.930 
shape of the wheel and as I had
mentioned<00:03:02.500> before<00:03:02.739> with<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.310> motion<00:03:03.730> wheel

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
mentioned before with the motion wheel

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.210 
mentioned before with the motion wheel
well<00:03:04.630> again<00:03:05.110> this<00:03:05.500> is<00:03:05.709> like<00:03:05.860> one<00:03:06.100> of<00:03:06.130> the

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
well again this is like one of the

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.250 
well again this is like one of the
original<00:03:06.790> wheels<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.239> I<00:03:07.360> start<00:03:07.720> skating<00:03:08.080> on

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
original wheels that I start skating on

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.320 
original wheels that I start skating on
back<00:03:08.530> in<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.769> early<00:03:09.070> 70s<00:03:09.610> and<00:03:09.670> this

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
back in the early 70s and this

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.710 
back in the early 70s and this
particular<00:03:10.690> world<00:03:11.049> is<00:03:11.170> 65<00:03:11.709> millimeter<00:03:12.250> wheel

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
particular world is 65 millimeter wheel

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.830 
particular world is 65 millimeter wheel
with<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.750> 80<00:03:14.019> with<00:03:14.290> us<00:03:14.500> 85<00:03:15.040> hardness<00:03:15.970> on<00:03:16.150> it<00:03:16.299> so

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
with the 80 with us 85 hardness on it so

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.140 
with the 80 with us 85 hardness on it so
again<00:03:16.959> it's<00:03:17.380> designed<00:03:17.560> for<00:03:18.040> outdoor<00:03:18.370> usage

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
again it's designed for outdoor usage

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.970 
again it's designed for outdoor usage
and<00:03:19.450> it<00:03:19.959> gives<00:03:20.110> you<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.260> little<00:03:20.440> bit<00:03:20.590> of<00:03:20.650> grip

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
and it gives you a little bit of grip

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.680 
and it gives you a little bit of grip
and<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.549> wideness<00:03:22.030> give<00:03:22.239> you<00:03:22.360> a<00:03:22.390> little<00:03:22.510> bit

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
and the wideness give you a little bit

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.830 
and the wideness give you a little bit
more<00:03:22.870> stability<00:03:24.180> we're<00:03:25.180> going<00:03:25.329> to<00:03:25.390> jump<00:03:25.630> over

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
more stability we're going to jump over

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.780 
more stability we're going to jump over
here<00:03:25.900> real<00:03:26.200> quickly<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.829> a<00:03:26.860> roller<00:03:27.190> ball<00:03:27.430> wheel

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
here real quickly to a roller ball wheel

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.150 
here real quickly to a roller ball wheel
this<00:03:28.090> is<00:03:28.239> a<00:03:28.269> sixty<00:03:28.810> to<00:03:28.989> ninety<00:03:29.019> seven<00:03:29.769> hardness

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
this is a sixty to ninety seven hardness

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.729 
this is a sixty to ninety seven hardness
wheel<00:03:30.400> this<00:03:30.970> is<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.299> wheel<00:03:31.480> that<00:03:31.510> I<00:03:31.750> use<00:03:32.110> and

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
wheel this is the wheel that I use and

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.020 
wheel this is the wheel that I use and
the<00:03:32.860> reason<00:03:33.130> why<00:03:33.250> I<00:03:33.280> use<00:03:33.400> this<00:03:33.850> particular

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
the reason why I use this particular

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.449 
the reason why I use this particular
wheel<00:03:34.510> especially<00:03:34.690> for<00:03:35.110> indoor<00:03:35.500> skating<00:03:35.890> is

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
wheel especially for indoor skating is

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.430 
wheel especially for indoor skating is
because<00:03:36.880> it<00:03:37.060> gives<00:03:37.299> me<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.480> grip<00:03:37.930> and<00:03:38.079> the

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
because it gives me the grip and the

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.500 
because it gives me the grip and the
control<00:03:38.890> that<00:03:39.190> I<00:03:39.340> like<00:03:39.670> to<00:03:39.820> use<00:03:40.000> when<00:03:40.329> I'm

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
control that I like to use when I'm

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.390 
control that I like to use when I'm
inside<00:03:40.900> skating<00:03:41.440> around<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.769> floor<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.070> even

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
inside skating around the floor and even

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.699 
inside skating around the floor and even
dance<00:03:42.790> so<00:03:43.510> it's<00:03:43.540> not<00:03:43.780> as<00:03:43.959> hard<00:03:43.989> as<00:03:44.380> some<00:03:44.530> of<00:03:44.620> the

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
dance so it's not as hard as some of the

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.470 
dance so it's not as hard as some of the
wheels<00:03:44.950> but<00:03:45.280> yet<00:03:45.549> it's<00:03:46.060> one<00:03:46.299> of<00:03:46.390> those

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
wheels but yet it's one of those

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.300 
wheels but yet it's one of those
particularly<00:03:47.079> especially<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:47.829> hardness

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
particularly especially the hardness

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.160 
particularly especially the hardness
that<00:03:48.940> will<00:03:49.120> give<00:03:49.269> you<00:03:49.360> the<00:03:49.450> control<00:03:49.780> pretty

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
that will give you the control pretty

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.009 
that will give you the control pretty
much<00:03:50.350> on<00:03:50.500> any<00:03:50.680> type<00:03:51.070> of<00:03:51.100> surface<00:03:51.630> this<00:03:52.630> is<00:03:52.690> one

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
much on any type of surface this is one

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.660 
much on any type of surface this is one
of<00:03:53.140> my<00:03:53.290> most<00:03:53.530> highly<00:03:53.950> recommended<00:03:54.100> wheels

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
of my most highly recommended wheels

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.759 
of my most highly recommended wheels
just<00:03:55.030> because<00:03:55.329> of<00:03:55.450> their<00:03:55.570> very<00:03:55.750> reason<00:03:56.230> so<00:03:56.410> you

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
just because of their very reason so you

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.289 
just because of their very reason so you
don't<00:03:57.010> have<00:03:57.100> to<00:03:57.190> jump<00:03:57.430> around<00:03:57.730> using<00:03:57.910> a<00:03:58.090> lot<00:03:58.269> of

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
don't have to jump around using a lot of

00:03:58.299 --> 00:03:59.880 
don't have to jump around using a lot of
different<00:03:58.480> wheels<00:03:58.870> but<00:03:59.140> it<00:03:59.260> works<00:03:59.470> on<00:03:59.650> all

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
different wheels but it works on all

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.310 
different wheels but it works on all
different<00:04:00.220> surfaces<00:04:00.820> even<00:04:01.570> a<00:04:01.690> super<00:04:02.049> smooth

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
different surfaces even a super smooth

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.100 
different surfaces even a super smooth
concrete<00:04:02.620> which<00:04:03.130> I<00:04:03.310> even<00:04:03.400> use<00:04:03.790> mine<00:04:04.090> on<00:04:04.120> so

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
concrete which I even use mine on so

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.310 
concrete which I even use mine on so
again<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:06.610> the<00:04:07.299> roller<00:04:07.510> ball<00:04:07.720> it's<00:04:07.900> very<00:04:08.140> good

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
again the the roller ball it's very good

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.130 
again the the roller ball it's very good
wheel

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
wheel

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.570 
wheel
jump<00:04:10.140> over<00:04:10.290> here<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.950> twisted<00:04:11.400> wheel

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
jump over here to the twisted wheel

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.540 
jump over here to the twisted wheel
again<00:04:12.240> this<00:04:12.510> is<00:04:12.660> sort<00:04:12.990> of<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:13.200> wheel<00:04:13.410> that<00:04:13.550> a

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
again this is sort of the wheel that a

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.340 
again this is sort of the wheel that a
wheel<00:04:15.000> that<00:04:15.210> a<00:04:15.240> lot<00:04:15.510> of<00:04:15.660> state<00:04:15.840> is<00:04:15.990> used<00:04:16.200> for

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
wheel that a lot of state is used for

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.580 
wheel that a lot of state is used for
Jam<00:04:16.620> skating<00:04:17.130> that's<00:04:17.640> why<00:04:17.940> it<00:04:18.900> has<00:04:19.110> to<00:04:19.350> look

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
Jam skating that's why it has to look

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.009 
Jam skating that's why it has to look
and<00:04:20.250> keep<00:04:20.459> in<00:04:20.640> mind<00:04:20.850> a<00:04:21.060> lot<00:04:21.180> of<00:04:21.390> these<00:04:21.630> wheels

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
and keep in mind a lot of these wheels

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.660 
and keep in mind a lot of these wheels
that<00:04:22.260> you<00:04:22.440> see<00:04:22.710> especially<00:04:23.190> with<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.430> same

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
that you see especially with the same

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.090 
that you see especially with the same
size<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.270> same<00:04:24.450> durometer<00:04:24.930> zhan<00:04:25.200> them<00:04:25.350> well

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
size the same durometer zhan them well

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.710 
size the same durometer zhan them well
they're<00:04:26.610> used<00:04:26.850> pretty<00:04:27.060> much<00:04:27.240> for<00:04:27.420> the<00:04:27.510> same

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
they're used pretty much for the same

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.060 
they're used pretty much for the same
thing<00:04:28.020> but<00:04:28.590> again<00:04:28.920> reason<00:04:29.580> why<00:04:29.700> people<00:04:30.410> go<00:04:31.410> and

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
thing but again reason why people go and

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.380 
thing but again reason why people go and
try<00:04:32.310> all<00:04:32.370> these<00:04:32.550> different<00:04:32.610> wheels<00:04:33.030> because

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
try all these different wheels because

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.870 
try all these different wheels because
some<00:04:33.870> wheels<00:04:34.230> just<00:04:34.440> fit<00:04:34.680> their<00:04:34.860> taste<00:04:35.190> it

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
some wheels just fit their taste it

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.690 
some wheels just fit their taste it
could<00:04:36.060> be<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.330> color<00:04:36.660> it<00:04:37.290> could<00:04:37.470> just<00:04:37.650> be<00:04:37.920> just

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
could be the color it could just be just

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.490 
could be the color it could just be just
the<00:04:38.820> way<00:04:38.970> it's<00:04:39.150> designed<00:04:39.330> this<00:04:40.140> particular

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
the way it's designed this particular

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.050 
the way it's designed this particular
one<00:04:41.100> has<00:04:41.340> has<00:04:42.330> like<00:04:42.570> not<00:04:42.840> a<00:04:42.870> rivet<00:04:43.320> but<00:04:43.590> it<00:04:44.340> has

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
one has has like not a rivet but it has

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.940 
one has has like not a rivet but it has
some<00:04:45.630> grip<00:04:45.960> all<00:04:46.200> the<00:04:46.320> way<00:04:46.440> through<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:46.800> wheel

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
some grip all the way through the wheel

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.840 
some grip all the way through the wheel
some<00:04:47.370> have<00:04:47.640> a<00:04:48.050> original<00:04:49.050> car<00:04:49.770> tire<00:04:50.040> to<00:04:50.640> give

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
some have a original car tire to give

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.130 
some have a original car tire to give
you<00:04:50.940> that<00:04:51.150> traction<00:04:51.510> when<00:04:51.870> you're<00:04:51.990> going

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
you that traction when you're going

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.660 
you that traction when you're going
around<00:04:52.470> the<00:04:52.620> floor<00:04:52.860> that's<00:04:53.460> why<00:04:53.610> this

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
around the floor that's why this

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.870 
around the floor that's why this
particular<00:04:54.180> wheel<00:04:54.600> is<00:04:55.410> very<00:04:55.560> good<00:04:56.010> so<00:04:56.220> again

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
particular wheel is very good so again

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.070 
particular wheel is very good so again
you<00:04:57.180> look<00:04:57.300> at<00:04:57.420> all<00:04:57.600> these<00:04:57.720> some<00:04:57.900> of<00:04:57.930> these

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
you look at all these some of these

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.440 
you look at all these some of these
different<00:04:58.470> wheels<00:04:58.680> same<00:04:59.550> size<00:04:59.910> just<00:04:59.940> a

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
different wheels same size just a

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.900 
different wheels same size just a
different<00:05:00.810> color<00:05:01.020> but<00:05:01.710> for<00:05:01.920> the<00:05:02.010> same<00:05:02.250> usages

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
different color but for the same usages

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.460 
different color but for the same usages
so<00:05:03.840> when<00:05:04.560> you're<00:05:04.770> deciding<00:05:05.190> on<00:05:05.670> a<00:05:05.730> wheel<00:05:06.470> think

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
so when you're deciding on a wheel think

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.290 
so when you're deciding on a wheel think
about<00:05:07.770> what<00:05:08.280> it<00:05:08.400> is<00:05:08.430> that<00:05:08.790> you're<00:05:08.970> going<00:05:09.120> to<00:05:09.180> be

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
about what it is that you're going to be

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.510 
about what it is that you're going to be
doing<00:05:09.510> right<00:05:09.990> you'll<00:05:10.170> be<00:05:10.290> skating<00:05:10.500> indoor<00:05:11.040> are

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
doing right you'll be skating indoor are

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.250 
doing right you'll be skating indoor are
you<00:05:11.700> going<00:05:11.820> to<00:05:11.880> be<00:05:11.940> skating<00:05:12.210> outdoor<00:05:12.870> or<00:05:13.200> are

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
you going to be skating outdoor or are

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.870 
you going to be skating outdoor or are
you<00:05:13.320> going<00:05:13.410> to<00:05:13.470> be<00:05:13.560> doing<00:05:13.740> artistic<00:05:14.400> skating

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
you going to be doing artistic skating

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.060 
you going to be doing artistic skating
or<00:05:15.090> you're<00:05:15.630> just<00:05:15.660> going<00:05:15.960> to<00:05:16.110> or<00:05:16.380> particular

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
or you're just going to or particular

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.800 
or you're just going to or particular
style<00:05:17.400> of<00:05:17.550> skating<00:05:17.940> and<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.150> state<00:05:18.450> that<00:05:18.480> you

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
style of skating and the state that you

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.190 
style of skating and the state that you
live<00:05:18.990> in<00:05:19.050> for<00:05:19.650> sliding<00:05:20.190> so<00:05:20.790> on<00:05:20.970> so<00:05:21.210> do<00:05:21.900> a<00:05:21.960> little

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
live in for sliding so on so do a little

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.100 
live in for sliding so on so do a little
bit<00:05:22.320> of<00:05:22.350> research<00:05:22.860> and<00:05:23.180> that<00:05:24.180> way<00:05:24.480> it<00:05:24.900> would

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
bit of research and that way it would

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.600 
bit of research and that way it would
help<00:05:25.350> you<00:05:25.470> decide<00:05:25.830> what's<00:05:26.130> going<00:05:26.280> to<00:05:26.340> be<00:05:26.490> the

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
help you decide what's going to be the
