and the silver and the white variants
very<00:02:08.070> soon<00:02:09.080> they<00:02:10.080> said<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.350> one<00:02:10.560> of<00:02:10.649> time<00:02:10.860> is

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
very soon they said this one of time is

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:18.950 
very soon they said this one of time is
aqua<00:02:11.310> blue<00:02:11.520> from<00:02:12.180> all<00:02:12.330> angles<00:02:12.570> for<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:17.960> so

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
aqua blue from all angles for you so

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.130 
aqua blue from all angles for you so
these<00:02:19.140> are<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.440> tilt<00:02:19.710> angles<00:02:20.130> as<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.340> can<00:02:20.550> see

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
these are the tilt angles as you can see

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.090 
these are the tilt angles as you can see
tilt<00:02:22.140> angles<00:02:22.440> are<00:02:22.500> not<00:02:22.620> all<00:02:22.740> that<00:02:22.860> great

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
tilt angles are not all that great

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.130 
tilt angles are not all that great
actually

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
actually

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.900 
actually

should not be a problem actually but

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.529 
should not be a problem actually but
this<00:06:04.340> is<00:06:04.580> come<00:06:04.819> up<00:06:04.880> as<00:06:05.000> a<00:06:05.029> requirement<00:06:05.509> that

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539 
this is come up as a requirement that

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:07.510 
this is come up as a requirement that
many<00:06:05.840> people<00:06:05.990> will<00:06:06.289> watch<00:06:06.529> the<00:06:06.710> video<00:06:06.860> so

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
many people will watch the video so

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.890 
many people will watch the video so
they're<00:06:07.669> showing<00:06:07.849> you<00:06:08.090> this<00:06:08.240> particular<00:06:08.659> part

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
they're showing you this particular part

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.680 
they're showing you this particular part
also<00:06:09.430> so<00:06:10.430> need<00:06:10.729> not<00:06:10.849> worry<00:06:11.029> about<00:06:11.090> this<00:06:11.419> aspect

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
also so need not worry about this aspect

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.350 
also so need not worry about this aspect
anyways<00:06:12.319> because<00:06:12.979> the<00:06:13.400> laptop<00:06:13.729> has<00:06:13.880> got<00:06:14.090> space

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
anyways because the laptop has got space

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.290 
anyways because the laptop has got space
between<00:06:14.750> the<00:06:15.319> LCD<00:06:15.650> screen<00:06:15.710> and<00:06:16.159> the<00:06:16.490> base<00:06:16.639> so

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
between the LCD screen and the base so

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.670 
between the LCD screen and the base so
that<00:06:17.509> that<00:06:17.840> space<00:06:18.050> is<00:06:18.259> going<00:06:18.440> to<00:06:18.500> be<00:06:18.560> there<00:06:20.680> the

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
that that space is going to be there the

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.680 
that that space is going to be there the
base<00:06:21.860> is<00:06:22.039> also<00:06:22.340> fantastic<00:06:22.550> actually<00:06:23.120> as<00:06:23.569> you

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
base is also fantastic actually as you

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.939 
base is also fantastic actually as you
can<00:06:23.840> see<00:06:25.539> the<00:06:26.539> entire<00:06:26.779> part<00:06:27.110> here<00:06:27.349> looks<00:06:27.650> the

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:27.949 
can see the entire part here looks the

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:30.129 
can see the entire part here looks the
same<00:06:28.400> blue<00:06:28.759> that<00:06:28.969> is<00:06:29.090> there<00:06:29.300> all<00:06:29.479> over<00:06:29.719> but<00:06:29.960> the

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:30.139 
same blue that is there all over but the

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:31.870 
same blue that is there all over but the
best<00:06:30.289> part<00:06:30.500> is<00:06:30.710> the<00:06:30.949> amount<00:06:31.400> of<00:06:31.580> heat<00:06:31.759> is

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
best part is the amount of heat is

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.140 
best part is the amount of heat is

the differential in the rudders that

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:37.120 
the differential in the rudders that
they<00:06:36.529> have<00:06:36.710> here

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
they have here

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.790 
they have here
the<00:06:37.310> red<00:06:37.460> up<00:06:37.550> here<00:06:37.580> is<00:06:38.050> higher<00:06:39.050> than<00:06:39.349> this

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
the red up here is higher than this

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.320 
the red up here is higher than this
rudder<00:06:40.039> so<00:06:40.310> relieved<00:06:40.639> a<00:06:40.729> differential<00:06:41.210> when

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330 
rudder so relieved a differential when

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.100 
rudder so relieved a differential when
you<00:06:41.389> are<00:06:41.449> putting<00:06:41.659> it<00:06:41.840> and
