00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello to begin with, we need to take 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.440
 normal and laser pointer which I 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:14.389
 bought for thirty rubles store hunting 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.389
 fishing and now and and begin to disassemble 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:24.720
 unscrew the top cover remove 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:35.239
 batteries and now we take out the top 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:45.360
 the cover is not very easy to pull out 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:48.450
 after we pulled her out 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:57.360
 yourself we need internals here 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:01:00.149
 this here is the part of it is the lens for 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.390
 we take this pliers and disconnect 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.870
 this part is from the case with microchips and 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.870
 buttons 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:12.030
 we need to unscrew the plastic 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:18.479
 stub from this detail and then the lens 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:21.450
 easy to get so now clamp it 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.920
 pliers and begin to unscrew 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:29.000
 plastic plug with a screwdriver first 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.619
 on unscrews hard it is already easier and 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.820
 so here it is almost twisted 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.820
 just a little bit left 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.860
 so here I pulled this plastic 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:51.770
 plug buy out the lens jumped out and 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.770
 spring we need this here's a lens 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:01.690
 so here it looks like this every 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.290
 laser pointer there is such here 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.290
 lens 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.819
 now take a piece of wire 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.819
 coated with polymer 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.970
 let's go round our lease to her and I'll twist 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.970
 fix 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:38.080
 so you can attach this lens 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:41.650
 to the phone's body so we will align everything to 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.420
 we have a lens exactly fit the body and 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.420
 here we have such a thing 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.599
 now take the phone 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.400
 we put a lens on the lens 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:21.300
 bend the wire a bit and podneg 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:36.690
 so we have it more tightly pressed 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:39.090
 we fix the phone case here 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.709
 now the lens is tight to the body 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:48.590
 phone and fixed now take 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:53.400
 ordinary lamp and remove the cover 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:55.470
 we will need it for highlighting if 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.800
 backlit phone then this is nothing 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.959
 it will not be necessary now take the glass 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.540
 the wand I took from the locker in 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.540
 bathroom, I put on two columns 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:15.810
 now take a bill for example 500 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:21.030
 rubles and start looking at it already under 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:24.410
 the microscope will see immediately small 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.410
 the details of this bill 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.020
 that is, you can even 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:35.610
 check it for authenticity 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.140
 take another bill and also 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.140
 Consider small details 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.840
 now take a leaf from some 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.590
 indoor plants such as in 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:08.770
 in this case from the ficus and see 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:11.400
 leaf structure under the microscope mentioning 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.110
 something school biology lessons 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.510
 Well, now you can collect yourself 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.190
 imagine such a microscope on this all
