modified<00:00:09.750> fast<00:00:10.110> these<00:00:11.099> are<00:00:11.250> things<00:00:11.460> that<00:00:11.610> I

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
modified fast these are things that I

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.950 
modified fast these are things that I
might<00:00:12.090> actually<00:00:12.389> continue<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.280> use<00:00:14.809> once<00:00:15.809> I

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
might actually continue to use once I

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.820 
might actually continue to use once I
get<00:00:16.460> to<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.490> point<00:00:17.699> where<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:17.970> feel<00:00:18.300> satisfied

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
get to a point where I feel satisfied

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.460 
get to a point where I feel satisfied
that<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:20.100> new<00:00:20.460> protocol<00:00:21.060> has<00:00:21.600> gotten<00:00:22.080> me<00:00:22.199> to

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
that this new protocol has gotten me to

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.400 
that this new protocol has gotten me to
where<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.920> want<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.130> be<00:00:23.220> weight<00:00:23.400> wise<00:00:23.580> oh<00:00:24.140> he<00:00:25.140> had

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
where I want to be weight wise oh he had

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.509 
where I want to be weight wise oh he had
a<00:00:25.439> lot<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.619> these<00:00:25.710> things<00:00:25.890> have<00:00:26.010> been<00:00:26.189> inspired

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
a lot of these things have been inspired

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.910 
a lot of these things have been inspired
by<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.789> lot<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.029> reading<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.660> I've<00:00:27.750> done<00:00:27.960> and

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
by a lot of reading that I've done and

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.919 
by a lot of reading that I've done and
the<00:00:29.000> velocity<00:00:30.000> diet<00:00:30.210> was<00:00:30.539> probably<00:00:30.810> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
the velocity diet was probably the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.740 
the velocity diet was probably the
biggest<00:00:31.080> inspiration<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:32.640> think<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.570> have

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
biggest inspiration I think I have

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.069 
biggest inspiration I think I have
trouble<00:00:34.110> following<00:00:34.559> strict<00:00:35.870> protocols<00:00:36.870> of

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
trouble following strict protocols of

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.780 
trouble following strict protocols of
others<00:00:37.320> about<00:00:37.680> wine<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.920> like<00:00:38.190> pulling<00:00:38.550> pieces

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
others about wine I like pulling pieces

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.690 
others about wine I like pulling pieces
of<00:00:39.090> things<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.510> like<00:00:39.809> experimenting<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.860> I've

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
of things in like experimenting and I've

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.819 
of things in like experimenting and I've
found<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:43.710> kind<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.460> create<00:00:45.210> hybrid

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
found that I kind of create hybrid

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.119 
found that I kind of create hybrid
protocols<00:00:46.829> on<00:00:47.660> weight<00:00:48.660> loss<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.260> I've<00:00:49.710> gotten

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
protocols on weight loss and I've gotten

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.979 
protocols on weight loss and I've gotten
a<00:00:50.190> really<00:00:50.370> good<00:00:50.550> response<00:00:50.850> at<00:00:51.539> least<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.840> feel

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
a really good response at least I feel

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.610 
a really good response at least I feel
from<00:00:52.350> from<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.879> particular<00:00:54.620> modification

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
from from this particular modification

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.470 
from from this particular modification
of<00:00:56.190> pulling<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.789> different<00:00:57.120> things

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
of pulling in different things

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.860 
of pulling in different things
and<00:00:58.010> one<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> things<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.329> felt<00:01:00.780> was

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
and one of the things that I felt was

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.179 
and one of the things that I felt was
important<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.829> I've<00:01:01.980> read<00:01:02.750> from

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
important in that I've read from

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.460 
important in that I've read from
people's<00:01:05.189> reactions<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.240> proteins<00:01:07.229> pre

modified<00:01:07.979> fasts<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:09.780> low<00:01:10.049> energy<00:01:10.080> levels

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
modified fasts is the low energy levels

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.700 
modified fasts is the low energy levels
because<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.250> lack<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.460> carbs<00:01:12.380> obviously<00:01:13.380> but

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
because of lack of carbs obviously but

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.800 
because of lack of carbs obviously but
we<00:01:13.860> know<00:01:14.010> from<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:15.090> scientific<00:01:15.659> literature

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
we know from the scientific literature

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.870 
we know from the scientific literature
if<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.290> follow<00:01:16.560> sort<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.950> things<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.630> your

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
if you follow sort of things is your

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.170 
if you follow sort of things is your
muscle<00:01:20.880> store<00:01:21.150> glycogen<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.820> glycogen<00:01:23.820> comes

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.440 
muscle store glycogen and glycogen comes
from<00:01:24.390> cars<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.140> if<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.369> are<00:01:26.549> low<00:01:26.759> carbing<00:01:27.270> it

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450

about 65 grams of carbs a day and those

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
carbs are complex are coming from things

such as the other way protein that I

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.570 
such as the other way protein that I
have<00:02:27.750> is<00:02:27.930> probably<00:02:28.200> from<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.380> lactose<00:02:28.830> which

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
have is probably from the lactose which

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.580 
have is probably from the lactose which
I<00:02:29.670> believe<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.330> disaccharide<00:02:31.080> has<00:02:31.410> two

news so and enough said about that but
so<00:02:50.430> I've<00:02:51.060> read<00:02:51.330> that<00:02:51.600> incorporating<00:02:52.350> a

it's<00:03:03.239> supposed<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.480> really<00:03:03.630> help<00:03:05.030> with<00:03:06.030> muscle

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
it's supposed to really help with muscle

reload<00:04:39.410> and<00:04:39.800> get<00:04:39.889> the<00:04:39.980> camera<00:04:40.550> good<00:04:40.730> there

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
reload and get the camera good there

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.420 
reload and get the camera good there
it's<00:04:41.750> the<00:04:41.960> reload<00:04:42.350> and<00:04:42.710> what<00:04:42.919> it<00:04:43.010> is<00:04:43.160> it's<00:04:43.340> a

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
it's the reload and what it is it's a

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.210 
it's the reload and what it is it's a
little<00:04:43.669> packet<00:04:46.870> it's<00:04:47.870> a<00:04:47.990> drink<00:04:48.350> you<00:04:48.740> mix<00:04:49.010> it

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
little packet it's a drink you mix it

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.830 
little packet it's a drink you mix it
and<00:04:50.560> it's<00:04:51.560> great<00:04:51.770> it's<00:04:51.980> a<00:04:52.100> cherry<00:04:52.669> flavor<00:04:53.090> and

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
and it's great it's a cherry flavor and

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.190 
and it's great it's a cherry flavor and
let<00:04:54.410> me<00:04:54.500> tell<00:04:54.680> you<00:04:54.740> what's<00:04:54.889> in<00:04:55.070> it<00:04:55.510> it's<00:04:56.510> 35

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
let me tell you what's in it it's 35

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.190 
let me tell you what's in it it's 35
calories<00:04:57.500> so<00:04:58.040> it's<00:04:58.160> pretty<00:04:58.340> low<00:04:58.820> calorie<00:04:59.240> has

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
calories so it's pretty low calorie has

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.530 
calories so it's pretty low calorie has
5<00:05:00.530> grams<00:05:00.560> of<00:05:01.130> carbs<00:05:01.580> so<00:05:01.669> there<00:05:01.790> are<00:05:01.910> carbs<00:05:02.419> in

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
5 grams of carbs so there are carbs in

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
5 grams of carbs so there are carbs in
here<00:05:02.750> and<00:05:02.840> I'll<00:05:02.930> explain<00:05:02.960> to<00:05:03.290> you<00:05:03.380> where<00:05:03.470> the

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
here and I'll explain to you where the

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.540 
here and I'll explain to you where the
cars<00:05:03.800> are<00:05:03.980> coming<00:05:04.010> from

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
cars are coming from

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.640 
cars are coming from
of<00:05:04.940> course<00:05:05.690> that's<00:05:05.810> got<00:05:06.020> your<00:05:06.230> creatine

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
of course that's got your creatine

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.420 
of course that's got your creatine
monohydrate<00:05:07.580> took<00:05:08.330> at<00:05:08.419> 2<00:05:08.630> grams<00:05:08.960> and<00:05:09.440> it's<00:05:10.250> got

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
monohydrate took at 2 grams and it's got

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.370 
monohydrate took at 2 grams and it's got
glutamine<00:05:10.850> 2<00:05:11.210> grams<00:05:11.540> and<00:05:11.930> there<00:05:12.140> is<00:05:12.230> some

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
glutamine 2 grams and there is some

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.130 
glutamine 2 grams and there is some
calcium<00:05:12.980> in<00:05:13.130> here<00:05:13.310> which<00:05:13.460> I<00:05:13.580> think<00:05:13.940> if<00:05:14.810> I<00:05:14.960> can

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
calcium in here which I think if I can

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.990 
calcium in here which I think if I can
remember<00:05:15.410> the<00:05:15.620> calcium<00:05:16.070> helps<00:05:16.280> the

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
remember the calcium helps the

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.719 
remember the calcium helps the
absorption<00:05:17.090> of<00:05:17.720> the<00:05:17.810> creatine<00:05:18.520> and<00:05:19.520> there's

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
absorption of the creatine and there's

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:22.030 
absorption of the creatine and there's
some<00:05:19.850> touring<00:05:20.240> in<00:05:20.390> there<00:05:20.570> too<00:05:20.780> so<00:05:21.020> it's<00:05:21.950> a

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
some touring in there too so it's a

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.250 
some touring in there too so it's a
little<00:05:22.430> bit<00:05:22.520> of<00:05:22.640> an<00:05:22.729> energy<00:05:23.419> supplement<00:05:24.080> I

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
little bit of an energy supplement I

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.469 
little bit of an energy supplement I
know<00:05:25.220> with<00:05:25.460> the<00:05:25.550> taurine<00:05:25.940> that's<00:05:26.180> something

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
know with the taurine that's something

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.990 
know with the taurine that's something
that's<00:05:26.630> included<00:05:27.050> in<00:05:27.139> the<00:05:27.200> Red<00:05:27.350> Bull<00:05:27.880> now<00:05:28.880> I'm

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
that's included in the Red Bull now I'm

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.670 
that's included in the Red Bull now I'm
definitely<00:05:29.150> expert<00:05:29.870> do<00:05:29.990> a<00:05:30.020> lot<00:05:30.229> of<00:05:30.260> reading

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
definitely expert do a lot of reading

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.370 
definitely expert do a lot of reading
but<00:05:31.220> I<00:05:32.030> definitely<00:05:32.510> know<00:05:32.840> the<00:05:33.080> Torrey<00:05:33.320> I

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
but I definitely know the Torrey I

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.300 
but I definitely know the Torrey I
believe<00:05:33.680> is<00:05:33.770> an<00:05:33.890> amino<00:05:34.070> acid<00:05:35.410> the<00:05:36.410> carbs<00:05:37.070> this

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
believe is an amino acid the carbs this

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.610 
believe is an amino acid the carbs this
come<00:05:37.550> from<00:05:37.580> Malta<00:05:38.210> dextra<00:05:38.660> which<00:05:39.229> have<00:05:39.440> done<00:05:39.590> a

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
lot of research on post-workout carbs

be to add a new one in the morning I'd

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:24.159 
be to add a new one in the morning I'd
dump<00:06:22.190> it<00:06:22.340> right<00:06:22.370> in<00:06:22.610> my<00:06:22.640> shake<00:06:22.970> which<00:06:23.750> is<00:06:23.900> birds

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:24.169 
dump it right in my shake which is birds

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:27.760 
dump it right in my shake which is birds
like<00:06:24.320> a<00:06:24.350> cheery<00:06:24.680> vanilla<00:06:25.190> type<00:06:26.380> shake<00:06:27.380> once<00:06:27.650> I

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
like a cheery vanilla type shake once I

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.490 
like a cheery vanilla type shake once I
I<00:06:27.979> mix<00:06:28.280> it<00:06:28.400> up<00:06:28.600> with<00:06:29.600> the<00:06:29.660> Chia<00:06:29.990> see<00:06:30.229> which<00:06:30.380> is
