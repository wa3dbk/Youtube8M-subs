00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
with some magical deal which I don't

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.070 
with some magical deal which I don't
think<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.550> going<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.849> happen<00:02:11.879> any<00:02:12.420> time<00:02:12.660> in<00:02:13.020> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
think is going to happen any time in the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.430 
think is going to happen any time in the
next

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
next

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.860

five<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.800> six<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.220> seven<00:02:14.520> years<00:02:14.850> it's<00:02:15.630> just

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
five to six to seven years it's just

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.700 
five to six to seven years it's just
it's<00:02:16.050> just<00:02:16.140> not<00:02:16.320> going<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.470> happen<00:02:16.530> because

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
it's just not going to happen because

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.230 
it's just not going to happen because
the<00:02:16.950> financial<00:02:17.340> realities<00:02:17.670> don't<00:02:17.880> make<00:02:18.000> sense

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
the financial realities don't make sense

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.970 
the financial realities don't make sense
for<00:02:18.360> either<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.810> parties<00:02:18.960> schnepf<00:02:19.770> you

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
for either of the parties schnepf you

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.800 
for either of the parties schnepf you
got<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.130> different<00:02:20.460> opinion<00:02:20.940> on<00:02:21.150> this<00:02:21.270> yeah<00:02:21.780> i

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
got a different opinion on this yeah i

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.960

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.910 
way eventually it'll happen and this is
the<00:02:26.490> only<00:02:26.610> way<00:02:26.880> would<00:02:27.120> happen<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.810> if<00:02:28.380> the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
the only way would happen is a if the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.680 
the only way would happen is a if the

crossover yeah I think that's the way to
do<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.280> like<00:02:59.430> eat<00:03:00.030> all<00:03:00.240> the<00:03:00.390> students<00:03:00.720> have

do it is like eat all the students have

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.200 
do it is like eat all the students have

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
let the Hulk make a quick appearance and

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
universe I think that's the way to do it

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.479 
universe I think that's the way to do it
and<00:03:26.970> you<00:03:27.810> better<00:03:28.080> do<00:03:28.320> it<00:03:28.350> it's<00:03:29.070> on<00:03:29.190> yeah<00:03:29.459> I

magnet<00:03:30.060> erina<00:03:30.360> I<00:03:30.390> don't<00:03:30.630> think<00:03:30.810> that'll

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
magnet erina I don't think that'll

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.110 
magnet erina I don't think that'll
happen<00:03:31.080> either<00:03:31.530> I<00:03:31.860> mean<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:32.220> agree<00:03:32.610> with<00:03:32.970> Chef

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
happen either I mean I agree with Chef

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.430 
happen either I mean I agree with Chef
that<00:03:33.180> that's<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.570> only<00:03:33.810> way<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:33.989> could<00:03:34.260> happen

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
that that's the only way it could happen

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.530 
that that's the only way it could happen
but<00:03:35.310> I<00:03:35.370> also<00:03:35.550> don't<00:03:35.760> believe<00:03:35.940> it'll<00:03:36.300> happen

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
but I also don't believe it'll happen
