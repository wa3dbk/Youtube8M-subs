00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
figured that Roadrunner accounts do not

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.240 
figured that Roadrunner accounts do not
work<00:01:59.890> yet<00:02:00.190> with<00:02:00.700> this<00:02:01.120> new<00:02:01.480> application<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:03.070> if

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
work yet with this new application so if

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.420 
work yet with this new application so if
you<00:02:03.370> have<00:02:03.580> a<00:02:03.610> roadrunner<00:02:04.000> which<00:02:04.690> is<00:02:04.870> a

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
you have a roadrunner which is a

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.460 
you have a roadrunner which is a
time-worn<00:02:06.430> email<00:02:07.060> address<00:02:07.390> you<00:02:07.960> will<00:02:08.170> not<00:02:08.289> be

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
time-worn email address you will not be

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.350 
time-worn email address you will not be
able<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.709> sync<00:02:09.009> it<00:02:09.129> with<00:02:09.429> this<00:02:09.700> account<00:02:10.149> as<00:02:10.330> of

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
able to sync it with this account as of

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.559 
able to sync it with this account as of
right<00:02:10.629> now<00:02:10.690> not<00:02:11.140> today<00:02:11.290> is<00:02:11.650> December<00:02:12.129> 7th<00:02:12.569> 2012

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
right now not today is December 7th 2012

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.360 
right now not today is December 7th 2012
now<00:02:13.989> this<00:02:14.230> could<00:02:14.439> change<00:02:14.650> so<00:02:14.980> if<00:02:15.040> I<00:02:15.159> make<00:02:15.310> a

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
now this could change so if I make a

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.830 
now this could change so if I make a
video<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.879> it's<00:02:16.030> updating<00:02:16.480> people<00:02:16.689> who<00:02:16.749> are

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
video and it's updating people who are

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.510 
video and it's updating people who are
just<00:02:17.109> no<00:02:17.290> true<00:02:17.590> well

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
just no true well

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.270 
just no true well
as<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:18.820> today<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.710> checked<00:02:20.710> this<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.220> they

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
as of today I checked this and they

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.520 
as of today I checked this and they
would<00:02:21.430> not<00:02:21.610> let<00:02:21.880> us<00:02:22.060> sink<00:02:22.690> in<00:02:22.930> account<00:02:23.320> that

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
would not let us sink in account that

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.920 
would not let us sink in account that
was<00:02:23.710> a<00:02:23.740> road<00:02:24.010> worker<00:02:24.190> Council<00:02:24.880> these<00:02:25.450> are<00:02:25.720> the

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.750 
nice it works well but normally it only
goes<00:03:53.170> back<00:03:53.200> up<00:03:53.800> to<00:03:54.010> two<00:03:54.220> weeks

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
goes back up to two weeks

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.260 
goes back up to two weeks
so<00:03:54.970> if<00:03:55.480> you<00:03:55.690> have<00:03:55.840> emails<00:03:56.290> that<00:03:56.770> are<00:03:57.120> they<00:03:58.120> have

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
been in like for example your draft so

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.340 
been in like for example your draft so
your<00:04:00.640> sent<00:04:00.940> mail<00:04:01.120> or<00:04:01.330> deleted<00:04:01.690> items<00:04:01.990> for<00:04:02.170> more

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.540 
than two weeks you may not see it in
here<00:04:04.209> because<00:04:04.690> this<00:04:04.959> isn't<00:04:05.170> optimized<00:04:06.040> to

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
here because this isn't optimized to

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.910 
here because this isn't optimized to
