00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello youtube friends how are you waiting 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.839
 Well today I bring you a video of what 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.450
 what I think of the anime without jet and nokia gym 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.000
 this video is also an analysis to this 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.590
 anime so it will contain singh spoilers 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.719
 equinoxes and not the attack of the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.180
 titans is a generation series in 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.279
 created by a moans and is called the manga of 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.230
 this series was very successful with few 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.080
 chapters and figure in the tenth place 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.390
 of the most viewed sleeves of 2011 at 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.939
 just as it is to save online it had many 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.070
 successes at the beginning this series came out 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.469
 on the air on April 7, 2013 in 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.870
 mainichi broadcasting system directed 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.000
 by solar text here I found out about this 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.160
 series was by a facebook friend who 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.870
 he also has an account on youtube 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.969
 He passed the opening of this series to 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.070
 principle did not surprise me much later 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.660
 one day I had the subtlety to see this 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.180
 anime already had five chapters 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.250
 I remember it was a Friday when I saw 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.440
 only two chapters a series I loved 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.629
 so much until I saw the three chapters 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.699
 that I was missing this express series 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.859
 many feelings since I almost cry 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.809
 when they kill eren's mother it was a 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.670
 a time of horror that I will never forget a 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.870
 epic moment in this anime 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.910
 the story is fucked 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.070
 magnificent although I have not seen the boss 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.990
 for me this series is one of those with which 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.300
 I look at the first two chapters and already 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.580
 I want to see more like in the case of anime 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.010
 of the lhotse although this did not appear in the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.780
 first tops that I know can be said 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.180
 that this is the is to save online from 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.430
 2013 but there are things that makes 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.230
 Animes of great success get out of your post 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.180
 such as fanaticism and 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.220
 overrated that they do so as well 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.290
 dragon ball z but watching the side 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.360
 positive of the series its animation and 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.460
 soundtrack are very good and their plot 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.260
 It's very epic but what I do not like 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.570
 This anime is much horror and 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.910
 gore although there are many people who like 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.830
 see a lot of blood in the anime but that 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.900
 it's something I can not stand to see so much 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.730
 short good age coming back with the 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.920
 details of the anime the scenarios and 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.530
 characters are well designed and a 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.750
 dubbing well done apparently this anime 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.670
 seems to promise a lot I hope it continues 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.110
 how it goes and not the streets where the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.630
 story unfolds in the future 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.700
 fictionally based on age 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.380
 media 'in which humanity was almost 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.840
 exterminated with the sudden appearance 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.810
 of humanoid beings known as 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.270
 Titans Huge- sized creatures with 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.980
 shape 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.160
 human and seemingly little intelligence 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.590
 that humans eat because of the size of 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.630
 the titans that go from 3 to 15 meters of 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.730
 height humanity was devoured without 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.770
 contemplation notwithstanding a group 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.720
 reduced of humans could survive 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.330
 inside a huge area of ​​land 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.610
 walled protected by walls of 50 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.620
 meters of height triple the height 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.350
 of the highest registered giants 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.020
 until the date of its construction 107 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.370
 years later, humanity lives 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.140
 peacefully within the walls and 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.570
 has not witnessed attacks by 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.180
 of the Titans during all that time 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.310
 until one day the young Eren haier and 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.500
 his adoptive sister my ackermann house 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.480
 witness as a titan as tall as 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.850
 the wall itself that is known 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.280
 later as colossal titan makes 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.540
 suddenly his appearance making a 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.880
 opening in one of the walls 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.800
 outside of the city what allows 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.350
 the entrance of a large group of titans 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.360
 of smaller size both young people see with 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.820
 horror as his mother is devoured alive 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.070
 for one of them after having survived 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.500
 to the attack eren swears to eliminate all 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.400
 titans in revenge for the death of his 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.620
 mother 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.989
 how exciting this series is and what 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.849
 causes curiosity on a personal level is how 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.010
 they are going to stop the titans some beings 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.890
 so big that they surpass the human being 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.720
 ordinary in strength speed agility and 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.519
 besides that the titans can be 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.620
 regenerate from any attack that they give 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.689
 but its weak point lies in the 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.180
 nape where from a sword to the titans 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:42.010
 does not give them time to regenerate what 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.349
 unique that differentiates humans from 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.510
 the titans is your intelligence and parts 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.480
 breeders since we do not even know about 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.849
 where they come from or where they come from 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.769
 great of this anime is very original and 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.989
 that I know there are not many animes that 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.569
 put titans or giants in their series 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.579
 well, the video is running out if 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.590
 are you going to share ideas please do it from 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.109
 civilized way and not criticizing that 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.269
 that does not get us anywhere 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.639
 Well, I highly recommend this series and 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.470
 I do not tell them anymore, see it to see who 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:14.109
 will win titans or humans 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:18.329
 Well that's it for this video 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.329
 your friend catón 220 says goodbye
