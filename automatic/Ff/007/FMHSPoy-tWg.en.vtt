00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
archetype that I you

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.230 
archetype that I you
normally<00:01:09.689> use<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.350> break<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.490> down<00:01:11.790> when<00:01:12.210> I

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
normally use to break this down when I

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.190 
normally use to break this down when I
talk<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.689> people<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.979> nest<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.990> always<00:01:15.990> say

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
talk to people is the nest I always say

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.310 
talk to people is the nest I always say
if<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.439> can<00:01:16.590> understand<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.250> nest<00:01:18.200> then<00:01:19.200> you

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
if you can understand the nest then you

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.460 
if you can understand the nest then you
can<00:01:19.470> understand<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.979> female<00:01:20.340> nature<00:01:20.640> I

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
can understand a female nature I

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.249 
can understand a female nature I
remember<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> long<00:01:22.740> time<00:01:23.009> ago<00:01:23.600> maybe<00:01:24.600> about<00:01:24.780> 30

between<00:01:33.960> men<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.650> women<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.299> men<00:01:37.259> do<00:01:37.530> not

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
between men and women is that men do not

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.609
