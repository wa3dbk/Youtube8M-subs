00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.330 

and<00:01:15.230> we'll<00:01:15.350> want<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.740> thread<00:01:16.580> it<00:01:16.730> in<00:01:16.880> lightly

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
and we'll want to thread it in lightly

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.320 
and we'll want to thread it in lightly
making<00:01:19.340> sure<00:01:19.520> that<00:01:19.700> it's<00:01:19.850> not<00:01:20.030> cross

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
making sure that it's not cross

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.680 
making sure that it's not cross

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
tightening down on the screw you will

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.760 
tightening down on the screw you will
notice<00:01:30.500> that<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.890> entire<00:01:31.690> bar<00:01:32.690> end<00:01:32.930> along

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
notice that the entire bar end along

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.000 
notice that the entire bar end along
with<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.250> anchor<00:01:34.430> is<00:01:34.850> moving<00:01:35.450> so<00:01:36.200> we<00:01:36.860> will

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
with the anchor is moving so we will

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.000 
with the anchor is moving so we will
need<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:37.280> do<00:01:37.430> is<00:01:37.640> grab<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.000> bar<00:01:38.420> in<00:01:38.570> here<00:01:38.900> and

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.160 

bottom<00:01:43.010> out<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.250> screw<00:01:43.660> will<00:01:44.660> go<00:01:44.780> over<00:01:44.990> to<00:01:45.020> the

bottom out the screw will go over to the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:56.170 
bottom out the screw will go over to the
other<00:01:45.350> side<00:01:54.370> and<00:01:55.370> just<00:01:55.430> repeat<00:01:55.910> the<00:01:56.030> procedure
