need to do various tests in order to get

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.899 
need to do various tests in order to get
to<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.450> bottom<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.020> okay<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.670> first

thing I want to say is it may be that
every<00:02:05.579> single<00:02:05.759> test

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
every single test

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.130 
every single test
do<00:02:06.500> is<00:02:06.770> normal<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:07.370> tomorrow<00:02:07.970> when<00:02:08.810> we<00:02:08.899> look

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
do is normal and tomorrow when we look

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.200 
do is normal and tomorrow when we look
at<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.350> baby<00:02:09.590> we<00:02:10.340> can<00:02:10.520> say<00:02:10.700> oh<00:02:10.729> this<00:02:11.150> is

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
at the baby we can say oh this is

at the baby we can say oh this is
clearly<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:12.230> know<00:02:12.350> this<00:02:12.530> is<00:02:12.650> looking<00:02:12.920> much

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
clearly you know this is looking much

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.890 
clearly you know this is looking much
more<00:02:13.280> like<00:02:13.460> a<00:02:13.490> boy<00:02:13.790> or<00:02:14.090> much<00:02:14.270> more<00:02:14.480> like<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.660> girl

more like a boy or much more like a girl

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.840 
more like a boy or much more like a girl
and<00:02:15.440> we<00:02:15.590> store<00:02:15.860> that<00:02:15.980> this<00:02:16.160> test<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.640> reassure

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
and we store that this test to reassure

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.880 
and we store that this test to reassure
us<00:02:17.060> perfectly<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:18.110> might<00:02:18.380> be<00:02:18.560> that<00:02:18.710> there's

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
us perfectly it might be that there's

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.450 
us perfectly it might be that there's
nothing<00:02:19.340> wrong<00:02:19.520> at<00:02:19.820> all<00:02:20.110> okay<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:22.010> test<00:02:22.250> that

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
nothing wrong at all okay the test that

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.090 
nothing wrong at all okay the test that
we<00:02:22.610> do<00:02:22.940> is<00:02:23.390> we'll<00:02:23.690> do<00:02:23.900> some<00:02:24.110> tests<00:02:24.620> looking<00:02:24.980> at

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
we do is we'll do some tests looking at

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.150 
we do is we'll do some tests looking at
the<00:02:25.190> baby's<00:02:25.550> genes<00:02:26.170> so<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.230> see<00:02:27.680> whether<00:02:27.920> the

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
the baby's genes so to see whether the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.150 
the baby's genes so to see whether the
genes<00:02:28.490> are<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:28.970> genes<00:02:29.240> of<00:02:29.600> a<00:02:30.050> baby<00:02:30.320> girl<00:02:30.740> or<00:02:31.100> a

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
genes are the genes of a baby girl or a

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.270 
genes are the genes of a baby girl or a
baby<00:02:31.490> boy<00:02:32.170> that's<00:02:33.170> one<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.710> tests<00:02:34.220> that

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
baby boy that's one of the tests that

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.240 
baby boy that's one of the tests that
will<00:02:34.610> do<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:35.420> then<00:02:35.900> we'll<00:02:36.380> also<00:02:36.560> do<00:02:36.950> some

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
will do and then we'll also do some

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.290 
will do and then we'll also do some
other<00:02:37.640> blood<00:02:38.030> tests<00:02:38.630> looking<00:02:39.200> at<00:02:39.410> some<00:02:39.590> other

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
other blood tests looking at some other

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.490 
other blood tests looking at some other
salt<00:02:41.300> levels<00:02:41.720> in<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:41.930> blood<00:02:42.140> because<00:02:42.380> they

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
salt levels in the blood because they

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.050 
salt levels in the blood because they
can<00:02:42.709> sometimes<00:02:42.950> be<00:02:43.420> abnormal<00:02:44.709> okay<00:02:45.709> you<00:02:46.670> say

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
can sometimes be abnormal okay you say

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.440 
can sometimes be abnormal okay you say
gene<00:02:48.020> gene<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.680> us<00:02:48.740> does<00:02:49.520> that<00:02:49.550> mean<00:02:50.030> it's<00:02:50.150> our

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
gene gene to us does that mean it's our

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.920 
gene gene to us does that mean it's our
fault<00:02:51.370> it's<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:52.459> very<00:02:52.700> good<00:02:52.850> question<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.600> no

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
fault it's a very good question and no

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.800 
fault it's a very good question and no
it<00:02:54.260> definitely<00:02:54.410> isn't<00:02:54.980> your<00:02:55.310> fault<00:02:55.580> okay<00:02:56.360> the

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
it definitely isn't your fault okay the

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.990 
it definitely isn't your fault okay the
the<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.910> commonest<00:02:59.140> cause<00:03:00.550> for<00:03:01.550> us<00:03:01.670> seeing

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
the the commonest cause for us seeing

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.600 
the the commonest cause for us seeing
this<00:03:02.300> although<00:03:02.690> is<00:03:02.930> very<00:03:03.200> uncommon<00:03:03.800> the

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
this although is very uncommon the

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.260 
this although is very uncommon the
Communist<00:03:05.090> cause<00:03:05.360> is<00:03:05.720> a<00:03:05.780> hormone<00:03:06.650> problem

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
Communist cause is a hormone problem

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.610 
Communist cause is a hormone problem
which<00:03:08.270> we<00:03:08.540> can<00:03:08.870> pick<00:03:09.830> up<00:03:09.860> on<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.640> blood<00:03:10.850> test

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
which we can pick up on the blood test

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.660 
which we can pick up on the blood test
okay<00:03:12.620> so<00:03:12.680> that's<00:03:13.010> why<00:03:13.160> you<00:03:13.220> want<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.550> do<00:03:13.640> a

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
okay so that's why you want to do a

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.670 
okay so that's why you want to do a
blood<00:03:13.940> test<00:03:13.970> it's<00:03:14.600> something<00:03:14.900> can<00:03:15.050> manage<00:03:15.380> or

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
blood test it's something can manage or

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.550 
blood test it's something can manage or
is<00:03:15.890> it<00:03:16.010> something<00:03:16.160> in<00:03:16.280> life<00:03:16.459> wrong<00:03:16.790> I<00:03:17.090> mean<00:03:17.560> III

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
is it something in life wrong I mean III

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.320 
is it something in life wrong I mean III
can<00:03:19.010> understand<00:03:19.340> you've<00:03:19.550> got<00:03:19.580> lots<00:03:19.970> of

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
can understand you've got lots of

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.180 
can understand you've got lots of
questions<00:03:20.480> and<00:03:21.110> it's<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:21.560> time<00:03:22.010> of<00:03:22.040> great

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
questions and it's a time of great

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.530 
questions and it's a time of great
uncertainty<00:03:22.489> and<00:03:23.590> what<00:03:24.590> we<00:03:24.799> can<00:03:25.010> do<00:03:25.250> is<00:03:25.700> we

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
uncertainty and what we can do is we

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.150 
uncertainty and what we can do is we
don't<00:03:26.720> know<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:27.410> I<00:03:27.500> don't<00:03:27.530> want<00:03:27.860> to<00:03:27.950> start

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
don't know and I don't want to start

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.430 
don't know and I don't want to start
talking<00:03:28.730> in<00:03:28.820> great<00:03:29.090> detail<00:03:29.690> about<00:03:29.959> the

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
talking in great detail about the

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.259 
talking in great detail about the
different<00:03:30.950> possibilities<00:03:31.700> until<00:03:31.940> we<00:03:32.150> know

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
different possibilities until we know

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.170 
different possibilities until we know
what<00:03:32.480> it<00:03:32.600> is<00:03:32.630> so<00:03:33.280> what<00:03:34.280> we're<00:03:34.430> going<00:03:34.549> to<00:03:34.610> do<00:03:34.850> is

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
what it is so what we're going to do is

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.449 
what it is so what we're going to do is
we're<00:03:35.420> going<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.630> do<00:03:35.810> two<00:03:36.440> tests<00:03:37.100> in<00:03:37.220> the

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
we're going to do two tests in the

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.789 
we're going to do two tests in the
immediate<00:03:37.940> term<00:03:38.180> and<00:03:38.510> that's<00:03:38.660> to<00:03:38.900> see<00:03:39.110> whether

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
immediate term and that's to see whether

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.070 
immediate term and that's to see whether
the<00:03:40.430> baby<00:03:40.640> is<00:03:40.790> on<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.209> phone<00:03:41.390> as<00:03:41.540> owners<00:03:41.870> of<00:03:41.900> a

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
the baby is on the phone as owners of a

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.960 
the baby is on the phone as owners of a
boy<00:03:42.290> your<00:03:42.650> chromosomes<00:03:43.250> of<00:03:43.430> a<00:03:43.489> girl<00:03:43.700> that's

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970

girl okay so we know what their genetic

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.410 
girl okay so we know what their genetic
makeup<00:03:48.260> is<00:03:48.680> yeah<00:03:49.160> and<00:03:49.730> we'll<00:03:49.910> do<00:03:50.030> this<00:03:50.150> other

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
makeup is yeah and we'll do this other

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.330 
makeup is yeah and we'll do this other
test<00:03:50.750> looking<00:03:51.049> for<00:03:51.290> this<00:03:51.410> hormone<00:03:51.860> problem

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
test looking for this hormone problem

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.070 
test looking for this hormone problem
and<00:03:53.060> they<00:03:53.209> will<00:03:53.330> give<00:03:53.480> us<00:03:53.570> a<00:03:53.690> lot<00:03:53.959> of

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
and they will give us a lot of

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.410 
and they will give us a lot of
information<00:03:54.440> in<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:55.070> first<00:03:55.310> instance<00:03:55.940> and

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
information in the first instance and

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.560 
information in the first instance and
then<00:03:57.080> we<00:03:57.739> will<00:03:57.890> take<00:03:58.070> it<00:03:58.130> from<00:03:58.400> there<00:03:58.570> thinking

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
then we will take it from there thinking

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.630 
then we will take it from there thinking
about<00:03:59.630> you<00:04:00.110> know<00:04:00.260> what<00:04:00.560> if<00:04:00.860> anything<00:04:01.190> we<00:04:01.489> need

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
about you know what if anything we need

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.350 
about you know what if anything we need
to<00:04:01.760> do<00:04:01.970> so<00:04:02.870> as<00:04:02.989> I<00:04:03.110> say<00:04:03.380> it<00:04:03.590> may<00:04:03.830> be<00:04:04.060> that<00:04:05.060> your

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
to do so as I say it may be that your

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.560 
to do so as I say it may be that your
baby's<00:04:05.720> totally<00:04:06.170> normal<00:04:06.620> okay<00:04:06.910> if<00:04:07.910> they<00:04:08.330> have

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
baby's totally normal okay if they have

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.150 
baby's totally normal okay if they have
one<00:04:08.840> of<00:04:08.989> these<00:04:09.110> hormone<00:04:09.620> problems

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
one of these hormone problems

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.860 
one of these hormone problems
that's<00:04:10.310> something<00:04:10.700> that<00:04:10.820> we<00:04:10.940> can<00:04:11.120> treat<00:04:11.420> very

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
that's something that we can treat very

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.310 
that's something that we can treat very
easily<00:04:13.030> so<00:04:14.030> so<00:04:14.540> what<00:04:14.720> were<00:04:14.840> you<00:04:14.960> going<00:04:15.110> to<00:04:15.170> do

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
easily so so what were you going to do

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.290 
easily so so what were you going to do
now<00:04:15.740> because<00:04:15.980> you<00:04:16.370> know<00:04:16.400> our<00:04:16.640> relatives<00:04:17.120> keep

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:17.300 
now because you know our relatives keep

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.789 
now because you know our relatives keep
coming<00:04:17.600> in<00:04:17.750> and<00:04:17.959> they're<00:04:18.050> like<00:04:18.170> what's<00:04:18.440> what's

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
coming in and they're like what's what's

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.009 
coming in and they're like what's what's
his<00:04:19.040> name<00:04:19.370> so<00:04:19.820> I<00:04:19.850> think<00:04:20.030> the<00:04:20.390> best<00:04:20.690> way<00:04:20.989> to

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
his name so I think the best way to

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.980 
his name so I think the best way to
approach<00:04:21.440> it<00:04:21.500> is<00:04:21.830> to<00:04:21.860> just<00:04:22.280> say<00:04:22.990> sometimes

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
approach it is to just say sometimes

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.220 
approach it is to just say sometimes
it's<00:04:24.770> not<00:04:24.950> clear<00:04:25.370> and<00:04:25.700> it<00:04:26.390> may<00:04:26.540> become<00:04:26.900> clear

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
it's not clear and it may become clear

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.930 
it's not clear and it may become clear
and<00:04:27.350> they're<00:04:27.560> just<00:04:27.710> going<00:04:27.920> to<00:04:27.980> do<00:04:28.130> some<00:04:28.340> tests

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
and they're just going to do some tests

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.330 
and they're just going to do some tests
and<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:29.780> tests<00:04:30.020> going<00:04:30.200> to<00:04:30.260> hurt<00:04:30.380> the<00:04:30.560> baby<00:04:30.680> so

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
and the tests going to hurt the baby so

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.830 
and the tests going to hurt the baby so
the<00:04:31.670> tests<00:04:31.940> that<00:04:32.030> we're<00:04:32.210> going<00:04:32.360> to<00:04:32.450> do<00:04:32.630> in<00:04:32.780> the

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
the tests that we're going to do in the

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.660 
the tests that we're going to do in the
first<00:04:33.080> instance<00:04:33.500> of<00:04:33.530> blood<00:04:33.800> tests<00:04:34.340> so<00:04:34.460> that's

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
first instance of blood tests so that's

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.910 
first instance of blood tests so that's
just<00:04:34.970> you<00:04:35.360> know<00:04:35.390> a<00:04:35.540> prick<00:04:35.990> with<00:04:36.200> a<00:04:36.230> needle<00:04:36.650> and

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
just you know a prick with a needle and

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.830 
just you know a prick with a needle and
babies<00:04:37.340> of<00:04:37.460> this<00:04:37.610> age<00:04:37.790> are<00:04:38.030> normally<00:04:38.570> bothered

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
babies of this age are normally bothered

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.550 
babies of this age are normally bothered
by<00:04:39.020> blood<00:04:39.290> tests<00:04:39.800> and<00:04:40.040> then<00:04:41.020> after<00:04:42.020> that<00:04:42.230> we

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
by blood tests and then after that we

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.650 
by blood tests and then after that we
might<00:04:42.800> go<00:04:43.040> on<00:04:43.070> in<00:04:43.640> the<00:04:43.730> next<00:04:43.880> few<00:04:44.060> days<00:04:44.330> to<00:04:44.510> do

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
might go on in the next few days to do

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.030 
might go on in the next few days to do
some<00:04:44.840> more<00:04:45.020> tests<00:04:45.320> but<00:04:45.530> I<00:04:45.560> can<00:04:45.740> talk<00:04:45.920> about

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
some more tests but I can talk about

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.170 
some more tests but I can talk about
those<00:04:46.640> if<00:04:47.390> and<00:04:47.840> when<00:04:47.990> we<00:04:48.140> need<00:04:48.320> to<00:04:48.440> do<00:04:48.590> them

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
those if and when we need to do them

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.900 
those if and when we need to do them
okay<00:04:50.210> this<00:04:51.020> is<00:04:51.170> calmer<00:04:51.440> woman<00:04:51.980> that<00:04:52.490> was<00:04:52.640> shot

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
okay this is calmer woman that was shot

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.370 
okay this is calmer woman that was shot
really<00:04:53.360> I<00:04:53.510> think<00:04:55.450> will<00:04:56.450> we<00:04:56.630> be<00:04:57.020> able<00:04:57.140> to<00:04:57.260> talk

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
really I think will we be able to talk

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.470 
really I think will we be able to talk
to<00:04:57.650> some<00:04:58.100> more<00:04:58.190> people<00:04:58.250> later<00:04:58.640> on<00:04:58.850> because<00:04:59.360> I'm

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
to some more people later on because I'm

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.090 
to some more people later on because I'm
sure<00:04:59.690> I<00:04:59.720> have<00:05:00.050> a<00:05:00.290> lot<00:05:00.650> of<00:05:00.680> things<00:05:00.920> going

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100

through my head that sure well I can I

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.400 
through my head that sure well I can I
can<00:05:03.560> leave<00:05:04.490> you<00:05:04.850> now<00:05:05.210> just<00:05:05.780> do<00:05:06.080> you<00:05:06.170> kind<00:05:06.350> of

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
can leave you now just do you kind of

can leave you now just do you kind of
get<00:05:06.560> your<00:05:06.650> head<00:05:06.830> around<00:05:06.950> it<00:05:07.340> because<00:05:07.670> I<00:05:07.700> know

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
get your head around it because I know

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.550 
get your head around it because I know
that<00:05:07.970> it's<00:05:08.270> a<00:05:08.360> lot<00:05:08.510> to<00:05:08.630> think<00:05:08.780> about<00:05:08.960> but<00:05:09.380> the

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
that it's a lot to think about but the

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.730 
that it's a lot to think about but the
essence<00:05:10.250> of<00:05:10.400> it<00:05:10.550> is<00:05:10.990> and<00:05:11.990> I<00:05:12.050> can<00:05:12.260> just<00:05:12.470> go<00:05:12.710> over

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
essence of it is and I can just go over

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.300 
essence of it is and I can just go over
again<00:05:13.340> in<00:05:14.120> simple<00:05:14.990> terms<00:05:15.230> if<00:05:15.620> you<00:05:15.650> like<00:05:15.980> is

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
again in simple terms if you like is

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.120 
again in simple terms if you like is
that<00:05:16.370> we<00:05:17.210> can't<00:05:17.900> be<00:05:18.080> sure<00:05:18.110> what<00:05:18.440> sex<00:05:18.740> your<00:05:18.950> baby

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
that we can't be sure what sex your baby

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.030 
that we can't be sure what sex your baby
is<00:05:19.430> this<00:05:20.090> sometimes<00:05:20.630> happens<00:05:21.110> and<00:05:21.530> it

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
is this sometimes happens and it

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.020 
is this sometimes happens and it
sometimes<00:05:22.550> turns<00:05:22.820> out<00:05:23.000> to<00:05:23.120> be<00:05:23.180> nothing<00:05:23.530> okay

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
sometimes turns out to be nothing okay

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.460 
sometimes turns out to be nothing okay
occasionally<00:05:26.030> and<00:05:26.330> the<00:05:26.540> common<00:05:27.200> lists<00:05:27.380> the

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
occasionally and the common lists the

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.860 
occasionally and the common lists the
most<00:05:27.590> urgent<00:05:27.919> thing<00:05:28.400> for<00:05:28.640> us<00:05:28.790> to<00:05:29.090> work<00:05:29.270> out<00:05:29.570> is

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
most urgent thing for us to work out is

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.770 
most urgent thing for us to work out is
if<00:05:30.440> it's<00:05:30.590> a<00:05:30.680> hormone<00:05:31.100> problem<00:05:31.419> so<00:05:32.419> that's<00:05:32.600> why

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
if it's a hormone problem so that's why

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.720 
if it's a hormone problem so that's why
we're<00:05:32.930> doing<00:05:33.050> the<00:05:33.230> blood<00:05:33.380> tests<00:05:34.010> and<00:05:34.580> we're

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
we're doing the blood tests and we're

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.510 
we're doing the blood tests and we're
also<00:05:34.910> doing<00:05:35.210> some<00:05:35.480> genetic<00:05:36.020> tests<00:05:36.590> to<00:05:37.160> look<00:05:37.370> at

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
also doing some genetic tests to look at

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.630 
also doing some genetic tests to look at
what<00:05:37.730> sex<00:05:38.270> what<00:05:38.570> genetic<00:05:39.200> sex<00:05:39.500> the<00:05:39.710> baby<00:05:39.919> is<00:05:40.160> so

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
if the baby's got the chromosomes of a

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.340 
if the baby's got the chromosomes of a

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
girl or a boy so they will help us so

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.140 
girl or a boy so they will help us so
we'll<00:05:45.500> have<00:05:45.590> much<00:05:45.919> more<00:05:45.950> information<00:05:46.490> in<00:05:47.060> a

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
we'll have much more information in a

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.270 
we'll have much more information in a
day<00:05:47.360> or<00:05:47.390> two<00:05:47.690> but<00:05:47.870> we<00:05:47.930> won't<00:05:48.230> get<00:05:48.350> those<00:05:48.590> tests

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
day or two but we won't get those tests

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.280 
day or two but we won't get those tests
back<00:05:49.460> straight<00:05:50.180> away<00:05:50.390> because<00:05:50.900> it<00:05:50.990> takes<00:05:51.200> a

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
back straight away because it takes a

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.130 
back straight away because it takes a
bit<00:05:51.440> of<00:05:51.470> time<00:05:51.590> and<00:05:52.220> so<00:05:52.820> just<00:05:53.090> for<00:05:53.390> now<00:05:53.540> if<00:05:54.080> you

bit of time and so just for now if you

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.090 
bit of time and so just for now if you
can<00:05:54.590> bear<00:05:54.890> to<00:05:54.919> it's<00:05:55.760> just<00:05:55.880> better<00:05:56.419> if<00:05:57.100> course

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100
