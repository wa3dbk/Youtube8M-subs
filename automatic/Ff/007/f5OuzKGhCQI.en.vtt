00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 sales usa and who from the test video site at 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.130
 point as if you are looking for a 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.870
 dietary supplement to win the 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.000
 endurance force opus mass 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.410
 muscular plus this dr gillison chances 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.679
 to win the three-point lottery when 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.929
 even 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.880
 so you can tested the creaq at max of 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.199
 at super 14 is so a product based 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.199
 of creatine is not only 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.680
 always 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.340
 this price find in deposit like these 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.800
 which contains about 120 g of oil 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.540
 so the games he has his little waret will be 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.250
 ordinary that side carthy referrals 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.140
 practical when we look at just the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.390
 composition then there is a small concern 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.760
 woman who does not necessarily care but we 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.470
 advise without the creatine the super 14 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.210
 so we expect to have products 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.020
 which contains only gold creatives 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.370
 find other ingredients to 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.840
 the interior is a bit annoying for 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.610
 those who really want to see that 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.649
 creatine because as its name 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.940
 the indicated if it creates alkaline so we 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.750
 will see a little bit of what 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.430
 it's when we look at that 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.410
 main ingredient composition 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.000
 obviously it's creatine to them they 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.810
 write to creatine monohydrate 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.830
 tamponnais 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.840
 gold it's not wrong it's mostly 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.280
 recognized as creatine created al 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.840
 Qaeda launched creatine we will tell 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.850
 new generations the researchers and 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.530
 were told that bocsa the cre at zemmouri 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.119
 Draka and effective that's no problem 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.860
 it is recognized against that product 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.310
 a lot of waste so creatinine 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.660
 therefore useless for the muscle and in addition 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.179
 we would have found a creatine finally 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.830
 products created has already absorbed one 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.090
 say it often and then it's not me who 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.090
 says it by the way we only do 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.500
 resume what all and I come 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.119
 mennesson years by the gym and a link 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.530
 narrative by the way because he has he did 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.300
 not this relative should be aware that 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.039
 creation hydra anyway to the 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.899
 absorb 100% of the apartments where 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.340
 you say that a creatine film for a 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.929
 better desert absorption one can a 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.789
 little doubt of the thing with respect 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.590
 to creatinine so they say that the 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.390
 creatinine monohydrate produced 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.979
 a lot so you have to know that the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.000
 studies would show that for this it 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.130
 must creatively are dives 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.830
 in a in water for a certain 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.390
 time in terms of hours actually for that 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.099
 for that and creatively hydrate she is 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.599
 rather stable in fact so there too 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:08.130
 it's the same thing that would be an argument 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:09.810
 would not be reasonable why we dine 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.060
 Thiel tamponnais creatine is skin 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.010
 wings would degrade - katyn 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.780
 it's not so fast so that's why 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.250
 so the concern is that regarding the 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.700
 creatine created in kalin ya little 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.980
 study 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.660
 finally I come come his site a I 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.250
 believe in 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.930
 his site that would demonstrate that by 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.340
 compared to its effectiveness what would 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.930
 maybe even less effective than the 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.580
 creatine world woods in a proportion 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.110
 lesser also you will find there 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.810
 teor different types of tea 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.070
 would cash green tea black tea white tea 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.600
 so we just have to commercial 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.580
 highlight the fact that they energy 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.230
 and so on the compared to the t1 must 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.850
 see here that for three capsules we have 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.110
 really very very little caffeine can 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.440
 also talk over effects 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.240
 health 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.350
 actually the tessin of anti effects 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.460
 oxidants but in my opinion the 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.040
 constructions are really not 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.150
 important for the same so in the end we 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.920
 ends up with throws had that 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.300
 basically contain someone 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.620
 who tampons me finally he is at 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.810
 remember that super 14 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.490
 all these products respected the 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.170
 haccp and gmp standards 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.880
 these are quality standards and it's 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.710
 so I invite you there too to go see 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.090
 an article to find the definition he 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.530
 just click on the link that is 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.080
 at the bottom of the video games super 14 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.250
 advise taking three capsules with 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.500
 fresh water for my part I said 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.510
 follow the protocol indicated to see 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.680
 if the promised effects could could 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.060
 happen because why not like 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.990
 there are few studies on it did not know 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.460
 necessarily say it's a product 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.510
 inefficient in this area then I 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.890
 will give you in that my felt 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.330
 but first of all we will talk about 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.100
 strengths and weaknesses of this 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.860
 product so strong you have the 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.150
 compliance with standards haccp and gmp does 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.040
 that it is practical also I had 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.810
 because since the 2 ages is rather 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.370
 correct in any case for this type of 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.200
 creatine if I base myself in relation to 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.850
 asia - hydrate so much and a 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.350
 little nicer to share the 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.420
 local why not at the point level 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.770
 weak it may be already the fact 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.600
 they have few studies on the subject 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.730
 and finally the under dosage of the others 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.650
 ingredients that are no longer there for this 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.420
 evening there to decorate wholesale when I 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.890
 taken so this product had stopped the 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.720
 creatine monohydrate to see you can 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.770
 the effects happens there I found 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.330
 an effect 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.310
 I had taken a little weight a little 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.840
 inflated a little float in my opinion a 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.520
 little bit related good to note that when I 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.110
 stopped so I stopped some time 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.480
 I took again after creating hydrates 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.060
 had been a little swollen dumas 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.710
 double has gone my friends of time when 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.480
 even for the facts that side papon 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.650
 energy during this month will be all that 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.180
 you want good ben there obviously I 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.800
 did not feel a dad 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.810
 usually since anyway when 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.700
 I explained at the tea level for me 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.049
 the 2h seems unimportant only maybe 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.220
 you bring cash or here 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.800
 so do not hesitate to tell us 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.730
 commented for that the video is coming has 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.290
 noted on our site 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.000
 so for my part I prefer to stay so 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.190
 on creatine marie idrac i'm sure 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.340
 that the effects will be there and then 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.810
 in addition the aspect also health a tool 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.640
 tracking there I do not know what that 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.230
 will provoke me to the long term so 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.460
 the drouais there and between the test for 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.500
