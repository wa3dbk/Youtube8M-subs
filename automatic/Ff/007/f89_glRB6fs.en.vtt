similar<00:05:55.150> in<00:05:55.450> touch<00:05:57.090> capability<00:05:58.090> so<00:05:58.840> this

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
similar in touch capability so this

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.600

one's<00:05:59.170> slightly<00:05:59.620> cheaper<00:06:00.100> i<00:06:00.280> think<00:06:00.490> the

one's slightly cheaper i think the

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.780 
one's slightly cheaper i think the
lenovo<00:06:01.060> retails<00:06:01.570> for<00:06:01.720> 350<00:06:02.530> but<00:06:02.890> you<00:06:03.040> can<00:06:03.220> have

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
lenovo retails for 350 but you can have

lenovo retails for 350 but you can have
the<00:06:03.910> acer<00:06:04.240> rather<00:06:04.420> retails<00:06:04.870> for<00:06:04.960> 350<00:06:05.530> but<00:06:05.680> you

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
the acer rather retails for 350 but you

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.500 
the acer rather retails for 350 but you
can<00:06:05.920> find<00:06:06.160> it<00:06:06.280> around<00:06:06.490> online<00:06:06.760> for<00:06:07.180> cheaper

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
can find it around online for cheaper

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.980 
can find it around online for cheaper
than<00:06:07.600> that<00:06:07.810> i<00:06:08.250> would<00:06:09.250> say<00:06:09.460> between<00:06:10.030> these<00:06:10.720> two

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990
