00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.960 
one-third two-thirds and full capacity
give<00:01:43.799> me<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> rough<00:01:44.070> idea<00:01:44.280> what's<00:01:44.520> going<00:01:44.729> on<00:01:44.850> in

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
give me a rough idea what's going on in

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
give me a rough idea what's going on in
there<00:01:45.060> when<00:01:45.149> your<00:01:45.299> fight<00:01:45.420> infection<00:01:45.780> yeah<00:01:45.899> you

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
there when your fight infection yeah you

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.450 
there when your fight infection yeah you
know<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.290> hook<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.500> big<00:01:46.649> fish<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.220> you're

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
know you hook a big fish and you're

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.590 
know you hook a big fish and you're
anchored<00:01:47.729> up<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.119> got<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.329> know<00:01:48.360> when

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
anchored up and you got to know when

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.880 
anchored up and you got to know when
it's<00:01:48.720> time<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.899> go<00:01:49.110> that's<00:01:49.530> what<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.740> line

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
it's time to go that's what the line

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.249 
it's time to go that's what the line
capacity<00:01:50.250> rings<00:01:50.430> are<00:01:50.579> therefore<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.689> graphite

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
capacity rings are therefore so graphite

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.780 
capacity rings are therefore so graphite
frame<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.680> side<00:01:52.799> plates<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.220> all<00:01:53.430> squall

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
frame and side plates like all squall

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.249 
frame and side plates like all squall
reels<00:01:54.060> are<00:01:54.270> that's<00:01:54.479> that's<00:01:54.750> where<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.990> squall

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
reels are that's that's where the squall

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.600 
reels are that's that's where the squall
means<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.860> it's<00:01:56.009> made<00:01:56.159> out<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.430> graphite

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
means is that it's made out of graphite

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.940 
means is that it's made out of graphite
and<00:01:57.170> really<00:01:58.170> lightweight<00:01:58.409> corrosion

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
and really lightweight corrosion

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.980 
and really lightweight corrosion
resistant<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.909> know<00:02:00.420> we've<00:02:00.570> got<00:02:00.600> four

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
resistant so you know we've got four

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.899 
resistant so you know we've got four
sizes<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.649> lineup<00:02:01.860> we<00:02:02.100> also<00:02:02.250> do<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.549> couple

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
sizes in the lineup we also do a couple

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.880 
sizes in the lineup we also do a couple
in<00:02:03.000> left<00:02:03.210> hand<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.960> we<00:02:04.079> offer<00:02:04.320> them<00:02:04.469> bit<00:02:04.619> left

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
in left hand so we offer them bit left

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.100 
in left hand so we offer them bit left
and<00:02:05.040> right<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.450> squall<00:02:06.689> level<00:02:06.990> line

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
and right this is the squall level line

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.469 
and right this is the squall level line
so<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.469> prep<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.250> successor<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.119> GT
