00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:53.170

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:56.049
 Pharaoh and Mars a nurse of the 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.559
 Hebrews for you to raise this child and the 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:01.330

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.510
 the maiden and called the child's mother 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.760

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.220
 the daughter of Pharaoh which the pro son and 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.180
 he called him Moses saying 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.160
 because from the waters I took it out 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.070
 in those days it happened that I grew up 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.380
 already moses came out to his brothers and saw them 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.940
 in his harsh tasks and observed a 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.580
 Egyptian who hit one of the 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.950
 Hebrews his brothers then looked at 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.590
 everywhere and seeing that it did not seem 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.650
 nobody killed the Egyptian and hid him in 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.140
 the sand the next day came out and saw 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.420
 two Hebrews who were scolding then said to 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.060
 that mistreated the other because you hit 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.650
 your neighbor and he answered who has 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.160

 you think kill me like you killed the Egyptian 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.640
 then Moses was afraid and said 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.840
 certainly this has been discovered 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.930
 Pharaoh hearing about this fact 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.090
 tried to kill bassinet but bassinet fled 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.479
 from before Pharaoh and dwelt in the 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.760
 Madian land and sitting together 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.709

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.170

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.370
 he also took out the water and gave us a drink 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.350
 to the sheep and told his daughters where 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.950
