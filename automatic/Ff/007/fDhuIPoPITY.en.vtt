00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.910
 the club hair they do not have a 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.379
 owner they have plenty of small 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.790
 attentions that come from several 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.440
 people who could have been their 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.790
 owners who will take care of it in 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.410
 as such but they do not have a 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.240
 stability of having a single owner 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.350
 and it's true that I think that as the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.029
 groom we bring them stability 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.449
 because every day and we saw 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.890
 and they can not consider us as 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.539
 the owner but it's stability 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.980
 that we can bring them to be there all 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.539
 the days then given the same care 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.090
 every day to see small 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.780
 attentions every day that they can 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.130
 really balances I think they 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.800
 are as many needs as any other 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.969
 horse that a great price horse that re 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.969
 at the world championships 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.489
 I think it's heroes for me 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.250
 maybe exaggerates the word is not exaggerated 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.550
 for me that's because it's 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.859
 horses passing in all hands 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.520
 who have all the experiences they 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:06.110
 wipe out all the emotions and that's 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.110
 really a background work that make 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.860
 Oh 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.090
 e 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.040
 the 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.490
 the club horse he still 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.310
 extremely adaptable 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.530
 quickly and that's one of his 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.570
 fundamental qualities 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.890
 he can be mounted dioner on the other 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.500
 by someone who has very little 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.770
 of experience that goes boiling that goes a lot 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.120
 move that will disturb him in parentheses 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.680
 what is abnormal he is there for that 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.380
 someone who in learning who is going 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.850
 start riding and draft 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.890
 but it's normal we have to accept it 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.080
 we are here as christian cambon 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.540

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.340
 change quickly resume that and then 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.880
 can be mounted ten minutes later by a 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.980
 very experienced rider protection 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.940
 this adaptability she is 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.940
