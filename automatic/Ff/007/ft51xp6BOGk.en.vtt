00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.540
 [music] 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.719
 [applause] 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.719
 [music] 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.890
 today is supposed to be done 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.880
 operation of total arthroplasty 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:20.250
 a 63-year-old patient’s knee joint 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.529
 In this case, the development of osteoarthritis of the knee 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.330
 the joint is due to a long-standing injury from 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.029
 damage meniscus damage 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.529
 internal lateral ligament at this 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.960
 moment X-ray picture 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.390
 says that it’s mostly worn out 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.150
 internal division of the knee joint 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.220
 however, intraoperatively we will see that 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.430
 the joint is almost completely destroyed 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.550
 is supposed to use the rear 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.710
 stabilized 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.210
 knee arthroplasty which 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.969
 allow the patient to lead completely 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.699
 normal life is no different 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.350
 from the previous endoprosthesis should serve 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.800
 many years with competent him 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.410
 using wear such a joint 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.300
 absolutely minimal count on 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.100
 what will have to be changed in the foreseeable 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.100
 the future definitely does not have to 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.700
 access to the knee joint 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.150
 from the front 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.460
 bypassing the patella dissect layers 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:19.320
 soft tissue here it is clearly seen that 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.870
 hip cartilage absent 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.560
 all remaining cartilage is heavily modified 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:28.670
 a bunch I practically and torn 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.670
 deformed patella arthritis 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.860
 since and on the knee prosthesis 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.720
 has a very complex geometry for it 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.810
 proper installation is necessary 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.340
 implement a certain amount 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.920
 accurate the pile of femoral and 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.250
 tibial bones for this purpose 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.200
 used to direct or patterns in 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.020
 during the operation we are consistent 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.530
 we change execute the file and delete 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.690
 remnants of damaged cartilage 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.360
 this removes the articular surface 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.910
 tibia from thicker and 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.650
 Sivak is cartilage he is also not perfect 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.500
 condition but nonetheless 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.019
 to completely hardening absolutely 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.019
 dead here it is dead 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.180
 sclerosing bone is already 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.580
 consequences from kind after 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.800
 made necessary 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.330
 and we saw the test saws 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.520
 endoprosthesis component 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.400
 and check the stability of the knee 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.250
 the joint is convinced that the axis 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.230
 limbs restored this denervation 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.630
 his patella we will not change him in 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.460
 good condition so that there is no pain 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.700
 in contact with the metal do 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.780
 denervation 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.250
 perforating hardening areas 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.250
 bones to better penetrate themselves 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.380
 permanent components are installed 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.840
 endoprosthesis for bone cement which 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.240
 freezes for 5 minutes 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.390
 tibial component that is covered 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:00.830
 cement and set its 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:04.060
 final place this femoral 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.060
 component covered with cement 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.220
 this is a polyethylene liner 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.050
 12 millimeters thick bone cement 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.730
 which freezes for 5 minutes 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.680
 about as soon as he froze all 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.480
 fixed bone processes you can leg 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.480
 load completely without waiting for anything 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.070
 performed hybrids range that is 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.590
 cleaning the knee here are fragments 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.200
 cartilage and small bone fragments 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.430
 pieces of cement during the operation 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.010
 joints repeatedly washed 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.140
 the antiseptic solution is completed 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.430
 drainage and stratified operation 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.860
 soft tissue closure 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.510
 tomorrow is supposed to walk 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.730
 full load patients 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.010
 operated limb operation 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.510
 finished we set that process 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.820
 which was originally intended 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.860
 no unexpected process finds 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.070
 operations made 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.420
 it was not all gone in normal mode 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.030
 tomorrow the patient will be lowered and 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.040
 obesity ation block and proceed to 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.140
 rehab if all goes well 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.890
 scheduled clouds rang will go home 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.890
 on their monk
