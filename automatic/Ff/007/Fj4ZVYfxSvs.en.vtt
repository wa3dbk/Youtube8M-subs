now<00:02:41.400> we<00:02:41.459> got<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.820> get<00:02:41.940> some<00:02:42.150> wobbling<00:02:42.630> going<00:02:43.400> so

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
now we got to get some wobbling going so

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.420 
now we got to get some wobbling going so
we're<00:02:44.940> going<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.180> put<00:02:45.480> a

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
we're going to put a

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.100 
we're going to put a
modifier<00:02:48.430> in<00:02:48.700> there<00:02:49.980> LFO<00:02:51.780> I'm<00:02:52.780> going<00:02:52.959> to<00:02:53.019> put

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
modifier in there LFO I'm going to put

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.929 
modifier in there LFO I'm going to put
it<00:02:53.230> above<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.680> harmonic<00:02:54.099> synthesizer<00:02:54.610> and

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:54.939 
it above the harmonic synthesizer and

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.350 
it above the harmonic synthesizer and
drag<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.959> assignment<00:02:56.680> from<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.760> harmonic

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
drag the assignment from the harmonic

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.520 
drag the assignment from the harmonic
synthesizer<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:59.530> thee<00:03:00.569> from<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:01.720> LFO<00:03:02.110> to<00:03:02.379> the

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
synthesizer to thee from the LFO to the

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.009 
synthesizer to thee from the LFO to the
stop<00:03:03.340> point<00:03:03.730> of<00:03:03.849> the<00:03:03.940> filter<00:03:04.329> on<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.569> harmonic

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
stop point of the filter on the harmonic

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.940 
stop point of the filter on the harmonic
synthesizer<00:03:06.989> now<00:03:07.989> will<00:03:08.170> synchronize<00:03:08.680> the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
synthesizer now will synchronize the

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:19.199 
synthesizer now will synchronize the
rate<00:03:09.129> and<00:03:09.849> move<00:03:10.090> it<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.390> about<00:03:10.720> 1/8<00:03:17.970> we'll<00:03:18.970> set

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
rate and move it to about 1/8 we'll set

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.089 
rate and move it to about 1/8 we'll set
it<00:03:19.239> to<00:03:19.420> be<00:03:19.569> a<00:03:19.599> sine<00:03:19.959> wave<00:03:19.989> so<00:03:20.680> it's<00:03:20.829> a<00:03:20.890> little

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
it to be a sine wave so it's a little

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.259 
it to be a sine wave so it's a little
smoother<00:03:21.549> and<00:03:22.299> now<00:03:23.140> we<00:03:23.769> don't<00:03:23.890> want<00:03:24.129> this<00:03:24.280> full

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
smoother and now we don't want this full

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.690 
smoother and now we don't want this full
up<00:03:25.420> throwing<00:03:26.170> wildly<00:03:26.769> back<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.129> forth<00:03:27.370> too

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
up throwing wildly back and forth too

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.300 
up throwing wildly back and forth too
far<00:03:28.000> so<00:03:28.480> we'll<00:03:28.900> pull<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.349> harmonics<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.250> the

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
far so we'll pull the harmonics and the

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:40.440 
far so we'll pull the harmonics and the
stop<00:03:30.579> point<00:03:31.170> down<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:39.010> it<00:03:39.159> doesn't<00:03:39.430> go<00:03:40.060> beyond

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
stop point down so it doesn't go beyond

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.860 
stop point down so it doesn't go beyond
the<00:03:40.629> ranges<00:03:41.019> we<00:03:41.170> want<00:03:41.409> it<00:03:41.530> to

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
the ranges we want it to

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.500 
the ranges we want it to
we<00:03:43.870> got<00:03:44.079> wobble<00:03:44.500> going<00:03:44.849> now<00:03:45.849> to<00:03:46.209> make<00:03:46.359> the

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
we got wobble going now to make the

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.869 
we got wobble going now to make the
wobble<00:03:46.870> have<00:03:47.260> some<00:03:47.440> variation<00:03:48.129> we're<00:03:48.700> going

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
wobble have some variation we're going

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.960 
wobble have some variation we're going
to<00:03:49.030> add<00:03:49.239> the<00:03:49.450> analog<00:03:49.930> sequencer<00:03:50.590> in<00:03:50.799> above<00:03:51.730> the

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
to add the analog sequencer in above the

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:59.270 
to add the analog sequencer in above the
LFO<00:03:52.480> on<00:03:52.949> channel<00:03:53.949> B<00:03:55.199> I'll<00:03:56.199> pull<00:03:56.470> these<00:03:56.620> down

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.099 

we're<00:04:00.280> going<00:04:00.489> to<00:04:00.790> assign<00:04:01.829> the<00:04:04.109> analog

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
we're going to assign the analog

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:10.610 
we're going to assign the analog
sequencer<00:04:05.709> to<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.400> rate<00:04:06.699> that<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.959> LFOs<00:04:09.180> rode

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
sequencer to the rate that the LFOs rode

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.830 
sequencer to the rate that the LFOs rode
oscillating<00:04:11.620> at<00:04:11.769> so<00:04:12.639> we'll<00:04:12.849> scrag<00:04:13.239> it<00:04:13.389> down<00:04:13.569> to

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
oscillating at so we'll scrag it down to

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.229 
oscillating at so we'll scrag it down to
the<00:04:13.930> rate

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.720 

we<00:04:18.239> don't<00:04:18.420> want<00:04:18.630> this<00:04:18.780> thing<00:04:18.840> again<00:04:19.730> wildly

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
we don't want this thing again wildly

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.050 
we don't want this thing again wildly
throwing<00:04:21.690> this<00:04:21.870> value<00:04:22.530> way<00:04:22.770> out<00:04:23.040> so<00:04:23.850> we'll

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
throwing this value way out so we'll

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:30.790 
throwing this value way out so we'll
pull<00:04:24.270> this<00:04:24.420> down<00:04:24.750> way<00:04:25.170> down<00:04:27.380> so<00:04:28.380> like<00:04:29.240> point<00:04:30.240> 10

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
pull this down way down so like point 10

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
pull this down way down so like point 10
now<00:04:31.800> we'll<00:04:32.010> move<00:04:32.160> some<00:04:32.400> of<00:04:32.430> these<00:04:32.580> about

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
now we'll move some of these about

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.020 
now we'll move some of these about
halfway<00:04:33.060> up<00:04:37.040> and<00:04:38.040> we'll<00:04:38.190> pull<00:04:38.370> down<00:04:38.520> the<00:04:38.730> slide

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
halfway up and we'll pull down the slide

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.540 
halfway up and we'll pull down the slide
as<00:04:39.360> low<00:04:39.690> as<00:04:39.840> we<00:04:39.960> can<00:04:40.200> so<00:04:40.830> there's<00:04:41.040> no<00:04:41.220> delay

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
as low as we can so there's no delay

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.590 
as low as we can so there's no delay
there<00:04:42.770> now<00:04:43.770> this<00:04:44.310> analog<00:04:44.850> sequencer<00:04:45.390> when

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
there now this analog sequencer when

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.680 
there now this analog sequencer when
these<00:04:45.780> are<00:04:45.990> up<00:04:46.280> is<00:04:47.280> modifying<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:48.450> right

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
these are up is modifying the right

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.120 
these are up is modifying the right
speed<00:04:49.050> of<00:04:49.320> the<00:04:49.830> LFO<00:04:50.840> which<00:04:51.840> is<00:04:52.050> modifying<00:04:52.560> the

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
speed of the LFO which is modifying the

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.240 
speed of the LFO which is modifying the
harmonic<00:04:53.730> synthesizer<00:04:54.240> cutoff<00:04:54.690> point<00:04:55.010> so<00:04:56.010> a

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
harmonic synthesizer cutoff point so a

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.220 
harmonic synthesizer cutoff point so a
long<00:04:56.580> way<00:04:56.790> about<00:04:57.060> it<00:04:57.270> saying<00:04:57.690> that<00:04:58.050> it's

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
long way about it saying that it's

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.320 
long way about it saying that it's
making<00:04:58.500> this<00:04:58.830> filter<00:04:59.250> wobble<00:04:59.790> at<00:04:59.970> different

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
making this filter wobble at different

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
making this filter wobble at different
rates<00:05:00.570> depending<00:05:01.110> on<00:05:01.290> where<00:05:01.860> this<00:05:02.010> light<00:05:02.670> is

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
rates depending on where this light is

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.260 
rates depending on where this light is
you<00:05:04.350> can<00:05:04.500> change<00:05:04.770> the<00:05:04.950> rate<00:05:05.220> of<00:05:05.460> this<00:05:05.640> also<00:05:05.880> so

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
you can change the rate of this also so

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:12.530 
you can change the rate of this also so
it<00:05:06.360> runs<00:05:06.570> faster<00:05:07.080> I<00:05:10.760> like<00:05:11.760> it<00:05:11.910> on<00:05:11.970> quarter<00:05:12.390> note

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
it runs faster I like it on quarter note

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.390 
it runs faster I like it on quarter note
pretty<00:05:12.810> much<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.260> resolution<00:05:14.000> all<00:05:15.000> right<00:05:16.400> now

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
pretty much the resolution all right now

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.400 
pretty much the resolution all right now
last<00:05:18.150> thing<00:05:18.360> in<00:05:18.420> the<00:05:18.480> channel<00:05:18.780> we'll<00:05:18.960> throw<00:05:19.200> in

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
last thing in the channel we'll throw in

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:25.280 
last thing in the channel we'll throw in
is<00:05:19.620> a<00:05:20.540> modulation<00:05:22.010> ensemble<00:05:23.990> we'll<00:05:24.990> put<00:05:25.140> it<00:05:25.260> at

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
is a modulation ensemble we'll put it at

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
is a modulation ensemble we'll put it at
the<00:05:25.410> very<00:05:25.560> end<00:05:27.500> all<00:05:28.500> right<00:05:28.590> it's<00:05:28.830> a<00:05:28.950> nice

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
the very end all right it's a nice

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.790 
the very end all right it's a nice
chorus<00:05:29.820> will<00:05:30.810> synchronize<00:05:31.230> it<00:05:31.350> to<00:05:31.440> the<00:05:31.500> tempo

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
chorus will synchronize it to the tempo

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.700 
chorus will synchronize it to the tempo
and<00:05:31.890> we'll<00:05:32.010> pull<00:05:32.160> it<00:05:32.250> down<00:05:32.430> to<00:05:32.640> about<00:05:33.290> 30%<00:05:34.290> or

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
and we'll pull it down to about 30% or

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.630 
and we'll pull it down to about 30% or
so<00:05:35.180> just<00:05:36.180> to<00:05:36.360> give<00:05:36.510> it<00:05:36.540> a<00:05:36.690> little<00:05:36.780> more<00:05:37.140> depth

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640
