00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hey people today so i'm going over 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.500
 girls talk about for ministers 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.970
 to be exact you do not know what 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.189
 a feminist is and women the 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.750
 really very profane and who are you 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.480
 I do not mean that for every woman 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.040
 lesbian or professional woman 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.210
 I'm talking about women's 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.440
 equality between man and 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.490
 Woman looking for her you have it here 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.449
 written between full width 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.890
 never filmed i thought that either 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.029
 finalists feel attacked euro 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.680
 Do you only believe because we are girls 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.090
 we can not handle jokes 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.740
 No, I never said why 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.849
 have a female character domenech 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.470
 but elaborate the characters the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.810
 are just as stupid as you call me 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.710
 me already stupid ha yes then thought 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.719
 I have no reason for it 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.100
 I feel like being attacked as well 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.420
 for the equal rights of man and 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.469
 Woman I agree that a woman's 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.579
 themselves pay like a man for the 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.570
 should get his job and then 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.500
 do not be pleased by the man drained 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.550
 be viewed if the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.170
 equality gold must be everything 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.980
 Equal rights are only certain 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.750
 things men's legs too 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.829
 equality for example why 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.030
 It is customary when you get the deep one 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.079
 to stop her, but why does she do it ? 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.250
 women for man why is it 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.780
 common for us men in the head too 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.670
 risk and always ask the women 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.170
 almost never ask and ask a marisa 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.699
 Gentlemanlike as a painter to 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.780
 pay and say that is so cute though 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.010
 one to their gifts and flowers 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.719
 sweets brings and what we get 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.370
 a free mom and why is there 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.960
 a girl's day and ours means guys 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.799
 It's child day I'm not saying that I'm all 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.119
 but that's what you want from 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.799
 Equal rights you ask 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.000
 Actually, we would have guys like that 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.290
 treat that we like to do live 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.729
 would be acceptable if it were 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.020
 most common complaint is from girls 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.549
 that we guys do not have enough time with us 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.750
 our friends spend but if 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.460
 you think about it then goes off 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.750
 He also said every page of that 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.520
 see what I did 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.450
 Equal rights did not come 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.130
 again not the whole day with 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.600
 to watch video games why spend 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.220
 you do not have a little time with me 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.380
 grab a controller there are two 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.549
 but I like watching video games 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.600
 to play and I like the Scots 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.009
 to go you know what I am 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.840
 No more attention and girls 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.650
 i am a guy i want another one 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.640
 always says about women 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.110
 Complaints is that your types only 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.310
 the one we think of sex and think 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.869
 how the body of the woman looks after all 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.340
 why is it okay if a girl says so 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.290
 you alone can do your muscles 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.840
 show less than 3 but when we say 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.220
 every member insult a beautiful one 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.200
 Women are just as bad as men 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.570
 they just feel more offended girls 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.280
 You bet your breasts introduce yourself 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.299
 men are as sensitive as I do 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.369
 your muscles 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.930
 What I want to say is that it does not matter 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.100
 So you are a man or a woman 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.509
 do not think that I am now like minister 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.320
 hate this is not true i am 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.149
 only say that both sexes 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.500
 positive as well as negative sides 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.640
 So listen to yourself about that 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.110
 loves to cherish other sex 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.090
 six of you who is what is 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.800
 It always makes you feel like a guy 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.840
 and abracadabra 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.130

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.330
