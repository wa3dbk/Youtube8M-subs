your<00:03:41.709> hair<00:03:41.890> you<00:03:42.070> may<00:03:42.190> want<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:42.430> use<00:03:42.459> this<00:03:42.730> a

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
your hair you may want to use this a

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.550 
your hair you may want to use this a
couple<00:03:43.150> of<00:03:43.209> times<00:03:43.299> a<00:03:43.540> week<00:03:43.690> but<00:03:43.900> I<00:03:44.320> wouldn't

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
couple of times a week but I wouldn't

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.930 
couple of times a week but I wouldn't
recommend<00:03:44.769> going<00:03:45.070> overboard<00:03:45.489> with<00:03:45.790> it

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
recommend going overboard with it

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.610 
recommend going overboard with it
because<00:03:46.299> it<00:03:46.540> does<00:03:46.900> get<00:03:47.320> rid<00:03:47.470> of<00:03:47.500> the

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
because it does get rid of the

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.930 
because it does get rid of the
brassiness<00:03:47.950> and<00:03:48.220> it<00:03:48.280> can't<00:03:48.489> strip<00:03:48.760> your<00:03:48.880> hair

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
brassiness and it can't strip your hair

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.000 
brassiness and it can't strip your hair
I<00:03:49.150> think<00:03:49.330> that<00:03:49.810> it<00:03:49.959> would<00:03:50.260> be<00:03:50.470> able<00:03:50.530> to<00:03:50.709> you

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
I think that it would be able to you

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.340 
I think that it would be able to you
know<00:03:51.130> it<00:03:51.400> could<00:03:51.760> strip<00:03:52.030> your<00:03:52.150> hair<00:03:52.209> if<00:03:52.450> it<00:03:52.570> you

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
know it could strip your hair if it you

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.610 
know it could strip your hair if it you
over<00:03:53.650> used<00:03:53.890> it<00:03:54.570> but<00:03:55.570> it<00:03:55.690> doesn't<00:03:56.019> enhance<00:03:56.380> your

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
over used it but it doesn't enhance your
