open<00:01:50.929> throttle<00:01:51.200> which<00:01:52.100> is<00:01:52.250> cool<00:01:52.520> to<00:01:52.789> the

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
open throttle which is cool to the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.300 
open throttle which is cool to the
coldest<00:01:53.300> it<00:01:53.420> can<00:01:53.569> get<00:01:53.720> that's<00:01:54.470> a<00:01:54.649> default<00:01:55.100> in
