00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
kind of pinch in the corners if you see

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.000 
kind of pinch in the corners if you see
what<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.160> mean

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
what I mean

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.140 
what I mean
let<00:02:12.970> me<00:02:13.060> do<00:02:13.209> one<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.720> then<00:02:13.900> I'll<00:02:14.050> show<00:02:14.319> you<00:02:15.150> so

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
let me do one and then I'll show you so

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.809 
let me do one and then I'll show you so
like<00:02:16.360> that<00:02:16.629> pinch<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.440> corners<00:02:17.830> in<00:02:18.010> don't<00:02:18.610> cut

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
like that pinch the corners in don't cut

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.369 
like that pinch the corners in don't cut
them<00:02:19.000> don't<00:02:19.209> make<00:02:19.269> tabs<00:02:19.629> okay<00:02:19.989> because<00:02:20.140> we're

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
them don't make tabs okay because we're

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.710 
them don't make tabs okay because we're
going<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.560> make<00:02:20.709> this<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:21.190> fold<00:02:21.760> flat<00:02:21.970> box<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.569> box

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
going to make this a fold flat box a box

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.240 
going to make this a fold flat box a box
that<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.049> can<00:02:23.200> fold<00:02:23.470> for<00:02:23.709> that<00:02:23.830> if<00:02:23.920> you<00:02:24.010> want

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
that you can fold for that if you want

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.300 
that you can fold for that if you want
to<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:25.540> just<00:02:25.599> pinch<00:02:26.080> in<00:02:26.319> you<00:02:26.470> can<00:02:26.680> score<00:02:27.040> if<00:02:27.190> you

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
to so just pinch in you can score if you

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.500 
to so just pinch in you can score if you
want<00:02:27.580> to<00:02:27.819> but<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.150> is<00:02:28.180> really<00:02:28.720> really<00:02:28.870> small<00:02:29.260> so

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
want to but it is really really small so

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.559 
want to but it is really really small so
pinching<00:02:31.510> in<00:02:31.599> is<00:02:31.720> fine<00:02:31.989> I<00:02:32.019> think<00:02:32.519> okay<00:02:33.569> alright

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
pinching in is fine I think okay alright

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.539 
pinching in is fine I think okay alright
so<00:02:34.629> it's<00:02:34.930> gonna<00:02:35.019> look<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.530> little<00:02:35.980> something

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
so it's gonna look a little something

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.869 
so it's gonna look a little something
like<00:02:36.670> that<00:02:36.730> once<00:02:37.269> you're<00:02:37.450> done<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:39.400> what<00:02:39.730> we

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
like that once you're done so what we

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.119 
like that once you're done so what we
want<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.120> do<00:02:40.269> is<00:02:40.450> this<00:02:41.019> paper<00:02:41.650> doesn't<00:02:41.920> have

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
want to do is this paper doesn't have

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.280 
want to do is this paper doesn't have
any<00:02:42.250> sort<00:02:42.489> of<00:02:42.610> like<00:02:42.849> directions<00:02:43.599> so<00:02:43.930> it's<00:02:44.079> fine

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
any sort of like directions so it's fine

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.339 
any sort of like directions so it's fine
but<00:02:44.500> if<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.739> does<00:02:44.920> have<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.220> direction<00:02:45.640> like

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
but if it does have a direction like

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.819 
but if it does have a direction like
this<00:02:47.349> one<00:02:47.620> I<00:02:47.829> obviously<00:02:48.730> wanted<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:50.410> don't

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
this one I obviously wanted the I don't

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.619 
this one I obviously wanted the I don't
know<00:02:50.890> what<00:02:51.040> these<00:02:51.160> are<00:02:51.370> these<00:02:52.120> things<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.540> be

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
know what these are these things to be

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:53.880 
know what these are these things to be
going<00:02:52.840> in<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:52.959> same<00:02:53.019> direction<00:02:53.319> on<00:02:53.739> the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
going in the same direction on the

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.580 
going in the same direction on the
inside<00:02:54.280> of<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.519> box<00:02:54.760> so<00:02:55.540> I<00:02:55.569> had<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.140> put<00:02:56.440> it<00:02:56.530> a

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
inside of the box so I had to put it a

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.770 
inside of the box so I had to put it a
specific<00:02:56.769> way<00:02:57.040> this<00:02:58.030> one<00:02:58.209> you<00:02:58.299> don't<00:02:58.390> have<00:02:58.510> to

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
specific way this one you don't have to

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.319 
specific way this one you don't have to
so<00:02:59.319> to<00:02:59.379> get<00:02:59.560> it<00:02:59.680> to<00:02:59.799> fold<00:03:00.010> flat<00:03:00.400> you've<00:03:01.030> got

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
so to get it to fold flat you've got

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.860 
so to get it to fold flat you've got
these<00:03:01.540> little<00:03:02.519> triangles<00:03:03.519> here<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:04.629> you're

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
these little triangles here and you're

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.470 
these little triangles here and you're
going<00:03:05.019> to<00:03:05.049> use<00:03:05.230> mini<00:03:05.500> glue<00:03:05.739> dots<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.480> stick

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
going to use mini glue dots to stick

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.729 
going to use mini glue dots to stick
this<00:03:07.629> together<00:03:07.930> you're<00:03:08.109> going<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.290> apply<00:03:08.440> one

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
this together you're going to apply one

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.990 
this together you're going to apply one
there<00:03:09.660> one<00:03:10.660> there<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:11.560> then<00:03:12.220> down<00:03:12.430> here<00:03:12.700> one

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
there one there and then down here one

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.059 
there one there and then down here one
there<00:03:13.299> and<00:03:13.510> one<00:03:13.569> there<00:03:14.019> don't<00:03:14.709> stick<00:03:14.950> anything

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
there and one there don't stick anything

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.220 
there and one there don't stick anything
on<00:03:15.400> this<00:03:15.519> inside<00:03:16.030> portion<00:03:16.569> only<00:03:16.750> on<00:03:16.959> the<00:03:17.019> top

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
on this inside portion only on the top

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.190 
on this inside portion only on the top
for<00:03:17.769> triangles<00:03:18.549> so<00:03:19.419> I'm<00:03:19.480> gonna<00:03:19.599> grab<00:03:19.810> my<00:03:19.840> mini

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
for triangles so I'm gonna grab my mini

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:32.129 
for triangles so I'm gonna grab my mini
glue<00:03:20.470> dots<00:03:30.150> make<00:03:31.150> sure<00:03:31.299> you<00:03:31.419> only<00:03:31.630> get<00:03:31.989> that

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
glue dots make sure you only get that

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.900 
glue dots make sure you only get that
little<00:03:33.630> triangle<00:03:34.630> and<00:03:34.750> not<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.169> whole<00:03:35.349> square

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
little triangle and not the whole square

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.979 
little triangle and not the whole square
well<00:03:36.910> then<00:03:37.030> everything<00:03:37.419> will<00:03:37.569> just<00:03:37.750> stick

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
well then everything will just stick

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:47.039 
well then everything will just stick
together<00:03:38.200> in<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.680> wrong<00:03:38.859> way<00:03:40.620> okay<00:03:45.000> so<00:03:46.049> now

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
together in the wrong way okay so now

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.890 
together in the wrong way okay so now
I'm<00:03:47.200> just<00:03:47.349> going<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:47.590> fold<00:03:47.919> in<00:03:48.480> press<00:03:49.480> down<00:03:49.720> on

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
I'm just going to fold in press down on

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.750 
I'm just going to fold in press down on
the<00:03:49.989> glue<00:03:50.169> dots<00:03:50.380> and<00:03:50.709> then<00:03:51.010> once<00:03:51.190> you<00:03:51.340> open

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
the glue dots and then once you open

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.300 
the glue dots and then once you open
this<00:03:51.880> up<00:03:52.120> you<00:03:52.450> can<00:03:52.690> see<00:03:52.750> it<00:03:53.500> opens<00:03:53.859> up<00:03:54.040> and

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
this up you can see it opens up and

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.390 
this up you can see it opens up and
these<00:03:55.120> sides<00:03:55.480> come<00:03:55.840> up<00:03:55.989> and<00:03:56.169> it<00:03:56.709> becomes<00:03:57.010> a

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
these sides come up and it becomes a

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.819 
these sides come up and it becomes a
little<00:03:57.760> box<00:03:58.090> so<00:03:58.629> that's<00:03:58.750> going<00:03:58.930> to<00:03:58.989> fit<00:03:59.230> right

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
little box so that's going to fit right

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.619 
little box so that's going to fit right
in<00:04:00.069> there<00:04:00.340> is<00:04:02.280> 1/16<00:04:03.280> of<00:04:03.400> an<00:04:03.549> inch<00:04:03.639> smaller<00:04:04.329> so

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
in there is 1/16 of an inch smaller so

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.020 
in there is 1/16 of an inch smaller so
it<00:04:04.720> should<00:04:04.900> fit<00:04:05.079> very<00:04:05.319> nicely<00:04:05.500> so<00:04:05.980> apply<00:04:06.760> some

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
it should fit very nicely so apply some

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.000 
it should fit very nicely so apply some
adhesive<00:04:07.120> onto<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:07.810> whole<00:04:08.049> of<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:08.650> back<00:04:08.799> of

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
adhesive onto the whole of the back of

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.900 
adhesive onto the whole of the back of
this<00:04:09.160> I'm<00:04:09.340> going<00:04:09.430> to<00:04:09.489> use<00:04:09.639> fast<00:04:09.879> fuse<00:04:12.870> I'm<00:04:14.910> so

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
this I'm going to use fast fuse I'm so

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.000 
this I'm going to use fast fuse I'm so
sticky<00:04:16.389> fast<00:04:16.660> fuse<00:04:16.989> you<00:04:17.500> really<00:04:17.769> have<00:04:17.859> to

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
sticky fast fuse you really have to

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.650 
sticky fast fuse you really have to
flick<00:04:18.220> it<00:04:18.400> and<00:04:18.880> I'm<00:04:19.030> just<00:04:19.180> going<00:04:19.299> to<00:04:19.389> make<00:04:19.510> sure

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.330 

because<00:04:26.800> those<00:04:27.490> bits<00:04:27.789> are<00:04:27.909> going<00:04:27.939> to<00:04:28.240> stick

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
because those bits are going to stick

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.010 
because those bits are going to stick

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
gonna the best way to do it is to come

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.070 
gonna the best way to do it is to come
up<00:04:35.979> over<00:04:36.460> which<00:04:36.610> I<00:04:36.909> can't<00:04:37.389> really<00:04:37.539> do<00:04:37.719> cuz<00:04:37.960> the

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
up over which I can't really do cuz the

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.230 
up over which I can't really do cuz the
cameras<00:04:38.409> in<00:04:38.529> the<00:04:38.590> way<00:04:38.710> but<00:04:39.009> you<00:04:39.759> want<00:04:39.939> to<00:04:40.060> just

cameras in the way but you want to just

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.510 
cameras in the way but you want to just
make<00:04:40.419> sure<00:04:40.569> that<00:04:40.599> the<00:04:40.930> score<00:04:41.349> lines<00:04:44.520> where

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
make sure that the score lines where

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.459 
make sure that the score lines where
they<00:04:45.669> should<00:04:45.999> be<00:04:46.300> before<00:04:46.870> you<00:04:46.990> put<00:04:47.259> this<00:04:47.409> down

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:47.469 
they should be before you put this down

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:53.010 
they should be before you put this down
and<00:04:47.979> stick<00:04:48.249> it<00:04:48.430> I<00:04:50.939> can't<00:04:51.939> really<00:04:52.300> see<00:04:52.840> that

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
and stick it I can't really see that

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.990 
and stick it I can't really see that
well<00:04:53.229> but<00:04:53.439> I'm<00:04:54.189> just<00:04:54.279> gonna<00:04:54.430> stick<00:04:54.729> that<00:04:54.939> down

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
well but I'm just gonna stick that down

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.309 
well but I'm just gonna stick that down
and<00:04:55.479> hope<00:04:55.629> for<00:04:55.779> the<00:04:55.840> best

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:56.319 
and hope for the best

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:00.330 
and hope for the best
so<00:04:56.979> when<00:04:57.279> you<00:04:57.370> bring<00:04:57.610> it<00:04:57.729> up<00:04:58.529> it<00:04:59.529> looks<00:05:00.069> like

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
so when you bring it up it looks like

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.390 
so when you bring it up it looks like
that<00:05:01.050> how<00:05:02.050> cute<00:05:02.319> is<00:05:02.469> that<00:05:02.500> I<00:05:02.949> think<00:05:03.250> that's

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
that how cute is that I think that's

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.249 
that how cute is that I think that's
really<00:05:03.789> really<00:05:04.120> nice<00:05:04.300> and<00:05:04.539> the<00:05:04.990> sides

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:05.259 
really really nice and the sides

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:09.330 
really really nice and the sides
obviously<00:05:05.770> line<00:05:06.430> up<00:05:06.610> really<00:05:06.819> nicely<00:05:07.379> and<00:05:08.379> then

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
obviously line up really nicely and then

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.249 
obviously line up really nicely and then
the<00:05:09.460> front<00:05:09.699> just<00:05:09.849> comes<00:05:10.090> down<00:05:10.330> like<00:05:10.569> this<00:05:10.990> so

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
the front just comes down like this so

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.480 
the front just comes down like this so
to<00:05:11.500> secure<00:05:12.279> it<00:05:12.520> I'm<00:05:12.669> gonna<00:05:12.849> use<00:05:14.250> ribbon<00:05:15.250> so<00:05:15.400> I'm

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
to secure it I'm gonna use ribbon so I'm

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.890 
to secure it I'm gonna use ribbon so I'm
gonna<00:05:15.639> punch<00:05:15.969> a<00:05:16.150> little<00:05:16.300> hole<00:05:18.719> roughly<00:05:19.719> in<00:05:19.810> the

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
gonna punch a little hole roughly in the

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.219 
gonna punch a little hole roughly in the
middle<00:05:20.610> that's<00:05:21.610> with<00:05:21.909> the<00:05:22.089> 1/8<00:05:22.689> of<00:05:22.990> an<00:05:23.139> inch

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
middle that's with the 1/8 of an inch

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.519 
middle that's with the 1/8 of an inch
hole<00:05:23.589> punch<00:05:23.860> and<00:05:24.069> I'm<00:05:24.249> going<00:05:24.520> to<00:05:24.639> use<00:05:25.529> this

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:26.529

ribbon which what is this this is lost
Lagoon<00:05:31.479> ribbon<00:05:31.870> I<00:05:31.960> think<00:05:32.169> it<00:05:32.259> might<00:05:32.409> be<00:05:32.439> one<00:05:32.620> of

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
Lagoon ribbon I think it might be one of

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.829 
Lagoon ribbon I think it might be one of
the<00:05:32.800> colors<00:05:33.069> in<00:05:33.219> there<00:05:33.400> actually<00:05:33.819> I'm<00:05:34.509> not

00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:34.839

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
sure it says that it is I don't think it

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.639
