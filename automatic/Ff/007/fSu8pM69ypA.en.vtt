00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
few minutes in the video but I'm going

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.470 
few minutes in the video but I'm going
to<00:02:45.330> read<00:02:45.540> from<00:02:46.080> my<00:02:46.290> phone<00:02:46.530> with<00:02:47.459> this<00:02:48.209> first

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
to read from my phone with this first

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.440 
to read from my phone with this first
listed<00:02:49.110> in<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.320> bunch<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.709> different<00:02:49.830> versions

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
listed in a bunch of different versions

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.430 
listed in a bunch of different versions
and<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.570> reason<00:02:51.840> why<00:02:51.900> I'm<00:02:51.989> going<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.200> do<00:02:52.290> that

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
and the reason why I'm going to do that

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.790 
and the reason why I'm going to do that
is<00:02:52.650> because<00:02:53.250> each<00:02:53.910> version<00:02:54.330> slightly<00:02:55.320> changes

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
is because each version slightly changes

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.199 
is because each version slightly changes
the<00:02:56.580> one<00:02:56.790> word<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.330> I<00:02:57.780> feel<00:02:57.989> it's<00:02:58.170> relevant<00:02:58.770> to

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
the one word and I feel it's relevant to

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.490 
the one word and I feel it's relevant to
some<00:03:00.209> things<00:03:00.480> okay<00:03:00.840> so<00:03:01.410> if<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:03.350> chapter<00:03:04.350> 1

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
some things okay so if you chapter 1

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.220 
some things okay so if you chapter 1
verse<00:03:04.709> a<00:03:04.890> if<00:03:05.130> you<00:03:05.280> go<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.459> says<00:03:05.970> go<00:03:06.660> up<00:03:06.930> into<00:03:07.110> the
