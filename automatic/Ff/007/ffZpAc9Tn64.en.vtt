what<00:00:22.199> I'm<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.439> casing<00:00:22.800> here<00:00:22.919> is<00:00:23.009> the<00:00:23.099> x1<00:00:23.429> hybrid

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849 
what I'm so casing here is the x1 hybrid

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.099 
what I'm so casing here is the x1 hybrid
solution<00:00:24.710> it's<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.949> base<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.939> full<00:00:27.119> power<00:00:27.359> X

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109

notebook with a hybrid solution we have

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.000 
notebook with a hybrid solution we have
a<00:00:32.519> Qualcomm<00:00:33.239> Snapdragon<00:00:33.800> system<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.980> chip

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
a Qualcomm Snapdragon system on a chip

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.569 
a Qualcomm Snapdragon system on a chip
on<00:00:35.399> board<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:37.140> can<00:00:37.320> be<00:00:37.470> into<00:00:38.070> instant<00:00:38.430> media

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579

my<00:00:43.710> battery<00:00:44.180> so<00:00:45.180> effectively<00:00:46.050> what<00:00:46.229> I<00:00:46.290> do<00:00:46.379> when

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
my battery so effectively what I do when

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.310 
my battery so effectively what I do when
I<00:00:46.739> shift<00:00:46.829> into<00:00:47.190> it's<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.850> media<00:00:48.120> mode<00:00:48.300> which<00:00:49.199> I

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
I shift into it's a media mode which I

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.229 
I shift into it's a media mode which I
demonstrate<00:00:49.739> for<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:49.979> now<00:00:50.100> very<00:00:51.059> quickly

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
demonstrate for you now very quickly

demonstrate for you now very quickly
powers<00:00:51.899> down<00:00:52.110> windows<00:00:52.589> and<00:00:53.159> power<00:00:53.369> is<00:00:53.610> up<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
powers down windows and power is up the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.910 
powers down windows and power is up the
system<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.269> the<00:00:54.330> chip<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:55.260> saw<00:00:55.409> the<00:00:55.470> very<00:00:55.710> fast

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
system on the chip you saw the very fast

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.399 
system on the chip you saw the very fast
transition<00:00:56.750> only<00:00:57.750> running<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.199> system

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409 
transition only running on that system

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:00.499 
transition only running on that system
on<00:00:58.619> a<00:00:58.650> chip<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.189> that's<00:00:59.850> why<00:00:59.970> I'm<00:01:00.059> doubling<00:01:00.420> my

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:00.509 
on a chip and that's why I'm doubling my

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:01.640 
on a chip and that's why I'm doubling my
battery<00:01:00.869> life<00:01:01.019> because<00:01:01.199> they're<00:01:01.320> not<00:01:01.439> pulling

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
battery life because they're not pulling

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.670 
battery life because they're not pulling
from<00:01:01.890> windows<00:01:02.720> so<00:01:03.720> now<00:01:03.839> demonstrate<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.439> can

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
from windows so now demonstrate I can

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.910 
from windows so now demonstrate I can
watch<00:01:04.830> movies<00:01:05.100> as<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.729> music<00:01:05.820> browse<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.509> web

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
watch movies as the music browse the web

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.289 
watch movies as the music browse the web
I'm<00:01:07.920> going<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.100> go<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.549> watch<00:01:09.210> a

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
I'm going to go in and just watch a

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.410 
I'm going to go in and just watch a
movie<00:01:09.570> here<00:01:09.600> movie<00:01:10.170> clip

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.210 

all<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.259> is<00:01:13.320> being<00:01:13.590> powered<00:01:13.799> by<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
all of this is being powered by the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.429 
all of this is being powered by the
system<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.939> chimp<00:01:15.150> not<00:01:15.420> windows<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.259> this

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
system in a chimp not windows so this

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.990 
system in a chimp not windows so this
Android<00:01:16.950> that's<00:01:17.189> running<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.460> here<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:17.909> an

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
Android that's running on here it's an

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.520 
Android that's running on here it's an
oath<00:01:18.150> based<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:18.600> an<00:01:18.720> open<00:01:18.930> source<00:01:19.110> version<00:01:19.200> of

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
oath based on an open source version of

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.310 
oath based on an open source version of
Android<00:01:19.890> two<00:01:20.130> three

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
Android two three

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.890 
Android two three
so<00:01:22.680> now<00:01:22.800> I<00:01:22.830> finished<00:01:23.220> watching<00:01:23.490> my<00:01:23.730> movie<00:01:24.060> now

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
so now I finished watching my movie now

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.469 
so now I finished watching my movie now
I<00:01:24.930> want<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.170> move<00:01:25.350> back<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.740> two<00:01:26.280> windows<00:01:26.729> I'll

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
I want to move back to two windows I'll

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.290 
I want to move back to two windows I'll
exit<00:01:27.900> out<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.050> instant<00:01:28.440> media<00:01:28.530> mode<00:01:29.300> and

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
exit out of instant media mode and

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.440 
exit out of instant media mode and
you'll<00:01:30.450> see<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.630> very<00:01:30.870> fast<00:01:31.170> transition<00:01:31.710> back

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
you'll see a very fast transition back

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.290 
you'll see a very fast transition back
to<00:01:33.450> windows<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.800> now<00:01:34.950> i'm<00:01:35.100> back<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.280> windows<00:01:35.700> so

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
to windows so now i'm back in windows so

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.120 
to windows so now i'm back in windows so
effectively<00:01:36.630> woke<00:01:36.900> up<00:01:37.080> windows<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.770> it's

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
effectively woke up windows and it's

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.570 
effectively woke up windows and it's
powered<00:01:38.729> down<00:01:38.880> Davis<00:01:39.920> it's<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.979> very<00:01:41.280> fast

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
powered down Davis it's a very fast

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.690 
powered down Davis it's a very fast
transition<00:01:42.060> if<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.479> look<00:01:42.660> at<00:01:43.520> again<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
transition if you look at again the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.010 
transition if you look at again the
major<00:01:45.330> benefit<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.930> w<00:01:46.440> valley

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
major benefit is w valley

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.929 
major benefit is w valley
so<00:01:47.649> this<00:01:47.859> only<00:01:48.009> that's<00:01:48.310> coming<00:01:48.700> to<00:01:48.729> market

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
so this only that's coming to market

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.510 
so this only that's coming to market
soon<00:01:49.240> yes<00:01:49.810> it'll<00:01:50.049> be<00:01:50.170> available<00:01:50.280> late<00:01:51.280> first

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
soon yes it'll be available late first

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.500 
soon yes it'll be available late first
