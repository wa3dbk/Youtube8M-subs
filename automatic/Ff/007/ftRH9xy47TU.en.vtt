that<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.700> don't<00:01:44.909> really<00:01:45.240> care<00:01:45.360> about<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
that I don't really care about the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.719 
that I don't really care about the
t-shirt<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.439> just<00:01:46.920> because<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.280> what<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.520> says

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
t-shirt is just because of what it says

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.340 
t-shirt is just because of what it says
I<00:01:48.060> mean<00:01:48.270> if<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.720> had<00:01:48.810> some<00:01:48.990> really<00:01:49.110> cool

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
I mean if it had some really cool

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.620 
I mean if it had some really cool
graphic<00:01:49.799> on<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.399> something<00:01:51.180> relevant<00:01:51.479> to

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
graphic on it and something relevant to

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.480 
graphic on it and something relevant to
grand<00:01:51.899> theft<00:01:52.020> auto<00:01:52.200> I'd<00:01:52.770> probably<00:01:53.040> be<00:01:53.369> all

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
grand theft auto I'd probably be all

over<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.939> but<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.210> says<00:01:54.390> killem<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.409> tract<00:01:55.710> is

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860
