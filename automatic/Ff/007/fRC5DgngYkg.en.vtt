00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.170
 hello to you on this channel as 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.050
 always bathead and now I would like you 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.340
 tell and show the figure of batman 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.500
 arches of the city namely the b figure on 3 7 and 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.630
 why exactly the answer of the series so because 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.240
 that the figures of the first two series are not 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.890
 like a lot less in the first place a lot 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.210
 zones of articulation and in general it is not that 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.460
 3 series 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.460
 yes it is perfect in this regard 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.149
 option well let's look at this 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.020
 the figure is closer here actually itself 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.329
 the figure and behind us show what kind 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.989
 there are also figures in this series 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.559
 in addition to batman, we see al here 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.809
 buzz 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:56.870
 two clowns azrael and penguin 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.870
 let's actually open the box 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:16.060
 besides the figure itself there is such 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.210
 here is the liner which is exactly the same to us 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.740
 demonstrates 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:28.910
 figures of the second series is Harley Quinn 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:33.590
 batman without a mask robin hush riddler one 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:40.750
 moment and accordingly batman detective 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:43.670
 mod well and the mad hatter and batman 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:48.250
 sample detective mod looks wrong 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:52.280
 cool he say so gleaming blue 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:56.030
 Well, well, Batman without a mask looks in 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.930
 principle pretty not bad here 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:04.100
 as you see when unpacking i'm a little 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:10.899
 slit this pamphlet but let's 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.899
 let 's begin to consider the figure itself 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:36.450
 finally i got it and what 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.609
 say figure just awesome 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:44.760
 really it is probably the biggest 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:48.280
 the figurine in my cloak collection is just 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:53.439
 chic he is really cool on 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:56.530
 touch tires really cool smell 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:57.909
 he is like rubber 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.549
 no big deal 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:06.129
 head moves in different directions 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:09.430
 scrolls all 360 degrees 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:14.919
 well worth noting great 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.000
 detailing and painting does not work 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:20.609
 outlines 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:25.049
 everything is painted perfect really it 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:28.959
 almost identical figure of batman 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.939
 regarding your gaming prototype that 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.970
 It concerns the material from which 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:36.159
 the figurine of tone is made to touch it not less 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.290
 pleasant than crying crying by the way is very 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.389
 soft and therefore 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.909
 batman's arms in the movements he's not 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:48.430
 limits what can be noted 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:50.979
 regarding articulation zones then they 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.699
 are located only in the main places like 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:58.959
 you see that is nothing superfluous and this 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:04:01.750
 Very well in the kit also went here 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:05.949
 such a thing you yourself know what it is 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.709
 without me but as for me the kit better 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:13.030
 would put a betarang or something in it 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.689
 kind but also looks pretty 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.979
 not bad 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:20.229
 and if you insert a gel feeder 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:24.520
 so let's say in batman's hand then he will 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:28.419
 look even better but probably 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.860
 and maybe it will not be but definitely will 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:36.310
 if you love day 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:39.349
 true what is the figure i'm very pleased with it 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.460
 really perfect decoration for 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:43.610
 my shelves 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:46.009
 the figure looks very cool and therefore 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.789
 I am thinking of buying myself something else from 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:53.479
 this series but you just take a look at this 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:55.389
 well this is great what u 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:05:01.069
 him press 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:06.560
 which pumped chest which biceps in 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:08.240
 general yes the figure is good yes about it all with
