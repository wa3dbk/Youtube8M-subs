you can see when you hit the bottom the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.850 
you can see when you hit the bottom the
widgets<00:00:36.360> kind<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.660> turn<00:00:36.960> there's<00:00:37.590> some<00:00:37.710> really

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860

interesting yeah it's just a really kind
of<00:00:40.920> interesting<00:00:41.370> integration<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:41.969> we<00:00:42.090> see

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
of interesting integration that we see

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.720 
of interesting integration that we see
here<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:43.070> unification<00:00:44.070> bar<00:00:44.250> does<00:00:44.430> come<00:00:44.640> from

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
here the unification bar does come from

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.700 
here the unification bar does come from
the<00:00:44.820> bottom<00:00:45.090> which<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.629> great<00:00:46.079> for<00:00:46.379> one-handed

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
the bottom which is great for one-handed

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
card this is a 4G device we have a looks

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.479 
card this is a 4G device we have a looks
to<00:01:03.570> be<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> full-size<00:01:04.140> USP<00:01:04.680> or<00:01:04.920> as<00:01:05.129> probably

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
to be a full-size USP or as probably

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.609 
to be a full-size USP or as probably
micro<00:01:05.850> because<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.119> quite<00:01:06.299> thin

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.590 

oh<00:01:09.649> yeah<00:01:10.399> micro<00:01:10.789> of<00:01:10.909> course<00:01:11.119> it's<00:01:11.270> Micra<00:01:11.570> I

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
oh yeah micro of course it's Micra I

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.609 
oh yeah micro of course it's Micra I
don't<00:01:11.750> know<00:01:11.810> what<00:01:11.960> I<00:01:11.990> was<00:01:12.140> thinking

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
don't know what I was thinking

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.230 
don't know what I was thinking
microUSB<00:01:13.460> if<00:01:13.579> we<00:01:13.640> take<00:01:13.729> a<00:01:13.820> look<00:01:13.939> around<00:01:14.179> the

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
microUSB if we take a look around the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.399 
microUSB if we take a look around the
other<00:01:14.299> side<00:01:14.600> you<00:01:14.780> can<00:01:14.899> see<00:01:15.049> that<00:01:15.200> we<00:01:15.289> have<00:01:15.380> a

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
other side you can see that we have a

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.830 
other side you can see that we have a
power<00:01:15.710> button<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.070> a<00:01:16.850> volume<00:01:16.880> rocker<00:01:17.240> I<00:01:17.689> like

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
power button and a volume rocker I like

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.209 
power button and a volume rocker I like
to<00:01:17.960> see<00:01:18.109> these<00:01:18.229> lower<00:01:18.409> down<00:01:18.649> power<00:01:18.920> buttons

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
to see these lower down power buttons

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:20.230 
to see these lower down power buttons
are<00:01:19.280> a<00:01:19.310> little<00:01:19.490> more<00:01:19.609> convenient<00:01:19.880> to<00:01:20.090> hold

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
are a little more convenient to hold

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.550 
are a little more convenient to hold
around<00:01:21.109> the<00:01:21.170> top<00:01:21.409> we<00:01:21.649> have<00:01:21.679> a<00:01:22.299> stylus<00:01:23.299> so<00:01:23.719> this

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
around the top we have a stylus so this

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.219 
around the top we have a stylus so this
is<00:01:25.100> oh<00:01:25.490> it's<00:01:26.000> an<00:01:26.119> antenna<00:01:26.360> for<00:01:26.630> dvb-t

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
is oh it's an antenna for dvb-t

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.790 
is oh it's an antenna for dvb-t
yeah<00:01:27.500> because<00:01:27.619> this<00:01:27.799> is<00:01:27.979> a

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
yeah because this is a

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.900 
yeah because this is a
this<00:01:30.580> is<00:01:30.700> a<00:01:30.840> Japanese<00:01:31.840> device<00:01:32.440> so<00:01:33.400> yeah<00:01:33.580> so<00:01:33.850> it

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
this is a Japanese device so yeah so it

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.450 
this is a Japanese device so yeah so it
definitely<00:01:34.240> has<00:01:34.480> access<00:01:34.870> to<00:01:34.900> TV<00:01:35.260> let's<00:01:36.190> see<00:01:36.370> on

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
definitely has access to TV let's see on

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.110 
definitely has access to TV let's see on
this<00:01:36.610> side<00:01:36.850> here<00:01:37.810> we<00:01:37.990> have<00:01:38.200> this<00:01:38.350> stylus<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.970> on

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
this side here we have this stylus so on

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.310 
this side here we have this stylus so on
the<00:01:40.240> back<00:01:40.390> you<00:01:40.540> can<00:01:40.630> see<00:01:40.750> there<00:01:40.900> is<00:01:40.990> an<00:01:41.080> LED

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
the back you can see there is an LED
