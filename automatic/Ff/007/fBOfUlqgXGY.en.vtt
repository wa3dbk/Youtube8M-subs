00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.900
 change the phone battery 5 then 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.500
 first you need to unscrew these 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.250
 two torx screws with a screwdriver like this 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.250
 pentagonal 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:45.130
 here it is, now you need a sucker 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:47.470
 and a little thought in practice 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:51.120
 first always remember to 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:54.610
 turn off the phone to avoid damage 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.640
 then now place the suction cup on the 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:03.330
 side began to pull not 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.330

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.050

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.490
 side 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:40.510
