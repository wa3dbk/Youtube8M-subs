wearing this Rose a lot so this is a big
difference<00:00:46.199> because<00:00:46.379> my<00:00:46.769> connection<00:00:47.249> bras

00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:47.429 
difference because my connection bras

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:49.430 
difference because my connection bras
are<00:00:47.760> lower<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> front<00:00:49.050> they<00:00:49.229> have

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359 
significantly narrower underwires that

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.450 
significantly narrower underwires that
are<00:00:51.449> also<00:00:51.600> lower<00:00:51.929> on<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> sides<00:00:52.409> and<00:00:52.889> this

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
are also lower on the sides and this

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.669 
are also lower on the sides and this
Rose<00:00:53.699> definitely<00:00:54.329> more<00:00:54.659> into<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.440> full

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679

having<00:00:58.379> said<00:00:58.499> that<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.949> fitness<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.549> pretty

having said that the fitness is pretty

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.869 
having said that the fitness is pretty
good<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.809> found<00:01:01.319> that<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.739> underwires<00:01:02.249> are<00:01:02.670> not

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
good I found that the underwires are not

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.479 
good I found that the underwires are not
quite<00:01:03.659> as<00:01:03.899> wide<00:01:04.140> back<00:01:04.470> as<00:01:04.650> women<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.129> styles

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
quite as wide back as women on styles

quite as wide back as women on styles
I've<00:01:05.610> tried<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:05.970> past<00:01:06.180> they're<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:06.870> as

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
I've tried in the past they're not as

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.800 
I've tried in the past they're not as
narrow<00:01:07.320> as<00:01:07.440> I<00:01:07.710> prefer<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:08.759> I<00:01:09.090> do<00:01:09.149> feel<00:01:09.570> like

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
narrow as I prefer but I do feel like

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.510 
narrow as I prefer but I do feel like
these<00:01:09.930> are<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.140> comfortable<00:01:10.619> width<00:01:10.740> for<00:01:11.039> me<00:01:11.189> and

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
these are a comfortable width for me and

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.270 
these are a comfortable width for me and
one<00:01:12.149> that<00:01:12.329> is<00:01:12.420> not<00:01:12.630> actually<00:01:13.350> like<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
one that is not actually like the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.190 
one that is not actually like the
Jasmine<00:01:14.640> MV<00:01:14.969> in<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.329> has<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.479> side<00:01:15.750> panel

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.289 
Jasmine MV in that it has a side panel
I<00:01:16.229> feel<00:01:16.439> like<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.710> fabric<00:01:17.250> here<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.820> almost

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
I feel like this fabric here is almost

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.330 
I feel like this fabric here is almost
stiff<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.869> shallow<00:01:19.140> enough<00:01:19.469> to<00:01:19.530> simulate<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
stiff and shallow enough to simulate the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.190 
stiff and shallow enough to simulate the
side<00:01:20.549> panel<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.359> do<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> lot<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.869> forward

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
side panel so I do a lot of forward

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.749 
side panel so I do a lot of forward
projection<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:22.950> move<00:01:23.070> my<00:01:23.130> arms<00:01:23.549> without

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
projection I can move my arms without

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.969 
projection I can move my arms without
having<00:01:24.090> any<00:01:24.240> issues<00:01:24.630> here<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.530> do<00:01:25.590> like

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
having any issues here and I do like

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.490 
having any issues here and I do like
that<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:27.000> shape<00:01:27.210> isn't<00:01:27.570> bad<00:01:27.719> if<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.259> feel

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
that the shape isn't bad if you feel

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.109 
that the shape isn't bad if you feel
like<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:28.920> blazing<00:01:29.340> apart<00:01:29.609> a<00:01:29.729> little<00:01:29.909> bit

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
like it's blazing apart a little bit

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.609 
like it's blazing apart a little bit
more<00:01:30.359> than<00:01:30.539> I<00:01:30.630> would<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:30.810> but<00:01:31.200> it's

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
more than I would like but it's

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.169 
more than I would like but it's
definitely<00:01:32.219> nothing<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.729> par<00:01:32.909> with<00:01:32.939> what<00:01:33.149> I

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
definitely nothing on par with what I

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:34.730 
definitely nothing on par with what I
have<00:01:33.390> experienced<00:01:33.869> from<00:01:34.049> panache<00:01:34.289> hauls<00:01:34.590> in

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
have experienced from panache hauls in

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.099 
have experienced from panache hauls in
the<00:01:34.770> past<00:01:35.039> and<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:36.270> find<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.840> overall

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109 
the past and I find that the overall

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:39.080 
the past and I find that the overall
shape<00:01:37.350> even<00:01:37.590> from<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.859> side<00:01:38.039> is<00:01:38.250> very<00:01:38.460> lifted

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
shape even from the side is very lifted

center or come over the top now the
materials<00:01:57.390> are<00:01:57.450> very<00:01:57.479> nice<00:01:57.810> they<00:01:58.289> use<00:01:58.619> their

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
materials are very nice they use their

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.330 
materials are very nice they use their
standard<00:01:59.820> felted<00:02:00.270> strap<00:02:00.600> which<00:02:01.439> as<00:02:01.679> much<00:02:02.100> as<00:02:02.219> I

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
standard felted strap which as much as I

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.289 
standard felted strap which as much as I
like<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.759> because<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.060> does<00:02:03.179> feel

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
like that because it does feel

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.760 
like that because it does feel
comfortable<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.869> front<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.259> also<00:02:04.409> find

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
comfortable in the front I also find

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.380 
comfortable in the front I also find
it's<00:02:04.920> frustrating<00:02:05.369> because<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.909> lot<00:02:06.179> of<00:02:06.210> women

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
it's frustrating because a lot of women

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.380 
it's frustrating because a lot of women
need<00:02:06.749> a<00:02:06.899> fully<00:02:07.109> adjustable<00:02:07.530> strap<00:02:07.859> and

need a fully adjustable strap and
like<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:09.660> there's<00:02:09.929> no<00:02:10.140> where<00:02:10.319> they<00:02:10.710> can<00:02:10.860> go

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
like this there's no where they can go

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.220 
like this there's no where they can go
if<00:02:11.310> they<00:02:11.430> need<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.640> go<00:02:11.819> further<00:02:12.180> than<00:02:12.630> what<00:02:13.020> the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
if they need to go further than what the

if they need to go further than what the
disability<00:02:13.770> is<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:15.030> wings<00:02:15.420> are<00:02:15.600> also<00:02:15.690> nice

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
disability is the wings are also nice

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.300 
disability is the wings are also nice

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
and firm I feel like that's a great

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.370 
and firm I feel like that's a great
thing<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.790> make<00:02:17.940> sure<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:19.020> don't<00:02:19.170> have

the bra the material of the cups is also

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.810 
the bra the material of the cups is also
on<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.230> firmer<00:02:25.620> side<00:02:25.650> but<00:02:26.130> still<00:02:26.310> very<00:02:26.340> soft

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
on the firmer side but still very soft

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.660 
on the firmer side but still very soft
and<00:02:26.970> comfortable<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.750> would<00:02:28.620> kind<00:02:29.100> of<00:02:29.250> liking

and comfortable I would kind of liking

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.550 
and comfortable I would kind of liking
it<00:02:29.850> actually<00:02:30.420> more<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.810> wards<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.910> Jasmine

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
it actually more to wards of the Jasmine

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.620 
it actually more to wards of the Jasmine
envy<00:02:34.560> side<00:02:34.890> except<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.550> exterior<00:02:36.300> this<00:02:36.450> is

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
envy side except the exterior this is

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.410 
envy side except the exterior this is

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
very very smooth it's very soft the top

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.470 
very very smooth it's very soft the top
cup<00:02:39.780> unlike<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.709> Jasmine<00:02:41.220> Envy<00:02:41.489> it<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:42.180> not<00:02:42.450> a

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
cup unlike the Jasmine Envy it is not a

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.210 
cup unlike the Jasmine Envy it is not a
stretch<00:02:42.750> lace<00:02:42.989> and<00:02:43.020> I<00:02:43.200> knew<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.739> going<00:02:43.890> into

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
stretch lace and I knew that going into

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.190 
stretch lace and I knew that going into
it<00:02:44.430> but<00:02:44.520> I<00:02:44.580> still<00:02:44.880> feel<00:02:45.150> like<00:02:45.180> this<00:02:45.660> bra

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
it but I still feel like this bra

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.340 
it but I still feel like this bra
approximates<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.400> idea<00:02:47.820> of<00:02:48.180> those<00:02:49.019> styles

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
approximates the idea of those styles

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.470 
approximates the idea of those styles
without<00:02:50.160> necessarily<00:02:50.700> having<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.360> be

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
without necessarily having to be

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.100 
without necessarily having to be
identical<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.260> them<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:53.190> cup<00:02:53.519> itself<00:02:53.850> is<00:02:54.150> got

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
identical to them the cup itself is got

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.540 
identical to them the cup itself is got
enough<00:02:55.410> depth<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:55.950> think<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.400> would<00:02:56.519> work

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
enough depth that I think it would work

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.240 
enough depth that I think it would work
for<00:02:57.120> women<00:02:57.780> who<00:02:57.900> are<00:02:58.110> either<00:02:58.470> bottom<00:02:58.980> heavier
