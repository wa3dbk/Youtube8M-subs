more times for a total of five and then
switching<00:01:09.720> sides

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
switching sides

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.190 
switching sides
see<00:01:11.670> how<00:01:11.820> Z<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.150> really<00:01:12.450> rotating<00:01:12.930> through<00:01:13.080> her

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
see how Z is really rotating through her

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.110 
see how Z is really rotating through her
rib<00:01:13.350> cage<00:01:13.380> that's<00:01:14.160> how<00:01:14.430> you're<00:01:14.580> gonna<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:14.910> the

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
rib cage that's how you're gonna get the

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.450 
rib cage that's how you're gonna get the
oblique<00:01:15.390> work<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.590> perfect<00:01:17.190> exercise

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
oblique work this is a perfect exercise

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.670 
oblique work this is a perfect exercise
for<00:01:17.909> targeting<00:01:18.300> the<00:01:18.420> muffin<00:01:18.720> top<00:01:18.870> well<00:01:19.440> then

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
for targeting the muffin top well then

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.440 
for targeting the muffin top well then
let's<00:01:19.860> do<00:01:20.010> a<00:01:20.040> more<00:01:20.280> advanced<00:01:20.700> version<00:01:20.760> and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
let's do a more advanced version and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.420 
let's do a more advanced version and
build<00:01:21.690> on<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.050> twist<00:01:22.440> we're<00:01:23.100> gonna<00:01:23.220> do

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
build on that twist we're gonna do

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.730 
build on that twist we're gonna do
remove<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:23.970> call<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.540> leg<00:01:24.780> thread<00:01:25.140> so

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
remove that we call the leg thread so

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.810 
remove that we call the leg thread so
you're<00:01:25.830> gonna<00:01:25.920> reach<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.310> leg<00:01:26.460> up<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.790> the
