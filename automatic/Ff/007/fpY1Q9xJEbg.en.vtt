00:00:04.329 --> 00:00:04.339 
okay got her with video requests for

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.280 
okay got her with video requests for
instructions<00:00:05.339> on<00:00:05.549> hooking<00:00:05.970> up<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:07.670> 6650

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290 
instructions on hooking up the 6650

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.220 
instructions on hooking up the 6650
single<00:00:10.290> cylinder<00:00:10.650> talk<00:00:10.980> ometer<00:00:12.019> so<00:00:13.019> what<00:00:13.110> I

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
single cylinder talk ometer so what I

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.700 
single cylinder talk ometer so what I
did<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:14.540> kind<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.599> took<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.870> instructions

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
did is I kind of took the instructions

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.609 
did is I kind of took the instructions
and<00:00:17.010> kind<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:18.029> large<00:00:18.690> them<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.140> bit<00:00:19.350> so

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
and kind of and large them a bit so

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.700 
and kind of and large them a bit so
they're<00:00:19.740> easy<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.100> read<00:00:20.960> you<00:00:21.960> take<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> look<00:00:22.560> at

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
they're easy to read you take a look at

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.210 
they're easy to read you take a look at
that<00:00:23.359> and<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.900> will<00:00:25.050> start<00:00:25.260> white<00:00:25.619> that

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
that and it will start white that

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.179 
that and it will start white that
actually<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.789> your<00:00:27.029> light<00:00:27.560> the<00:00:28.560> ring<00:00:28.859> there's

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
actually is your light the ring there's

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.220 
actually is your light the ring there's
a<00:00:29.250> ring<00:00:29.490> all<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.670> way<00:00:29.789> around<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.390> tack<00:00:30.689> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
a ring all the way around the tack the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.479 
a ring all the way around the tack the
dial<00:00:31.500> face<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.910> lights<00:00:33.149> up<00:00:33.390> for<00:00:33.660> at<00:00:33.750> night

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
dial face and it lights up for at night

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.130 
dial face and it lights up for at night
for<00:00:35.489> low<00:00:35.640> light<00:00:35.850> red<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.780> your<00:00:36.930> power

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
for low light red is your power

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.190 
for low light red is your power
obviously<00:00:37.879> goes<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.090> your<00:00:39.210> battery<00:00:39.510> as<00:00:40.140> well

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
obviously goes to your battery as well

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.139 
obviously goes to your battery as well
as<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.620> light<00:00:40.829> you'd<00:00:41.610> have<00:00:41.790> two<00:00:41.969> different

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
as the light you'd have two different

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.470 
as the light you'd have two different
switches<00:00:42.899> which<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.100> best<00:00:44.430> because<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.360> have

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
switches which is best because you have

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.209 
switches which is best because you have
a<00:00:45.510> fuse<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> red<00:00:46.469> which<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.829> your<00:00:46.980> power

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
a fuse for the red which in your power

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.029 
a fuse for the red which in your power
to<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:48.300> tach<00:00:49.910> need<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.000> run<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> fuse<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.039> they

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
to the tach need to run a fuse and they

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.610 
to the tach need to run a fuse and they
don't<00:00:53.219> supply<00:00:53.520> one<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.930> fuse<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.230> need

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
don't supply one and the fuse you need

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.430 
don't supply one and the fuse you need
is<00:00:55.800> down<00:00:56.039> here<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.640> I'll<00:00:56.760> focus<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:58.260> might

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
is down here so I'll focus in that might

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.799 
is down here so I'll focus in that might
have<00:00:58.590> changed<00:00:58.980> though<00:00:59.219> my-my<00:01:00.090> tach<00:01:00.359> was<00:01:00.600> made

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
have changed though my-my tach was made

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.039 
have changed though my-my tach was made
in<00:01:00.930> 2003<00:01:01.820> it<00:01:02.820> might<00:01:03.059> be<00:01:03.329> different

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
in 2003 it might be different

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.070 
in 2003 it might be different
instructions<00:01:04.830> now<00:01:05.450> but<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.600> basically<00:01:06.960> a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
instructions now but it's basically a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.250 
instructions now but it's basically a
one<00:01:07.320> amp<00:01:07.560> fuse<00:01:07.920> or<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.790> three<00:01:09.210> AG<00:01:09.659> that's<00:01:09.960> like<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
one amp fuse or a three AG that's like a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.130 
one amp fuse or a three AG that's like a
part<00:01:10.560> number<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.159> then<00:01:11.610> they<00:01:11.760> also<00:01:11.880> say<00:01:12.689> you

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
part number and then they also say you

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.590 
part number and then they also say you
could<00:01:13.320> use<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:14.810> 312<00:01:15.810> that's<00:01:16.500> also<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.210> fuse<00:01:18.210> model

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
could use a 312 that's also a fuse model

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.039 
could use a 312 that's also a fuse model
number<00:01:19.220> but<00:01:20.220> um

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
number but um

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.660 
number but um
anyway<00:01:22.490> just<00:01:23.490> look<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.210> over

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
anyway just look that over

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.160 
anyway just look that over
and<00:01:26.670> then<00:01:27.000> back<00:01:27.329> to<00:01:27.359> here<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:29.509> black<00:01:30.509> to

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
and then back to here we have black to

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.359 
and then back to here we have black to
ground<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.679> battery<00:01:32.009> you're<00:01:32.189> definitely

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
ground on battery you're definitely

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.029 
ground on battery you're definitely
going<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.729> need<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.909> 12-volt<00:01:33.420> source<00:01:34.039> doesn't

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
going to need a 12-volt source doesn't

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.179 
going to need a 12-volt source doesn't
have<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.310> be<00:01:35.429> high<00:01:35.609> you<00:01:36.270> could<00:01:36.420> probably<00:01:37.189> get

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
have to be high you could probably get

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.099 
have to be high you could probably get
away<00:01:38.280> with<00:01:38.429> the<00:01:38.759> toilet<00:01:39.149> like<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.299> battery<00:01:39.780> pack

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:40.109 
away with the toilet like a battery pack

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:45.069 
away with the toilet like a battery pack
but<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:40.829> make<00:01:41.009> sure<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.280> 12<00:01:41.579> volts<00:01:41.969> and

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.559 

make<00:01:46.079> sure<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.319> got<00:01:46.469> a<00:01:46.500> fuse<00:01:46.860> too<00:01:47.329> of<00:01:48.329> course

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
make sure you got a fuse too of course

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.910 
make sure you got a fuse too of course

ghost<00:02:24.599> there<00:02:24.870> this<00:02:25.799> is<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.190> one<00:02:26.400> step<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:26.819> I

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
ghost there this is the one step that I

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.720 
ghost there this is the one step that I
I<00:02:27.629> think<00:02:28.079> I<00:02:28.170> miss<00:02:28.500> cuz<00:02:28.829> my<00:02:29.010> tach<00:02:29.310> wasn't

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
I think I miss cuz my tach wasn't

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.240 
I think I miss cuz my tach wasn't
working<00:02:30.030> at<00:02:30.180> first<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.900> thought<00:02:31.079> I<00:02:31.410> thought

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
working at first and I thought I thought

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.670 
working at first and I thought I thought
it<00:02:32.400> might<00:02:32.609> have<00:02:32.700> been<00:02:32.760> bad<00:02:33.090> but<00:02:33.389> it<00:02:33.680> this

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
it might have been bad but it this

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.759 
it might have been bad but it this
little<00:02:35.010> step<00:02:35.310> here<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:35.910> didn't<00:02:36.269> read

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
little step here that I didn't read

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.160 
little step here that I didn't read
because<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:37.889> didn't<00:02:38.600> you<00:02:39.600> know<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:39.750> didn't<00:02:39.989> read

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
because I didn't you know I didn't read

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.420 
because I didn't you know I didn't read
it<00:02:40.200> they're<00:02:40.500> good<00:02:40.829> engine<00:02:41.400> ground<00:02:41.700> and

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
it they're good engine ground and

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.009 
it they're good engine ground and
basically<00:02:44.430> this<00:02:44.730> black<00:02:45.060> wire<00:02:45.359> from<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.660> tack

basically this black wire from the tack

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.900 
basically this black wire from the tack

Briggs ignition coils so hopefully

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.319 
Briggs ignition coils so hopefully
that's<00:03:54.230> easier<00:03:54.859> to<00:03:55.010> understand<00:03:55.579> and<00:03:56.030> I'm<00:03:56.150> sure

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
that's easier to understand and I'm sure

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:57.640 
that's easier to understand and I'm sure
there's<00:03:56.540> a<00:03:56.599> copy<00:03:56.930> of<00:03:57.169> this<00:03:57.290> on<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.620> internet

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.030 
there's a copy of this on the internet
you<00:03:58.250> do<00:03:58.400> Google<00:03:58.669> search<00:03:59.200> and<00:04:00.200> I'm<00:04:00.680> sure<00:04:00.919> you

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
you do Google search and I'm sure you

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.920 
you do Google search and I'm sure you
search<00:04:01.310> through<00:04:01.579> images<00:04:02.209> and<00:04:02.480> you'll

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
search through images and you'll

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.860 
search through images and you'll
probably<00:04:03.079> find<00:04:03.290> this<00:04:03.709> on<00:04:03.919> there<00:04:04.099> somewhere<00:04:04.870> so

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
probably find this on there somewhere so

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.409 
probably find this on there somewhere so
that's<00:04:06.109> it
