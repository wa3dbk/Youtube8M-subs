00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
going to cut out or the children are

going to cut out the red I'm sorry the
green<00:02:30.209> leave<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.379> brown<00:02:31.650> stem<00:02:32.629> for<00:02:33.629> that

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
green leave and the brown stem for that

all<00:02:36.209> image<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.599> can<00:02:36.750> kind<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:36.989> get<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.200> idea

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
all image you can kind of get the idea

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.979 
all image you can kind of get the idea
that<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.799> plate<00:02:38.010> would<00:02:38.190> be<00:02:38.660> mostly<00:02:39.660> covered

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
that the plate would be mostly covered

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.880 
that the plate would be mostly covered
with<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.110> red<00:02:40.580> torn<00:02:41.580> paper<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:43.170> for<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.650> stem

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
with a red torn paper and for the stem

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.910 
with a red torn paper and for the stem
you<00:02:44.280> just<00:02:45.030> make<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.209> little<00:02:45.480> cut<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.470> children

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
you just make a little cut and children

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.020 
you just make a little cut and children
can<00:02:47.010> do<00:02:47.130> this<00:02:47.280> as<00:02:47.459> well<00:02:49.400> just<00:02:50.400> make<00:02:50.519> some<00:02:50.819> kind

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
can do this as well just make some kind

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.240 
can do this as well just make some kind
of<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.120> stem<00:02:51.360> shape<00:02:51.720> some<00:02:52.620> people<00:02:52.890> like<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.010> put

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
of a stem shape some people like to put

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.160 
of a stem shape some people like to put
the<00:02:53.370> stems<00:02:53.610> behind<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.329> paper<00:02:54.510> plates<00:02:54.810> but<00:02:55.110> I

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
the stems behind the paper plates but I

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.350 
the stems behind the paper plates but I
think<00:02:55.440> it's<00:02:55.560> easier<00:02:55.950> for<00:02:56.099> children<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.549> glue

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
think it's easier for children to glue

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.180 
think it's easier for children to glue
them<00:02:57.510> right<00:02:57.540> on<00:02:57.810> top<00:02:58.019> of<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.380> Apple<00:02:58.799> so<00:02:59.040> they

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
them right on top of the Apple so they

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.650 
them right on top of the Apple so they
can<00:02:59.340> either<00:02:59.459> put<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.760> glue<00:03:00.030> on<00:03:00.060> top<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.599> the

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
can either put the glue on top of the

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.680 
can either put the glue on top of the
red<00:03:00.780> paper<00:03:00.989> or<00:03:01.319> on<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.799> brown<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.970> then<00:03:03.599> they

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
red paper or on the brown and then they

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.650 
red paper or on the brown and then they
would<00:03:03.810> press<00:03:04.049> that<00:03:04.230> on<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:05.299> then<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.420> same

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
would press that on and then the same

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.229 
would press that on and then the same
thing<00:03:06.930> for<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.379> leaf<00:03:07.530> shape<00:03:07.829> they<00:03:08.790> would<00:03:08.940> take

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
thing for the leaf shape they would take

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.300 
thing for the leaf shape they would take
their<00:03:09.450> paper<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.530> make<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.680> leaf<00:03:10.890> shape<00:03:11.099> as

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
their paper and make a leaf shape as

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.729 
their paper and make a leaf shape as
best<00:03:11.519> as<00:03:11.640> they<00:03:11.670> can<00:03:15.140> and<00:03:16.140> then<00:03:16.349> they<00:03:16.560> could

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
best as they can and then they could

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.920 
best as they can and then they could
glue<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:17.190> on<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:18.239> their<00:03:18.390> paper<00:03:18.599> plate<00:03:20.930> like

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
glue that on to their paper plate like

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.370 
glue that on to their paper plate like
so<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:23.010> again<00:03:23.700> these<00:03:23.790> are<00:03:23.970> really<00:03:24.269> cute<00:03:24.569> hung

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
so and again these are really cute hung
