00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970
 high tech or son and vanessa for 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.970
 a new video 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.410
 I'm thrilled I finally it's 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.849
 the purchase I wanted to make since 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.670
 now six months 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.990
 it's really crazy stuff 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.279
 know well those who know the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.070
 chain I have a lot of fantasies 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.750
 that I tried a lot I like 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.760
 a lot i appreciate your i like 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.930
 less and I thought I had too much 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.699
 I do not need to buy 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.349
 a new 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.060
 it's done, I like to buy it 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.529
 pie background that I wanted since 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.780
 long time and so I'm going to make you a 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.950
 review on this foundation is based 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.460
 theme I'm finally going to the real ones 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.340
 progeny 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.809
 it is the visionary soil of lancÃ´me 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.090
 so there is in this way that is 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.149
 really beautiful and really make 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.770
 magazines that I love packaging side is 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.379
 really he is as beautiful outside as 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.620
 in here so here you can see a 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.840
 visionary of lancome it is a duet 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.719
 do you have a concealer and the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.850
 son so hand I louvre a little long 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.510
 red I'm in the head but prowl 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.510
 to rabbits ten years 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.909
 and here's the foundation it is 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.920
 beautiful really the packaging is 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.189
 just perfect I show you he's getting 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.070
 present like that it is in two parts 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:23.009
 so at the top you have the corrector a 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.960
 precision corrector it blows like that 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.759
 so there you have a little mirror for 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.080
 apply and there you have correctors 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.659
 who is top 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.670
 it is very common is what there is 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.380
 good with this range with this 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.439
 particular dyed background is that 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.540
 integrates care that is to say that the 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.670
 care of a visionary who passes all the 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.470
 time the lancome TV is integrated 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.540
 in his stamp the concealer that is 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.040
 here you ask about acne spots or 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.259
 other than you have pears and 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.180
 consorts it reduces the poles after 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.740
 four weeks 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.210
 he is excellent here 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.490
 then by ego in the foundation you 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.810
 just have to lift his so do 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.430
 part with that in your bag if you 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.570
 want to do some editing and where you 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.900
 have the foundation that is only a 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.300
 excellent little item too that contains 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.190
 a little maso molecules and reduces him the 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.480
 ports it improves the appearance of the skin or 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.820
 four weeks is perfect 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.590
 really i was looking i'm looking for all the 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.850
 time the perfect foundation I have 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.160
 tried quite a few others no longer 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.470
 other than that so that's where I mix and 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.660
 everything is this one definitely 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.430
 part of my top five i got you to do 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.480
 still a ground video because 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.860
 that for me the foundation is this 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.480
 that there is more important in make-up 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.670
 it's really the backdrop if 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.010
 is not a text by hardly the age the 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.870
 wear one at the 18 o'clock at the hour 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.240
 I am from the video and I wore them 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.240
 all day long he still has what 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.530
 it is really impeccable and you have 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.990
 need very little to make up 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.390
 I personally put that on the 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.320
 outline of the mouth and on the tasks 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.840
 then I apply leak I need 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.150
 of a chip I made up a chip 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.620
 and the brush I assure you that I 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.760
 do not always take makeup limit me 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.239
 still remains for the moment with a 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.250
 pschitt 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.840
 and yet I put a lot of background 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.650
 complexion I really want it to be 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.810
 impeccable 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.370
 I can really plaster but 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.040
 I would like at least that foundation 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.420
 that's good covering because I have 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.090
 had acne so I have some tasks with 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.070
 this one is extremely coherent but 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.769
 what's so good is that they 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.510
 do very naturally told you do 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.460
 really bare skin effect it's 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.560
 to learn table 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.230
 that's down to size for real 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.620
 I have never done any journals on a 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.230
 product especially this one goes 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.030
 give really call it is perfect 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.260
 I am in the table number 12 self 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.630
 far off like mine it's called 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.690
 members there are five shades for them 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.280
 blacks are stretching to really 8 I bought 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.930
 also to encourage them to 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.580
 flowers said that's it's fine continue 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.400
 the blacks you know that there are exactly 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.030
 30 min 36 shades of black hues 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.560
 say white 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.030
 so when she is plugged this time 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.020
 reason all their complaint or not of 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.210
 sweets made 5 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.180
 it's already very well really the usual 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.740
 are 2 maximum 3 if he really dream 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.970
 there is a dark hue for the half-breeds and 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.650
 that's all we're doing and 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:06.210
 between the two most of the time it's 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.500
 this bravo really bravo slow rom and me 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.690
 I used it a week ago that 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.950
 I use now when I 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.570
 removes make-up I think my favorite 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.040
 kawa is not tired is not mugging 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.630
 when I take it all day I 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.820
 not after a few hours 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.010
 feeling of having had face foundation 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.080
 it really is my skin it is very smooth 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.760
 as a right to ask yourself after 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.250
 a few minutes the dry and y is 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.680
 perfect and it is extremely bright 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.050
 and does not divide the skin at all it is 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.060
 really he is really good really 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.690
 he has everything I like in a background of 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.030
 dyed and costs 57 euros - with the la 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.740
 reduction that I had at sephora I 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.570
 could see 1.45 so I took advantage 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.590
 insofar as at sephora and finally 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.420
 for blacks 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.250
 I had already asked the wind to 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.630
 sephora as soon as he came out and show 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.520
 badly received as the name that had 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.470
 exactly dictates jeans for blacks 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.040
 whereas there are 15 and 15.5 for the 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.990
 blacks 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.010
 but that's wrong it does not do you 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.810
 can you go to the galleries 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.920
 lafayette his wii of a you will find 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.420
 maybe some state funds for them 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.410
 mac head only in paris this is not the case 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.129
 but me in marseille i got 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.639
 informed 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:06.270
 we say and that toulouse I saw that 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.679
 for blacks 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.149
 and since I had less than 20% jumped 

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:10.679
 I'm straight, you say it's the moment 

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:12.360
 since the time I came htg 

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:13.949
 to buy and I'm not disappointed so 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.360
 really here it's back to school if you 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.399
 look for a big amount for the return 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.509
 I already made a video where I 

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:21.800
 was training the foundations for the 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:24.539
 back who are very good it does not change 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.669
 I could integrate this one and it will be 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.559
 definitely in October's favorites 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.330
 that's going on you've loved my 

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:31.769
 video i hope will help you in a choice 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.539
 of a possible foundation or then 

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:34.379

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.569
