00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 in antiquity a bride should not 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.560
 distinguish yourself from your bridesmaids the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.929
 young woman who was going to get married chose the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.330
 girls who most resembled her and all 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.340
 they wore similar costumes this similarity 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.680
 He intended to confuse evil 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.949
 spirits that jealous of the happiness of others 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.580
 maybe they tried to hinder in 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.189
 theory the ladies provide security and more 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.210
 if it is difficult to distinguish one from the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.400
 other 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.830
 That's why the bride surrounds herself with girls 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.410
 similar to them at least in the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.300
 costumes in ancient Rome the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.760
 marriages were carried out in 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.100
 presence of ten witnesses and some 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.950
 historians have found that the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.539
 custom of having godmothers and godparents 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.120
 at weddings comes from those 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.070
 times sometimes ladies and sponsors 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.829
 they were there to defend the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.780
 promised and some possible attack up 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.360
 the average age was not unusual for a 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.550
 rival suitor accompanied his friends 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.270
 abduct the bride during the ceremony 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.670
 of marriage a maid of honor can 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.640
 guess what fate holds for you if 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.500
 observe certain signs a stumble in the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.350
 path to the altar diminishes its 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.930
 possibilities of getting married and 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.869
 if it's a lady three times it means that 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.240
 will remain single the number three will 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.460
 relates to good or bad luck 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.310
 for a bridesmaid 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.650
 that figure portends diseases unless 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.640
 I'll be a lady again in four more 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.890
 weddings the number seven of the days of the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.070
 week is good luck because it is 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.680
 attached to the moon phrases to the phases 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.869
 of moon if a lady experiences seven 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.280
 times any change then it will have 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.649
 good luck 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.770
 It is therefore recommended to have seven ladies in 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.150
 the wedding all these are ancient rites of 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.670
 a bridal happiness 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.540
 and therefore strange beliefs of our 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.540
 ancestors
