thing<00:00:52.250> about<00:00:52.280> him<00:00:52.580> is<00:00:52.699> possibly<00:00:53.059> his<00:00:53.210> pace<00:00:53.420> and

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
thing about him is possibly his pace and

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.930 
thing about him is possibly his pace and
his<00:00:53.890> high<00:00:54.890> high<00:00:55.070> work<00:00:55.309> rate<00:00:55.339> so<00:00:55.699> you<00:00:55.790> don't

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
his high high work rate so you don't

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.670 
his high high work rate so you don't
really<00:00:56.059> know<00:00:56.239> if<00:00:56.360> them<00:00:56.510> that<00:00:56.750> much<00:00:56.930> he<00:00:57.530> didn't

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
really know if them that much he didn't

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.020 
really know if them that much he didn't
manage<00:00:57.860> to<00:00:57.890> score<00:00:58.129> me<00:00:58.280> a<00:00:58.309> goal<00:00:58.519> from<00:00:58.760> a<00:00:58.850> header

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
manage to score me a goal from a header

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.640 
manage to score me a goal from a header
and<00:00:59.360> I've<00:00:59.540> got<00:00:59.780> the<00:00:59.809> Sentinel<00:01:00.260> threaten<00:01:00.530> him

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
and I've got the Sentinel threaten him

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.229 
and I've got the Sentinel threaten him
which<00:01:00.800> improves<00:01:01.190> his<00:01:01.280> defending<00:01:01.790> and<00:01:01.970> had<00:01:02.120> it

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
which improves his defending and had it

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.090 
which improves his defending and had it
could<00:01:02.899> also<00:01:03.020> get<00:01:03.199> the<00:01:03.320> in-form<00:01:03.590> if<00:01:03.800> she<00:01:03.890> wants

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
could also get the in-form if she wants

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.350 
could also get the in-form if she wants
