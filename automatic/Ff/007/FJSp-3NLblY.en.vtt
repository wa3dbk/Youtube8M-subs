00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
weapons to the game and then once you do

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.120 
weapons to the game and then once you do
you<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.230> go<00:00:34.410> over<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.800> believe<00:00:34.980> it's

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
you have to go over and I believe it's

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.340

like<00:00:35.280> 14<00:00:35.850> grand<00:00:36.300> which<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.510> pretty<00:00:36.899> expensive

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
like 14 grand which is pretty expensive

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.500 
like 14 grand which is pretty expensive
but<00:00:37.770> then<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.430> weapon<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.969> essentially<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
but then this weapon is essentially the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.569 
but then this weapon is essentially the
