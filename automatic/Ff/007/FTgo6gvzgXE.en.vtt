00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.290 
ground even though they're not really
shoe<00:02:29.050> laces<00:02:29.230> just<00:02:29.560> pretend<00:02:30.070> and<00:02:30.250> then<00:02:31.030> you

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
shoe laces just pretend and then you

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.430 
shoe laces just pretend and then you
pull<00:02:31.720> forward<00:02:32.020> or<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:33.130> put<00:02:33.310> your<00:02:33.460> hands<00:02:33.850> right

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
pull forward or you put your hands right

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.230 
pull forward or you put your hands right
here<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:35.650> pull<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:36.580> it's<00:02:36.700> kind<00:02:36.880> of<00:02:36.940> stretches

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
here and pull so it's kind of stretches

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.960 
here and pull so it's kind of stretches
right<00:02:37.720> in<00:02:37.840> your<00:02:37.990> calf<00:02:38.560> muscle<00:02:38.980> right<00:02:39.070> here

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.480 

then<00:02:42.970> do<00:02:43.120> that<00:02:43.300> and<00:02:43.600> then<00:02:43.750> switch

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.400 

and<00:02:47.760> then<00:02:47.970> another<00:02:48.210> one<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.810> do<00:02:48.900> for

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
and then another one I do for

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.390 
and then another one I do for
cheerleading<00:02:51.410> it's<00:02:52.410> put<00:02:53.100> one<00:02:53.400> leg<00:02:53.580> back<00:02:54.110> and

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
cheerleading it's put one leg back and

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.920 
cheerleading it's put one leg back and
then<00:02:56.400> reach<00:02:56.580> forward<00:02:56.910> so<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.690> kind<00:02:57.870> of

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
then reach forward so it kind of

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.480 
then reach forward so it kind of
stretches<00:02:58.340> this<00:02:59.340> area<00:02:59.820> again<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:01.020> cap<00:03:01.490> the

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
stretches this area again the cap the

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.120 
stretches this area again the cap the
one<00:03:02.640> that's<00:03:02.790> on<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:02.910> ground<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.840> pull<00:03:04.620> but

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
one that's on the ground and pull but

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.620 
one that's on the ground and pull but
make<00:03:05.250> sure<00:03:05.400> your<00:03:05.550> knee<00:03:05.730> is<00:03:05.760> not<00:03:06.090> further<00:03:06.450> than

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
make sure your knee is not further than

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:15.600 
make sure your knee is not further than
your<00:03:06.720> toes<00:03:08.450> and<00:03:09.450> then<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.720> next

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.050 

and<00:03:15.760> then<00:03:16.330> eventually

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
and then eventually

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.550 
and then eventually
you<00:03:18.630> can<00:03:18.810> do<00:03:18.930> this

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.170 

split<00:03:22.190> all<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.849> way<00:03:23.090> down

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
split all the way down

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.199 
split all the way down
so<00:03:25.599> then<00:03:25.720> you<00:03:25.810> can<00:03:25.930> like<00:03:26.049> stretch<00:03:26.950> out<00:03:27.129> to<00:03:27.250> here

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.309 

and<00:03:31.209> then<00:03:31.360> if<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:31.540> want<00:03:31.659> to<00:03:31.689> do<00:03:31.780> some<00:03:31.959> standing

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
and then if you want to do some standing

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.950 
and then if you want to do some standing
up<00:03:34.439> you

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.840 

you<00:03:39.080> can<00:03:39.200> do<00:03:39.290> them<00:03:39.440> stand<00:03:39.650> up<00:03:39.770> like<00:03:39.950> arm

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
you can do them stand up like arm

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.440 
you can do them stand up like arm
circles<00:03:41.360> or<00:03:41.780> arm<00:03:41.990> backwards<00:03:42.470> or<00:03:42.740> always<00:03:43.670> do<00:03:44.300> it

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
circles or arm backwards or always do it

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.060 
circles or arm backwards or always do it
best<00:03:44.630> to<00:03:44.750> your<00:03:44.960> arm<00:03:45.170> stretch<00:03:45.470> out<00:03:45.650> because<00:03:45.770> you

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
best to your arm stretch out because you

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:52.970 
best to your arm stretch out because you
don't<00:03:46.220> want<00:03:46.490> to<00:03:46.550> pull<00:03:46.730> your<00:03:47.270> arms

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.690 

they're<00:03:53.980> always<00:03:54.130> fearless<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:56.310> then<00:03:57.310> for

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
they're always fearless and then for

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.059 
they're always fearless and then for
this<00:03:57.850> you<00:03:58.240> put<00:03:58.600> your<00:03:58.750> legs<00:03:58.870> apart<00:03:59.200> and<00:03:59.530> then

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.649 

but<00:04:05.769> always<00:04:06.040> put<00:04:06.220> your<00:04:06.610> head<00:04:06.819> to<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:08.470> knee<00:04:09.659> try

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
to get as far as you can go because then

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.880 
to get as far as you can go because then

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
you'll eventually be all stretched out

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.890 
you'll eventually be all stretched out
and<00:04:15.129> then<00:04:15.220> you'll<00:04:15.400> eventually<00:04:15.879> be<00:04:16.660> in<00:04:16.780> all

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
and then you'll eventually be in all

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.099 
and then you'll eventually be in all
flexible<00:04:17.440> and<00:04:17.739> then<00:04:18.370> straight<00:04:19.329> down<00:04:19.720> so<00:04:19.959> then

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
flexible and then straight down so then

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.990 
flexible and then straight down so then
eventually<00:04:20.380> you<00:04:21.010> can<00:04:21.160> try<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.370> do<00:04:21.579> your<00:04:21.820> male

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000
