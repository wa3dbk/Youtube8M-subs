has a little bit of shimmer in it as

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.270 
has a little bit of shimmer in it as
well<00:04:46.970> I<00:04:49.780> think<00:04:50.780> just<00:04:51.260> throwing<00:04:51.560> on<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:51.740> apples

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
and then to finish off I think I'm going

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.040 
and then to finish off I think I'm going
to<00:05:10.450> use<00:05:10.750> a<00:05:11.670> revlon<00:05:12.670> matte<00:05:12.700> shades<00:05:13.300> this<00:05:13.750> one

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
to use a revlon matte shades this one

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.170 
to use a revlon matte shades this one
it's<00:05:14.770> zero<00:05:15.100> zero<00:05:15.580> one<00:05:16.000> that's<00:05:16.900> a<00:05:17.050> really<00:05:17.410> nice

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
it's zero zero one that's a really nice

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:30.150 
it's zero zero one that's a really nice
slightly<00:05:19.180> warm<00:05:20.100> pale<00:05:21.100> nude<00:05:21.490> shade<00:05:29.010> so<00:05:30.010> it's

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
slightly warm pale nude shade so it's

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.770 
slightly warm pale nude shade so it's
not<00:05:30.370> again<00:05:30.730> too<00:05:31.470> pale<00:05:32.470> but<00:05:32.830> it's<00:05:33.600> it's<00:05:34.600> got
