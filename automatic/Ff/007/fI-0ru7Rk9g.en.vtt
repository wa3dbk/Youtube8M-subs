00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:04.480
 It is. Singer seas will be difficult 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.880
 There were not many differences, not heavy metal quotations 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.359
 Rings and necklaces were cut down from 1500 won. 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.359
 The golden key, of course, 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.650
 Could it be related to food 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.269
 That could be lucky 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.759
 I have a relationship with him. 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:25.919
 For example 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.249
 That part is 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.699
 you want to 6 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.070
 280 9 minutes 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.330
 Of course, hormones 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.730
 Rather than force 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.390
 We have to get into the 400th group of 39. 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.390
 That's because the overall content is low. 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.870
 mbc's publicity is only about the degree of 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.580
 l006 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.580
 I've been thinking about it in the industry. 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.090
 The case of Lee Hyeok-jae is hardly semiconductor 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.950
 I have a special attendant problem. 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.839
 Pianist 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.839
 From the structure, I broke my breath. 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.250
 If so, 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.250
 So the mother pushed. 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.160
 But this was not the end. 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.020
 light 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.579
 I did not feel that way. Once you save your save 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.579
 When you hear the sound 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.670
 4-game winning streak 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.850
 Limited pitchers 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.360
 The State Department 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.100
 I am not doing that. 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.280
 That we are the Roh Moo-hyun regime 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.050
 Today I am sentenced to five years 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.220
 The SP 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.530
 It was like a dancing with a special sound. 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.210
 The United States told me 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.020
 So to make it 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.020
 Looking at the performance, I was working. 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.240
 It has a sound from falling sound. reinforce 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.240
 Autonomy of government schools for accurate noise measurement 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.960
 Business results are bad. 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.910
 The results are coming out, 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:11.869
 Back off 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:15.119
 I think President Bush is easy to write on the 20th. 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:16.749
 Park Geun-hye 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:19.109
 It is not money. 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:23.240
 The US economy slowed down. Broadcasting is not a broadcasting 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.489
 13 24 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:26.990
 Emotional outcome 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.889
 I respect the settlement. I'm a real friend. 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.979
 I have answered. 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:32.099
 15. 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.769
 Ilyha products.
