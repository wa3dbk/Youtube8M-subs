nitrogen in order to produce oil and
here<00:00:45.170> what<00:00:45.440> we<00:00:45.589> do<00:00:45.769> before<00:00:46.129> we<00:00:46.430> ever<00:00:46.790> start

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
here what we do before we ever start

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.119 
here what we do before we ever start
planting<00:00:47.420> as<00:00:47.720> we<00:00:47.870> prepare<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.500> soil<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:49.070> as

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
planting as we prepare the soil and as

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.180 
planting as we prepare the soil and as
you<00:00:49.220> can<00:00:49.370> see<00:00:49.580> the<00:00:50.180> alfalfa<00:00:50.780> is<00:00:51.379> the<00:00:51.739> choice

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
you can see the alfalfa is the choice

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.990 
you can see the alfalfa is the choice
that<00:00:52.220> we<00:00:52.610> use<00:00:53.000> in<00:00:53.769> feeding<00:00:54.769> and<00:00:55.159> nurturing<00:00:55.489> the

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
that we use in feeding and nurturing the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.340 
that we use in feeding and nurturing the
soil<00:00:56.320> pre<00:00:57.320> planting<00:00:58.129> stage<00:00:58.750> so<00:00:59.750> we<00:00:59.930> let<00:01:00.140> the

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
soil pre planting stage so we let the

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.219 
soil pre planting stage so we let the
alfalfa<00:01:00.860> grow<00:01:01.339> on<00:01:01.489> the<00:01:01.610> soil<00:01:01.879> for<00:01:02.239> five<00:01:02.540> years

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
alfalfa grow on the soil for five years

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.480 
alfalfa grow on the soil for five years
and<00:01:03.320> then<00:01:04.220> as<00:01:04.549> we<00:01:04.970> will<00:01:05.119> do<00:01:05.299> next<00:01:05.690> summer

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
and then as we will do next summer

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.380 
and then as we will do next summer

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.360 
planting once the subsoil is completed
then<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.380> second<00:02:13.380> machine<00:02:13.769> goes<00:02:14.040> through

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
then the second machine goes through

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.630 
then the second machine goes through
with<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:15.030> switch<00:02:15.330> plow<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:16.160> does<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.190> deep

with the switch plow and does a deep

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.059 
with the switch plow and does a deep
plowing<00:02:18.030> process

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.660 

once<00:02:22.060> we're<00:02:22.299> ready<00:02:22.569> to<00:02:22.810> prep<00:02:23.079> the<00:02:23.290> soil<00:02:23.670> for

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
once we're ready to prep the soil for

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.050 
once we're ready to prep the soil for
planting<00:02:25.329> it<00:02:26.290> starts<00:02:26.829> this<00:02:27.129> exact<00:02:27.579> time<00:02:27.879> of

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
planting it starts this exact time of

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.280 
planting it starts this exact time of
the<00:02:28.120> year<00:02:28.239> and<00:02:28.420> that's<00:02:28.510> why<00:02:28.780> we're<00:02:29.079> out<00:02:29.109> here

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
the year and that's why we're out here

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.000 
the year and that's why we're out here
in<00:02:29.829> this<00:02:30.459> cool<00:02:30.760> weather<00:02:31.260> it's<00:02:32.260> simply<00:02:32.650> because

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
in this cool weather it's simply because

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.089 
in this cool weather it's simply because
as<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.400> plant<00:02:33.819> has<00:02:34.150> reached<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.290> height<00:02:35.620> of<00:02:35.920> 8

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
as the plant has reached the height of 8

elements<00:04:03.879> which<00:04:04.239> are<00:04:04.419> critical<00:04:05.019> for<00:04:05.229> the

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
elements which are critical for the

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.069 
elements which are critical for the
growing<00:04:05.769> of<00:04:06.010> an<00:04:06.129> aromatic<00:04:06.340> plant<00:04:06.909> but<00:04:07.900> they

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
growing of an aromatic plant but they

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.009 
growing of an aromatic plant but they
really<00:04:08.590> demand<00:04:09.099> a<00:04:09.340> lot<00:04:09.609> of<00:04:09.760> nitrogen<00:04:10.389> so

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
really demand a lot of nitrogen so

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.409 
really demand a lot of nitrogen so
alfalfa<00:04:11.799> gives<00:04:12.040> us<00:04:12.159> natural<00:04:12.699> nitrogen<00:04:13.239> so

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
alfalfa gives us natural nitrogen so

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.539 
alfalfa gives us natural nitrogen so
we're<00:04:13.540> not<00:04:13.720> having<00:04:14.049> to<00:04:14.229> put<00:04:14.549> synthetic

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
we're not having to put synthetic

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.699 
we're not having to put synthetic
chemicals<00:04:16.120> on<00:04:16.329> the<00:04:16.570> soil<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.109> in<00:04:17.320> the

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
chemicals on the soil and in the
