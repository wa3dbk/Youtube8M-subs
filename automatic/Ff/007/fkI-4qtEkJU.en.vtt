it's good to be the hook in the cross
cross<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.409> book<00:00:55.589> and<00:00:55.829> those<00:00:56.280> alternate<00:00:56.879> so

well<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.580> would<00:01:06.120> argue<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.390> there's<00:01:06.630> a

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
well I would argue that there's a

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.480 
well I would argue that there's a
there's<00:01:07.260> several<00:01:07.440> other<00:01:07.650> types<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.010> boxers<00:01:08.340> -

closes the range and just smothered him

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.270 
closes the range and just smothered him
stays<00:01:12.960> close<00:01:13.230> enough<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.620> land<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.010> book<00:01:14.160> in

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
like three of those in a sequence we'll

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.240 
like three of those in a sequence we'll
stop<00:01:50.940> and<00:01:51.480> reset<00:01:51.930> let<00:01:52.470> me<00:01:52.530> do<00:01:52.620> the<00:01:52.740> same<00:01:52.920> Indian

they just have to sort of react to when

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.090 
they just have to sort of react to when
I<00:01:57.780> throw<00:01:57.990> them<00:01:58.110> away

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.369 

again<00:02:06.100> I<00:02:06.189> will<00:02:06.310> tell<00:02:06.490> her<00:02:09.300> nice<00:02:10.300> and<00:02:10.569> the<00:02:11.230> nice

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
thing to do I like this she she's

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.479 
thing to do I like this she she's
throwing<00:02:13.209> these<00:02:13.360> sharp<00:02:13.860> short<00:02:14.860> punches<00:02:15.370> that

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489

notice<00:02:19.239> how<00:02:19.330> she's<00:02:19.569> driving<00:02:20.019> me<00:02:20.110> back<00:02:20.319> I<00:02:20.620> can't

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
notice how she's driving me back I can't

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.890 
notice how she's driving me back I can't
stand<00:02:21.280> there<00:02:21.459> because<00:02:22.269> then<00:02:22.480> she's<00:02:22.660> getting

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
stand there because then she's getting

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.660 
stand there because then she's getting
really<00:02:23.019> dangerous<00:02:23.230> getting<00:02:24.129> so<00:02:24.250> close<00:02:24.459> with

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
really dangerous getting so close with

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.740 
really dangerous getting so close with
all<00:02:24.790> these<00:02:24.910> different<00:02:25.180> angles<00:02:25.269> she<00:02:25.540> gets

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
all these different angles she gets

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.240 
all these different angles she gets
right<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:25.989> distance<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.560> feel<00:02:26.739> better<00:02:26.920> because<00:02:27.069> I

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
right a distance I feel better because I

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.009 
right a distance I feel better because I
know<00:02:27.280> she<00:02:27.940> doesn't<00:02:28.209> have<00:02:28.330> all<00:02:28.450> these<00:02:28.629> angles

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
know she doesn't have all these angles

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.750 
know she doesn't have all these angles
but<00:02:29.410> she's<00:02:29.590> forcing<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.160> range<00:02:30.430> where<00:02:30.610> she

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
but she's forcing that range where she

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.229 
but she's forcing that range where she
does<00:02:30.970> so<00:02:31.810> looking<00:02:32.080> at<00:02:32.140> this<00:02:32.200> one<00:02:32.379> more<00:02:32.500> time

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.900 

one<00:02:37.239> more<00:02:37.269> time<00:02:41.610> all<00:02:42.610> right

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
one more time all right

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.660 
one more time all right
so<00:02:43.599> there<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:43.870> have<00:02:43.930> this<00:02:44.290> warmer<00:02:44.980> another

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
so there you have this warmer another

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.059 
so there you have this warmer another
type<00:02:45.910> of<00:02:45.940> boxer<00:02:46.420> very<00:02:46.840> effective<00:02:47.290> if<00:02:47.829> you<00:02:47.950> have

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
type of boxer very effective if you have

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.809 
type of boxer very effective if you have
shorter<00:02:48.340> arms

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
shorter arms

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:57.630 
shorter arms
let's<00:02:49.450> reach

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.700 

you
