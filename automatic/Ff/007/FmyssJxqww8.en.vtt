00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
then without straightening it I just

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.330 
then without straightening it I just
took<00:01:35.380> my<00:01:36.330> one<00:01:37.330> and<00:01:37.660> a<00:01:37.750> half<00:01:37.960> inch<00:01:38.259> curling<00:01:38.979> iron

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
and then curled the end and then you get

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.690 
and then curled the end and then you get
this<00:01:46.450> look<00:01:46.720> and<00:01:46.930> then<00:01:47.080> right<00:01:47.380> now<00:01:47.670> today<00:01:48.670> I
