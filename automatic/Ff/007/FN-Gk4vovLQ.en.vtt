00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.000
 good good pleasures of life is 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.300
 be taken at any time of year 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.220
 cold or heat a good vanilla ice cream 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.020
 like the one we teach to do here in 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.570
 our channel the vanilla base side 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.079
 exquisite topped by s 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.090
 fast and the chocolate that thing this 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:28.279
 style that much richer than syrup 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.099
 of normal chocolate with that flavor that 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.470
 good texture that richness of flavor that 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.329
 let us love as could be the 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.640
 we are going to do is maybe 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.740
 to give you an idea similar to the 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.300
 that you can take in mcdonald's but 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.220
 even more similar since almost 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.380
 identical to the primitives that were made 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.810
 in the USA and they were sold in in the 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.390
 food stores would help us 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.550
 A lot of time can be done from many 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.530
 ways with many different details and 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.540
 here our expert is going to give us that 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.730
 point that we need to learn 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.130
 Well today we will explain how 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.200
 do it and also how to decorate because 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.790
 psoe to our house that we love already 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.040
 at the end as it is so cool 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.120
 tourism the part is directly all 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.120
 your 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.310
 to use it they make their little balls 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.710
 ice cream and they place it over the fax 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.300
 it has to be hot and you can 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.270
 also add a little cream 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.270
 mounted a beer or if not some 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.820
 nuts a sprinters or shavings 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.280
 chocolate what you want and what 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.660
 fun of this is to use the 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.210
 imagination and this is going to be a 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.250
 perfect perfect and personalized sande 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.020
 and personalized and if you want 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.090
 vary them a bit the flavor and for 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.250
 example, they want to make him mocha 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.720
 place two tablespoons of coffee if 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.000
 they want to do for example orange you 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.010
 they put two tablespoons of 4 or one 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.480
 teaspoon of orange essence and if 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.150
 they want to make mint as a 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.580
 teaspoon of mint essence and also 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.290
 although tourists say that only 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.990
 can do with the vanilla logo 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.420
 do not pay too much attention to mint 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.190
 or on the side of another type of ice cream 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.930
 also to see is that it's okay with your ex 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.790
 peeled chocolate to see what 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.770
 wonderful yes you have to try all the 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.540
 possible classes and we're going to 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.240
 thank you if you keep track of what 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.820
 we started good we're going to need 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.360
 200 milliliters of condensed milk that 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.180
 It's 8 ounces 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.560
 90 grams of dark chocolate in pieces 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.319
 which are 3 ounces 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.090
 30 grams of butter that are 2 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.540
 spoonfuls 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:33.980
 a teaspoon of vanilla extract 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.700
 a few feet pringles of colors and cream 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.030
 mounted 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.600
 good morning we are going to explain what 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.520
 quickie and facilitated that is this 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.190
 let's place 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.260
 the fire 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:55.099
 at medium medium-high heat 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.099
 and we are going to place the condensed milk 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.650
 and the Chocolate 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.230
 and we are going to remove 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.490
 until it is completely melted 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.690
 chocolate 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.850
 as you will see they have completely dissolved 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.230
 the chocolate no longer has any 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:23.349
 let's go back well we do not have anything left 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.710
 and just at this moment what 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:29.520
 remove from the fire 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:32.870
 and we're going to put the butter 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.870
 we dissolve it well 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.430
 and once we have totally 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.930
 melted the butter then it 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.209
 we add 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.989
 the vanilla is curious the brightness of the 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:48.060
 butter the melted chocolate and 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.680
 awesome how it changes from that color 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.560
 that rather like paco and when you 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.769
 you add the butter right away 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.109
 bright good if it's already completely 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.040
 integrated into our vanilla and now what 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:03.040
 let's place 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.040
 bones 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.390
 where are we going to let it rest 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.310
 3 to 5 minutes 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.220
 well here they have the consistency that 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:25.540
 you have to have already seen that as you 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:28.580
 He said yes life that is dense and very rich 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.900
 now we place it above 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.900
 by our side 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:41.300
 and show you 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.300
 we can decorate it as we want 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:49.760
 who has been more than what we do 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.830
 put him 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.250
 a little ball to swim half of 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.250
 cream 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:01.530
 and a little bit and we decorate it to make it 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.129
 more colorful and that good with a 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.919
 little bit 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:09.520
 of spring list of colors that always 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:12.210
