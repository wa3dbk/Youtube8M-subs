00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
place so this way there you go go

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.709

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.269 
grading the road all-terrain tractor so
let's<00:01:50.929> see<00:01:51.049> let's<00:01:51.409> see<00:01:51.439> if<00:01:51.560> I<00:01:51.619> can<00:01:51.799> push<00:01:52.009> down

00:01:52.269 --> 00:01:52.279 
let's see let's see if I can push down

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:54.159 
let's see let's see if I can push down
on<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:52.490> see<00:01:53.149> as<00:01:53.240> you<00:01:53.389> can<00:01:53.509> tell<00:01:53.719> it's<00:01:53.840> got<00:01:53.959> the

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:54.169 
on it see as you can tell it's got the

00:01:54.169 --> 00:02:00.489 
on it see as you can tell it's got the
rubber<00:01:54.770> treads<00:01:57.069> all<00:01:58.069> four<00:01:58.549> sides<00:01:59.499> move

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:00.499 
rubber treads all four sides move

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:03.159 
rubber treads all four sides move
independently<00:02:01.219> I<00:02:01.909> think<00:02:02.599> this<00:02:02.719> is<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:02.959> first

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:03.169 
independently I think this is the first

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:05.229 
independently I think this is the first
is<00:02:03.739> this<00:02:03.919> the<00:02:04.069> first<00:02:04.219> real<00:02:04.489> working<00:02:04.880> working

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:05.239 
is this the first real working working

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:08.290 
is this the first real working working
rigs<00:02:05.689> that<00:02:05.899> has<00:02:06.109> a<00:02:06.139> four<00:02:06.939> rubber<00:02:07.939> treads

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300

know who's gonna get this what countries
or<00:02:13.460> what<00:02:14.060> not<00:02:14.270> as<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.510> matter<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:14.840> fact<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:15.290> know

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
or what not as a matter of fact you know

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.070 
or what not as a matter of fact you know
it's<00:02:15.950> even<00:02:16.100> hard<00:02:16.460> to<00:02:16.550> find<00:02:16.850> them<00:02:17.000> in<00:02:17.180> the

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
it's even hard to find them in the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.650 
it's even hard to find them in the
toy<00:02:18.350> stores<00:02:18.770> so<00:02:19.730> maybe<00:02:19.970> you'll<00:02:20.150> have<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.420> check

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
toy stores so maybe you'll have to check

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.620 
toy stores so maybe you'll have to check
smaller<00:02:21.350> places<00:02:21.710> like<00:02:22.130> Kohl's<00:02:22.910> or<00:02:23.390> whatnot

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
smaller places like Kohl's or whatnot

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.530 
smaller places like Kohl's or whatnot
but<00:02:24.410> let's<00:02:24.590> go<00:02:24.740> ahead<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:25.070> see<00:02:25.280> if<00:02:25.310> it'll<00:02:25.700> if<00:02:26.360> I

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
but let's go ahead and see if it'll if I

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.400 
but let's go ahead and see if it'll if I
can<00:02:26.720> get<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.200> rubber<00:02:27.590> treads<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:27.950> roll<00:02:32.410> yeah

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
can get the rubber treads to roll yeah

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.830 
can get the rubber treads to roll yeah
it's<00:02:33.650> a<00:02:33.710> little<00:02:33.800> hard<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.460> roll<00:02:34.690> that's<00:02:35.690> why

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
it's a little hard to roll that's why

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.140 
it's a little hard to roll that's why
I'm<00:02:35.930> not<00:02:36.050> a<00:02:36.110> big<00:02:36.740> fan<00:02:37.160> of<00:02:37.220> these<00:02:37.520> generally

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
I'm not a big fan of these generally

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.770 
I'm not a big fan of these generally
because<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:38.840> might<00:02:39.110> be<00:02:39.320> neat<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:40.120> have<00:02:41.120> sitting

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
because it might be neat to have sitting

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.010 
because it might be neat to have sitting
around<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.410> that<00:02:43.100> you<00:02:43.580> know<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:43.970> imagine<00:02:44.870> it

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
around and that you know you imagine it

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.590 
around and that you know you imagine it
but<00:02:45.320> as<00:02:45.920> far<00:02:46.310> as<00:02:46.490> being<00:02:46.640> able<00:02:46.850> to<00:02:47.060> play<00:02:47.450> and

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
but as far as being able to play and

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.180 
but as far as being able to play and
roll<00:02:47.780> it's<00:02:47.960> not<00:02:48.110> my<00:02:48.230> thing<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:48.620> know<00:02:48.680> there's<00:02:49.010> a
