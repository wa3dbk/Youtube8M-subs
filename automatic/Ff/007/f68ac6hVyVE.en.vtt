this<00:00:36.630> ski<00:00:36.840> it's<00:00:36.989> specifically<00:00:37.739> meant<00:00:38.010> for

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
this ski it's specifically meant for

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.510 
this ski it's specifically meant for
those<00:00:38.610> big<00:00:39.000> powder<00:00:39.480> days<00:00:40.070> where<00:00:41.070> your<00:00:41.309> normal

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
those big powder days where your normal

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.389 
those big powder days where your normal
skis<00:00:42.000> would<00:00:42.360> not<00:00:42.570> work<00:00:42.840> but<00:00:43.379> Solomon<00:00:43.829> did<00:00:44.100> make

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
skis would not work but Solomon did make

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.000 
skis would not work but Solomon did make
this<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.640> little<00:00:44.879> more<00:00:45.200> frontside<00:00:46.200> friendly

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
this a little more frontside friendly

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.319 
this a little more frontside friendly
this<00:00:47.190> year<00:00:47.399> we'll<00:00:47.550> say<00:00:47.730> because<00:00:48.059> then<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
this year we'll say because then the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.540 
this year we'll say because then the
years<00:00:48.450> passes<00:00:48.899> our<00:00:49.020> has<00:00:49.110> been<00:00:49.260> ultra<00:00:50.070> specific

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
years passes our has been ultra specific

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.850 
years passes our has been ultra specific
the<00:00:50.670> powder<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.120> still<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.570> but<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.410> can<00:00:52.649> is

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
the powder and still is but it can is

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.319 
the powder and still is but it can is
definitely<00:00:53.280> easier<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.670> get<00:00:53.820> down<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
definitely easier to get down to the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.330 
definitely easier to get down to the
bottom<00:00:54.510> for<00:00:55.020> lunch<00:00:55.260> get<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.129> year's

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
bottom for lunch get on this year's

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.410 
bottom for lunch get on this year's
model<00:00:56.489> yeah<00:00:56.760> definitely<00:00:57.149> one<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
model yeah definitely one of the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.720 
model yeah definitely one of the
detriments<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.140> having<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.680> powder<00:00:59.010> type<00:00:59.370> ski

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
detriments to having a powder type ski

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.119 
detriments to having a powder type ski
or<00:00:59.940> something<00:01:00.120> that's<00:01:00.449> designed<00:01:01.109> for<00:01:01.859> that

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
or something that's designed for that

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.030 
or something that's designed for that
that<00:01:03.000> type<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.420> terrain<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:04.860> not

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
that type of terrain is that it's not

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.490 
that type of terrain is that it's not
very<00:01:05.280> good<00:01:05.610> for<00:01:06.570> regular<00:01:06.840> all-mountain

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
very good for regular all-mountain

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.289 
very good for regular all-mountain
performance<00:01:08.130> or<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.400> piste<00:01:08.700> performing<00:01:09.180> right

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
performance or on piste performing right

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.330 
performance or on piste performing right
so<00:01:09.659> we<00:01:09.780> did<00:01:10.020> change<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.530> ski<00:01:10.740> up<00:01:10.920> just<00:01:11.220> a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
so we did change the ski up just a

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.160 
so we did change the ski up just a
little<00:01:11.369> bit<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:12.150> order<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.450> make<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> little

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
little bit in order to make it a little

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.289 
little bit in order to make it a little
bit<00:01:13.439> more<00:01:13.590> user-friendly<00:01:14.010> when<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.030> have<00:01:15.180> to

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
bit more user-friendly when you have to

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.030 
bit more user-friendly when you have to
get<00:01:15.420> down<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.990> mountain<00:01:16.020> at<00:01:16.500> 4<00:01:16.770> o'clock<00:01:16.799> in

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040

some exactly so but we've got the an

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.820 
some exactly so but we've got the an
enormous<00:01:21.810> amount<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.080> rocker<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.500> tip<00:01:22.710> of

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
enormous amount of rocker in the tip of

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.810 
enormous amount of rocker in the tip of
the<00:01:22.890> ski<00:01:23.009> which<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.460> going<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> aid

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
the ski which is going to aid

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.850 
the ski which is going to aid
performance<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.020> powder<00:01:25.229> conditions<00:01:25.439> so

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
performance in the powder conditions so

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.170 
performance in the powder conditions so
it<00:01:25.920> can<00:01:26.040> be<00:01:26.130> elaborate<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.880> little<00:01:26.970> bit

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
it can be elaborate on that a little bit

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.469 
it can be elaborate on that a little bit
yeah<00:01:27.780> given<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.369> 670<00:01:29.369> millimeters<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.060> of

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
yeah given it 670 millimeters of of

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.219 
yeah given it 670 millimeters of of
rocker<00:01:31.490> creates<00:01:32.490> amazing<00:01:33.229> powdered

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
rocker creates amazing powdered

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.100 
rocker creates amazing powdered
performance<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.729> pop<00:01:36.000> performance<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
performance so pop performance in the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.469 
performance so pop performance in the
soft<00:01:37.350> snow<00:01:37.500> but<00:01:38.250> giving<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.939> two<00:01:39.180> layers<00:01:39.390> of

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
soft snow but giving it two layers of

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.859 
soft snow but giving it two layers of
fiberglass<00:01:40.460> also<00:01:41.460> putting<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.090> full<00:01:42.630> woodcore

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
fiberglass also putting a full woodcore

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.039 
fiberglass also putting a full woodcore
in<00:01:43.320> still<00:01:44.100> makes<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.030> good<00:01:45.329> performance

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
in still makes it a good performance

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.039 
in still makes it a good performance
scheme<00:01:46.409> ok<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.430> it's<00:01:47.729> not<00:01:48.000> by<00:01:48.600> not<00:01:48.810> putting

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
scheme ok and it's not by not putting

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.539 
scheme ok and it's not by not putting
metal<00:01:49.590> or<00:01:49.770> something<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.430> it

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
metal or something like that and it

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.370 
metal or something like that and it
keeps<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.790> lightweight<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.630> some<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.259> guys

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
keeps it lightweight so some of the guys

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.359 
keeps it lightweight so some of the guys
