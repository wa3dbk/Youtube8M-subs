 colorful foliage 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.680
 I think it was important when 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.320
 choose a hideout of not only 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.239

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.120
 voice in a humid environment and that makes 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.710
 a yellow flower another language that

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:13.609
 it's the little bleeding heart but the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.310
 name of the cultivar it's ivory so since 

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:18.289
 two or three years we have about 3 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.170

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.939

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:50.149

 we see it here offered pink flowers 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.250
 but if I grow is cultivating 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.250
