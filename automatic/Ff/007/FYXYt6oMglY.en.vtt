00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:09.269
 I do not not mean make the actual and cooking myself to say I recently started self-catering whether it real 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:16.200
 Scan and manage it with data 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:20.260
 It 's self-catering. I got a scanner before , so I use it for several books 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.930
 I tried to practice it scanned how I read it at that time 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.800
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.650
 It feels like reading on a personal computer, but that 's why it is so annoying 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.090
 I want to read like a book after all 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:34.120
 What you come up with here Let's use ipad 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:38.640
 Ipad is heavy after being expensive 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:43.379
 The consumption of the battery is intense and my eyes get tired 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:47.760
 That's this very light I bought this reader of my sony 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:53.070
 I feel like I really got it like this I have no trick ipad 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:56.580
 Rest I feel tired in the arm in about 10 minutes if I read it like this 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.630
 I 'm not tired I feel like I 'm reading this book 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.680
 Page turning 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:06.040
 I can also touch the screen but it has a hard key here 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:12.340
 Again you will Deki by pushing the button send button 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:13.240
 But this you are flipping through this I hope not use it is also intuitive is and what you're doing for a long time 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.170
 Get tired 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.620
 Because I feel like that, this is a hardware button ordinary button 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.460
 I hope there is 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.510
 Hmm 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.020
 This refers to the terminal 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:32.220
 There is something to worry about but I think everyone is worried 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.150
 What is discriminatory when compared to what kind of data to handle know it can handle data-only type 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.960
 If not 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:41.500
 In the standard format, various bookmarks may be inserted 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:47.590
 Even if you stop watching on the way, it starts softly next time 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.400
 It attached function say is a load a form of pdf Toka general purpose back to one page 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.060
 End up 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.010
 There was such a bad usability 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.380
 I do not have a leader 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:01.380
 pdf treats another in the same way as format standard format of the body 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:07.290
 For example , I stopped reading 100 pages 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.850
 Next time I open the book again, it starts from page 100. This is good. 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.030
 What do you do with 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:16.750
 I think there is something dedicated software or something like that 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:21.280
 But there is not this It connects this with the computer with usb 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:26.770
 Then the drive will be displayed It is the same as usb memory 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.340
 Only the top number of pdf files on the drive is just that it is the file name 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.020
 Become 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:36.740
 The relationship icon will be the name of the first page displayed 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.290
 It becomes an icon if you put 1 page 2 beat 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.409
 So what I bought in this leader format 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:48.349
 I did not cook it myself pdf 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:51.409
 It can be used in the same way as the dedicated format, so it is not 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:55.459
 Honestly such terminal own data 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:59.280
 This does not have to think about anything but there was a very stress on those things 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:03.240
 Useless is of the I and large resolution too high is 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:09.420
 You need to have an appropriate dpi resolution 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:10.140
 Special software for a personal computer that can move up to here and exchange files and so on 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.390
 Not the times 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:18.890
 This leader who is thinking about self-catering if there is only pdf 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.890
 Please try it as an option
