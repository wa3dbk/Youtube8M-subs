function you've got a friend finder so
you're<00:01:30.860> saying<00:01:31.130> you<00:01:31.220> up<00:01:31.310> in<00:01:31.430> here<00:01:31.580> and<00:01:31.940> this

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
you're saying you up in here and this

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.090 
you're saying you up in here and this
shows<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.270> we're<00:01:32.840> setting<00:01:33.170> up<00:01:33.290> is<00:01:33.470> in<00:01:33.740> my<00:01:33.830> area

shows the we're setting up is in my area
and<00:01:34.370> of<00:01:35.000> course<00:01:35.210> if<00:01:35.360> he<00:01:35.390> knew<00:01:35.630> X<00:01:35.840> if<00:01:36.080> he<00:01:36.230> works

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
and of course if he knew X if he works

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.590 
and of course if he knew X if he works
to<00:01:36.770> be<00:01:36.860> seen<00:01:37.130> on<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.280> map<00:01:37.490> um<00:01:37.730> so<00:01:38.420> there's<00:01:38.540> a

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
to be seen on the map um so there's a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.330 
to be seen on the map um so there's a
little<00:01:38.720> friend<00:01:39.350> keeps<00:01:39.560> an<00:01:39.710> eye<00:01:39.770> on<00:01:39.800> your

or little organizer built in with your

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.100 
or little organizer built in with your
nav<00:01:54.920> system<00:01:55.390> just<00:01:56.390> little<00:01:56.570> things<00:01:56.690> that<00:01:56.930> kind

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
nav system just little things that kind

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.900 
nav system just little things that kind
of<00:01:57.170> you<00:01:57.350> know<00:01:57.380> make<00:01:57.680> your<00:01:57.710> make<00:01:58.610> your<00:01:58.729> days<00:01:58.880> a

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
of you know make your make your days a

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.640 
of you know make your make your days a
bit<00:01:59.150> more<00:01:59.300> efficient<00:01:59.750> that<00:02:00.020> was<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.260> Mustang

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
bit more efficient that was the Mustang

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.940 
bit more efficient that was the Mustang
event<00:02:01.270> I<00:02:02.270> know<00:02:02.479> that<00:02:02.720> shot<00:02:02.960> oh<00:02:03.580> I'm<00:02:04.580> on<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.090> set

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
event I know that shot oh I'm on a set

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.919 
event I know that shot oh I'm on a set
group<00:02:06.950> of<00:02:07.190> tracks<00:02:07.550> it<00:02:08.090> basically<00:02:08.360> has<00:02:08.690> the

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
group of tracks it basically has the

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.920 
group of tracks it basically has the
most<00:02:09.140> efficient<00:02:09.560> lines<00:02:09.740> the<00:02:10.070> most<00:02:10.250> efficient

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
most efficient lines the most efficient

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.840 
most efficient lines the most efficient
well<00:02:11.930> well<00:02:12.530> not<00:02:12.709> equal<00:02:13.040> not<00:02:13.190> even<00:02:13.430> yeah<00:02:13.700> I'll

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
well well not equal not even yeah I'll

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.690 
well well not equal not even yeah I'll
think<00:02:14.060> even<00:02:14.360> need<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.570> have<00:02:14.600> a<00:02:15.280> formula<00:02:16.280> or

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
think even need to have a formula or

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.270 
think even need to have a formula or
he'll<00:02:17.540> run<00:02:17.959> for<00:02:17.990> every<00:02:18.320> track<00:02:18.590> but<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.010> mean

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
he'll run for every track but I mean

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.009 
he'll run for every track but I mean
corner<00:02:19.940> by<00:02:20.060> corner<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:20.630> know<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.840> power

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
corner by corner you know the power

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.470 
corner by corner you know the power
knows<00:02:21.260> where<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.310> limits<00:02:22.459> are<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:23.000> you<00:02:23.390> know

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
knows where the limits are and you know

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.630 
knows where the limits are and you know
in<00:02:24.110> some<00:02:24.350> racing<00:02:24.650> myself<00:02:24.769> but<00:02:25.190> I<00:02:25.220> know<00:02:25.340> that

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
in some racing myself but I know that

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.729 
in some racing myself but I know that
the<00:02:25.820> car<00:02:26.030> should<00:02:26.060> be<00:02:26.350> one<00:02:27.350> of<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.530> three

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
the car should be one of the three

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.680 
the car should be one of the three
components<00:02:27.890> of<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.610> car<00:02:28.820> she<00:02:28.970> be<00:02:29.090> Harper<00:02:29.480> sent

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
components of the car she be Harper sent

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.350 
components of the car she be Harper sent
either<00:02:29.810> year<00:02:30.140> your<00:02:30.800> brakes<00:02:31.130> or<00:02:31.340> your<00:02:31.519> power<00:02:31.670> or

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
either year your brakes or your power or

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.330 
either year your brakes or your power or
attraction<00:02:32.690> she<00:02:32.989> bi<00:02:33.140> %<00:02:33.650> at<00:02:33.800> some<00:02:33.980> point<00:02:34.220> on<00:02:34.280> the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
attraction she bi % at some point on the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.170 
attraction she bi % at some point on the
track<00:02:34.550> but<00:02:34.700> always<00:02:34.880> hydration<00:02:36.040> them<00:02:37.040> so<00:02:38.030> with

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
track but always hydration them so with

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.880 
track but always hydration them so with
that<00:02:38.360> with<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.900> sensors<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:39.470> basically<00:02:39.680> tell

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
that with the sensors and basically tell

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.410 
that with the sensors and basically tell
you<00:02:40.010> here<00:02:40.519> to<00:02:40.580> give<00:02:40.670> your<00:02:40.820> hit<00:02:41.000> in<00:02:41.090> those<00:02:41.209> Nets

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
you here to give your hit in those Nets

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.360 
you here to give your hit in those Nets
governor

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
governor

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.890 
governor
that<00:02:43.879> make<00:02:44.030> sense<00:02:44.060> all<00:02:44.450> right<00:02:44.569> so<00:02:44.690> basically

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
that make sense all right so basically

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.690 
that make sense all right so basically
it<00:02:45.230> does<00:02:45.530> an<00:02:45.650> efficiency<00:02:46.010> equation<00:02:46.610> to

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
it does an efficiency equation to

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.140 
it does an efficiency equation to
determine<00:02:47.349> which<00:02:48.349> of<00:02:48.379> those<00:02:48.650> three<00:02:48.709> is<00:02:49.150> you

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
determine which of those three is you

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.089 
determine which of those three is you
know<00:02:50.209> that<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:50.989> are<00:02:51.319> at<00:02:51.560> one<00:02:51.860> hundred<00:02:51.920> percent

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
know that you are at one hundred percent

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.009 
know that you are at one hundred percent
uh<00:02:52.370> nation<00:02:52.640> or<00:02:52.849> one<00:02:53.120> of<00:02:53.150> each<00:02:53.510> of<00:02:53.750> those<00:02:53.959> three

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
uh nation or one of each of those three

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.920 
uh nation or one of each of those three
are<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.440> ratio<00:02:54.890> yeah<00:02:55.450> okay<00:02:56.450> that<00:02:56.690> makes<00:02:56.810> sense

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
are a ratio yeah okay that makes sense

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.890 
are a ratio yeah okay that makes sense
yep<00:02:57.409> yep
