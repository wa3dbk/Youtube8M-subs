00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
okay so last week we played around with

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.400 
okay so last week we played around with
some<00:00:07.830> ways<00:00:08.309> that<00:00:08.519> you<00:00:08.580> can<00:00:08.760> accept<00:00:09.410> meltdowns

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
some ways that you can accept meltdowns

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.780 
some ways that you can accept meltdowns
and<00:00:10.650> crossers<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:12.710> we<00:00:13.710> did<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.519> little<00:00:14.700> bit

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
and crossers and we did a little bit

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.029 
and crossers and we did a little bit
more<00:00:14.880> flying<00:00:15.210> over<00:00:15.660> fives

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
more flying over fives

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.429 
more flying over fives
this<00:00:17.699> week<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.180> have<00:00:18.480> been<00:00:18.690> having<00:00:19.020> all<00:00:19.380> kinds

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
this week I have been having all kinds

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.200 
this week I have been having all kinds
of<00:00:19.830> fun<00:00:19.890> with<00:00:20.279> hybrids<00:00:22.760> this<00:00:23.760> being<00:00:24.060> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
of fun with hybrids this being the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.939 
of fun with hybrids this being the
example<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:25.430> I<00:00:26.430> used<00:00:26.820> last<00:00:26.910> week<00:00:27.949> when

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
example that I used last week when

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.359 
example that I used last week when
talking<00:00:29.400> about<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:30.060> interesting<00:00:30.960> technique<00:00:31.470> my

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
talking about a interesting technique my

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.959 
talking about a interesting technique my
friend<00:00:32.610> Colleen<00:00:33.059> showed<00:00:33.420> me<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.760> this<00:00:35.760> week

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
friend Colleen showed me and this week

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.540 
friend Colleen showed me and this week
I'm<00:00:36.180> finally<00:00:36.510> at<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.690> point<00:00:36.719> where<00:00:37.550> I'm

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
I'm finally at the point where I'm

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.389 
I'm finally at the point where I'm
getting<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.910> be<00:00:39.030> reasonably<00:00:39.660> comfortable<00:00:40.399> but

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
getting to be reasonably comfortable but

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.500 
getting to be reasonably comfortable but
doing<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.820> hybrid<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:43.230> both<00:00:43.530> sides<00:00:44.450> and<00:00:45.450> I

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
doing this hybrid on both sides and I

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.560 
doing this hybrid on both sides and I
gotta<00:00:45.690> say<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> big<00:00:46.200> fan<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.710> because

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
gotta say a big fan of it because

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.610 
gotta say a big fan of it because
there's<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.840> hybrid<00:00:49.910> that<00:00:50.910> learn<00:00:51.870> from<00:00:52.199> how

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
there's this hybrid that learn from how

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.049 
there's this hybrid that learn from how
many<00:00:52.680> Lucas<00:00:53.510> several<00:00:54.510> weeks<00:00:54.690> ago<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:56.059> when

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
many Lucas several weeks ago that when

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.549 
many Lucas several weeks ago that when
paired<00:00:58.039> together<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.579> hybrid<00:01:03.350> makes<00:01:04.350> for

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
paired together this hybrid makes for

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:12.300 
paired together this hybrid makes for
some<00:01:04.769> very<00:01:04.799> interesting<00:01:05.339> parallel<00:01:06.119> effects

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.690 

yeah<00:01:12.970> so<00:01:13.450> it's<00:01:13.570> prequel<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:18.430> other

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
yeah so it's prequel the other

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.100 
yeah so it's prequel the other
interesting<00:01:18.910> thing<00:01:19.210> I<00:01:19.600> have<00:01:19.720> been<00:01:19.840> playing

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
interesting thing I have been playing

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.740 
interesting thing I have been playing
around<00:01:20.230> as<00:01:20.530> a<00:01:20.560> result<00:01:20.950> of<00:01:21.100> that<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:22.479> this

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
around as a result of that is this

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.430 
around as a result of that is this
hybrid<00:01:23.670> glitch<00:01:24.670> I<00:01:27.510> have<00:01:28.510> heard<00:01:28.990> about<00:01:29.080> and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
hybrid glitch I have heard about and

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.280 
hybrid glitch I have heard about and
have<00:01:29.560> seen<00:01:29.800> videos<00:01:30.010> of<00:01:30.220> but<00:01:30.880> until<00:01:31.360> now<00:01:31.570> I<00:01:31.900> was

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
have seen videos of but until now I was

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.930 
have seen videos of but until now I was
totally<00:01:32.740> clueless<00:01:32.950> as<00:01:33.310> to<00:01:33.340> how<00:01:33.550> to<00:01:33.610> pull<00:01:33.850> it

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
totally clueless as to how to pull it

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.430 
totally clueless as to how to pull it
off<00:01:36.060> easy<00:01:37.060> that<00:01:37.300> really<00:01:37.720> interesting<00:01:38.140> kind<00:01:38.380> of

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
off easy that really interesting kind of

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.830 
off easy that really interesting kind of
split<00:01:38.710> time<00:01:38.979> feel<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:42.420> your<00:01:43.420> hands<00:01:43.660> of<00:01:43.810> course

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
split time feel but your hands of course

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.560 
split time feel but your hands of course
are<00:01:44.110> doing<00:01:44.229> at<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.380> same<00:01:44.530> time<00:01:45.420> thinking<00:01:46.420> that

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
are doing at the same time thinking that

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.150 
are doing at the same time thinking that
a<00:01:46.600> split<00:01:46.840> time<00:01:47.110> though<00:01:47.259> I<00:01:47.290> gotta<00:01:47.590> admit<00:01:47.619> it<00:01:48.070> was

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
a split time though I gotta admit it was

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.320 
a split time though I gotta admit it was
kind<00:01:48.670> of<00:01:48.790> deceptive<00:01:49.420> because<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.820> does<00:01:52.119> not

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
kind of deceptive because it does not

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.770 
kind of deceptive because it does not
feel<00:01:52.690> like<00:01:52.720> split<00:01:53.229> time<00:01:53.470> although<00:01:54.040> it<00:01:54.369> is<00:01:54.780> you

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
feel like split time although it is you

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.710 
feel like split time although it is you
can<00:01:56.020> break<00:01:56.259> into<00:01:56.590> it<00:01:56.680> from<00:01:56.830> split<00:01:57.190> time<00:01:57.720> like

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
can break into it from split time like

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.830 
can break into it from split time like
so<00:01:59.850> another<00:02:00.850> interesting<00:02:01.240> discovery<00:02:01.360> of<00:02:01.750> this

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
so another interesting discovery of this

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.960 
so another interesting discovery of this
hybrid<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.850> when<00:02:04.119> you're<00:02:04.240> doing<00:02:04.479> this<00:02:04.600> one

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
hybrid so when you're doing this one

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.220 
hybrid so when you're doing this one
your<00:02:06.970> inner<00:02:07.180> hand<00:02:07.570> is<00:02:09.239> setting<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.690> paces

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
your inner hand is setting the paces

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.630 
your inner hand is setting the paces
this<00:02:11.830> one<00:02:12.040> right<00:02:12.190> here

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
this one right here

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.600 
this one right here
and<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:14.260> other<00:02:14.440> hand<00:02:14.709> is<00:02:14.860> kind<00:02:15.070> of<00:02:15.190> following

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
and the other hand is kind of following

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.320 
and the other hand is kind of following
along<00:02:15.760> this<00:02:16.150> trap<00:02:16.540> ring<00:02:19.110> but<00:02:20.400> for<00:02:21.400> some<00:02:21.910> reason

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
along this trap ring but for some reason

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.949 
along this trap ring but for some reason
I<00:02:22.600> could<00:02:23.019> identify<00:02:23.260> first<00:02:24.450> very<00:02:25.450> very<00:02:25.720> easy

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
I could identify first very very easy

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.400 
I could identify first very very easy
time<00:02:26.200> getting<00:02:26.440> this<00:02:26.860> hybrid<00:02:27.340> on<00:02:27.610> this<00:02:27.790> side

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
time getting this hybrid on this side

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.370 
time getting this hybrid on this side
but<00:02:29.410> this<00:02:30.070> side<00:02:30.570> you<00:02:31.570> can<00:02:31.720> see<00:02:31.750> them<00:02:32.080> right<00:02:32.230> now

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
but this side you can see them right now

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.180 
but this side you can see them right now
I'm<00:02:32.590> still<00:02:37.170> this<00:02:38.170> side<00:02:38.470> I<00:02:38.650> was<00:02:38.739> having<00:02:39.010> some

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
I'm still this side I was having some

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.380 
I'm still this side I was having some
issues<00:02:39.280> with<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:41.670> part<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:42.700> that<00:02:42.850> I<00:02:42.910> think<00:02:43.269> is

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
issues with and part of that I think is

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.610 
issues with and part of that I think is
also<00:02:43.780> that<00:02:44.220> as<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.400> watched<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.570> past<00:02:47.140> take<00:02:47.410> of

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
also that as I watched a past take of

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.310 
also that as I watched a past take of
this<00:02:47.799> I'm<00:02:48.040> realizing<00:02:49.030> that<00:02:49.060> my<00:02:49.480> isolations

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
this I'm realizing that my isolations

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.580 
this I'm realizing that my isolations
with<00:02:50.920> these<00:02:51.190> hybrids<00:02:51.820> are<00:02:52.000> not<00:02:52.450> so<00:02:52.989> round

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
with these hybrids are not so round

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.920 
with these hybrids are not so round
unfortunately<00:02:54.150> anyway<00:02:55.150> that's<00:02:55.660> neither<00:02:55.810> here

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
unfortunately anyway that's neither here

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.729 
unfortunately anyway that's neither here
nor<00:02:56.049> there<00:02:56.200> if<00:02:56.410> that's<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:57.090> Polish<00:02:58.090> but<00:03:00.510> yeah

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
nor there if that's the Polish but yeah

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.470 
nor there if that's the Polish but yeah
from<00:03:02.739> what<00:03:02.920> I<00:03:02.950> can<00:03:03.040> tell<00:03:03.220> it<00:03:03.820> turns<00:03:04.060> out<00:03:04.269> that

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
from what I can tell it turns out that

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.110 
from what I can tell it turns out that
it's<00:03:04.750> actually<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.769> outer<00:03:06.010> hand<00:03:06.310> on<00:03:07.030> this

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
it's actually the outer hand on this

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.110 
it's actually the outer hand on this
hybrid<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:08.920> sets<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.310> pace<00:03:11.459> I<00:03:12.459> don't<00:03:12.970> know

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
hybrid that sets the pace I don't know

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.110 
hybrid that sets the pace I don't know
if<00:03:13.360> anybody<00:03:13.750> else<00:03:13.840> has<00:03:14.049> found<00:03:14.230> that<00:03:15.000> but<00:03:16.000> it

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
if anybody else has found that but it

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.280 
if anybody else has found that but it
seems<00:03:16.329> to<00:03:16.420> be<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.570> trick<00:03:16.810> that's<00:03:16.989> helping<00:03:17.230> me

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
seems to be the trick that's helping me

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.040 
seems to be the trick that's helping me
out<00:03:17.590> in<00:03:17.769> fact<00:03:18.239> what<00:03:19.239> helped<00:03:19.510> me

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
out in fact what helped me

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.040 
out in fact what helped me
on<00:03:20.140> this<00:03:20.320> side<00:03:20.980> was<00:03:21.550> actually<00:03:21.760> touching<00:03:22.450> my

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
on this side was actually touching my

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.790 
on this side was actually touching my
two<00:03:23.110> hands<00:03:23.830> together<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:25.750> allowing<00:03:26.140> them<00:03:26.440> to

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
two hands together and allowing them to

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.390 
two hands together and allowing them to
break<00:03:27.010> apart<00:03:27.600> just<00:03:28.600> actually<00:03:29.380> that<00:03:29.770> one<00:03:30.040> spot

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
break apart just actually that one spot

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.480 
break apart just actually that one spot
where<00:03:30.580> they<00:03:30.640> have<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.940> cross<00:03:32.490> also

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
where they have to cross also

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.300 
where they have to cross also
interesting<00:03:34.060> thing<00:03:34.180> you<00:03:34.270> can<00:03:34.420> do<00:03:34.570> with<00:03:34.690> that

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
interesting thing you can do with that

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.270 
interesting thing you can do with that
you're<00:03:36.310> gonna<00:03:36.490> good<00:03:36.760> friend<00:03:37.030> of<00:03:37.120> mine<00:03:38.280> showed

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
you're gonna good friend of mine showed

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.780 
you're gonna good friend of mine showed
me<00:03:39.490> this<00:03:40.120> kind<00:03:40.420> of<00:03:40.480> hybrid<00:03:40.660> which<00:03:41.790> apologies

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
me this kind of hybrid which apologies

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.660 
me this kind of hybrid which apologies
very<00:03:43.390> sloppy<00:03:43.750> with<00:03:43.960> it<00:03:44.110> still<00:03:44.380> which<00:03:45.280> is

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
very sloppy with it still which is

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.080 
very sloppy with it still which is
basically<00:03:46.450> like<00:03:46.780> I<00:03:47.410> have<00:03:48.310> a<00:03:48.340> great<00:03:48.430> extension

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
basically like I have a great extension

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.480 
basically like I have a great extension

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
in isolation that wheat bread which

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.370 
in isolation that wheat bread which
totally<00:03:54.910> comes<00:03:55.120> together<00:03:55.300> much<00:03:55.660> easier<00:03:56.050> when

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
totally comes together much easier when

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.590 
totally comes together much easier when
you've<00:03:56.530> got<00:03:56.710> the<00:03:56.920> rest<00:03:57.040> of<00:03:57.190> it<00:03:57.310> and<00:03:57.670> last<00:03:58.450> but

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
you've got the rest of it and last but

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.280 
you've got the rest of it and last but
not<00:03:58.750> least<00:03:58.990> on<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.950> hybrid<00:04:00.100> front<00:04:00.750> guy<00:04:01.750> that

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
not least on the hybrid front guy that

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.470 
not least on the hybrid front guy that
got<00:04:02.590> me<00:04:02.740> into<00:04:02.890> thinking<00:04:03.100> well<00:04:03.520> okay<00:04:04.210> I'm

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
got me into thinking well okay I'm

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.630 
got me into thinking well okay I'm
reasonably<00:04:05.050> comfortable<00:04:06.390> with<00:04:07.390> this

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
reasonably comfortable with this

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.620 
reasonably comfortable with this
reasonably<00:04:09.640> comfortable<00:04:09.910> with<00:04:10.920> this<00:04:11.920> but

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
reasonably comfortable with this but

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.600 
reasonably comfortable with this but
what<00:04:13.630> happens<00:04:14.080> if<00:04:14.440> say<00:04:14.890> I<00:04:14.920> reverse<00:04:15.430> the

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
what happens if say I reverse the

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:28.440 
what happens if say I reverse the
direction<00:04:15.640> of<00:04:16.390> one<00:04:17.489> pointedness<00:04:25.920> now<00:04:27.450> the

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
direction of one pointedness now the

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.240 
direction of one pointedness now the
first<00:04:28.780> thing<00:04:28.990> i<00:04:29.110> did<00:04:29.320> this<00:04:29.530> i<00:04:29.740> mistakenly

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
first thing i did this i mistakenly

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
first thing i did this i mistakenly
refer<00:04:30.730> to<00:04:30.970> it<00:04:31.120> as<00:04:31.330> an<00:04:31.720> isolation<00:04:32.230> cat<00:04:32.470> hybrid

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
refer to it as an isolation cat hybrid

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.530 
refer to it as an isolation cat hybrid
and<00:04:34.270> then<00:04:34.480> i<00:04:34.510> took<00:04:34.660> a<00:04:34.870> look<00:04:35.200> and<00:04:35.470> realized<00:04:36.540> that

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
and then i took a look and realized that

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.940 
and then i took a look and realized that
my<00:04:37.690> left<00:04:37.870> hand<00:04:38.080> is<00:04:38.170> being<00:04:38.320> sloppy<00:04:38.590> and<00:04:39.390> that<00:04:40.950> it

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
my left hand is being sloppy and that it

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:48.360 
my left hand is being sloppy and that it
does<00:04:42.280> create<00:04:42.580> a<00:04:43.090> circular<00:04:43.420> motion<00:04:43.840> for<00:04:45.600> my<00:04:47.370> my

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
does create a circular motion for my my

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.940 
does create a circular motion for my my
right<00:04:48.550> hand<00:04:48.820> to<00:04:48.940> follow<00:04:49.680> but<00:04:50.680> it's<00:04:50.830> not

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
right hand to follow but it's not

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.980 
right hand to follow but it's not
actually<00:04:51.220> creating<00:04:51.400> in<00:04:51.610> translation<00:04:52.390> i<00:04:52.600> think

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
actually creating in translation i think

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.990 
actually creating in translation i think
actually<00:04:53.200> it's<00:04:53.620> another<00:04:54.630> ellipse<00:04:55.630> variance

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
actually it's another ellipse variance

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:06.550 
actually it's another ellipse variance
but<00:04:58.440> as<00:04:59.850> time<00:05:00.850> goes<00:05:01.300> on

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.140 

we<00:05:07.070> shall<00:05:07.370> work<00:05:08.980> on<00:05:09.980> adding<00:05:10.340> that<00:05:10.640> difficulty

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
we shall work on adding that difficulty

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.670 
we shall work on adding that difficulty
out<00:05:12.760> so<00:05:13.760> I<00:05:14.090> think<00:05:14.720> this<00:05:14.990> is<00:05:15.050> still<00:05:15.320> technically

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
out so I think this is still technically

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.830 
out so I think this is still technically
a<00:05:15.740> hybrid<00:05:19.060> that's<00:05:20.710> of<00:05:21.710> indeterminate<00:05:22.340> type

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
a hybrid that's of indeterminate type

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.370 
a hybrid that's of indeterminate type
let's<00:05:23.840> dance

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
let's dance

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.560 
let's dance
there's<00:05:24.890> a<00:05:24.950> pattern<00:05:25.130> right<00:05:25.460> so<00:05:25.910> this<00:05:26.150> is<00:05:26.390> cool

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
there's a pattern right so this is cool

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.990 
there's a pattern right so this is cool
these<00:05:26.750> for<00:05:26.900> that<00:05:26.990> reason<00:05:27.850> something<00:05:28.850> that

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
these for that reason something that

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.370 
these for that reason something that
other<00:05:29.330> things<00:05:29.600> have<00:05:29.690> been<00:05:29.780> playing<00:05:30.050> with<00:05:30.170> this

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
other things have been playing with this

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.550 
other things have been playing with this
week<00:05:31.210> my<00:05:32.210> friend<00:05:32.450> Charlie<00:05:32.840> actually<00:05:32.990> showed

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
week my friend Charlie actually showed

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.880 
week my friend Charlie actually showed
an<00:05:33.740> interesting<00:05:33.980> variation<00:05:35.440> oops

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:44.020 

meltdown<00:05:41.650> saucer<00:05:42.650> pattern<00:05:43.040> where<00:05:43.790> you<00:05:43.820> take

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
meltdown saucer pattern where you take

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.460 
meltdown saucer pattern where you take
it<00:05:44.120> over<00:05:44.150> your<00:05:44.330> shoulder<00:05:44.570> like<00:05:44.600> that<00:05:45.070> which

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
it over your shoulder like that which

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.960 
it over your shoulder like that which
this<00:05:48.470> pattern<00:05:48.890> right<00:05:49.040> here<00:05:51.490> which<00:05:52.490> is<00:05:52.520> also<00:05:52.820> a

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
this pattern right here which is also a

00:05:52.970 --> 00:06:04.680 
this pattern right here which is also a
great<00:05:53.120> way<00:05:53.390> to<00:05:54.280> a<00:05:55.280> meeting<00:05:55.580> the<00:05:55.880> back<00:05:56.740> we<00:05:57.740> strap

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.909 

so<00:06:05.690> and<00:06:06.530> then<00:06:07.100> yes<00:06:07.960> if<00:06:08.960> you<00:06:09.140> want<00:06:09.530> to<00:06:09.650> think<00:06:09.830> of

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 
so and then yes if you want to think of

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.940 
so and then yes if you want to think of
it<00:06:10.010> this<00:06:10.070> way<00:06:10.130> I<00:06:10.760> also<00:06:11.750> think<00:06:12.080> of<00:06:12.169> this<00:06:12.320> as<00:06:12.380> a

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950 
it this way I also think of this as a

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
it this way I also think of this as a
given<00:06:13.370> points<00:06:14.979> where<00:06:15.979> you<00:06:16.130> can<00:06:16.340> do<00:06:16.520> this<00:06:16.669> melt

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
given points where you can do this melt

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:24.030 
given points where you can do this melt
down<00:06:19.870> and<00:06:20.870> cross<00:06:21.350> hybrids<00:06:22.010> I<00:06:22.330> guess<00:06:23.330> this<00:06:23.510> is

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.040 
down and cross hybrids I guess this is

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.980 
down and cross hybrids I guess this is
but<00:06:25.330> it's<00:06:26.330> the<00:06:26.510> way<00:06:26.660> that<00:06:26.690> the<00:06:26.930> two<00:06:27.310> I<00:06:28.720> know<00:06:29.720> how

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
but it's the way that the two I know how

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.750 
but it's the way that the two I know how
do<00:06:30.050> ya<00:06:30.500> know<00:06:31.360> how<00:06:32.360> it's<00:06:32.510> going<00:06:32.660> over<00:06:33.110> this<00:06:33.760> red

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760 
do ya know how it's going over this red

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:42.400 
do ya know how it's going over this red
and<00:06:34.790> then<00:06:35.150> you<00:06:35.479> straight<00:06:35.810> up<00:06:36.340> across<00:06:41.410> of

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:42.410 
and then you straight up across of

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:47.650 
and then you straight up across of
course<00:06:43.510> here<00:06:44.510> should<00:06:45.410> be<00:06:46.360> should<00:06:47.360> be<00:06:47.450> possible

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:47.660 
course here should be should be possible

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:59.710 
course here should be should be possible
to<00:06:47.990> do<00:06:49.540> something<00:06:50.540> relatively<00:06:51.110> similar<00:06:58.720> think

00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720 
to do something relatively similar think

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.850 
to do something relatively similar think
that's<00:06:59.900> Bennet<00:07:00.350> that<00:07:00.530> I've<00:07:00.620> been<00:07:00.710> playing

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:00.860 
that's Bennet that I've been playing

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.080 
that's Bennet that I've been playing
with<00:07:01.100> this<00:07:01.250> past<00:07:01.520> week

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.090 
with this past week

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.810 
with this past week
or<00:07:04.090> my<00:07:04.180> solutions<00:07:04.660> of<00:07:04.810> course<00:07:05.050> I<00:07:05.640> clearly<00:07:06.640> need

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:06.820 
or my solutions of course I clearly need

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:20.670 
or my solutions of course I clearly need
practice<00:07:07.210> with<00:07:07.390> them<00:07:16.740> so<00:07:17.740> yeah<00:07:19.350> for<00:07:20.350> this<00:07:20.470> week

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:20.680 
practice with them so yeah for this week

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.430 
practice with them so yeah for this week
thanks<00:07:21.070> for<00:07:21.100> watching
