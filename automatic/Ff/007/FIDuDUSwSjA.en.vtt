inch<00:02:02.400> above<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.910> lateral<00:02:03.360> line<00:02:03.830> and<00:02:04.830> feel

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
inch above the lateral line and feel

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.060 
inch above the lateral line and feel
them<00:02:05.310> with<00:02:05.430> your<00:02:05.580> index<00:02:05.910> finger<00:02:06.120> there<00:02:06.600> and

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
we'll make a slice right over the top of

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.430 
we'll make a slice right over the top of
them<00:02:10.080> first<00:02:10.410> straight<00:02:10.830> down<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.260> can

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
them first straight down and you can

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.290 
them first straight down and you can
feel<00:02:13.740> these<00:02:14.160> go<00:02:14.370> down<00:02:14.400> about<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.850> quarter-inch

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
feel these go down about a quarter-inch

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.510 
feel these go down about a quarter-inch
into<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.810> meat<00:02:15.960> you<00:02:16.170> can<00:02:16.320> feel<00:02:16.560> what<00:02:16.860> bones<00:02:17.130> so

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
into the meat you can feel what bones so

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.430 
into the meat you can feel what bones so
then<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.820> make<00:02:18.030> angle<00:02:18.780> your<00:02:18.930> knife<00:02:19.140> out

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
then you make angle your knife out

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.790 
then you make angle your knife out
toward<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.980> back<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:21.080> make<00:02:22.080> another<00:02:22.230> slice

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
toward the back and make another slice

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.090 
toward the back and make another slice
just<00:02:23.580> bought<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.210> skin<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:25.530> then<00:02:25.980> the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
just bought to the skin and then the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.949 
just bought to the skin and then the
second<00:02:26.490> slice<00:02:26.760> underneath<00:02:27.360> them<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.690> going<00:02:27.870> to

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
second slice underneath them is going to

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.410 
second slice underneath them is going to
be<00:02:28.020> rate<00:02:28.320> from<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.709> lateral<00:02:29.070> line<00:02:29.400> at<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.820> 45

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
be rate from the lateral line at a 45

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.250 
be rate from the lateral line at a 45
degree<00:02:30.450> angle<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.180> pretty<00:02:33.690> much<00:02:33.780> gets

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
degree angle and that pretty much gets

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
degree angle and that pretty much gets
right<00:02:34.470> underneath<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:35.070> Y<00:02:35.190> bones<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:44.100> can

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
right underneath the Y bones and you can

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.160 
right underneath the Y bones and you can
just<00:02:44.459> remove<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:45.120> strip<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.690> meat<00:02:45.900> and

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
that's all the bones in the fully a

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.750 
that's all the bones in the fully a
right<00:02:48.180> there<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.230> Y<00:02:49.709> bones<00:02:50.010> are<00:02:50.190> located

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
right there and the Y bones are located

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.790 
right there and the Y bones are located
about<00:02:50.940> 1/4<00:02:51.300> inch<00:02:51.450> above<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.080> lateral<00:02:52.290> line

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
about 1/4 inch above the lateral line

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.710 
about 1/4 inch above the lateral line
and<00:02:53.160> we're<00:02:53.280> going<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.430> make<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.790> cut<00:02:54.060> right<00:02:54.270> on

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
and we're going to make it cut right on

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.190 
and we're going to make it cut right on
top<00:02:55.050> of<00:02:55.080> them<00:02:55.410> first<00:02:56.360> and<00:02:57.360> cut<00:02:57.630> just<00:02:57.870> above

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
top of them first and cut just above

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.470 
top of them first and cut just above
like<00:02:58.500> eighth<00:02:58.739> of<00:02:59.010> an<00:02:59.100> inch<00:02:59.190> above<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.610> Y<00:03:00.180> bones

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
like eighth of an inch above the Y bones

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.990 
like eighth of an inch above the Y bones
and<00:03:00.870> Don<00:03:01.350> about<00:03:01.650> 1/4<00:03:01.950> inch<00:03:02.100> into<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.700> flesh

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
and Don about 1/4 inch into the flesh

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.460 
and Don about 1/4 inch into the flesh
you'll<00:03:03.269> feel<00:03:03.540> them<00:03:03.720> with<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.870> knife

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
you'll feel them with a knife

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.550 
you'll feel them with a knife
the<00:03:05.400> second<00:03:06.090> cut<00:03:06.330> you<00:03:06.540> make<00:03:06.720> at<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:06.959> 45<00:03:07.530> degree

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
the second cut you make at a 45 degree

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.240 
the second cut you make at a 45 degree
angle<00:03:08.810> now<00:03:09.810> I'm<00:03:09.959> pretty<00:03:10.170> close<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.830> skin

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
angle now I'm pretty close to the skin

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.690 
angle now I'm pretty close to the skin
and<00:03:11.760> that's<00:03:12.630> one<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.080> cut<00:03:13.260> their<00:03:13.530> second<00:03:14.519> cut

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
and that's one to cut their second cut

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.300 
and that's one to cut their second cut
is<00:03:15.000> right<00:03:15.269> at<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.690> lateral<00:03:16.050> line<00:03:16.350> I<00:03:16.620> had<00:03:16.739> a<00:03:16.769> 45

is right at the lateral line I had a 45

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.170 
is right at the lateral line I had a 45
degree<00:03:17.550> angle<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.920> pretty<00:03:20.370> much<00:03:20.550> that<00:03:20.880> was

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
degree angle and pretty much that was

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.560 
degree angle and pretty much that was
right<00:03:21.420> underneath<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:22.170> rib<00:03:22.739> or<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.790> rule<00:03:24.420> of

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
right underneath that rib or the rule of

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.530 
right underneath that rib or the rule of
Y<00:03:25.080> bones<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:26.430> can<00:03:26.580> just<00:03:26.730> pretty<00:03:27.000> much<00:03:27.090> peel

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
Y bones you can just pretty much peel

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.830 
Y bones you can just pretty much peel
that<00:03:27.750> right<00:03:27.810> off<00:03:28.049> like<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:29.450> and<00:03:30.450> that<00:03:30.600> makes

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
that right off like that and that makes

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.410 
that right off like that and that makes
a<00:03:30.989> boneless<00:03:31.230> filet<00:03:31.760> I'm<00:03:32.760> gonna<00:03:32.940> go<00:03:33.090> ahead<00:03:33.180> and

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
a boneless filet I'm gonna go ahead and

a boneless filet I'm gonna go ahead and
skin<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.900> fish<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:35.730> hand<00:03:35.970> knife<00:03:37.700> in<00:03:38.700> angle

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.150 
your knife at about a 30-degree angle
and<00:03:42.390> just<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.720> sighing<00:03:43.019> motion<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:43.799> don't
