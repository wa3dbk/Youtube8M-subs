00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 welcome gentlemen them some hands 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.650
 for it castle transmitting from 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.140
 Lima Peru for people scattering their 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.750
 points is opportunity with the unboxing of 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.750
 the network is the eos must be taken into account 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.389
 that reigns is the company or brand that 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.910
 does the program interface is called 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.480
 sernatur sky wife not to be confused 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.220
 with that and nobody gets the box so we're going 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.220
 to do the unboxing 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.719
 despite the fact that the inside of the box 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.989
 the first thing that we are going to realize 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:38.989
 with four rca cables 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.920
 without any good usb cable 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.530
 this here if I do not say are some legs that 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.969
 you can add the interface so you do not 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.000
 be directly on some 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.740
 surface 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.530
 if we have what he is 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.810
 the software well if it 's version 2.2 the 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.890
 current version if I do not arrive at 22.42 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.600
 follow 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.330
 download the latest version after 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.780
 We will see what it is and bring them with thesis 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.060
 the additions 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.990
 we already have the interface itself 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.860
 we 'll see it in seconds sevilla 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.860
 we have the parts 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.780
 we have 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.150
 and a guarantee stickers 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.830
 and we have here 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.830
 a quick installation guide 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.870
 the first steps and very important the 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.030
 calibration both to come and for 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.420
 if you read ceratto recommends that you release 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.119
 the clogged bag is there every time 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.830
 we use a new unit then it is 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.530
 important to be a good calibration 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.979
 to be able to achieve that the 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.350
 cerato and the king and a set of friends 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.930
 It's simple and the player works very 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.550
 well are the steps and in the parts 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.539
 back of the world short cuts for what 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.539
 which is the senate is class life 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.600
 and then we have 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.950
 a manual 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.780
 a manual of the functions of the cerrato 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.080
 the sun life and some super tips 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.180
 important is a reality and is in 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.830
 English or in Spanish those who speak their 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.830
 English will have an advantage 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.140
 and at the end we have new vinyls 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:44.150
 and now yes to finish the interface 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.290
 now many wonder why that 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.709
 data is more expensive 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.530
 I have two or three answers for that 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:55.859
 first because that deal has a 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.359
 agreement with king on the subject of 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.099
 licenses that means that the 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:02.310
 Ceratto's license is Carlos Jalif 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.959
 free for life to queen and do 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.459
 very interested in both putting the 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.579
 program interests you that you buy in 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.220
 the hardware and the ham is the key to 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:14.660
 open the program 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:17.690
 second the labor of that interface 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.310
 is clearly gringa a gringo or someone 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.030
 with green car he has made it very manufactured 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.650
 in china and finally greim and it will be where 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.470
 no agreement to the people and while having 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.690
 to be able to download free music to 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.180
 through the page while at the moment 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.450
 subscribe to download the software and 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.220
 they will also get a confirmation 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.190
 pay for that he writes is water and music 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.770
 free of the agreements that white has 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.690
 label with the left one there is no 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.370
 Latin music theme and so for that 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.200
 find electronic hip hop from the 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.660
 kinds of cute European things 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:55.850
 seriously that interface replaces the 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:58.870
 sl one has port 2.0 and its 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:02.360
 converters are four thousand 648 coffee 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.090
 fourth said hertz how it connects in the 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:09.950
 top we have the entrance 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:12.560
 of players line 1 and 2012 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.519
 we have a switch here for what it is 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.970
 phone eyes and vinyl and the great for 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.850
 land 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.560
 the energy input in the part 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.410
 front we have 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:28.639
 already the outputs to the mixed and the call 2.0 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:31.160
 and the ignition switch there are solids like 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.380
 says his name is for two channels the sl 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.960
 3 work three channels and sl 4 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.430
 works to 4 channels now if you 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.050
 they ask why I buy this interface 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.490
 because I work and already say a 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.430
 time with serrat or dÃ­az and the 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.860
 controller is x I come from the lic 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.770
 so I have my Japanese marcus 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.389
 Wright will already in fact be everything is much 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.820
 easier to make the change or make 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.840
 switch it's been a while since I went to another 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.760
 Interface 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.800
 I want to emphasize again who will be everything 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.870
 selaive comes with the license and via 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.910
 you do not have to pay for the license that 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.560
 it means that from the relationship one 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.260
 that came out to three live channels up 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.300
 the current version 2.42 absolutely 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.710
 nobody has paid a single for the license 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.250
 the cerato that has already been included within 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.530
 of the price of the interface control other 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.490
 the advantage of working with the products 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.460
 of renato also 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.319
 is that both are plan play connect the 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.729
 laptop to the interface and the secret is to 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.960
 realize that you have a hardware 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.090
 connected king and will open 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.410
 automatically the scratch live 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.930
 we do not forget to do any kind of 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.120
 configuration the sheraton does it by 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.560
 we the English have all been 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.150
 speed and seem has been transmitting 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.419
 from Lima Peru for people and expression 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.160
 fundalex do not forget to give us your 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:43.139
 comments between the notes are likes in 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.240
 facebook and on youtube your tweets in 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:49.759
 twitter and other social networks 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.759
 well now yes the support less sofa
