00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040

I<00:00:50.969> find<00:00:51.149> one<00:00:51.920> you<00:00:52.920> think<00:00:53.100> Napper<00:00:54.079> Arana<00:00:55.079> is

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
I find one you think Napper Arana is

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.619 
I find one you think Napper Arana is
just<00:00:55.320> some<00:00:55.410> along<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.770> bill<00:00:55.949> find<00:00:56.250> one<00:00:56.370> but

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
just some along that bill find one but

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.849 
just some along that bill find one but
apparently<00:00:57.629> it's<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> crossover<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.379> well<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
apparently it's a crossover and well the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.290 
apparently it's a crossover and well the
earlier<00:00:59.129> ones<00:00:59.280> bill<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.640> year<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.000> still

between 56 and 57 and go on the truck

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.590 
between 56 and 57 and go on the truck
I'm<00:01:03.660> gonna<00:01:03.840> try<00:01:03.989> out<00:01:04.170> here<00:01:04.409> shortly

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
I'm gonna try out here shortly

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.380 
I'm gonna try out here shortly
it's<00:01:06.600> fresh<00:01:06.750> straight<00:01:06.900> up

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:42.990 

it<00:01:12.990> does<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.290> smells<00:01:13.380> bad<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:13.920> hot<00:01:14.100> here

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.540 

Skyler's<00:01:44.000> leaky<00:01:44.299> exhaust

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.510 

does<00:01:49.210> run<00:01:49.420> drive

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.810 

the<00:01:54.880> fuel<00:01:55.420> tanks<00:01:55.689> still<00:01:55.869> so<00:01:56.079> I<00:01:56.140> got<00:01:56.350> my<00:01:56.729> chest<00:01:57.729> a

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
the fuel tanks still so I got my chest a

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:09.300 
the fuel tanks still so I got my chest a
moral<00:01:58.119> ball<00:01:59.759> very<00:02:00.759> much

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.250 

that's<00:02:09.940> a<00:02:10.030> cold<00:02:10.209> start<00:02:10.539> there<00:02:10.780> after<00:02:11.050> all<00:02:11.200> the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
that's a cold start there after all the

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.030 
that's a cold start there after all the
to<00:02:11.410> really<00:02:12.340> go<00:02:12.459> wrong<00:02:12.610> with<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.830> we're<00:02:15.010> I

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
to really go wrong with that and we're I

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.100 
to really go wrong with that and we're I
guess<00:02:16.350> so<00:02:17.350> I'm<00:02:17.650> going<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:17.950> go<00:02:18.130> ahead<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:19.110> buy

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
guess so I'm going to go ahead and buy

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.140 
guess so I'm going to go ahead and buy
next<00:02:20.440> part<00:02:20.590> of<00:02:20.620> this<00:02:20.709> project<00:02:21.160> we'll<00:02:22.120> be

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
next part of this project we'll be

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.070 
next part of this project we'll be
pulling<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.200> gas<00:02:23.380> tank<00:02:23.680> cleaning<00:02:24.040> it<00:02:24.100> out

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
pulling the gas tank cleaning it out

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
pulling the gas tank cleaning it out
possibly<00:02:26.080> it's<00:02:26.230> gonna<00:02:26.380> get<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.530> new<00:02:26.680> fuel<00:02:26.920> pump

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
possibly it's gonna get a new fuel pump

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.620 
possibly it's gonna get a new fuel pump
I<00:02:27.370> haven't<00:02:27.670> got<00:02:27.790> that<00:02:27.819> far<00:02:28.120> yet<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.480> see<00:02:28.569> if

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
I haven't got that far yet and see if

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.190 
I haven't got that far yet and see if
the<00:02:28.690> old<00:02:28.870> one<00:02:28.959> still<00:02:29.080> works<00:02:29.410> or<00:02:29.560> not<00:02:31.110> then<00:02:32.110> I

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
the old one still works or not then I

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.920 
the old one still works or not then I
move<00:02:32.410> on<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.620> brakes<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:34.480> I<00:02:36.540> check<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.660> Napo

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
move on to brakes so I check the Napo

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.870 
move on to brakes so I check the Napo
you<00:02:38.050> can<00:02:38.170> still<00:02:38.350> get<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.800> brake<00:02:39.310> master

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
you can still get to a brake master

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.479 
you can still get to a brake master
cylinder<00:02:40.270> rebuild<00:02:40.630> kit<00:02:40.890> as<00:02:41.890> well<00:02:42.040> as<00:02:42.310> we'll

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
cylinder rebuild kit as well as we'll

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.210 
cylinder rebuild kit as well as we'll
sit<00:02:42.670> on<00:02:42.700> a<00:02:42.790> rebuild<00:02:43.090> kit<00:02:43.150> for<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.480> won<00:02:43.630> tons

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
sit on a rebuild kit for the won tons

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.630 
sit on a rebuild kit for the won tons
hopefully<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.370> right<00:02:45.550> thing<00:02:45.900> we'll<00:02:46.900> see<00:02:47.080> I've

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
hopefully the right thing we'll see I've

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.930 
hopefully the right thing we'll see I've
made<00:02:48.640> numerous<00:02:48.790> trips<00:02:49.090> so<00:02:49.360> far<00:02:49.800> trying<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:50.980> get
