00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.640
 clearly how these fish swim well, more precisely 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.640
 here we will not reveal everything 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.890
 we stayed unfortunately in ours 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.380

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.740
 only two colors I did not have time to take you off 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.700
 all other colors were with us or 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:28.020
 the greens were pink now left here 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:32.869
 only blue and orange but not the most 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:37.110
 the running colors are very beautiful bright 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:41.490
 Well, so were the other green and 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.790
 pink ones are such fish 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:49.350
 see what comes here comes in two 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:53.610
 batteries here two such here 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.189
 pretty little batteries of the fish itself 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.979
 the battery is already inserted so how are you 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.280
 just open the package and run 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:06.030
 fish water she already you will immediately swim 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.929
 which additionally do not need to insert but 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.810
 I want to say what batteries if often 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.620
 to use 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.950
 always sit pretty fast if 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.550
 there swim an hour in the tub with the fish she 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.239
 Of course you have a low battery 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.290
 because the fish are very active 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.220
 spend 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.170
 inner and therefore stock up on a battery 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.170
 my who is going to use often 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.540
 batteries are very cheap to own 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.400
 here are such small and moreover 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:46.450
 inserted one by one thing so 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:50.790
 there will be no problems on our packaging 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:54.459
 it is indicated that these toys are 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.040
 intended for children from 14 years old 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:01.000
 what I want to tell you is of course full 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:05.010
 Brad at 14 I think that children already 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.580

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.950

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.590
 I even want to tell you from two years 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.090
 it will be interesting to children you can run them 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.310
 in the bathroom you can run them 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.129
 the aquarium can be run at all where 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.819
 wherever there is some water there but 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:29.310
 about that, like me 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.540

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:39.420
 please i will show you now how it is 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:44.970
 all the plan so therefore such here are the fish 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:47.890
 you can give a gift that's well and the kids 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.680
 adults too, for the sake of such interest 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:54.040
 can have fun with such interesting 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.590
 I already took one out of the packaging with fish 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:01.200
 Here I have it in my hands 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:06.970
 fish in it, he is such a soft tail 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:11.109
 so that's how the rubber stir bends 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:15.609
 and not even try to show it in 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:18.400
 hand 3 months from the beginning of wagging well 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:24.550
 so I because she squeezed these 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:27.099
 here are the graduations here on the soup tour which 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.960
 reacts to touch starts in 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:34.840
 here's a hand even without water 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:39.849
 flutter interesting fish so what 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:44.139
 launched yes come on friend floated here 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:46.120
 so it's interesting she bends in the water here 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:50.020
 they are such modes there she can right 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.300
 speed up and slow down when there is 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.880
 pretty good depth 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.990
 she will sink to the bottom 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:03.030
 up that is and absolutely they are safe 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:06.460

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:21.000
