tablets on the market it does have a

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.779 
tablets on the market it does have a
good<00:01:17.229> speed<00:01:17.680> but<00:01:18.280> definitely<00:01:18.640> not<00:01:18.729> the

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
good speed but definitely not the

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:20.999 
good speed but definitely not the
fastest<00:01:19.450> what's<00:01:20.170> powering<00:01:20.500> this<00:01:20.710> is<00:01:20.950> a

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
fastest what's powering this is a

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.120 
fastest what's powering this is a
dual-core<00:01:21.640> processor<00:01:22.630> clocked<00:01:23.229> in<00:01:23.409> at<00:01:23.560> 1.2

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
dual-core processor clocked in at 1.2

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.480 
dual-core processor clocked in at 1.2
gigahertz<00:01:24.880> and<00:01:25.359> a<00:01:26.229> graphics<00:01:27.009> card<00:01:27.219> that<00:01:27.280> is

gigahertz and a graphics card that is

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.480 
gigahertz and a graphics card that is
fairly<00:01:27.909> generic<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:29.530> terms<00:01:29.950> of<00:01:30.159> built-in

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
fairly generic in terms of built-in

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.029 
fairly generic in terms of built-in
storage<00:01:30.520> you<00:01:31.119> have<00:01:31.149> about<00:01:31.630> five<00:01:31.990> point<00:01:32.380> one

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
storage you have about five point one

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.130 
storage you have about five point one
three<00:01:33.340> that<00:01:33.609> you<00:01:33.729> start<00:01:34.000> off<00:01:34.149> with<00:01:34.420> which

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
three that you start off with which

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.410 
three that you start off with which
gives<00:01:35.409> you<00:01:35.530> a<00:01:35.619> decent<00:01:35.890> amount<00:01:36.310> of<00:01:36.460> apps<00:01:36.789> space

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
gives you a decent amount of apps space

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.929 
gives you a decent amount of apps space
but<00:01:37.840> again<00:01:38.469> it<00:01:38.950> depends<00:01:39.250> on<00:01:39.369> how<00:01:39.520> quickly<00:01:39.700> you

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
but again it depends on how quickly you

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.560 
but again it depends on how quickly you
can<00:01:40.119> fill<00:01:40.299> that<00:01:40.329> up<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:42.159> terms<00:01:42.670> of<00:01:42.939> sound

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
can fill that up in terms of sound

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.169 
can fill that up in terms of sound
quality<00:01:43.869> it's<00:01:44.439> okay<00:01:44.979> it's<00:01:45.369> not<00:01:45.549> the<00:01:45.880> best

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
quality it's okay it's not the best

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.389 
quality it's okay it's not the best
definitely<00:01:47.109> out<00:01:47.229> there<00:01:47.259> I<00:01:47.710> don't<00:01:48.159> like<00:01:48.280> the

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
definitely out there I don't like the

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.580 
definitely out there I don't like the
speaker<00:01:48.729> placement<00:01:49.060> per<00:01:49.420> se<00:01:49.630> because<00:01:49.869> it's<00:01:50.380> on

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
speaker placement per se because it's on

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:59.260 
speaker placement per se because it's on
the<00:01:50.770> back<00:01:51.009> and<00:01:51.719> even<00:01:52.719> at<00:01:52.869> the<00:01:52.990> loudest<00:01:53.380> setting

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.450 

it<00:02:00.270> sounds<00:02:00.900> muffled<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.710> again<00:02:02.070> just<00:02:02.280> because

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
it sounds muffled and again just because

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.700 
it sounds muffled and again just because
it's<00:02:02.730> away<00:02:02.940> from<00:02:02.970> you<00:02:03.330> it<00:02:03.660> doesn't<00:02:04.110> sound<00:02:04.410> as

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
it's away from you it doesn't sound as

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.400 
it's away from you it doesn't sound as
well<00:02:04.980> as<00:02:05.010> you<00:02:05.220> would<00:02:05.370> probably<00:02:05.760> like<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:06.180> to
