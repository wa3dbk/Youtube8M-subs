you<00:00:30.869> remember<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.320> very<00:00:31.560> often<00:00:31.830> I'll<00:00:32.160> twist

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
you remember that very often I'll twist

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.280 
you remember that very often I'll twist
my<00:00:32.579> hair<00:00:32.759> before<00:00:32.850> going<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.239> bed<00:00:33.390> that's

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
my hair before going to bed that's

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.889 
my hair before going to bed that's
because<00:00:34.680> when<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.010> lie<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.370> my<00:00:35.550> head<00:00:36.059> my<00:00:36.630> happy

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
because when I lie in my head my happy

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.650 
because when I lie in my head my happy
cap<00:00:37.290> becomes<00:00:37.770> matted<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.340> becomes<00:00:38.670> compacted

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
cap becomes matted it becomes compacted

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.350 
cap becomes matted it becomes compacted
together<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:41.070> also<00:00:41.399> makes<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.910> tangle

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
together and that also makes a tangle

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.790 
together and that also makes a tangle
more<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.780> makes<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.170> more<00:00:43.290> difficult<00:00:43.500> to

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
more and makes it more difficult to

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.430 
more and makes it more difficult to
manage<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.190> next<00:00:44.460> day<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.300> twist<00:00:45.989> your<00:00:46.079> hair

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
manage the next day so twist your hair

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.029 
manage the next day so twist your hair
before<00:00:46.770> bed<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.670> detangle<00:00:48.030> mmm<00:00:48.840> three<00:00:49.710> I

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
before bed to detangle mmm three I

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.479 
before bed to detangle mmm three I
always<00:00:50.670> finger<00:00:51.449> comb<00:00:51.710> before<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.949> use<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> comb

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
always finger comb before I use a comb

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.880 
always finger comb before I use a comb
or<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:54.090> may<00:00:54.360> sometimes<00:00:54.960> especially<00:00:55.379> during<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
or I may sometimes especially during the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.490 
or I may sometimes especially during the
week<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.280> will<00:00:56.670> finger<00:00:57.270> comb<00:00:57.600> entirely<00:00:58.320> and

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
week I will finger comb entirely and

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.400 
week I will finger comb entirely and
that<00:00:59.010> really<00:00:59.579> reduces<00:00:59.850> tangling<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:01.109> when<00:01:01.379> I

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
that really reduces tangling so when I

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.860 
that really reduces tangling so when I
handle<00:01:01.770> my<00:01:01.890> hair<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.430> use<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> downward<00:01:03.690> motion

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
handle my hair I use a downward motion

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.630 
handle my hair I use a downward motion

more<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:27.060> not<00:01:27.659> talked<00:01:27.930> about<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.320> quite<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.560> bit

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
more I not talked about this quite a bit

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.069 
more I not talked about this quite a bit

your overall has a lower tendency to

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.980 
your overall has a lower tendency to
tangle<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:47.149> timing<00:01:48.149> has<00:01:48.420> become<00:01:48.630> more<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.899> a

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
tangle so timing has become more of a

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.140 
tangle so timing has become more of a
problem<00:01:49.290> as<00:01:49.560> my<00:01:49.710> hands

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
problem as my hands

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.190

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
deal with a single strand not well by

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.810 
deal with a single strand not well by
the<00:02:17.720> way<00:02:17.960> when<00:02:18.500> my<00:02:18.620> hair<00:02:18.830> gets<00:02:18.980> really<00:02:19.400> knotted

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
the way when my hair gets really knotted

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.760 
the way when my hair gets really knotted
and<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:20.030> can't<00:02:20.240> entangle<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:21.020> just<00:02:21.530> cut<00:02:21.680> it

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
and I can't entangle it I just cut it

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.490 
and I can't entangle it I just cut it
off<00:02:22.060> that's<00:02:23.060> pretty<00:02:23.240> much<00:02:23.420> what<00:02:23.630> I<00:02:23.660> do<00:02:23.780> so<00:02:23.930> I

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
off that's pretty much what I do so I

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.620 
off that's pretty much what I do so I
will<00:02:24.650> use<00:02:24.830> my<00:02:25.130> fingers<00:02:25.640> as<00:02:25.730> much<00:02:25.970> as<00:02:26.240> possible

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
and then when I reach a point when I'm

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.230 
and then when I reach a point when I'm
like<00:02:28.880> this<00:02:29.410> isn't<00:02:30.410> gonna<00:02:30.590> happen<00:02:30.709> I<00:02:31.160> just<00:02:31.459> take
