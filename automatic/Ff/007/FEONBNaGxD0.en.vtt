00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 so as usual a little video 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.970
 to show the progress of 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.760
 electronics is here on the front 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.190
 arm and whose repellents I presented 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.370
 so we will have at the level of the hands 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.090
 So in this case it is to be used 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.850
 again a module are hong hao also 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.820
 in use 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.380
 what's called an effect sensors 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.880
 hall have roughly speaking with a field 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.910
 magnetic that we apply so 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.790
 simply a magnet we can use it 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.340
 like a switch so here we have 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:46.460
 puffed up and when we go with a 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:49.160
 loving so the idea will be to house him at 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:57.550
 level of the wrist guards in 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:01:02.059
 straightening the hand and we sing it then 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:07.550
 the advantage is that we can change 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:09.200
 mode using a button is then at this 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:16.549
 moment we can do that my level 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:18.850
 of the film conquered his jacket in pause and 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.710
 we release 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.750
 So that's about all I was 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.570
 there are other possibilities that are 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.430
 related sound modules ie 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.590
 increase decrease the sound 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.910
 we can also change the intensity 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.450
 average luminous as well as time of 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.400
 create the speed in fact of felines and 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:53.640
 Feddal of tony wore lights 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:55.500
 so we go back to shooting mode then 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.160
 the idea I think is that I will do it 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.860
 in one of the gauntlets a shooting mode and 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:16.160
 in the other bank but a mode 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:16.160
 round trip feel that's it
