I think it's fine for them to stand up

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.110 
I think it's fine for them to stand up
to<00:02:28.440> school<00:02:28.709> just<00:02:28.739> as<00:02:29.099> long<00:02:29.310> as<00:02:29.459> they're<00:02:29.610> not<00:02:29.670> in

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
she'll climb on my lap I mean you know

being<00:02:55.590> their<00:02:55.769> mother<00:02:56.329> they<00:02:57.329> would<00:02:57.540> feel<00:02:57.750> less

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
being their mother they would feel less

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.830 
being their mother they would feel less
free<00:02:58.379> I<00:02:58.410> think<00:02:58.829> with<00:02:58.980> me<00:02:59.160> around<00:02:59.450> so<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.480> would

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
free I think with me around so I would

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.630 
free I think with me around so I would
rather<00:03:01.019> be<00:03:01.200> involved<00:03:01.709> in<00:03:01.829> everything<00:03:02.220> else

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
rather be involved in everything else

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.000 
rather be involved in everything else
you<00:03:03.209> know<00:03:03.329> outside<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.379> it<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.829> know

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
you know outside of it you know

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.860 
you know outside of it you know
organizing<00:03:05.430> camping<00:03:06.209> trips<00:03:06.390> or<00:03:06.569> give<00:03:06.780> you

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
organizing camping trips or give you

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.300 
organizing camping trips or give you
know<00:03:06.989> there's<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.560> lot<00:03:07.709> of<00:03:07.739> ways<00:03:07.920> like<00:03:08.069> being

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
know there's a lot of ways like being

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.300 
know there's a lot of ways like being
involved<00:03:08.519> but<00:03:08.700> not<00:03:09.170> being<00:03:10.170> there<00:03:10.829> during<00:03:11.099> the

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
involved but not being there during the

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.110 
involved but not being there during the
school<00:03:11.579> day<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:12.920> think<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.250> would<00:03:14.400> be<00:03:14.549> hard

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
school day I think it would be hard

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.280 
school day I think it would be hard
being<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.690> pain<00:03:16.019> and<00:03:16.440> then<00:03:17.209> these<00:03:18.209> days<00:03:18.780> you

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
being a pain and then these days you

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.640 
being a pain and then these days you
might<00:03:19.500> hear<00:03:19.890> your<00:03:20.250> child<00:03:20.579> swear<00:03:21.209> or<00:03:22.109> something

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
might hear your child swear or something

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.990 
might hear your child swear or something
like<00:03:22.799> that<00:03:23.130> oh<00:03:23.160> oh

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
like that oh oh

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.479 
like that oh oh
playing<00:03:24.480> violent<00:03:25.049> games<00:03:25.410> or<00:03:25.769> whatever<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.310> is

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
playing violent games or whatever it is

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.550 
playing violent games or whatever it is
and<00:03:26.910> I<00:03:27.150> think<00:03:27.810> that's<00:03:27.989> probably<00:03:28.169> there<00:03:28.530> are

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
and I think that's probably there are

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.339 
and I think that's probably there are
this<00:03:28.889> part<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.430> then<00:03:29.940> they<00:03:30.419> still<00:03:30.840> want<00:03:31.079> to<00:03:31.230> be

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
this part and then they still want to be

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.819 
this part and then they still want to be
the<00:03:31.680> parent<00:03:32.069> of<00:03:32.239> duty<00:03:33.239> and<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:34.410> think<00:03:34.709> that

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
the parent of duty and I think that

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.069 
the parent of duty and I think that
would<00:03:34.980> be<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.129> hardest<00:03:35.579> part<00:03:35.879> I<00:03:36.180> mean<00:03:36.959> it

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
would be the hardest part I mean it

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.539 
would be the hardest part I mean it
really<00:03:37.230> depends<00:03:37.680> on<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:37.859> kid<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.190> depends<00:03:38.489> on

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
really depends on the kid and depends on

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.089 
really depends on the kid and depends on
the<00:03:38.609> parent<00:03:38.940> but<00:03:39.269> I<00:03:39.329> think<00:03:39.690> for<00:03:39.870> most<00:03:40.099> most

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
the parent but I think for most most

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.150 
the parent but I think for most most
parents<00:03:41.459> for<00:03:41.639> most<00:03:41.849> kids<00:03:42.030> they<00:03:42.989> tend<00:03:43.349> to<00:03:43.530> make

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
parents for most kids they tend to make

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.449 
parents for most kids they tend to make
the<00:03:44.370> kids<00:03:44.599> unless<00:03:45.599> comfortable<00:03:46.379> just<00:03:47.250> paint

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
the kids unless comfortable just paint

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.750 
the kids unless comfortable just paint
themselves<00:03:49.010> but<00:03:50.010> that's<00:03:50.220> not<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.459> say<00:03:50.489> that

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
themselves but that's not to say that

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.159 
themselves but that's not to say that
parents<00:03:51.329> are<00:03:51.419> not<00:03:51.599> involved<00:03:51.840> at<00:03:52.049> all<00:03:52.109> in

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
parents are not involved at all in

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.559 
parents are not involved at all in
school<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:53.459> mean<00:03:53.879> parents<00:03:54.150> are<00:03:54.299> voting<00:03:54.540> members

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
school I mean parents are voting members

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.379 
school I mean parents are voting members
of<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:54.959> school<00:03:55.169> assembly<00:03:55.849> which<00:03:56.849> doesn't

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
of the school assembly which doesn't

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:58.909 
of the school assembly which doesn't
really<00:03:57.569> have<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:58.019> day-to-day<00:03:58.590> management

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
really have a day-to-day management

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:02.360 
really have a day-to-day management
function<00:03:59.579> but<00:04:00.120> does<00:04:00.829> sort<00:04:01.829> of<00:04:01.919> approve<00:04:02.220> the

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
function but does sort of approve the

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.069 
function but does sort of approve the
budget<00:04:02.519> at<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.120> end<00:04:03.269> of<00:04:03.359> the<00:04:03.419> year<00:04:03.599> is<00:04:03.870> the

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
budget at the end of the year is the

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.129 
budget at the end of the year is the
legal<00:04:04.919> governing<00:04:05.310> body<00:04:05.489> of<00:04:05.609> the<00:04:05.790> school<00:04:06.139> and

legal governing body of the school and

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.800 
legal governing body of the school and
there's<00:04:07.650> certainly<00:04:08.000> I<00:04:09.000> think<00:04:09.449> in<00:04:09.720> most

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
there's certainly I think in most

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.150 
there's certainly I think in most
separate<00:04:10.230> schools<00:04:10.500> certainly<00:04:10.709> it's<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.129> very

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
separate schools certainly it's a very

separate schools certainly it's a very

so they're not really very social but at

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.850 
so they're not really very social but at
the<00:05:29.390> same<00:05:29.570> time<00:05:29.780> we<00:05:29.990> have<00:05:30.140> like<00:05:30.320> cake<00:05:30.590> and

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420 
coffee and things like that you know I

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.390 
coffee and things like that you know I
actually<00:05:32.720> like<00:05:33.440> to<00:05:33.470> let<00:05:33.800> them<00:05:33.890> know<00:05:34.040> I<00:05:34.070> think

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
actually like to let them know I think

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.770 
actually like to let them know I think
it's<00:05:34.520> a<00:05:34.610> healthy<00:05:34.850> thing<00:05:35.620> when<00:05:36.620> they<00:05:36.770> worry<00:05:37.780> if

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
it's a healthy thing when they worry if

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.290 
it's a healthy thing when they worry if
they're<00:05:39.140> not<00:05:39.290> worried<00:05:40.570> it<00:05:41.570> makes<00:05:41.930> me<00:05:42.200> worry

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
they're not worried it makes me worry

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.960 
they're not worried it makes me worry
because<00:05:44.710> I<00:05:45.710> think<00:05:45.770> they<00:05:46.190> are<00:05:46.340> doing<00:05:46.550> something

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
because I think they are doing something

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.110 
because I think they are doing something
that<00:05:47.390> hardly<00:05:48.320> anyone<00:05:48.680> else<00:05:49.070> in<00:05:49.430> this<00:05:49.850> country

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
that hardly anyone else in this country

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.330 
that hardly anyone else in this country
and<00:05:50.600> the<00:05:50.900> world<00:05:51.080> chooses<00:05:51.860> to<00:05:52.100> do<00:05:52.280> and<00:05:53.650> and<00:05:54.650> at

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
and the world chooses to do and and at

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.160 
and the world chooses to do and and at
the<00:05:55.520> same<00:05:55.730> time<00:05:56.000> and<00:05:56.510> I<00:05:56.660> think<00:05:56.690> they<00:05:56.960> need<00:05:57.140> a

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
the same time and I think they need a

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.040 
the same time and I think they need a
huge<00:05:57.470> amount<00:05:57.560> of<00:05:57.860> support<00:05:58.190> to<00:05:58.400> do<00:05:58.580> that<00:05:58.820> and<00:05:59.270> I

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
huge amount of support to do that and I

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.350 
huge amount of support to do that and I
think<00:06:00.410> one<00:06:00.620> of<00:06:00.650> the<00:06:00.920> best<00:06:01.250> lessons<00:06:01.520> that<00:06:02.030> they

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
think one of the best lessons that they

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.690 
think one of the best lessons that they
can<00:06:02.570> be<00:06:02.750> helping<00:06:03.590> their<00:06:03.740> children<00:06:03.950> through<00:06:04.340> is

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
can be helping their children through is

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.000 
can be helping their children through is
just<00:06:05.000> taking<00:06:05.360> taking<00:06:05.980> responsibility<00:06:06.980> for

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
just taking taking responsibility for

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.480 
just taking taking responsibility for
that<00:06:08.110> that<00:06:09.110> whole<00:06:09.440> process<00:06:09.920> of<00:06:10.340> their

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
that that whole process of their

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.090 
that that whole process of their
education
