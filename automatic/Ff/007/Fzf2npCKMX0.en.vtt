00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.680
 good guys and girls you know that 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.839
 comparatives are the order of the day and 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.430
 this time we face two big 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.440
 sagas in terms of technical quality 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.339
 above all but more expensive quality 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.590
 techniques and if I do not mean the design of 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.720
 the faces that will appear in each one 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.810
 of the players of these titles that 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.510
 we are watching pro evolution soccer ' 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.060
 2016 and fifa 16 what we see is a 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.860
 comparative of the faces you already know that 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.050
 soccer video games are going 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.520
 striving more and more during the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.530
 last years in getting the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.450
 players look as similar as possible 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.460
 to reality this time they have 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.010
 compiled the faces of the footballers 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.160
 Real Madrid that appear in fifa 16 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.920
 and pro evolution soccer '16 an amateur 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.360
 has been commissioned to collect and compare 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.210
 each of the faces of the players 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.370
 Real Madrid of video games that 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.340
 I just told you about these two great 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.590
 football sagas and the intention of 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.660
 the designers is to copy exactly 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.670
 the expressions and factions of the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.680
 footballers in some cases have 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.730
 achieved but it is true that in others 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.530
 no and in fact 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.440
 and I personally there are some 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.490
 players that I see very weird 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.770
 depending on what game it is not 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.230
 I would know if I prefer the designs 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.230
 fifa 16 on the faces or the pro 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.710
 evolution soccer '16 because I'm telling you 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.630
 that seem to me or in some cases I 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.960
 they like more and others 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.350
 in fact those of pro evolution soccer 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.340
 they seem to me sometimes as if they were 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.350
 play dough I do not know a thing a little 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.980
 strange I do not know what you think 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.050
 boys and girls, you have a verdict 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.540
 generalized you prefer those of fifa 16 or 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.550
 the faces of pro evolution software 2016 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.500
 you will say I already tell you 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.540
 depending on which player it is about 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.420
 in which case it is treated because it seems to me 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.940
 more to the player in real life in a 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.670
 game or another but well there is my 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.300
 opinion and what I would like to know is 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.300
 Yours
