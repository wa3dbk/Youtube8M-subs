00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
check out all the stuff that I was

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.380 
check out all the stuff that I was
talking<00:04:33.980> about<00:04:34.250> because<00:04:34.760> this<00:04:34.880> is<00:04:35.060> a<00:04:35.090> big

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390

think there's much of a Minecraft

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.270 
think there's much of a Minecraft
history<00:04:41.060> but<00:04:41.210> anyway<00:04:41.480> um<00:04:41.800> that<00:04:42.800> is<00:04:42.950> the<00:04:43.100> moon

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
history but anyway um that is the moon

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.750 
history but anyway um that is the moon

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
as you can see it's kind of it's kind of

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.260 
as you can see it's kind of it's kind of
like<00:04:47.170> like<00:04:48.550> like<00:04:49.550> all<00:04:49.730> the<00:04:49.820> stars<00:04:50.090> are

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
like like like all the stars are

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.890 
like like like all the stars are
shifting<00:04:50.690> that<00:04:51.200> way<00:04:51.580> the<00:04:52.580> Sun<00:04:52.880> is<00:04:53.090> like<00:04:53.300> a<00:04:53.480> bad

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
shifting that way the Sun is like a bad

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.480 
shifting that way the Sun is like a bad
angle<00:04:54.140> right<00:04:54.470> now<00:04:54.530> on<00:04:54.890> the<00:04:54.980> other<00:04:55.010> side<00:04:55.340> of<00:04:55.370> the

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
angle right now on the other side of the

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.420 
angle right now on the other side of the
world<00:04:55.870> this<00:04:56.870> moon<00:04:57.140> is<00:04:57.380> coming<00:04:57.530> up<00:04:57.770> and<00:04:58.220> there's
