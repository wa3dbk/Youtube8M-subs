like $2.99 new Wacom has it for about

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.510 
like $2.99 new Wacom has it for about
249<00:01:04.379> as<00:01:04.530> well<00:01:04.729> but<00:01:06.740> this<00:01:07.740> display<00:01:08.689> is<00:01:10.520> highly

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
249 as well but this display is highly

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.750 
249 as well but this display is highly
comparable<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.390> Samsung<00:01:13.229> model<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.580> has

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
comparable to the Samsung model that has

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.899 
comparable to the Samsung model that has
been<00:01:14.939> selling<00:01:15.270> very<00:01:15.420> well<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:16.790> the<00:01:17.790> only

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
been selling very well and the only

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.340 
been selling very well and the only
difference<00:01:18.090> between<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.689> one<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
difference between this one and the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.190 
difference between this one and the
Samsung<00:01:19.740> model<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.670> hasn't<00:01:22.400> 5a5

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
Samsung model is this hasn't 5a5

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.920 
Samsung model is this hasn't 5a5
millisecond<00:01:25.490> refresh<00:01:26.490> rate<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.420> Samsung

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
millisecond refresh rate and the Samsung

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.080 
millisecond refresh rate and the Samsung
has<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> two<00:01:28.860> millisecond<00:01:29.400> refresh<00:01:29.640> rate<00:01:29.850> so

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
has a two millisecond refresh rate so

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.060 
has a two millisecond refresh rate so
this<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.049> still<00:01:31.229> great<00:01:31.380> for<00:01:31.530> gaming<00:01:31.740> and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
this is still great for gaming and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.960 
this is still great for gaming and
moving<00:01:32.430> using<00:01:33.240> gaming<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:33.960> movies<00:01:34.350> but<00:01:35.009> if

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
moving using gaming and movies but if

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.370 
moving using gaming and movies but if
you're<00:01:36.119> looking<00:01:36.329> for<00:01:36.509> more<00:01:36.689> high<00:01:36.840> performance

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
you're looking for more high performance

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.780 
you're looking for more high performance

when I think this amp some probably the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.499 
when I think this amp some probably the
better<00:01:38.909> way<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.150> go

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
better way to go

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.929 
better way to go
they're<00:01:39.869> both<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.229> same<00:01:40.409> price<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:41.490> styling

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
they're both the same price the styling

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.160 
they're both the same price the styling
on<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.180> one<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.450> much<00:01:42.600> better<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.960> my<00:01:43.020> opinion

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
there we go all right before I take the

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.710 
there we go all right before I take the
monitors<00:03:30.670> out<00:03:30.760> let's<00:03:31.060> go<00:03:31.150> ahead<00:03:31.269> see<00:03:31.480> what<00:03:31.629> we

monitors out let's go ahead see what we
got<00:03:31.900> here<00:03:32.010> on<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.909> bottom<00:03:35.040> or<00:03:36.040> maybe<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.579> top

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
got here on the bottom or maybe the top

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.149 
got here on the bottom or maybe the top
maybe<00:03:36.939> I<00:03:37.060> open<00:03:37.329> it<00:03:37.420> up<00:03:37.510> set<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.810> upside<00:03:38.109> down<00:03:38.290> I

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159 
maybe I open it up set to upside down I

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:41.539 
maybe I open it up set to upside down I
think<00:03:39.549> I<00:03:39.609> did<00:03:39.790> you're<00:03:40.239> gonna<00:03:40.359> have<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.689> stand

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
think I did you're gonna have the stand

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.559 
think I did you're gonna have the stand
into<00:03:42.549> the<00:03:42.700> ultra<00:03:43.000> slim<00:03:43.269> stand<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.700> power

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
into the ultra slim stand and a power

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.710 
into the ultra slim stand and a power
brick<00:03:47.189> the<00:03:48.189> way<00:03:48.340> they<00:03:48.519> slim<00:03:49.090> down<00:03:49.269> on<00:03:49.540> the

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
brick the way they slim down on the

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.869 
brick the way they slim down on the
design<00:03:50.409> is<00:03:50.769> they<00:03:51.010> put<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:51.400> power<00:03:51.579> brick

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
design is they put the power brick

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.839 
design is they put the power brick
outside<00:03:52.439> the<00:03:53.439> power<00:03:53.620> supply<00:03:53.919> outside<00:03:54.459> of<00:03:54.700> the

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
outside the power supply outside of the

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.110 
outside the power supply outside of the
monitor<00:03:55.599> so<00:03:56.349> you<00:03:56.379> have<00:03:56.799> a<00:03:56.970> separate<00:03:57.970> power

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
monitor so you have a separate power

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.500 
monitor so you have a separate power
supply<00:03:59.159> you<00:04:00.159> are<00:04:00.250> also<00:04:00.430> given<00:04:00.879> a<00:04:02.250> VGA<00:04:03.250> cable

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
supply you are also given a VGA cable

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.509 
supply you are also given a VGA cable
this<00:04:04.510> monitor<00:04:04.930> does<00:04:04.989> support<00:04:05.500> VGA<00:04:05.919> DVI<00:04:06.250> and

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
this monitor does support VGA DVI and

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.929 
this monitor does support VGA DVI and
HDMI<00:04:07.470> would<00:04:08.470> have<00:04:08.560> been<00:04:08.650> nice<00:04:08.799> before<00:04:09.220> a<00:04:09.250> HDMI

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:09.939 
HDMI would have been nice before a HDMI

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:13.140 
HDMI would have been nice before a HDMI
cable<00:04:10.329> but<00:04:10.510> I<00:04:11.579> don't<00:04:12.579> think<00:04:12.730> we<00:04:12.819> can<00:04:12.970> really

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
cable but I don't think we can really

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.129 
cable but I don't think we can really
expect<00:04:13.540> anybody<00:04:13.810> to<00:04:14.049> start<00:04:14.379> supplying<00:04:14.620> those

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
looks larger maybe it's the bezel around

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:02.670 
looks larger maybe it's the bezel around
the<00:05:57.419> screen<00:05:59.129> but<00:06:01.139> this<00:06:02.139> does<00:06:02.349> not<00:06:02.379> have<00:06:02.649> the

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
the screen but this does not have the

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.519 
the screen but this does not have the
capacitive<00:06:03.339> touch<00:06:03.520> buttons<00:06:03.550> as<00:06:04.509> the<00:06:05.110> hardware

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:05.529 
capacitive touch buttons as the hardware

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:07.320 
capacitive touch buttons as the hardware
buttons<00:06:05.830> down<00:06:05.979> here<00:06:06.039> so<00:06:06.819> you<00:06:06.849> have<00:06:06.939> your<00:06:07.089> power

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
buttons down here so you have your power

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.269 
buttons down here so you have your power
button<00:06:07.389> and<00:06:07.779> then<00:06:07.930> you<00:06:08.020> have<00:06:08.169> your<00:06:08.439> different

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:09.279 
button and then you have your different

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:10.950 
button and then you have your different
buttons<00:06:09.669> here<00:06:09.819> to<00:06:09.969> bring<00:06:10.149> up<00:06:10.300> the<00:06:10.419> on-screen

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
buttons here to bring up the on-screen

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.889 
buttons here to bring up the on-screen
display<00:06:11.639> this<00:06:12.639> right<00:06:12.879> here<00:06:13.120> does<00:06:13.449> light<00:06:13.719> up

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:13.899 
display this right here does light up

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:16.200 
display this right here does light up
blue<00:06:14.199> it's<00:06:14.800> I<00:06:15.129> think<00:06:15.339> it's<00:06:15.520> like<00:06:15.610> a<00:06:15.639> reflection

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
blue it's I think it's like a reflection

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.170 
blue it's I think it's like a reflection
from<00:06:16.330> the<00:06:16.479> down<00:06:16.659> part<00:06:16.870> from<00:06:17.529> right<00:06:17.710> here<00:06:18.180> but

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
from the down part from right here but

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.339 
from the down part from right here but
this<00:06:19.270> is<00:06:19.449> where<00:06:19.569> you<00:06:19.719> would<00:06:19.870> mount<00:06:20.020> it<00:06:20.199> into

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:20.349 
this is where you would mount it into

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:21.379 
this is where you would mount it into
the<00:06:20.529> stand

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.389 
the stand

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:23.999 
the stand
now<00:06:22.389> if<00:06:22.509> LED<00:06:22.870> monitors<00:06:23.259> not<00:06:23.529> many<00:06:23.740> of<00:06:23.889> them

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:24.009 
now if LED monitors not many of them

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.369 
now if LED monitors not many of them
support<00:06:24.550> base<00:06:24.789> amounts<00:06:25.270> or<00:06:25.449> visa<00:06:25.719> versa<00:06:25.990> or

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:26.379 
support base amounts or visa versa or

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:30.300 
support base amounts or visa versa or
visa<00:06:27.449> so<00:06:28.449> there's<00:06:28.749> no<00:06:28.930> way<00:06:29.110> to<00:06:29.139> mount<00:06:29.349> this<00:06:29.620> so

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
visa so there's no way to mount this so

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.850 
visa so there's no way to mount this so
but<00:06:31.270> let's<00:06:31.990> take<00:06:32.050> a<00:06:32.139> look<00:06:32.259> at<00:06:32.349> the<00:06:32.409> displays<00:06:32.740> on
