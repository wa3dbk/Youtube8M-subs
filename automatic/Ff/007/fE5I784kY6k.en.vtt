millimeter compact cameras of all time
which<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.349> really<00:00:31.590> great<00:00:31.740> because<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.040> really

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
which is really great because I really

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.400 
which is really great because I really
enjoyed<00:00:32.880> 35<00:00:33.300> millimeter<00:00:33.660> compact<00:00:34.050> cameras

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
enjoyed 35 millimeter compact cameras

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.830 
enjoyed 35 millimeter compact cameras
its<00:00:34.559> base<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.489> my<00:00:35.700> favorite<00:00:36.149> style<00:00:36.690> of

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
its base it's my favorite style of

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.650 
its base it's my favorite style of
camera<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.350> use<00:00:37.790> both<00:00:38.790> one<00:00:39.059> I'm<00:00:39.180> just<00:00:39.360> Nikki

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
camera to use both one I'm just Nikki

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.850 
camera to use both one I'm just Nikki
nor<00:00:39.780> Hannah<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.200> when<00:00:40.320> I'm<00:00:40.410> going<00:00:40.649> out<00:00:40.739> and

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
nor Hannah and when I'm going out and

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.979 
nor Hannah and when I'm going out and
shooting<00:00:41.040> something<00:00:41.309> more<00:00:41.550> serious<00:00:41.989> which

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
shooting something more serious which

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.389 
shooting something more serious which
kind<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.500> conflicts<00:00:43.829> with<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.980> lot<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.190> people

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
kind of conflicts with a lot of people

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.160 
kind of conflicts with a lot of people
because<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> compact<00:00:45.090> size<00:00:45.270> doesn't<00:00:45.629> work<00:00:45.899> in

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
because the compact size doesn't work in

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.100 
because the compact size doesn't work in
most<00:00:46.530> situations<00:00:46.820> but<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.390> me<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:48.809> really

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
most situations but to me it's really

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.619 
most situations but to me it's really
the<00:00:49.260> most<00:00:49.590> beneficial<00:00:50.219> for<00:00:50.250> many<00:00:50.520> ways<00:00:50.760> now

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
the most beneficial for many ways now

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.299 
the most beneficial for many ways now
the<00:00:52.079> camera<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.410> wanted<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.680> start<00:00:52.920> off<00:00:53.010> with

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
the camera I wanted to start off with

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.000 
the camera I wanted to start off with
this<00:00:53.399> month<00:00:53.699> with<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.719> olympus<00:00:55.020> 35<00:00:55.469> ec

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.340 
this month with is the olympus 35 ec
this<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> 35<00:00:57.000> millimeter<00:00:57.480> compact<00:00:57.989> zone

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
this is a 35 millimeter compact zone

this is a 35 millimeter compact zone
focused<00:00:58.739> camera<00:00:59.129> now<00:00:59.850> there<00:01:00.000> isn't<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> lot<00:01:00.390> of

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
focused camera now there isn't a lot of

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.000 
focused camera now there isn't a lot of
information<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.170> online<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.680> was<00:01:01.739> made

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
information on this online it was made

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.030 
information on this online it was made
in<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.579> late<00:01:03.090> 60s<00:01:03.600> early<00:01:03.750> 70s<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.589> i'm<00:01:04.769> basing

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
in the late 60s early 70s and i'm basing

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.039 
in the late 60s early 70s and i'm basing
that<00:01:05.129> off<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.339> few<00:01:05.610> things<00:01:05.689> most<00:01:06.689> importantly

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
that off a few things most importantly

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.830 
that off a few things most importantly
the<00:01:07.170> styling<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:08.369> very<00:01:09.150> reminiscent<00:01:09.510> of

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
the styling it's very reminiscent of

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.289 
the styling it's very reminiscent of
that<00:01:09.900> time<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.619> also<00:01:11.010> uses<00:01:11.400> mercury<00:01:11.880> cell

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
that time it also uses mercury cell

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.880 
that time it also uses mercury cell
batteries<00:01:12.720> now<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.409> here<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.590> don't<00:01:13.710> have

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
batteries now in here I don't have

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.740 
batteries now in here I don't have
mercury<00:01:14.250> cell<00:01:14.610> batteries<00:01:14.939> actually<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.330> have

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
mercury cell batteries actually I have

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.160 
mercury cell batteries actually I have
two<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:17.090> two<00:01:18.090> alkaline<00:01:18.509> equivalents<00:01:18.960> which

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
two of two alkaline equivalents which

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.570 
two of two alkaline equivalents which
are<00:01:19.350> actually<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> exact<00:01:20.070> same<00:01:20.250> batteries

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
are actually the exact same batteries

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.820 
are actually the exact same batteries
that<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.729> use<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.210> my<00:01:21.240> little<00:01:22.080> high<00:01:22.170> Matic<00:01:22.470> F<00:01:22.650> as

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
that I use in my little high Matic F as

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.380 
that I use in my little high Matic F as
you<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.100> see<00:01:23.280> right<00:01:23.400> there<00:01:23.460> now<00:01:24.060> they<00:01:24.240> work

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
you can see right there now they work

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.460 
you can see right there now they work
just<00:01:24.420> fine<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:25.650> most<00:01:26.009> cases<00:01:26.360> but<00:01:27.360> because<00:01:28.320> they

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
just fine in most cases but because they

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.440 
just fine in most cases but because they
do<00:01:28.530> have<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.829> tendency<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.369> very<00:01:29.790> exposure

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
do have a tendency to very exposure

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.359 
do have a tendency to very exposure
I<00:01:30.479> typically<00:01:31.200> overexposed<00:01:31.890> by<00:01:32.040> about<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.280> stop

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
I typically overexposed by about a stop

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.890 
I typically overexposed by about a stop
now<00:01:33.060> because<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.659> completely

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
now because this is a completely

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.020 
now because this is a completely
automatic<00:01:34.500> camera<00:01:35.040> there<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.400> only<00:01:35.610> one<00:01:35.850> way

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
automatic camera there is only one way

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.969 
automatic camera there is only one way
to<00:01:36.060> do<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.630> that's<00:01:36.720> by<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:36.990> ISO<00:01:37.500> dial<00:01:37.770> up

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
to do that and that's by the ISO dial up

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:38.569 
to do that and that's by the ISO dial up

it<00:01:39.299> goes<00:01:39.420> from<00:01:39.509> 25<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.990> 800<00:01:40.500> which<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> really

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
it goes from 25 to 800 which is a really

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.550 
it goes from 25 to 800 which is a really
wide<00:01:41.250> range<00:01:41.310> for<00:01:41.820> many<00:01:41.939> cameras<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:43.229> time

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
wide range for many cameras of this time

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.810 
wide range for many cameras of this time
most<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.399> them<00:01:44.549> had<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> range<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.869> 50<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.890> 500<00:01:47.310> or

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
most of them had a range of 50 to 500 or

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.969 
most of them had a range of 50 to 500 or
so<00:01:48.060> somewhere<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.110> there<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.500> few<00:01:49.680> went<00:01:49.890> up

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
so somewhere in there and a few went up

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.039 
so somewhere in there and a few went up
to<00:01:50.070> 800<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:50.579> really<00:01:50.880> not<00:01:51.030> many<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.659> being

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
to 800 but really not many and so being

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.300 
to 800 but really not many and so being
able<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.259> have<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.530> option<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:53.009> here<00:01:53.220> is

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
able to have that option on here is

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.889 
able to have that option on here is
really<00:01:53.340> great<00:01:53.820> because<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.540> does<00:01:54.659> allow<00:01:54.869> for

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
really great because it does allow for

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.800 
really great because it does allow for
some<00:01:55.200> nice<00:01:55.320> low-light<00:01:55.829> photography<00:01:56.600> with<00:01:57.600> its

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
some nice low-light photography with its

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.580 
some nice low-light photography with its
decently<00:01:58.619> fast<00:01:58.799> 2.8<00:01:59.340> lens<00:01:59.570> so<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.899> ISO<00:02:01.469> is

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
decently fast 2.8 lens so the ISO is

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.749 
decently fast 2.8 lens so the ISO is
just<00:02:01.770> set<00:02:01.950> with<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.189> little<00:02:02.399> doll<00:02:02.579> right

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
just set with this little doll right

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.230 
just set with this little doll right
here<00:02:02.909> super<00:02:03.329> easy<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.719> use<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.610> again<00:02:05.610> if<00:02:06.030> I

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
here super easy to use and again if I

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.999 
here super easy to use and again if I
have<00:02:06.390> 100<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.140> say<00:02:07.350> film<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:07.710> there<00:02:07.829> I'll<00:02:07.979> just

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
have 100 a I say film in there I'll just

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.969 
have 100 a I say film in there I'll just
set<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.459> 80

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
set it to 80

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.440 
set it to 80
and<00:02:09.069> that<00:02:09.340> will<00:02:09.459> help<00:02:09.550> me<00:02:09.700> compensate<00:02:10.000> for<00:02:10.330> the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
and that will help me compensate for the

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.089 
and that will help me compensate for the
batteries<00:02:10.840> now<00:02:11.319> the<00:02:11.379> batteries<00:02:11.680> are<00:02:11.800> cheaper

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
batteries now the batteries are cheaper

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.589 
batteries now the batteries are cheaper
and<00:02:12.129> much<00:02:12.310> easier<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.730> find<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.120> mercury<00:02:13.420> cell

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
and much easier to find the mercury cell

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.050 
and much easier to find the mercury cell
your<00:02:13.750> zinc<00:02:13.989> air<00:02:14.140> cell<00:02:14.379> or<00:02:14.530> anything<00:02:14.709> like<00:02:14.920> that

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
your zinc air cell or anything like that

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.059 
your zinc air cell or anything like that
and<00:02:16.420> so<00:02:16.870> that's<00:02:17.049> why<00:02:17.170> I<00:02:17.200> prefer<00:02:17.409> using<00:02:17.799> them

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
and so that's why I prefer using them

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.740 
and so that's why I prefer using them
and<00:02:18.310> I'll<00:02:18.489> take<00:02:18.730> there<00:02:19.360> goes<00:02:19.480> my<00:02:19.599> phone

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
and I'll take there goes my phone

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.449 
and I'll take there goes my phone
getting<00:02:20.049> a<00:02:20.080> text<00:02:20.319> message<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:20.890> so<00:02:21.190> I'll<00:02:21.310> take

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
getting a text message and so I'll take

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.539 
getting a text message and so I'll take
this<00:02:22.260> little<00:02:23.260> variance<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.739> exposure<00:02:24.069> for

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
this little variance and exposure for

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.550 
this little variance and exposure for
the<00:02:24.640> convenience<00:02:25.030> that<00:02:25.299> it<00:02:25.569> uses<00:02:25.930> now<00:02:26.349> this

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
the convenience that it uses now this

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.190 
the convenience that it uses now this
camera<00:02:26.799> is<00:02:27.069> very<00:02:27.099> similar<00:02:27.819> as<00:02:28.090> I<00:02:28.239> said<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.720> be

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
camera is very similar as I said to be

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.960 
camera is very similar as I said to be
an<00:02:29.290> input<00:02:29.470> strip<00:02:29.860> that's<00:02:30.400> for<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.670> number<00:02:30.819> of

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
an input strip that's for a number of

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.670 
an input strip that's for a number of
reasons<00:02:31.090> actually<00:02:31.480> it's<00:02:31.750> zone<00:02:31.959> focus<00:02:32.379> much

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
reasons actually it's zone focus much

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.770 
reasons actually it's zone focus much
like<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:32.980> Olympus<00:02:33.280> trip<00:02:33.549> it's<00:02:34.060> like<00:02:34.690> the

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
like the Olympus trip it's like the

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.250 
like the Olympus trip it's like the
automatic<00:02:35.819> it<00:02:36.819> works<00:02:37.060> out<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.360> light<00:02:37.540> you

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
automatic it works out the light you

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.630 
automatic it works out the light you
just<00:02:38.440> click<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.680> chat<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.280> so<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:39.400> really

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
just click the chat and so I really

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.360 
just click the chat and so I really
don't<00:02:39.730> have<00:02:39.879> to<00:02:40.000> work<00:02:40.180> out<00:02:40.329> anything

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
don't have to work out anything

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.319 
don't have to work out anything
everything's<00:02:42.370> done<00:02:42.549> with<00:02:42.790> just<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.180> one

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
everything's done with just the one

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.180 
everything's done with just the one
shutter<00:02:43.629> button<00:02:43.930> right<00:02:44.079> there

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
shutter button right there

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.009 
shutter button right there
also<00:02:45.670> like<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:45.849> Olympus<00:02:46.239> trip<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.720> loads

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
also like the Olympus trip it loads

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.380 
also like the Olympus trip it loads
backwards<00:02:47.859> and<00:02:48.099> what<00:02:48.640> I<00:02:48.670> mean<00:02:48.849> by<00:02:48.910> that<00:02:49.150> is

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
backwards and what I mean by that is

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.660 
backwards and what I mean by that is
when<00:02:50.019> you<00:02:50.109> open<00:02:50.260> this<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.829> can<00:02:51.250> see<00:02:51.430> that<00:02:51.579> the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
when you open this you can see that the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.520 
when you open this you can see that the
film<00:02:51.910> goes<00:02:52.120> over<00:02:52.450> here<00:02:52.720> on<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.959> right<00:02:53.140> side<00:02:53.410> of

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
film goes over here on the right side of

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.309 
film goes over here on the right side of
the<00:02:53.620> camera<00:02:53.859> when<00:02:54.670> you're<00:02:55.079> right<00:02:56.079> inside<00:02:56.290> of

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
the camera when you're right inside of

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.690 
the camera when you're right inside of
the<00:02:56.410> camera<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:56.829> the<00:02:56.890> leaders<00:02:57.129> pull<00:02:57.370> over<00:02:57.489> to

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
the camera and the leaders pull over to

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.080 
the camera and the leaders pull over to
the<00:02:57.790> left<00:02:58.030> that<00:02:58.780> is<00:02:58.900> then<00:02:59.079> closed<00:02:59.379> now<00:03:00.190> the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
the left that is then closed now the

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.759 
the left that is then closed now the
other<00:03:01.239> thing<00:03:01.450> that's<00:03:01.569> very<00:03:01.690> Olympus<00:03:02.319> trip<00:03:02.560> II

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
other thing that's very Olympus trip II

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.150 
other thing that's very Olympus trip II
is<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.579> the<00:03:04.060> film<00:03:05.049> advance<00:03:05.200> is<00:03:05.709> this<00:03:05.859> little

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
is that the film advance is this little

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.770 
is that the film advance is this little
knob<00:03:06.370> I<00:03:06.760> actually<00:03:07.030> don't<00:03:07.209> like<00:03:07.329> this<00:03:07.540> knob

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
knob I actually don't like this knob

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.170 
knob I actually don't like this knob
very<00:03:08.019> much<00:03:08.170> because<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:09.400> have<00:03:09.579> to<00:03:09.700> do<00:03:09.819> it<00:03:09.940> four

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
very much because you have to do it four

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.940 
very much because you have to do it four
or<00:03:10.209> five<00:03:10.329> times<00:03:10.750> in<00:03:11.109> order<00:03:11.349> to<00:03:11.530> advance<00:03:11.680> the

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
or five times in order to advance the

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.190 
or five times in order to advance the
next<00:03:12.069> frames<00:03:12.430> really<00:03:13.209> not<00:03:13.359> good<00:03:13.599> for<00:03:13.630> doing

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
next frames really not good for doing

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.140 
next frames really not good for doing
anything<00:03:14.739> fast<00:03:15.099> where<00:03:15.400> you<00:03:15.489> need<00:03:15.639> to<00:03:15.760> take<00:03:15.910> a

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
anything fast where you need to take a

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.830 
anything fast where you need to take a
bunch<00:03:16.419> of<00:03:16.510> shots<00:03:16.780> now<00:03:18.209> obviously<00:03:19.209> most<00:03:19.569> people

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
bunch of shots now obviously most people

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.240 
bunch of shots now obviously most people
won't<00:03:19.930> be<00:03:20.079> using<00:03:20.260> a<00:03:20.440> camera<00:03:20.709> like<00:03:20.859> this<00:03:20.919> for

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
won't be using a camera like this for

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.650 
won't be using a camera like this for
sports<00:03:21.519> photography<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:22.209> I<00:03:22.239> don't<00:03:22.359> see<00:03:22.540> why

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
sports photography and I don't see why

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.120 
sports photography and I don't see why
you<00:03:22.720> would<00:03:23.019> it's<00:03:23.200> really<00:03:23.500> not<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.799> greatest

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
you would it's really not the greatest

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.789 
you would it's really not the greatest
but<00:03:24.609> even<00:03:24.880> so<00:03:25.060> I<00:03:25.269> mean<00:03:25.480> this<00:03:25.959> is<00:03:26.109> the<00:03:26.260> fastest

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
but even so I mean this is the fastest

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.650 
but even so I mean this is the fastest
way<00:03:26.950> I<00:03:26.980> can<00:03:27.220> line<00:03:27.639> the<00:03:27.760> film<00:03:27.970> is<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.299> just<00:03:28.480> kind

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
way I can line the film is to just kind

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.030 
way I can line the film is to just kind
of<00:03:28.750> slide<00:03:29.169> by<00:03:29.319> hanging<00:03:29.530> across<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:29.859> back<00:03:30.010> of

of slide by hanging across the back of

of slide by hanging across the back of
the<00:03:30.160> camera<00:03:30.519> but<00:03:30.910> then<00:03:31.060> who<00:03:31.239> knows<00:03:31.419> what<00:03:31.480> I'm

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
the camera but then who knows what I'm

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.610 
the camera but then who knows what I'm
pointing<00:03:31.930> it<00:03:32.260> out

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
pointing it out

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.530 
pointing it out
now<00:03:32.889> like<00:03:33.160> I<00:03:33.250> said<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.579> lens<00:03:33.819> is<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.209> as<00:03:34.480> a

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
now like I said the lens is a as a

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.479 
now like I said the lens is a as a
seeker<00:03:34.959> lens<00:03:35.169> usually<00:03:35.859> on<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.040> Olympus<00:03:36.340> own

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
seeker lens usually on the Olympus own

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.039 
seeker lens usually on the Olympus own
one<00:03:36.730> one<00:03:37.120> of<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.269> best<00:03:37.419> cameras<00:03:37.690> in<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.870> world

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
one one of the best cameras in the world

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.949 
one one of the best cameras in the world
and<00:03:38.260> it's<00:03:38.500> a<00:03:38.590> 42<00:03:38.889> millimeter<00:03:39.370> 2.8<00:03:39.849> one<00:03:40.030> which

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
and it's a 42 millimeter 2.8 one which

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:41.789 
and it's a 42 millimeter 2.8 one which
is<00:03:41.079> really<00:03:41.319> nice

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
is really nice

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.949 
is really nice
very<00:03:42.340> sharp<00:03:42.579> very<00:03:42.790> contrasting<00:03:43.269> and<00:03:43.569> it<00:03:43.660> uses

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
very sharp very contrasting and it uses

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.589 
very sharp very contrasting and it uses
own<00:03:44.169> focus<00:03:44.650> which<00:03:45.519> is<00:03:45.700> pretty<00:03:46.060> great<00:03:46.269> because

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
own focus which is pretty great because

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.390 
own focus which is pretty great because
the<00:03:47.019> way<00:03:47.230> that<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.739> works<00:03:47.919> is<00:03:48.069> that<00:03:48.190> there<00:03:48.340> are

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
the way that it works is that there are

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.879 
the way that it works is that there are
five<00:03:48.579> settings<00:03:49.030> on<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.239> camera<00:03:49.389> or<00:03:50.290> on<00:03:50.769> the

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
five settings on the camera or on the

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.770 
five settings on the camera or on the
lens<00:03:51.040> I<00:03:51.160> should<00:03:51.340> say<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:51.819> so<00:03:52.359> you<00:03:52.450> get<00:03:52.510> three

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
lens I should say and so you get three

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.509 
lens I should say and so you get three
feet<00:03:52.959> you<00:03:53.470> get<00:03:53.620> something<00:03:54.099> that's<00:03:54.160> in<00:03:54.430> between

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
feet you get something that's in between

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.580 
feet you get something that's in between
three<00:03:54.910> and<00:03:54.940> four<00:03:55.180> feet<00:03:55.419> and<00:03:55.660> then<00:03:56.200> four<00:03:56.470> and

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
three and four feet and then four and

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.860 
three and four feet and then four and
five<00:03:56.739> seven<00:03:57.340> and<00:03:57.400> ten<00:03:57.549> and<00:03:57.730> infinity<00:03:58.299> now

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
five seven and ten and infinity now

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.629 
five seven and ten and infinity now
those<00:03:59.109> are<00:03:59.230> all<00:03:59.379> represented<00:04:00.099> pretty<00:04:00.400> well

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
those are all represented pretty well

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:01.830 
those are all represented pretty well
when<00:04:00.819> you<00:04:00.910> look<00:04:01.060> through<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.299> viewfinder<00:04:01.510> you

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
when you look through the viewfinder you

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.030 
when you look through the viewfinder you
have<00:04:01.930> four<00:04:02.200> different<00:04:02.319> distance<00:04:02.859> scale

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
have four different distance scale

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.369 
have four different distance scale
markings<00:04:03.519> on<00:04:03.639> there<00:04:03.819> one<00:04:04.209> as<00:04:04.329> a<00:04:04.359> face<00:04:04.660> and<00:04:04.959> then

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
markings on there one as a face and then

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.490 
markings on there one as a face and then
you<00:04:05.500> move<00:04:05.680> to<00:04:06.150> two<00:04:07.150> people<00:04:07.510> and<00:04:07.690> then<00:04:07.959> a<00:04:07.989> group

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
you move to two people and then a group

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.800 
you move to two people and then a group
of<00:04:08.620> people<00:04:08.889> and<00:04:09.040> then<00:04:09.129> mountains<00:04:09.639> at<00:04:10.000> infinity

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
of people and then mountains at infinity

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.110 
of people and then mountains at infinity
and<00:04:11.169> those<00:04:11.949> show<00:04:12.190> up<00:04:12.220> pretty<00:04:12.489> well<00:04:12.579> as<00:04:12.879> bright

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
and those show up pretty well as bright

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.400 
and those show up pretty well as bright
lines<00:04:13.329> which<00:04:13.569> also<00:04:13.750> have<00:04:13.930> parallax

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
lines which also have parallax

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.319 
lines which also have parallax
correcting<00:04:14.799> marks<00:04:15.099> on<00:04:15.280> them<00:04:15.459> and<00:04:15.669> you<00:04:15.970> can<00:04:16.120> see

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
correcting marks on them and you can see

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.330 
correcting marks on them and you can see
those<00:04:16.479> right<00:04:16.570> there<00:04:17.019> which<00:04:17.859> really<00:04:18.010> makes<00:04:18.250> it

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
those right there which really makes it

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.909 
those right there which really makes it
pretty<00:04:18.700> easy<00:04:18.969> to<00:04:19.120> use<00:04:19.450> and<00:04:19.719> really<00:04:19.750> quick<00:04:20.409> to<00:04:20.680> I

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
pretty easy to use and really quick to I

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:21.259 
pretty easy to use and really quick to I
mean

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
mean

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.300 
mean
long<00:04:21.449> as<00:04:21.599> you<00:04:21.720> know<00:04:21.900> what<00:04:22.620> those<00:04:22.800> different

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
long as you know what those different

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.159 
long as you know what those different
cliques<00:04:23.580> mean<00:04:23.819> for<00:04:24.389> instance<00:04:24.660> you<00:04:24.750> can<00:04:24.840> set<00:04:25.080> it

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
cliques mean for instance you can set it

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.540 
cliques mean for instance you can set it
to<00:04:25.199> infinity<00:04:25.680> every<00:04:25.889> time<00:04:26.099> and<00:04:26.340> if<00:04:26.400> you're

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
to infinity every time and if you're

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.490 
to infinity every time and if you're
going<00:04:26.759> to<00:04:26.819> be<00:04:26.940> shooting<00:04:27.180> from<00:04:27.419> about<00:04:27.720> seven<00:04:28.440> to

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
going to be shooting from about seven to

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.779 
going to be shooting from about seven to
ten<00:04:28.530> feet<00:04:28.830> away<00:04:28.919> you<00:04:29.039> know<00:04:29.340> that<00:04:29.550> every<00:04:29.759> time

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
ten feet away you know that every time

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.850 
ten feet away you know that every time
you<00:04:30.030> just<00:04:30.150> have<00:04:30.300> to<00:04:30.389> go<00:04:30.509> one<00:04:30.690> click<00:04:30.930> over<00:04:31.199> or<00:04:31.680> if

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
you just have to go one click over or if

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.200 
you just have to go one click over or if
you<00:04:31.949> can<00:04:32.069> remember<00:04:32.310> what<00:04:32.610> they're<00:04:32.759> set<00:04:33.060> at

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
you can remember what they're set at

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.850 
you can remember what they're set at
then<00:04:33.629> it's<00:04:33.780> really<00:04:33.960> not<00:04:34.169> a<00:04:34.229> big<00:04:34.409> deal<00:04:34.470> and<00:04:34.800> you

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
then it's really not a big deal and you

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.290 
then it's really not a big deal and you
can<00:04:35.009> actually<00:04:35.280> focus<00:04:35.460> it's<00:04:35.759> faster<00:04:36.180> than

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
can actually focus it's faster than

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.779 
can actually focus it's faster than
making<00:04:36.629> auto<00:04:36.870> focus<00:04:37.259> cameras<00:04:37.710> just<00:04:38.159> hold<00:04:38.699> it

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
making auto focus cameras just hold it

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.189 
making auto focus cameras just hold it

complaints<00:04:45.389> with<00:04:45.479> this<00:04:45.599> camera<00:04:45.870> and<00:04:46.139> that<00:04:46.409> is

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
complaints with this camera and that is

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.020 
complaints with this camera and that is
the<00:04:47.190> shutter<00:04:47.490> feels<00:04:48.060> really<00:04:48.500> it's<00:04:49.500> not<00:04:50.490> spongy

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
the shutter feels really it's not spongy

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.860 
the shutter feels really it's not spongy
but<00:04:52.069> interesting<00:04:53.069> it<00:04:53.310> has<00:04:53.460> a<00:04:53.610> hard<00:04:53.970> firm<00:04:54.300> push

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
but interesting it has a hard firm push

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.980 
but interesting it has a hard firm push
when<00:04:55.169> you<00:04:55.289> push<00:04:55.530> down<00:04:55.800> on<00:04:55.830> really<00:04:56.340> springy

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
when you push down on really springy

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.149 
when you push down on really springy
which<00:04:57.990> is<00:04:58.169> nice<00:04:58.349> it<00:04:58.560> I<00:04:58.680> do<00:04:58.740> like<00:04:59.009> some

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
which is nice it I do like some

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.189 
which is nice it I do like some
resistance<00:04:59.610> and<00:04:59.789> my<00:04:59.880> shutter<00:05:00.150> buttons<00:05:00.479> but

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
resistance and my shutter buttons but

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.760 
resistance and my shutter buttons but
when<00:05:01.380> you<00:05:01.500> push<00:05:01.800> it<00:05:01.830> back<00:05:02.069> up<00:05:02.449> it<00:05:03.650> pushes<00:05:04.650> your

when you push it back up it pushes your
finger<00:05:05.099> back<00:05:05.220> up<00:05:05.460> it<00:05:05.580> doesn't<00:05:05.940> gently<00:05:06.690> go<00:05:06.840> it's

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
finger back up it doesn't gently go it's

finger back up it doesn't gently go it's
a<00:05:07.169> long<00:05:07.409> travel<00:05:07.800> and<00:05:08.159> then<00:05:08.280> it<00:05:08.400> jumps<00:05:08.880> back<00:05:09.060> up

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
put that on silent no no and so I mean

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.439 
put that on silent no no and so I mean
you<00:05:19.080> can<00:05:19.229> hear<00:05:19.440> it<00:05:19.500> here<00:05:19.969> it's<00:05:20.969> also<00:05:21.120> not<00:05:21.270> very

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
you can hear it here it's also not very

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.209 
you can hear it here it's also not very
quiet<00:05:21.870> which<00:05:22.440> is<00:05:22.560> too<00:05:22.650> bad<00:05:22.770> because<00:05:22.979> the

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:23.219 
quiet which is too bad because the

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:25.490 
quiet which is too bad because the
shutter<00:05:23.520> on<00:05:23.849> this<00:05:24.240> camera<00:05:24.599> is<00:05:24.750> absolutely

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
shutter on this camera is absolutely

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.360 
shutter on this camera is absolutely
silent<00:05:26.659> now<00:05:27.659> it's<00:05:28.259> really<00:05:28.560> nice<00:05:28.800> and<00:05:29.069> it<00:05:29.219> does

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
silent now it's really nice and it does

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.089 
silent now it's really nice and it does
use<00:05:29.550> one<00:05:29.729> of<00:05:29.759> those<00:05:29.909> interesting<00:05:31.099> hybrid

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
use one of those interesting hybrid

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.149 
use one of those interesting hybrid
shutter<00:05:32.940> and<00:05:33.210> aperture<00:05:33.599> mechanisms<00:05:34.500> which<00:05:35.009> is

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 
shutter and aperture mechanisms which is

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:37.189 
shutter and aperture mechanisms which is
to<00:05:35.310> say<00:05:35.460> that<00:05:35.789> the<00:05:36.270> shutter<00:05:36.599> rather<00:05:36.960> than

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 
to say that the shutter rather than

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:39.110 
to say that the shutter rather than
having<00:05:37.500> an<00:05:37.710> aperture<00:05:38.279> in<00:05:38.520> front<00:05:38.819> of<00:05:38.880> it<00:05:38.969> in<00:05:39.060> the

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
having an aperture in front of it in the

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.450 
having an aperture in front of it in the
shutter<00:05:39.419> adjust<00:05:40.080> the<00:05:40.169> shutter<00:05:40.349> speed<00:05:40.590> it<00:05:41.219> goes

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
shutter adjust the shutter speed it goes

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.070 
shutter adjust the shutter speed it goes
both<00:05:41.639> at<00:05:41.819> one<00:05:41.969> time<00:05:42.180> so<00:05:42.449> it<00:05:42.509> opens<00:05:42.930> to<00:05:43.050> a

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
both at one time so it opens to a

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.510 
both at one time so it opens to a
certain<00:05:43.380> amount<00:05:43.560> for<00:05:43.770> a<00:05:43.860> certain<00:05:44.159> length<00:05:44.310> and

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
certain amount for a certain length and

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.950 
certain amount for a certain length and
that's<00:05:44.819> it<00:05:45.060> that's<00:05:45.240> your<00:05:45.419> shutter<00:05:45.630> and<00:05:45.810> your

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
that's it that's your shutter and your

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.019 
that's it that's your shutter and your
aperture<00:05:46.169> all<00:05:46.440> in<00:05:46.590> one<00:05:46.889> the<00:05:47.250> camera<00:05:47.490> also<00:05:47.699> does

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:48.029 
aperture all in one the camera also does

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:49.399 
aperture all in one the camera also does
have<00:05:48.060> a<00:05:48.210> lock<00:05:48.389> feature<00:05:48.630> so<00:05:48.930> that<00:05:49.080> when<00:05:49.259> you've

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
cameras out there which probably doesn't
