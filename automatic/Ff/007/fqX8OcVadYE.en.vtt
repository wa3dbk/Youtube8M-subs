00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.560
 dear painters missionaries guatemala 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.660
 Maldives 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:22.320
 here are some collage elements 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:24.949
 for the dvd on this disc there is 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.359
 a lot of using technology with media 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.500
 crossover on top of each other 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.869
 among themselves 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.239
 let yourself be inspired 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.410
 different techniques on their way 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.410
 to the mission possible 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.140
 because many people are afraid of drawing 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.030
 I would like to have a little bit now 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:54.719
 show how to overcome this fear 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:57.539
 I can do that with ink 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.059
 three types of bag that 's this 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.440
 ecology has liquid handle and that 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.629
 I'm a bit here for a while 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.129
 a bit in there and then 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.659
 I then dilute that different 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.390
 So I always show a bit of sepia 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.200
 color comes in here 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.030
 Here comes a bit more pure 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.030
 or is already in there water and here too 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:25.530
 then followed the dilution so that 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.680
 have three tables and a bag 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.150
 which is a bit thinner 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.159
 typical that is a bit darker 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.729
 and a bag that is almost cure you 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.220
 can stretch a bit as 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.900
 template for this drawing the same 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.210
 I'll think big 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.890
 Sketchbook from the USA by the red 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.060
 bulls painted on it of course, too 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.360
 you can see it here too 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.860
 I would like to red bull in big 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.439
 really big with these three tables 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.000
 paint and the special thing is that one with 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.070
 light and bright ink 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.170
 it will start disappearing later 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.880
 almost when you get to the next unclear 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.500
 Add to that, if I can do it a bit 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.030
 Expire there because one wants to 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.229
 bit basic with 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.459
 it will be a bit warmer 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.160
 normally I would now in these 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.470
 beautiful work are working but 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.910
 The motive is great and I have something 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:23.489
 other than that brush is also available 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:31.380
 im tall and with that we are going to do that now 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:32.910
 you bring a nice cousin brush and 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.160
 this is not really cool 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.800
 canvas that is really hard that 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.530
 great thing about this is 100% FSC wood 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.670
 means really sustainable and that 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.070
 just good quality 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.260
 That's why I'm promoting this company wildly 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.300
 everything directly because they are for the 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.360
 to use the environment in this sense 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.350
 thank you very much thank you vinci for this 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.560
 wonderful brush and now it comes to me 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:02.930
 The brush here in the bright 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.930
 liquid and start once in a while 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.140
 a nice start to start with 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.739
 the many are 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.709
 that means that afterwards they hung 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.940
 disappear on darker lines 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.940
 become the dominant ones 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:38.200
 the color sepia is doing this 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:44.739
 is also a need you can see clearly 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:47.879
 trees is the ketscher reforestation 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.879
 extremely effective 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.360
 everything where we can not leave us 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.020
 help first where no light comes out 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.960
 Let's have a little bit of peace 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.640
 Insert clegg you do not need fear 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.920
 have to do anything wrong 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.500
 because exactly these helmlingen allow 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.290
 to clear everything away for now 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.890
 the dark lines after the wise 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.890
 the direction 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.840
 and now we go the next 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.840
 critical 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.960
 The trees behind let her hold back 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.170
 you in the background 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.000
 the trees in front de you can now 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.570
 These should be darker in the 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.570
 foreground 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.050
 you notice the dark lines pull the 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.250
 look at the viewer more 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.920
 Contrasts will be as always forward 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.170
 bring contrasts fear many 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.270
 front means in this case the 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.650
 dark surfaces attract wear in view 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.460
 can and now I do one more 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.460
 fourth place 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.890
 that's the last very dark one 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.270
 phase 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.960
 Here the real ones keep coming down 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.690
 to wear 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.650
 you set the same way much more relaxed 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.030
 you already have a lighter one 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.610
 the basis has an orientation 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.930
 give 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.930
 nice that the brush with structure 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.080
 Attention camera a bit annoying 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:49.460
 We think we have to go a bit more 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:51.530
 in the back so so you can a newspaper 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.930
 make and develop it completely relaxed 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.280
 No worries just start and then 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.080
 to become darker 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.520
 then you have to be more concrete but 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.320
 by having the lighter newspaper 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.240
 you can do it yourself 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.710
 has a much better orientation 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.050
 basis on which you are very sure 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:08.050
 can move the recipe for good times
