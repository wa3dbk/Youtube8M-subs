00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.440 
the xbox 720 now I have no problem with
that<00:01:54.979> that's<00:01:55.189> a<00:01:55.369> really<00:01:55.609> cool<00:01:55.819> sounding<00:01:56.239> name

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
that that's a really cool sounding name

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.019 
that that's a really cool sounding name
I<00:01:56.689> think<00:01:57.139> it's<00:01:57.289> definitely<00:01:58.039> best<00:01:58.669> to<00:01:58.819> stick

00:01:59.019 --> 00:01:59.029 
I think it's definitely best to stick

00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:00.969 
I think it's definitely best to stick
with<00:01:59.209> numbers<00:01:59.389> as<00:01:59.869> they<00:02:00.109> did<00:02:00.289> with<00:02:00.409> the<00:02:00.529> xbox

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
with numbers as they did with the xbox

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.389 
with numbers as they did with the xbox
360<00:02:02.649> anything<00:02:03.649> else<00:02:03.799> I<00:02:03.979> don't<00:02:04.159> think<00:02:04.309> would

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
360 anything else I don't think would

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.669 
360 anything else I don't think would
really<00:02:04.459> work<00:02:04.849> to<00:02:05.059> be<00:02:05.179> honest<00:02:05.539> and<00:02:05.779> if<00:02:06.559> you

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
really work to be honest and if you

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.380 
really work to be honest and if you
think<00:02:06.709> about<00:02:07.099> it<00:02:07.309> I<00:02:07.579> actually<00:02:07.849> think<00:02:08.149> this

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
think about it I actually think this

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.199 
think about it I actually think this
would<00:02:08.720> work<00:02:08.929> as<00:02:09.170> a<00:02:09.229> console<00:02:10.069> name<00:02:10.310> but<00:02:10.880> yet<00:02:11.090> it

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
would work as a console name but yet it

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.210 
would work as a console name but yet it
might<00:02:11.360> not<00:02:11.629> make

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
might not make

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.870 
might not make
as<00:02:12.580> to<00:02:13.360> you<00:02:13.930> know<00:02:13.960> gaming<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.680> such<00:02:14.890> but<00:02:15.760> if

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
as to you know gaming and such but if

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.060 
as to you know gaming and such but if
they<00:02:16.000> actually<00:02:16.150> named<00:02:16.660> whatever<00:02:17.380> services

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
they actually named whatever services

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.120 
they actually named whatever services
this<00:02:18.580> is<00:02:18.730> called<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.120> ex<00:02:19.360> TV<00:02:19.960> that's<00:02:20.680> going<00:02:20.920> on

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
the Xbox 461 I think that would be an

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.180 
the Xbox 461 I think that would be an
excellent<00:02:24.850> short<00:02:25.780> title<00:02:26.260> for<00:02:27.160> a

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
excellent short title for a

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.240 
excellent short title for a
next-generation<00:02:27.760> Xbox<00:02:28.270> console<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.830> xt
