description now let's talk about the age
52<00:00:51.210> cqb<00:00:51.930> what<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.290> would<00:00:52.440> call<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.920> carbine<00:00:53.760> and

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
52 cqb what you would call a carbine and

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.880 
52 cqb what you would call a carbine and
the<00:00:54.360> best<00:00:54.540> feature<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:55.110> carbine<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.800> it

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the best feature of a carbine is that it

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.560 
the best feature of a carbine is that it
is<00:00:56.010> actually<00:00:56.220> universal<00:00:57.180> for<00:00:57.360> all<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
is actually universal for all the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.810 
is actually universal for all the
classes<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.230> battlefield<00:00:58.650> 4<00:00:58.710> does<00:00:59.610> it<00:00:59.730> matter

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
classes in battlefield 4 does it matter

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.030 
classes in battlefield 4 does it matter
if<00:00:59.940> you're<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.150> medic<00:01:00.510> or<00:01:00.629> recon<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.530> can<00:01:01.769> still

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
if you're a medic or recon you can still

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.969 
if you're a medic or recon you can still
use<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.820> carbines<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.870> being<00:01:04.559> one<00:01:04.800> of<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
use the carbines so being one of the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.890 
use the carbines so being one of the
carbines<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:06.060> had<00:01:06.180> some<00:01:06.390> pretty<00:01:06.570> stiff

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
carbines it had some pretty stiff

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.810 
carbines it had some pretty stiff
competition<00:01:07.140> between<00:01:07.770> them<00:01:08.160> guns<00:01:08.460> like<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
competition between them guns like the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.390 
competition between them guns like the
ak-12<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.720> acw-r<00:01:10.470> are<00:01:10.800> really<00:01:11.190> good

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
ak-12 and the acw-r are really good

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.190 
ak-12 and the acw-r are really good
weapons<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.060> people<00:01:12.330> tend<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.690> use<00:01:12.960> those

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
weapons and people tend to use those

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.190 
weapons and people tend to use those
because<00:01:13.619> they<00:01:13.830> are<00:01:13.979> very<00:01:14.369> easy<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.820> unlock<00:01:15.200> so

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
because they are very easy to unlock so

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.020 
because they are very easy to unlock so
it's<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.440> age<00:01:16.500> 52<00:01:16.950> cqb<00:01:17.460> but<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.789> takes<00:01:17.940> a

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
it's the age 52 cqb but it takes a

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.460 
it's the age 52 cqb but it takes a
little<00:01:18.149> bit<00:01:18.300> longer<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.869> play<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
little bit longer to play with the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.200 
little bit longer to play with the
carbon<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.009> actually<00:01:20.250> unlock<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.759> weapon

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
carbon so actually unlock this weapon

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.029 
carbon so actually unlock this weapon
why<00:01:21.600> do<00:01:21.660> actually<00:01:22.080> review<00:01:22.440> this<00:01:22.560> weapon<00:01:22.890> then

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
why do actually review this weapon then

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:24.680 
why do actually review this weapon then
while<00:01:23.430> was<00:01:23.670> actually<00:01:24.000> convinced<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
while was actually convinced that the

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.620 
while was actually convinced that the
ak-12<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.470> ACW<00:01:25.800> are<00:01:26.250> worth<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.759> best<00:01:27.060> carbines

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
ak-12 in ACW are worth the best carbines

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.139 
ak-12 in ACW are worth the best carbines
in<00:01:27.899> the<00:01:27.990> carbine<00:01:28.410> class<00:01:28.800> until<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.820> came<00:01:29.880> across

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
in the carbine class until I came across

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.600 
in the carbine class until I came across
this<00:01:30.360> weapon<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.259> especially<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.310> stats

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
this weapon and especially the stats

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.279 
this weapon and especially the stats
were<00:01:32.820> actually<00:01:33.240> kind<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.509> interesting<00:01:33.690> to<00:01:34.140> me

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
were actually kind of interesting to me

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:36.529 
were actually kind of interesting to me
and<00:01:34.920> here<00:01:35.070> they<00:01:35.190> are<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.940> gun<00:01:36.090> has<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> maximum

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
and here they are the gun has a maximum

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.749 
and here they are the gun has a maximum
damage<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:37.080> 34<00:01:37.619> up<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.860> around<00:01:38.100> eight<00:01:38.340> meters

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
damage of 34 up to around eight meters

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.330 
damage of 34 up to around eight meters
and<00:01:38.940> drops<00:01:39.149> off<00:01:39.330> to<00:01:39.509> 20<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.050> around<00:01:40.259> 50<00:01:40.740> which

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
and drops off to 20 and around 50 which

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.669 
and drops off to 20 and around 50 which
is<00:01:41.550> actually<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:42.000> really<00:01:42.450> high<00:01:42.869> damage<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.590> is

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
is actually a really high damage it is

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:45.800 
is actually a really high damage it is
the<00:01:43.830> highest<00:01:44.009> damaging<00:01:44.789> carbine<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.660> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
the highest damaging carbine in the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.749 
the highest damaging carbine in the
class<00:01:46.020> which<00:01:46.709> is<00:01:46.860> mostly<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.310> reason<00:01:47.610> why<00:01:47.729> I

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
class which is mostly the reason why I

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.730 
class which is mostly the reason why I
actually<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.810> punch<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.500> fire

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
actually like it that punch the fire

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.620 
actually like it that punch the fire
rate<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.009> 650<00:01:50.700> rounds<00:01:50.880> per<00:01:51.179> minute<00:01:51.330> which

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
rate is 650 rounds per minute which

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.480 
rate is 650 rounds per minute which
isn't<00:01:52.050> that<00:01:52.200> high<00:01:52.440> if<00:01:52.709> you're<00:01:52.979> compared<00:01:53.310> to

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
isn't that high if you're compared to

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.120 
isn't that high if you're compared to
the<00:01:53.640> other<00:01:53.789> carbines<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:55.050> the<00:01:55.289> damage<00:01:55.770> model

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
the other carbines but the damage model

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.040 
the other carbines but the damage model
definitely<00:01:56.849> makes<00:01:57.090> up<00:01:57.270> for<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.479> also

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
definitely makes up for that also

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.510 
definitely makes up for that also
unusual<00:01:58.709> about<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.039> weapon<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.459> the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
unusual about this weapon is the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.059 
unusual about this weapon is the
magazine<00:02:00.060> size<00:02:00.330> with<00:02:00.630> 25<00:02:01.110> rounds<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.739> you

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
magazine size with 25 rounds and you

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.339 
magazine size with 25 rounds and you
have<00:02:02.220> one<00:02:02.429> round<00:02:02.670> chambered<00:02:03.119> makes<00:02:03.569> it<00:02:03.750> 26

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:04.349 
have one round chambered makes it 26

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:06.260 
have one round chambered makes it 26
compared<00:02:05.099> to<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.280> other<00:02:05.429> carbines<00:02:05.819> with<00:02:06.060> 30

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
compared to the other carbines with 30

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.609 
compared to the other carbines with 30
rounds<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.690> think<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:06.989> is<00:02:07.170> currently<00:02:07.440> the

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
rounds of think this is currently the

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.919 
rounds of think this is currently the
weakest<00:02:08.160> aspect<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:08.910> weapon<00:02:09.119> now<00:02:09.750> as<00:02:09.899> you

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
weakest aspect of this weapon now as you

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.780 
weakest aspect of this weapon now as you
would<00:02:10.140> expect<00:02:10.229> with<00:02:10.590> 650<00:02:11.280> rounds<00:02:11.400> per<00:02:11.670> minute

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
would expect with 650 rounds per minute

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.270 
would expect with 650 rounds per minute
it<00:02:12.000> isn't<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.510> good<00:02:12.840> at<00:02:12.989> cqb<00:02:13.650> or<00:02:13.950> what<00:02:14.190> you

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
it isn't that good at cqb or what you

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.760 
it isn't that good at cqb or what you
would<00:02:14.400> call<00:02:14.610> close<00:02:15.030> quarters<00:02:15.510> combat<00:02:15.770> even

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
would call close quarters combat even

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.500 
would call close quarters combat even
though<00:02:16.860> of<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.099> guns<00:02:17.310> high<00:02:17.489> damage<00:02:17.819> at<00:02:18.209> closer

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
though of the guns high damage at closer

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.990 
though of the guns high damage at closer
ranges<00:02:18.989> I<00:02:19.170> think<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.590> best<00:02:19.860> avoidable<00:02:20.370> to

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
ranges I think it is best avoidable to

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.400 
ranges I think it is best avoidable to
get<00:02:21.150> up<00:02:21.300> close<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.540> personal<00:02:21.750> with<00:02:22.170> your

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
enemy now also something to remind

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.330 
enemy now also something to remind
yourself<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.140> magazine<00:02:25.680> size<00:02:25.980> those

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
five rounds matter I actually find

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.199 
five rounds matter I actually find
myself<00:02:28.620> running<00:02:28.950> into<00:02:29.280> an<00:02:29.370> empty<00:02:29.580> mag<00:02:29.879> every

myself running into an empty mag every

myself running into an empty mag every
now<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.540> then<00:02:30.690> just<00:02:31.020> because<00:02:31.349> I'm<00:02:31.500> not<00:02:31.590> used

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
now and then just because I'm not used

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.800 
now and then just because I'm not used
to<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.099> five-run<00:02:32.400> difference<00:02:33.180> now<00:02:33.629> let's

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
to that five-run difference now let's

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.330 
to that five-run difference now let's
talk<00:02:33.900> about<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.230> attachments<00:02:34.830> starting<00:02:35.220> off

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
talk about the attachments starting off

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.500 
talk about the attachments starting off
with<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.580> optics<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:36.150> would<00:02:36.300> definitely

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
with the optics I would definitely

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.869 
with the optics I would definitely
recommend<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.590> coyote<00:02:37.920> red<00:02:38.129> dot<00:02:38.340> sight<00:02:38.640> if

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
recommend the coyote red dot sight if

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.220 
recommend the coyote red dot sight if
you<00:02:39.209> need<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.390> little<00:02:39.599> bit<00:02:39.720> more<00:02:39.840> range<00:02:40.080> you

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
you need a little bit more range you

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.559 
you need a little bit more range you
could<00:02:40.379> also<00:02:40.500> add<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:41.220> magnifier<00:02:41.849> if<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.270> really

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
could also add a magnifier if you really

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.750 
could also add a magnifier if you really
need<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.230> I<00:02:43.739> like<00:02:43.920> using<00:02:44.099> this<00:02:44.340> site<00:02:44.550> all

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
combat not having to aim down sight

combat not having to aim down sight
actually<00:02:57.090> helped<00:02:57.360> me<00:02:57.480> out<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.630> lot<00:02:57.870> on<00:02:58.350> this<00:02:58.500> gun

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
actually helped me out a lot on this gun

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.590 
actually helped me out a lot on this gun
as<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:59.100> barrel<00:02:59.459> attachment<00:02:59.520> i<00:03:00.000> would<00:03:00.150> recommend

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
as a barrel attachment i would recommend

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.390 
as a barrel attachment i would recommend
the<00:03:00.720> muzzle<00:03:01.110> brake<00:03:01.319> i<00:03:01.530> personally<00:03:02.130> hate

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
the muzzle brake i personally hate

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.220 
the muzzle brake i personally hate
site-to-site<00:03:02.970> recoil<00:03:03.660> i<00:03:03.750> can<00:03:03.930> deal<00:03:04.080> with

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
site-to-site recoil i can deal with

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.020 
site-to-site recoil i can deal with
vertical<00:03:04.560> recoil<00:03:04.830> but<00:03:05.190> side<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.490> side<00:03:05.610> Rico

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
vertical recoil but side to side Rico

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.820 
vertical recoil but side to side Rico
I'm<00:03:06.180> just<00:03:06.450> derping<00:03:06.810> around<00:03:06.810> so<00:03:07.290> muzzle<00:03:07.680> brake

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
I'm just derping around so muzzle brake

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.470 
I'm just derping around so muzzle brake
is<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.040> best<00:03:08.310> answer<00:03:08.520> for<00:03:08.730> me<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.150> wouldn't

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
is the best answer for me I wouldn't

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.670 
is the best answer for me I wouldn't
recommend<00:03:09.690> going<00:03:09.930> with<00:03:10.050> a<00:03:10.140> suppressor<00:03:10.440> on

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
recommend going with a suppressor on

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.470 
recommend going with a suppressor on
this<00:03:10.890> weapon<00:03:11.069> because<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.670> muzzle<00:03:12.000> velocity

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
this weapon because the muzzle velocity

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.570 
this weapon because the muzzle velocity
decreases<00:03:12.690> massively<00:03:13.680> when<00:03:14.040> you're<00:03:14.160> using<00:03:14.310> it

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
decreases massively when you're using it

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.729 
decreases massively when you're using it
as<00:03:14.730> an<00:03:15.209> attachment<00:03:15.780> i<00:03:16.110> would<00:03:16.260> added<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.560> choose

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
as an attachment i would added to choose

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.740 
as an attachment i would added to choose
the<00:03:16.920> stubby<00:03:17.250> grip<00:03:17.280> or<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.730> potato<00:03:18.120> grip<00:03:18.420> not<00:03:18.720> a

the stubby grip or the potato grip not a

the stubby grip or the potato grip not a
subgroup<00:03:19.140> is<00:03:19.260> actually<00:03:19.739> with<00:03:19.860> easier<00:03:20.250> to

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
subgroup is actually with easier to

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.250 
subgroup is actually with easier to
unlock<00:03:20.730> because<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.300> not<00:03:21.450> battle<00:03:21.870> pack<00:03:22.050> on

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260

unlocked it i would say go with the
potato<00:03:26.489> grid<00:03:26.730> now<00:03:27.420> this<00:03:27.600> weapon<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:27.959> an

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
potato grid now this weapon is an

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.229 
potato grid now this weapon is an
absolute<00:03:28.560> beast<00:03:28.920> when<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.550> comes<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:29.940> engaging

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
absolute beast when it comes to engaging

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.780 
absolute beast when it comes to engaging
enemies<00:03:30.720> at<00:03:30.989> medium<00:03:31.380> ranges<00:03:31.800> i<00:03:32.040> prefer<00:03:32.640> this

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
enemies at medium ranges i prefer this

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.550 
enemies at medium ranges i prefer this
carbine<00:03:33.150> over<00:03:33.480> almost<00:03:33.630> all<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.290> assault

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
carbine over almost all the assault

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.410 
carbine over almost all the assault
rifles<00:03:34.980> when<00:03:35.130> it<00:03:35.220> comes<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.610> that<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:36.060> because

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
rifles when it comes to that and because

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.970 
rifles when it comes to that and because
of<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.630> low<00:03:36.810> fire<00:03:37.050> rate<00:03:37.080> on<00:03:37.470> this<00:03:37.590> weapon<00:03:37.769> i

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
of the low fire rate on this weapon i

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.500 
of the low fire rate on this weapon i
think<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.280> is<00:03:38.340> actually<00:03:38.550> really<00:03:38.850> effective<00:03:39.360> on

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
think it is actually really effective on

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.120 
think it is actually really effective on
medium<00:03:39.810> ranges<00:03:40.140> without<00:03:40.410> having<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.769> control

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
medium ranges without having to control

battlefield 4 at the moment together

recommend it to engage enemies at medium

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.819 
recommend it to engage enemies at medium
ranges<00:04:03.269> try<00:04:03.630> to<00:04:03.690> avoid<00:04:03.840> those<00:04:04.140> close<00:04:04.410> ranges
