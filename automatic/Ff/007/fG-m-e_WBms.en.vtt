00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
you know I'm not sure that it will

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.370 
you know I'm not sure that it will
translate<00:02:15.490> into<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:16.000> team<00:02:16.300> that<00:02:16.510> performs<00:02:17.080> any

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
translate into a team that performs any
