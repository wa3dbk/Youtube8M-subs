00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550

used more combinations going down the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.510 
used more combinations going down the
stretch<00:00:22.460> but<00:00:23.560> we<00:00:24.560> came<00:00:24.740> close<00:00:24.800> at<00:00:25.340> one

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
stretch but we came close at one

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.100 
stretch but we came close at one
particular<00:00:25.640> time<00:00:25.970> I<00:00:26.150> think<00:00:26.420> I<00:00:26.480> dislocated<00:00:26.690> my

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
particular time I think I dislocated my

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.990 
particular time I think I dislocated my
elbow<00:00:27.200> my<00:00:28.010> left<00:00:28.220> elbow<00:00:28.400> when<00:00:28.700> we<00:00:28.790> came<00:00:28.940> close

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860
