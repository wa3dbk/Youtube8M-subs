scale pattern it's not hard all you
gotta<00:02:36.550> do<00:02:36.880> is<00:02:37.120> think<00:02:37.690> of<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:38.020> as<00:02:39.060> letter<00:02:40.060> skis

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.550 

so<00:03:03.590> it<00:03:04.280> should<00:03:04.490> look<00:03:04.640> with<00:03:04.820> that<00:03:05.080> all<00:03:06.080> right<00:03:06.350> so

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
so it should look with that all right so

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.170
