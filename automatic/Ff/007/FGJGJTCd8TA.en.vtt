00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.460
 Hi, I'm Nestor Serra, your coach 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.289
 staff today we're going to focus on the 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.930
 preparation for the mountain bike between 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.099
 the exercises prior to pedaling 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.960
 we will start with a work of the 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.759
 mobility while activating all the 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.550
 extensor musculature of the back 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:32.689
 for this we will place the parallel feet 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:35.210
 we will perform a trunk flexion and 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.250
 little by little vertebra to vertebra we will go 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.190
 doing the extension of the column 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.800
 vertebral until you get to this 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.260
 maximum extension for this second 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.879
 exercise we will place ourselves on our knees with 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.580
 hands resting on the floor at 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.350
 height of the others 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.690
 we will start raising the right hand 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.570
 with the left foot making a 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.330
 cross total extension we will return to the 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.000
 initial position and we perform the 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.280
 lifting the other side left hand and 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.560
 right foot 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.780
 for this third exercise we will perform 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.700
 a hypopressive work with which 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.860
 we will improve the whole tone of our belt 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.930
 abdominal we will place ourselves in the same 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.799
 Initial position of the second exercise 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.600
 but with hands rotated inwards 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:23.270
 from this position what I'm going to do 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.740
 is to shift the center of gravity towards 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.930
 ahead 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:32.750
 inspire exhale took out all the air and here 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.299
 munar I will make a false inspiration that is 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.939
 an opening of the costal box but without 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.340
 take a breath the fourth exercise will be 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.490
 Stretched face up with the feet 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.090
 parallel and parallel knees from 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.780
 this position we will lift the hip 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.420
 activating the gluteus and the lumbar area 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.330
 we keep for more or less a minute 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.729
 I know it costs but try this fifth 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.450
 exercise we will do a stretch of 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.069
 the entire posterior myofascial chain is 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.959
 a bit ridiculous exercise already 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.200
 you'll see but do not worry it's going very 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:11.600
 very well the heels together the tips 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.730
 a little bit apart the knees a 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.690
 slightly flexed the hip towards 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.190
 back and back spine 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:24.010
 stretching stretching 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:26.480
 moment hands in external rotation 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.390
 and endured this position 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.489
 lengthening lengthening lengthening 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.530
 also about a minute for this 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.330
 last exercise we will use the grit of 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.739
 trigger point or you can also use 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:42.769
 the black roll of tou located on the floor 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.860
 and I'm going to place my lower back on top of 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.740
 the 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.070
 I raise the gluteus and in this position 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.160
 I do as a little massage on all 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.600
 the back part 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.910
 raising and lowering my body 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.320
 Take care of your lower back and you can follow 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.030
 enjoying the benefits of 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.030
 pedal for many years
