00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
even simpler way to play this you can go

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:14.370 
even simpler way to play this you can go
open<00:03:08.049> a<00:03:10.200> third<00:03:11.200> fresh<00:03:11.670> into<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.760> five<00:03:13.079> is<00:03:14.079> this

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
open a third fresh into the five is this

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.170 
open a third fresh into the five is this
is<00:03:14.590> a<00:03:15.540> power<00:03:16.540> cord<00:03:17.040> opening<00:03:18.040> then<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.940> third

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
is a power cord opening then the third

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.090 
is a power cord opening then the third
fret<00:03:19.570> still<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.140> same<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:21.690> then<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.470> LOI

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
fret still the same and then to the LOI

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.099 
fret still the same and then to the LOI
on<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.609> a<00:03:24.640> string<00:03:24.790> because<00:03:25.359> that's<00:03:25.600> you<00:03:25.989> know

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109
