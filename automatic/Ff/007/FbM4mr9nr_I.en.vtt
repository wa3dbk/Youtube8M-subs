contest but I'll Swift a little bit too

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:24.759 
contest but I'll Swift a little bit too
much<00:03:17.030> oil<00:03:17.269> as<00:03:17.920> well<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:23.480> usually<00:03:23.810> when<00:03:24.290> I<00:03:24.350> trim

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
much oil as well and usually when I trim

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.479 
much oil as well and usually when I trim
my<00:03:24.920> hair<00:03:24.950> that's<00:03:25.579> also<00:03:26.799> when<00:03:27.799> it's<00:03:27.980> bandit

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
my hair that's also when it's bandit

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.160 
my hair that's also when it's bandit
because<00:03:28.790> my<00:03:28.970> hair<00:03:29.150> is<00:03:29.180> kind<00:03:29.510> of<00:03:29.600> stretched<00:03:29.959> out

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
because my hair is kind of stretched out

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.160 
because my hair is kind of stretched out
so<00:03:31.130> I<00:03:31.160> do<00:03:31.459> while<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.150> bands<00:03:32.390> are<00:03:32.660> on<00:03:32.810> my<00:03:32.959> hair

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
so I do while the bands are on my hair

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.470 
so I do while the bands are on my hair
like<00:03:34.040> this<00:03:34.100> little<00:03:34.519> bit<00:03:34.790> of<00:03:34.910> hair<00:03:35.090> here<00:03:35.269> you

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
like this little bit of hair here you

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.720 
like this little bit of hair here you
see<00:03:35.720> how<00:03:35.870> that<00:03:36.109> is<00:03:36.290> it's<00:03:36.859> not<00:03:37.070> with<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.370> resume

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
see how that is it's not with the resume

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.460 
see how that is it's not with the resume
of<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:37.910> way<00:03:38.090> through<00:03:38.299> this<00:03:38.480> trails<00:03:38.840> at<00:03:38.989> all

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.569 

and<00:03:42.670> it's<00:03:43.670> not<00:03:43.880> much<00:03:44.769> but<00:03:45.769> it's<00:03:45.829> the<00:03:46.280> straight

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
and it's not much but it's the straight

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.550 
and it's not much but it's the straight
end<00:03:46.910> that<00:03:47.150> you<00:03:47.180> know<00:03:47.510> it<00:03:47.660> probably<00:03:47.900> just<00:03:48.230> split

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
end that you know it probably just split

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.530 
end that you know it probably just split
