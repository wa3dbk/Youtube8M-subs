00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
they don't really need to be fed but

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.719 
they don't really need to be fed but
they<00:02:00.000> do<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.570> they<00:02:01.140> respond<00:02:01.619> very<00:02:01.770> well<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.310> it

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
they do and they respond very well to it

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.030 
they do and they respond very well to it
so<00:02:03.240> with<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.689> soil<00:02:03.990> ready<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.560> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
so with the soil ready and the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.219 
so with the soil ready and the
fertilizer<00:02:05.490> already<00:02:05.850> worked<00:02:06.090> into<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.659> what<00:02:07.200> I

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
fertilizer already worked into it what I

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.960 
fertilizer already worked into it what I
do<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.619> just<00:02:07.799> pop<00:02:08.009> these<00:02:08.280> out<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.789> their

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
do is I just pop these out of their

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.840 
do is I just pop these out of their
little<00:02:09.119> cell<00:02:09.360> pack<00:02:09.660> like<00:02:09.929> that

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
little cell pack like that

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.340 
little cell pack like that
you<00:02:10.880> can<00:02:11.000> see<00:02:11.240> that<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.510> roots<00:02:11.750> are<00:02:12.050> slightly

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
you can see that the roots are slightly

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.740 
you can see that the roots are slightly
bound<00:02:12.740> together<00:02:12.920> I<00:02:13.400> just<00:02:13.880> gently<00:02:14.180> pull<00:02:14.570> them

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
bound together I just gently pull them

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.900 
bound together I just gently pull them
apart<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.740> this<00:02:15.890> will<00:02:16.040> encourage<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.700> roots

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
apart and this will encourage the roots

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.360 
apart and this will encourage the roots
to<00:02:17.150> grow<00:02:17.300> out<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:18.200> then<00:02:18.830> what<00:02:19.010> I'm<00:02:19.130> going<00:02:19.280> to

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
to grow out and then what I'm going to

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.570 
to grow out and then what I'm going to
do<00:02:19.490> is<00:02:19.640> plant<00:02:19.970> these<00:02:20.180> pansies<00:02:20.920> about<00:02:21.920> every

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
do is plant these pansies about every

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.380 
do is plant these pansies about every
eight<00:02:23.480> inches<00:02:23.930> apart<00:02:24.550> cuz<00:02:25.550> that<00:02:25.670> like<00:02:25.820> a<00:02:25.850> solid

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
eight inches apart cuz that like a solid

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.680 
eight inches apart cuz that like a solid
mass<00:02:26.660> of<00:02:27.020> them<00:02:27.610> now<00:02:28.610> one<00:02:29.060> of<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.270> things<00:02:29.540> that

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
mass of them now one of the things that

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.170 
mass of them now one of the things that
I<00:02:29.780> learned<00:02:29.990> to<00:02:30.170> do<00:02:30.290> years<00:02:30.650> ago<00:02:30.980> was<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.760> pinch

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
I learned to do years ago was to pinch

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.610 
I learned to do years ago was to pinch
off<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.720> blooms<00:02:33.100> like<00:02:34.100> this<00:02:34.460> I<00:02:35.050> it's<00:02:36.050> painful

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
off the blooms like this I it's painful

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.100 
off the blooms like this I it's painful
to<00:02:36.770> do<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:38.090> can<00:02:38.240> pinch<00:02:38.480> off<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.840> blooms

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
to do and you can pinch off the blooms

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.830 
to do and you can pinch off the blooms
here<00:02:39.470> like<00:02:39.800> that<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:41.120> reason<00:02:41.480> for<00:02:41.630> this<00:02:41.780> is

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
here like that the reason for this is

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.140 
here like that the reason for this is
that<00:02:42.830> you<00:02:42.950> really<00:02:43.100> want<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.460> little<00:02:43.670> plant<00:02:43.970> to

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
that you really want the little plant to

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.540 
that you really want the little plant to
get<00:02:44.270> established<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:45.650> if<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.010> comes<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.340> rain

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
get established and if it comes to rain

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.090 
get established and if it comes to rain
these<00:02:47.000> blooms<00:02:47.360> well<00:02:47.840> they<00:02:48.290> just<00:02:48.320> get<00:02:48.710> beaten

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
you'll have this mass planting along the

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.530 
you'll have this mass planting along the
edge<00:03:27.140> most<00:03:28.010> of<00:03:28.130> my<00:03:28.160> bulbs<00:03:28.640> are<00:03:28.820> back<00:03:29.000> here<00:03:29.360> and

edge most of my bulbs are back here and

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.870 
edge most of my bulbs are back here and
so<00:03:29.990> halfway<00:03:30.290> where<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.770> bulbs<00:03:31.130> are<00:03:31.310> up<00:03:31.580> to<00:03:31.730> the
