and moving around so fast it's kind of
hard<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.020> see<00:00:07.200> what's<00:00:07.410> doing<00:00:07.529> what<00:00:07.770> enough

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
hard to see what's doing what enough

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.910 
hard to see what's doing what enough
anything<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.370> upgrading<00:00:08.849> or<00:00:09.120> whatnot<00:00:09.740> but<00:00:10.740> um

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
anything is upgrading or whatnot but um

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.129 
anything is upgrading or whatnot but um
regardless<00:00:11.849> his<00:00:12.000> armpit<00:00:12.269> juvenal<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.750> up<00:00:12.929> and

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
regardless his armpit juvenal is up and

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.289 
regardless his armpit juvenal is up and
I<00:00:13.980> haven't<00:00:14.700> caught<00:00:14.849> whether<00:00:15.000> or<00:00:15.059> not<00:00:15.120> he's

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
I haven't caught whether or not he's

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.840 
I haven't caught whether or not he's
making<00:00:15.660> his<00:00:15.780> first<00:00:15.990> arbiter<00:00:16.350> yet<00:00:16.560> no<00:00:17.369> I'm<00:00:17.760> not

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
making his first arbiter yet no I'm not

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.260 
making his first arbiter yet no I'm not
sure<00:00:18.199> I<00:00:19.199> don't<00:00:20.039> know<00:00:20.250> if<00:00:20.369> Terrance<00:00:20.670> expanded

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
sure I don't know if Terrance expanded

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.689 
sure I don't know if Terrance expanded
yet<00:00:21.359> or<00:00:21.480> not<00:00:21.570> but<00:00:21.949> I<00:00:22.949> would<00:00:23.340> assume<00:00:23.550> he

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
yet or not but I would assume he

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.310 
yet or not but I would assume he
probably<00:00:23.970> has<00:00:24.390> considering<00:00:24.990> he<00:00:25.080> can<00:00:25.230> just

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
probably has considering he can just

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.589 
probably has considering he can just
lift<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:26.160> looks<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.150> he<00:00:27.269> might<00:00:27.420> have<00:00:27.539> a

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
lift it looks like he might have a

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.200 
lift it looks like he might have a
natural<00:00:28.560> expansion<00:00:28.800> taken<00:00:29.550> right<00:00:29.670> now<00:00:29.789> and

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
natural expansion taken right now and

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.799 
natural expansion taken right now and
normal<00:00:30.660> has<00:00:30.750> about<00:00:30.929> ten<00:00:31.199> Dragons<00:00:31.500> know<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:32.809> he

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
normal has about ten Dragons know so he

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:34.940 
normal has about ten Dragons know so he
should<00:00:33.989> he<00:00:34.170> should<00:00:34.200> be<00:00:34.440> ready<00:00:34.620> for<00:00:34.739> anything

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
should he should be ready for anything

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.510 
should he should be ready for anything
that<00:00:35.340> his<00:00:35.640> opponent<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> throw<00:00:36.239> at<00:00:36.390> him<00:00:36.480> oh

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
that his opponent to throw at him oh

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.619 
that his opponent to throw at him oh
yeah<00:00:38.520> there's<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> expansion<00:00:39.300> right<00:00:39.420> there

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
yeah there's the expansion right there

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.900 
yeah there's the expansion right there
so<00:00:39.870> yes<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.290> expansion<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.739> up<00:00:40.920> he's<00:00:41.670> making

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
so yes the expansion is up he's making

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.529 
so yes the expansion is up he's making
some<00:00:41.940> zealots<00:00:42.420> three<00:00:42.870> zealots<00:00:43.170> right<00:00:43.350> now

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
some zealots three zealots right now

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.810 
some zealots three zealots right now
that's<00:00:45.539> nice<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.960> guess<00:00:46.340> they<00:00:47.340> still<00:00:47.399> haven't

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
that's nice I guess they still haven't

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.979 
that's nice I guess they still haven't
shown<00:00:47.940> whether<00:00:48.210> or<00:00:48.270> not<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.480> arbiters<00:00:48.809> not

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
shown whether or not the arbiters not

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.130 
shown whether or not the arbiters not
being<00:00:49.289> produced<00:00:49.530> kind<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.399> surprised<00:00:50.730> by<00:00:50.879> that

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
being produced kind of surprised by that

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.630 
being produced kind of surprised by that
normal<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.230> just<00:00:52.260> making<00:00:52.739> sure<00:00:52.860> he's<00:00:53.070> aware<00:00:53.460> of

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
normal is just making sure he's aware of

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.619 
normal is just making sure he's aware of
what<00:00:53.789> his<00:00:53.879> opponents<00:00:54.239> doing<00:00:54.420> at<00:00:54.510> all<00:00:54.570> times

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
what his opponents doing at all times

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.310 
what his opponents doing at all times
here<00:00:55.110> with<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.320> courser<00:00:57.050> some<00:00:58.050> more<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.230> you

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
here with this courser some more of you

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.830 
here with this courser some more of you
lots<00:00:58.440> being<00:00:58.649> made<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:58.980> some<00:00:59.940> cannons<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.480> put

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
lots being made and some cannons to put

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.360 
lots being made and some cannons to put
up<00:01:00.899> some<00:01:01.050> defense<00:01:01.170> against<00:01:01.559> some<00:01:01.980> potential

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
up some defense against some potential

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.100 
up some defense against some potential
drops<00:01:02.640> because<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.180> dropship<00:01:03.750> should<00:01:03.960> have

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
drops because the dropship should have

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.020 
drops because the dropship should have
been<00:01:04.260> up<00:01:04.350> by<00:01:04.559> now<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:05.070> mean<00:01:05.580> they<00:01:05.670> really<00:01:05.820> should

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
been up by now I mean they really should

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.399 
been up by now I mean they really should
have<00:01:06.119> it's<00:01:06.240> almost<00:01:06.450> nine<00:01:06.840> minutes<00:01:07.140> into<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
have it's almost nine minutes into the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.580 
have it's almost nine minutes into the
game<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:08.780> that's<00:01:09.780> definitely<00:01:10.229> enough<00:01:10.409> time

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
game and that's definitely enough time

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.399 
game and that's definitely enough time
to<00:01:10.770> get<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> drop-off<00:01:11.580> for<00:01:11.939> sure<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.330> mean<00:01:13.020> Nora's

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
to get a drop-off for sure I mean Nora's

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.469 
to get a drop-off for sure I mean Nora's
almost<00:01:13.680> got<00:01:13.799> arbiters<00:01:14.130> by<00:01:14.280> now<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.700> you

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
almost got arbiters by now so you you

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.730 
almost got arbiters by now so you you
would<00:01:15.630> think<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:16.140> term<00:01:16.409> would've<00:01:16.650> already

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
would think that term would've already

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.920 
would think that term would've already
dropped<00:01:16.860> him<00:01:17.189> by<00:01:17.310> now<00:01:17.430> but<00:01:17.640> who<00:01:18.630> knows<00:01:18.659> what

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
dropped him by now but who knows what

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.170 
dropped him by now but who knows what
turns<00:01:19.080> doing<00:01:19.259> maybe<00:01:19.500> he's<00:01:19.650> trying<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.920> get<00:01:20.040> up

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
turns doing maybe he's trying to get up

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.910 
turns doing maybe he's trying to get up
economic<00:01:21.180> advantage<00:01:21.540> who'd<00:01:22.470> almost<00:01:22.799> actually

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
economic advantage who'd almost actually

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.830 
economic advantage who'd almost actually
making<00:01:23.189> hallucinate<00:01:23.820> that's<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.479> trick<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.720> I

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
making hallucinate that's a trick that I

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.560 
making hallucinate that's a trick that I
like<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.140> use<00:01:25.290> against<00:01:25.650> tyranny<00:01:26.479> who<00:01:27.479> are

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
like to use against tyranny who are

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.210 
like to use against tyranny who are
doing<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.990> no<00:01:28.110> good<00:01:28.140> base<00:01:28.740> defense<00:01:29.040> like<00:01:29.189> that

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
doing you no good base defense like that

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.999 
doing you no good base defense like that
with<00:01:29.490> turrets<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.909> glass<00:01:30.920> hallucinates<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
with turrets and glass hallucinates a

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.300 
with turrets and glass hallucinates a
great<00:01:32.189> way<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.400> get<00:01:32.729> an<00:01:32.850> arbiter<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.329> for<00:01:33.689> sure

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
great way to get an arbiter in for sure

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.620 
great way to get an arbiter in for sure
just<00:01:35.310> one<00:01:35.490> hallucinate<00:01:35.939> can<00:01:36.180> make<00:01:36.360> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
just one hallucinate can make the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.700 
just one hallucinate can make the
difference<00:01:36.659> between<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.200> arbiter<00:01:37.500> dying

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
difference between the arbiter dying

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.960 
difference between the arbiter dying
before<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.070> get<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.310> recall<00:01:38.549> off<00:01:38.700> which<00:01:38.850> would

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
before you get to recall off which would

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.499 
before you get to recall off which would
be<00:01:39.060> really<00:01:39.240> bad<00:01:39.479> for<00:01:39.540> Nora<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:42.060> that's<00:01:42.210> nice<00:01:42.360> to

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
be really bad for Nora so that's nice to

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.109 
be really bad for Nora so that's nice to
see<00:01:42.630> how<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.720> would<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.020> see<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.640> i<00:01:44.640> actually

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
see how I would to see that i actually

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.639 
see how I would to see that i actually
just<00:01:45.390> watched<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.840> legendary<00:01:46.290> replay

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
tear and i remember what his name was

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.560 
tear and i remember what his name was
but<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:53.009> legendary<00:01:53.430> new<00:01:53.670> crush<00:01:53.939> video<00:01:54.270> and

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
it was actually the coolest nipples I've

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.740 
it was actually the coolest nipples I've
ever<00:01:56.250> seen<00:01:56.579> even<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.030> opponent<00:01:57.360> was<00:01:57.450> really

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
ever seen even the opponent was really

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.060 
ever seen even the opponent was really
bad<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.110> mean<00:01:58.229> he<00:01:58.380> was<00:01:58.500> worse<00:01:58.649> than<00:01:58.680> most<00:01:58.979> of

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
bad and I mean he was worse than most of

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.310 
bad and I mean he was worse than most of
the<00:01:59.100> people<00:01:59.219> i<00:01:59.430> play<00:01:59.640> with<00:01:59.790> on<00:01:59.969> bnet<00:02:00.450> by<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
the people i play with on bnet by the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.760 
the people i play with on bnet by the
faller<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:03.509> was<00:02:03.630> kind<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.840> funny<00:02:04.049> too<00:02:04.200> I

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
faller so that was kind of funny too I

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.959 
faller so that was kind of funny too I
mean<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.159> don't<00:02:05.310> even<00:02:05.340> know<00:02:05.520> why<00:02:05.670> he<00:02:05.850> was

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
mean I don't even know why he was

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.760 
mean I don't even know why he was
getting<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.780> play<00:02:06.960> against<00:02:07.170> blocks<00:02:07.439> or<00:02:07.590> maybe

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
getting to play against blocks or maybe

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.160 
getting to play against blocks or maybe
was<00:02:07.950> like<00:02:08.039> noobs<00:02:08.399> versus<00:02:08.700> Pro<00:02:08.940> 9<00:02:09.149> but<00:02:09.450> anyway

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
was like noobs versus Pro 9 but anyway

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.650 
was like noobs versus Pro 9 but anyway
it<00:02:11.800> was<00:02:11.890> just<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.069> cool<00:02:12.280> dry<00:02:12.459> it<00:02:12.610> was<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.730> cool<00:02:12.910> new

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
it was just a cool dry it was a cool new

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.559 
it was just a cool dry it was a cool new
crusher<00:02:13.930> because<00:02:14.200> he<00:02:14.440> had<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:15.390> science<00:02:16.390> also

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
crusher because he had the science also

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.690 
crusher because he had the science also
for<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.840> EMP<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.739> defensive<00:02:18.190> shield<00:02:18.430> or

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
for the EMP and the defensive shield or

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.520 
for the EMP and the defensive shield or
yeah<00:02:19.270> defensive<00:02:19.690> shield<00:02:19.900> if<00:02:20.050> he<00:02:20.110> needed<00:02:20.349> it<00:02:20.440> on

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
yeah defensive shield if he needed it on

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.550 
yeah defensive shield if he needed it on

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
a ghost EMP on the Nexus obviously for

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.979 
a ghost EMP on the Nexus obviously for
a1<00:02:23.709> a2<00:02:23.860> kill<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.790> he<00:02:24.910> also<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.599> I've<00:02:25.840> never

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
a1 a2 kill and he also and I've never

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.920 
a1 a2 kill and he also and I've never
seen<00:02:26.140> anyone<00:02:26.349> do<00:02:26.530> this<00:02:26.560> but<00:02:26.980> he<00:02:27.099> also<00:02:27.250> had<00:02:27.930> two

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
seen anyone do this but he also had two

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.260 
seen anyone do this but he also had two
medics<00:02:29.560> ready<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.130> flare<00:02:30.430> any<00:02:30.640> observers<00:02:31.120> that

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
medics ready to flare any observers that

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.840 
medics ready to flare any observers that
come<00:02:31.420> along<00:02:31.600> which<00:02:32.590> was<00:02:33.040> very<00:02:33.250> clever<00:02:33.610> in<00:02:33.730> my

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
come along which was very clever in my

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.150 
come along which was very clever in my
opinion<00:02:34.090> very<00:02:34.450> clever<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:35.470> make<00:02:35.680> sure<00:02:35.950> that

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
opinion very clever to make sure that

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.680 
opinion very clever to make sure that
they're<00:02:36.370> got<00:02:36.550> off<00:02:36.700> next<00:02:37.120> time<00:02:37.239> I<00:02:37.360> new<00:02:37.480> crush

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
they're got off next time I new crush

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.699 
they're got off next time I new crush
somebody<00:02:37.900> that's<00:02:38.110> exactly<00:02:38.410> what<00:02:38.560> I'm<00:02:38.620> going

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
somebody that's exactly what I'm going

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.250 
somebody that's exactly what I'm going
to<00:02:38.800> be<00:02:38.860> doing<00:02:39.720> looks<00:02:40.720> like<00:02:40.870> Nora<00:02:41.080> I<00:02:41.170> was

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
to be doing looks like Nora I was

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.390 
to be doing looks like Nora I was
getting<00:02:41.470> ready<00:02:41.620> it's<00:02:41.769> ten<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.370> half

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
getting ready it's ten and a half

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.970 
getting ready it's ten and a half
minutes<00:02:42.700> into<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.030> game<00:02:43.060> he's<00:02:43.480> got<00:02:43.830> you<00:02:44.830> did

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
minutes into the game he's got you did

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.250 
minutes into the game he's got you did
enough<00:02:45.160> for<00:02:45.340> close<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:45.940> two<00:02:46.269> full<00:02:46.540> recalls<00:02:46.989> if

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
enough for close to two full recalls if

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.860 
enough for close to two full recalls if
he<00:02:47.440> clumps<00:02:47.920> him<00:02:48.010> together<00:02:48.130> right<00:02:48.489> so<00:02:49.450> he<00:02:49.690> does

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
he clumps him together right so he does

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.180 
he clumps him together right so he does
have<00:02:50.019> two<00:02:50.170> orbiters<00:02:50.530> so<00:02:50.739> I'm<00:02:50.830> assuming<00:02:50.920> that's

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
have two orbiters so I'm assuming that's

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.620 
have two orbiters so I'm assuming that's
what<00:02:51.280> he's<00:02:51.700> waiting<00:02:51.850> for<00:02:52.030> probably<00:02:52.540> the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
what he's waiting for probably the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.750 
what he's waiting for probably the
energy<00:02:53.019> and<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.170> few<00:02:53.470> more<00:02:53.560> troops<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.160> here

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
energy and a few more troops and here

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.890 
energy and a few more troops and here
they<00:02:54.850> are<00:02:54.880> right<00:02:55.120> now<00:02:55.299> another<00:02:55.510> five

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
they are right now another five

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.900 
they are right now another five
zealand's<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.590> he's<00:02:57.459> making<00:02:57.640> up<00:02:57.880> his

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
zealand's and he's making up his

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.360 
zealand's and he's making up his
robotics<00:02:58.450> most<00:02:58.660> likely<00:02:58.930> just<00:02:59.080> for<00:02:59.370> observers

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
robotics most likely just for observers

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.220 
robotics most likely just for observers
not<00:03:00.670> for<00:03:00.910> drops<00:03:01.150> because<00:03:01.450> he's<00:03:01.720> got<00:03:01.870> arbiters

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
not for drops because he's got arbiters

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.759 
not for drops because he's got arbiters
obviously<00:03:02.680> so<00:03:03.299> anyway<00:03:04.299> um<00:03:04.620> just<00:03:05.620> I'm<00:03:05.739> just

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
obviously so anyway um just I'm just

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:06.990 
obviously so anyway um just I'm just
waiting<00:03:06.069> for<00:03:06.190> word<00:03:06.280> now<00:03:06.400> I'm<00:03:06.519> just<00:03:06.610> waiting<00:03:06.700> to

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
waiting for word now I'm just waiting to

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.720 
waiting for word now I'm just waiting to
see<00:03:07.120> how<00:03:07.209> effective<00:03:07.600> it<00:03:07.690> is<00:03:08.280> we'll<00:03:09.280> see<00:03:09.489> i'm

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
see how effective it is we'll see i'm

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.890 
see how effective it is we'll see i'm
just<00:03:09.880> really<00:03:10.060> really<00:03:10.239> surprised<00:03:10.600> that<00:03:10.720> good

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
just really really surprised that good

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.300 
just really really surprised that good
