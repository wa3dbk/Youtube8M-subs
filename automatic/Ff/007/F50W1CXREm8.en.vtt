not work and it's just slightly off just
like<00:02:45.190> everybody<00:02:45.580> says<00:02:45.880> that<00:02:46.209> would<00:02:46.810> be

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
like everybody says that would be

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.430 
like everybody says that would be
slightly<00:02:47.680> off<00:02:48.780> you're<00:02:49.780> putting<00:02:49.989> it<00:02:50.079> in<00:02:50.170> wrong

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.860 

this<00:02:53.440> bracket<00:02:54.010> is<00:02:54.100> designed<00:02:54.160> to<00:02:54.670> hold<00:02:54.850> two<00:02:55.180> two

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
this bracket is designed to hold two two

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.800 
this bracket is designed to hold two two
and<00:02:55.989> a<00:02:56.049> half<00:02:56.200> drives<00:02:56.910> you've<00:02:57.910> got<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.630> two

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
and a half drives you've got the two

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.539 
and a half drives you've got the two
sets<00:02:59.290> of<00:02:59.380> holes<00:02:59.590> there<00:02:59.860> you<00:03:00.040> put<00:03:00.250> one<00:03:00.400> on<00:03:00.519> top

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
sets of holes there you put one on top

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.750 
sets of holes there you put one on top
put<00:03:01.000> one<00:03:01.120> on<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.269> bottom<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:03.100> do<00:03:03.640> the

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
same thing with the matching side so

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.430 
same thing with the matching side so
it's<00:03:05.920> sandwiched<00:03:06.250> in<00:03:06.519> and<00:03:06.820> that's<00:03:07.200> that's<00:03:08.200> it

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
it's sandwiched in and that's that's it

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.800 
it's sandwiched in and that's that's it
and<00:03:08.920> to<00:03:09.250> prove<00:03:09.489> everybody<00:03:09.730> correct<00:03:10.450> I'm<00:03:10.630> going

screw there you can see it the bracket
makes<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:27.850> hard<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.090> get<00:03:28.209> lighting<00:03:28.540> on<00:03:28.660> it<00:03:28.799> but

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
makes it hard to get lighting on it but

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.800 
makes it hard to get lighting on it but
that's<00:03:31.209> it<00:03:31.390> it<00:03:31.660> screws<00:03:32.109> in<00:03:32.350> there's<00:03:32.709> no<00:03:32.920> extra

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
that's it it screws in there's no extra

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.199 
that's it it screws in there's no extra
well<00:03:34.810> no<00:03:35.260> real<00:03:35.560> extra<00:03:35.980> overhang<00:03:36.430> for<00:03:36.760> it<00:03:36.910> in<00:03:37.030> my

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
well no real extra overhang for it in my

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.050 
well no real extra overhang for it in my
opinion<00:03:38.250> probably<00:03:39.250> could<00:03:39.609> turned<00:03:39.880> it<00:03:39.970> around

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
opinion probably could turned it around

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.890 
opinion probably could turned it around
or<00:03:40.390> something<00:03:40.630> like<00:03:40.690> that<00:03:40.750> maybe<00:03:41.109> but<00:03:41.850> it's

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
or something like that maybe but it's

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.229 
or something like that maybe but it's
fine<00:03:43.900> I<00:03:44.230> don't<00:03:44.290> see<00:03:44.620> any<00:03:44.769> issues<00:03:45.130> with<00:03:45.400> the

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
fine I don't see any issues with the

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.520 
fine I don't see any issues with the
bracket<00:03:46.630> itself<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:49.780> know<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:50.019> does<00:03:50.200> come

I<00:04:12.450> would<00:04:12.780> definitely<00:04:12.930> recommend<00:04:13.170> this<00:04:13.739> Vitek

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
I would definitely recommend this Vitek

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.440 
I would definitely recommend this Vitek
bracket<00:04:14.760> it's<00:04:15.480> I<00:04:15.720> think<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.019> was<00:04:16.109> like<00:04:16.290> five

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
bracket it's I think it was like five

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.990 
bracket it's I think it was like five
maybe<00:04:18.450> seven<00:04:18.780> bucks<00:04:19.459> wasn't<00:04:20.459> too<00:04:20.549> bad<00:04:20.730> a

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
maybe seven bucks wasn't too bad a

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.450 
maybe seven bucks wasn't too bad a
little<00:04:21.720> bit<00:04:21.810> more<00:04:22.019> expensive<00:04:22.680> in<00:04:22.919> my<00:04:23.010> opinion

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
little bit more expensive in my opinion

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.060 
little bit more expensive in my opinion
and<00:04:24.180> that<00:04:24.450> would<00:04:24.630> have<00:04:24.930> liked<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.470> pay<00:04:25.620> for<00:04:25.680> it

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
and that would have liked the pay for it

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.800 
and that would have liked the pay for it
in<00:04:26.160> my<00:04:26.280> opinion<00:04:26.490> that's<00:04:26.820> just<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.389> chunk<00:04:27.690> of

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
in my opinion that's just the chunk of

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.020 
in my opinion that's just the chunk of
metal<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.410> it<00:04:28.650> should<00:04:28.860> only<00:04:29.010> cost<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:29.910> know

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
metal and it should only cost you know

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.810 
metal and it should only cost you know
like<00:04:30.800> two<00:04:31.800> bucks<00:04:32.300> but<00:04:33.300> you<00:04:34.340> know<00:04:35.340> it's<00:04:35.639> not

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
like two bucks but you know it's not

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.490 
like two bucks but you know it's not
like<00:04:35.880> there's<00:04:36.300> a<00:04:36.389> lot<00:04:36.570> of<00:04:36.630> market<00:04:37.020> for<00:04:37.260> it<00:04:37.320> so<00:04:37.440> I

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
like there's a lot of market for it so I

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.200 
like there's a lot of market for it so I
can<00:04:37.620> understand<00:04:37.950> the<00:04:38.100> marking<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:38.550> up<00:04:38.700> you

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
can understand the marking it up you

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.640 
can understand the marking it up you
know<00:04:39.740> for<00:04:40.740> it<00:04:41.690> that's<00:04:42.690> it<00:04:42.870> it's<00:04:43.020> just<00:04:43.110> two

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
know for it that's it it's just two

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.440 
know for it that's it it's just two
pieces<00:04:43.830> and<00:04:44.070> that<00:04:44.160> only<00:04:44.400> is<00:04:44.580> screw<00:04:45.210> it<00:04:45.300> into

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
pieces and that only is screw it into

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.540 
pieces and that only is screw it into
your<00:04:45.570> hard<00:04:45.690> drive<00:04:46.130> and<00:04:47.270> that's<00:04:48.270> it
