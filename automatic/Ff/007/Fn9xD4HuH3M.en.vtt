be able to see I'd like to talk about
them<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.120> little<00:00:54.210> bit<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.570> know<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.870> some

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
them a little bit so you know that some

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.689 
them a little bit so you know that some
things<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.350> been<00:00:55.469> done<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.219> can't<00:00:56.489> see

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
things have been done that you can't see

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.610 
things have been done that you can't see
one<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.480> them<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.840> floor<00:00:58.079> pans<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.500> these

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
one of them is the floor pans of these

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.750 
one of them is the floor pans of these
cards<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.920> know<00:00:59.039> these<00:00:59.190> cards<00:00:59.489> were<00:00:59.579> known

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
cards you know these cards were known

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.060 
cards you know these cards were known
for<00:00:59.789> because<00:01:00.780> they're<00:01:01.050> unibody<00:01:01.469> water<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:01.949> get

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
for because they're unibody water we get

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.590 
for because they're unibody water we get
trapped<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.520> certain<00:01:02.820> places<00:01:02.940> underneath

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
trapped in certain places underneath

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.840 
trapped in certain places underneath
meaning<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.080> most<00:01:05.070> people<00:01:05.309> know<00:01:05.339> what<00:01:05.519> unibody

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
meaning it most people know what unibody

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.310 
meaning it most people know what unibody
is<00:01:06.060> but<00:01:06.240> if<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.390> don't<00:01:06.600> what<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.869> means<00:01:07.080> is

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
is but if you don't what that means is

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.920 
is but if you don't what that means is
instead<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.400> having<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.729> frame<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.240> then<00:01:09.659> the
