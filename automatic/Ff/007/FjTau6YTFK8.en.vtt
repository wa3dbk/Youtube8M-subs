00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
LeBlanc is some kind of the safe peek at

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.889 
LeBlanc is some kind of the safe peek at
the<00:00:58.649> moment<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.190> we<00:00:59.910> didn't<00:01:00.180> know<00:01:00.270> what<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.629> mid

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
the moment so we didn't know what is mid

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.650 
the moment so we didn't know what is mid
lane<00:01:01.109> if<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:01.620> Azrael<00:01:02.160> or<00:01:02.399> Thurston<00:01:02.850> AAP<00:01:03.300> or

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
lane if it's Azrael or Thurston AAP or

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.780

something<00:01:06.000> else<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.479> be<00:01:06.600> picked<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:06.900> to

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
something else to be picked in to

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.750 
something else to be picked in to
Tristan<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.560> some<00:01:07.740> kind<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.070> counter<00:01:08.430> tu<00:01:08.610> mundo

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
Tristan is some kind of counter tu mundo

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.380 
Tristan is some kind of counter tu mundo
so<00:01:09.689> we<00:01:10.560> decided<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.610> pick<00:01:11.760> something<00:01:11.970> safe

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
so we decided to pick something safe

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.480 
so we decided to pick something safe
that<00:01:12.810> against<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.409> almost<00:01:13.950> against<00:01:14.250> anything

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
that against a almost against anything

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.749 
that against a almost against anything
and<00:01:15.409> when<00:01:16.409> they<00:01:16.500> pick<00:01:16.530> nidalee<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.220> actually

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
and when they pick nidalee I actually

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.490 
and when they pick nidalee I actually
don't<00:01:18.000> like<00:01:18.270> LeBlanc<00:01:18.810> against<00:01:19.140> nidalee

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
don't like LeBlanc against nidalee

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.840 
don't like LeBlanc against nidalee
matchup<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.040> much<00:01:20.220> because<00:01:20.460> it's<00:01:20.729> really

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
matchup that much because it's really

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.460 
matchup that much because it's really
hard<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.299> kill<00:01:21.479> needle<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.900> lane<00:01:22.110> if<00:01:22.320> he's

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
hard to kill needle in lane if he's

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.350 
hard to kill needle in lane if he's
playing<00:01:22.710> properly<00:01:23.250> even<00:01:23.729> if<00:01:23.909> he<00:01:24.030> falls<00:01:24.060> behind

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
playing properly even if he falls behind

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.960 
playing properly even if he falls behind
then<00:01:25.229> he<00:01:25.439> farms<00:01:25.890> more<00:01:26.189> than<00:01:26.369> late<00:01:26.520> lankans

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
then he farms more than late lankans

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.840 
then he farms more than late lankans
getting<00:01:27.330> into<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.930> bit<00:01:28.290> better<00:01:28.409> light<00:01:28.710> game<00:01:28.979> but

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
getting into a bit better light game but

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.670 
getting into a bit better light game but
against<00:01:30.630> their<00:01:30.810> comp<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.140> think<00:01:31.320> LeBlanc<00:01:31.619> was

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
against their comp I think LeBlanc was

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.410 
against their comp I think LeBlanc was
really<00:01:32.009> good<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.460> was<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.790> you

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
really good and that was to you

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.030 
really good and that was to you
certainly<00:01:33.869> had<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> better<00:01:34.290> time<00:01:34.500> with<00:01:34.710> LeBlanc

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
certainly had a better time with LeBlanc

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.920 
certainly had a better time with LeBlanc
against<00:01:35.490> them<00:01:36.060> than<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.390> did<00:01:36.570> against

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
against them than you did against

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.350 
against them than you did against
fanatic<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:38.100> what<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.729> also<00:01:38.790> wanted<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.210> ask

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
fanatic but what I also wanted to ask
