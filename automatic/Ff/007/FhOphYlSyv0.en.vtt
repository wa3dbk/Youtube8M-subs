 little one who is a portable charger 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.160
 is the nokia dc 18 which is really a real one 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.260
 and its own portable battery 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.820

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.829
 nokia device but also nokia

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.010
 This, and a battery 1720

 microusb cipr allows us to recharge 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.080
 precisely our device that can 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.600

 compact has a weight of only 65 grams ha 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.470
 a convenient charge indicator of the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.840
 internal battery that shows us when 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.090
 we need to recharge the battery for 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.280
 recharging it is also given to us 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.799
 equipped this cable that allows us 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.420
 to recharge the battery or via the 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.049

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.720
 wall we can attach it to ours 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.110
 electricity is really the expense 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.350
 very small because it costs only 19 e 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.200
 90 then 19 euros to take home a 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.270
 a really useful contraption from 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.400
 bring in one always with you for 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.810
 when we have to recharge ours 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.729
 device 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.799
 another accessory is this one that is 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.729
 a cover, however, this is an accessory 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.920
 dedicated to the lumia 1020 that's why ce 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.770
 we have it here with us it's a cover 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.800
 wireless charging that enables the 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.200
 that is, charging wirelessly 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.230

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.920
 mount it here it is 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.230
 as you can see it will not change 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.010
 both the thickness goes a little to flatten the 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.930
 difference in height between the camera and 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.030
 the rest of the body 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.530

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.239
 place it on the stand and how 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.850
 you will see here the little icon is lit. 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.850
 my lumia 1020 which is not equipped with 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.010
 this of this particular refill 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.890
 now thanks to the cover it can be 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.510
 recharged quietly via wireless 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.100
 this is the 300 cc excuse cover 30 66 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.560
 so if you are interested in buying 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:15.170

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.250
 important that this portable case 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.760
 really very interesting of the gbl in 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:27.269
 collaboration with nokia which is the jbl 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.090
 playout with NFC technology like us 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.250
 indicates the name itself what it does well 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.609
 obviously if in a case it reproduces 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.410
 music plays music from ours 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:39.810
 device that in this case is not 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.150
 it doesn't have to be an e 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.180
 lumia but can be any 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.040
 device with wireless technology 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:51.390
 going to plug here come 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.620
 paired the two devices in a few 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.459
 seconds in theory 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:00.570
 let's see if it luciano here it is 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.549
 the device we nor is recognized 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.930
 activated pairing and with a 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.729
 acoustic signal 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:12.329
 the gbl share is that it is possible 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:13.530
 let's play music now let's go 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.680
 a test 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:20.669
 let's see if we have a song let's go 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:24.620
 in music and here is that in very few 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.620
 seconds we can activate 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.060
 no 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.940
 apart from the beauty of the song you have 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.250
 really felt a stupendous quality 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.490
 law bl a very important brand e 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.910
 very famous in the sector and these houses 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.100
 I'm really a portent on the website n 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.940
 store can be found at a price 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.710
 special of 99.90 euro cents is 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.450
 an offer 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.990
 ok, an offer for the time of 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.660
 video 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.780
 so if you want go to the site ad 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.360
 buying them is really worth it 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:14.270
 because the sun is really crystal clear at 360 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.950
 degrees and a wireless connection that 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.870
 allows us to listen to music in 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:22.910
 all mobility and we really need it 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:24.440
 just a phone from a phone 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.990
 with NFC technology 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.990
 the battery the battery of the gbl 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:33.920
 1400 battery 30 years liam for now 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.510
 which allows usability in 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.850
 mobility 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.530
 we already have ke we show it 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.560
 we obviously have the possibility then 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.720
 possibly to connect it to the network 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.770
 electrical then then can 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.750
 really become a home stereo 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.910
 like many others, however, with a quality 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.850
 really unbeatable 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:59.270
 finally the last accessory the most one 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.540
 known is the wireless stand stand 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.860
 charging that also in this case with 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:09.080
 I'm going to call again even though we already have 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:11.720
 seen with a lumia device as it can 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.780
 be 920 or other devices via 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.460
 the cover can guarantee recharging 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.040
 wireless and then charging without 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.120
 wires of our phone 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.010
 even in this case I 'm not 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.380
 to dwell so much you know how it works 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:28.040
 above all to know the community that is 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:30.110
 don't have any thread to put 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.530
 then the finger between us and the device 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.180
 in a few seconds we can detach it 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.610
 reattach it from the charge without having to 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.580
 stand each time to hang up unplug 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:43.250
 the cable that is very often annoying 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.200
 very convenient then take it to the office 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.630
 put your phone there that you 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.540
 look, you can really handle the 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.460
 phone without obviously having to 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.550
 so every time really detach 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.980
 practical and useful is a great gift idea 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.050
 you can also find this on the site

 of the cover and on the in-store site is 29 

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:23.390
 euro and 90 so this too is really a 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.340
 a low price for a gift idea really
