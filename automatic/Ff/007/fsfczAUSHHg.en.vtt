00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 Hello my name is Japan and that's what 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.549
 Here are just some more trials 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.529
 frontier so trials played on the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.000
 mobile platform will come for now 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.849
 it does not take a while to get out 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.080
 we could at the ubisoft days or in the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.340
 He ubisoft in paris 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.960
 since ever look at it 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.670
 and I have commander too 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.320
 kriegers channel a video about it 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.119
 uploaded but now here at 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.470
 look through all my backups 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.000
 or the whole thing the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.650
 I still want to work on that is me 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.359
 I liked the hands again 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.980
 also participated in the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.990
 Handy so very amateurish easy 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.070
 just filmed and the colleague of the da 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.960
 he also plays his own 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.170
 youtube-channel that's loud adventure from 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.690
 channel lost planet is called or platinum as 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.790
 suddenly I can always speak wrong 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.980
 Of damn platelets means of course 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.360
 So just platinum means link you will find 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.890
 in the video description so you can 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.539
 so break your tongue 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.160
 The colleague has a bit around us 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.930
 guided or as well as us 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.239
 the hand has taken the whole here 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.520
 played and me just like that 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.500
 I have a little bit of filming 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.320
 yes already in the video commander warrior 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.699
 so my mustard to the actual game 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.930
 left out but here you can still 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.820
 to look a little bit like that 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.350
 Looks like someone else is there 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.549
 he does not play that crazy 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.560
 or a little bit 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.180
 I say tactical strategic 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.010
 or just had something considered 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.170
 it's their turn and they do it the same way 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.700
 looked through a bit and for now 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.170
 watch what is there so that is here 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.939
 for example, a kind of homescreen where 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.830
 where you where you do things so different 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.360
 can stop or 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.530
 then all the missions and yourself 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.270
 so this touch and the whole 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.009
 others win that then stop 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.960
 somehow gets set up then can 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.270
 but what we are all interested in 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.369
 is actually only the actual 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.619
 so here you can see it too 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.509
 quite nice the two sticks 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.430
 So on the bottom left with the two cases 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.049
 So on the left side to 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.420
 inclining forward and rearward and 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.549
 course on the right side to the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.829
 gas and take to the gas so 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.380
 accelerate braking or even 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.119
 drive backwards and here you get 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.829
 very good impression of it like this 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.829
 Control just works and 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.200
 how easy to slash that difficult 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.210
 then it will be after a game 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.020
 or how well it then control 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.850
 I will have with me now 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.830
 Colleagues talked that a bit 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.510
 Hang more mobile gaming in there and 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.470
 That's why I have to agree 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.620
 this game a little bit more 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.640
 I am auditing I played it 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.319
 and I'm very, too 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.819
 unbiased yet unbiased 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.319
 went in and have just now 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.480
 seen that it has crashed again 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.819
 but that is in such an early age 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.290
 stadium of course no rarity 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.060
 such things are here 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.680
 in principle only so ne demo there you have to 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.629
 Do not think and think yourself 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.099
 if it is a singleplayer game that 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.080
 is not a multiplayer where now in principle 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.610
 since any lives depend on it 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.010
 that you definitely come on and 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.620
 carries on but here what I said 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.260
 actually wanted to say it is 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.090
 even if I am now as inexperienced 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.680
 mobile gamer so only once to say yes, the 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.120
 does not look bad and so on 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.680
 and so on but the real one 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.810
 multiplayer experience is not there now 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.440
 because it is a singleplayer that needs to 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.120
 maybe a bit 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.950
 differentiated because of the trials 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.470
 maybe a mini ipad or fan 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.299
 has another tablet or so to speak 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.920
 gamble on his smartphone all the time 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.110
 I want to and can, of course, will 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.849
 are happy that he is here now with trial 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.530
 of animal then soon with the 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.690
 You have the possibility to do so 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.609
 just do not disregard it here 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.019
 Now again this homescreen with the 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.250
 all possibilities this gives here 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.410
 Now you can see them again 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.670
 The card is also really big out 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.889
 So here you can zoom 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.650
 really many tracks you stop then 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.940
 he can play and that's just it 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.109
 a box that should be so sometimes 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.030
 I could appreciate a little bit 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.739
 Imagine that there over time 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.810
 later own tracks to come 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.639
 or even more than we are now 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.349
 in the apron have already seen and 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.730
 Of course here is also partly moderate 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.250
 just keep trying so with it 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.480
 to do their tricks or beats 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.920
 to do that for you of course then 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.959
 also various bonuses then stop later 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.519
 but you have to do that, of course 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.959
 have a bit out so it is 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.370
 not quite as easy as it is here now 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.139
 maybe at first glance 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.880
 could be like here right now 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.380
 the colleague Lothar has seen nicely 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.169
 Venture lays down here once 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.180
 for one all the time for tomorrow 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:01.910
 As you can see it is beautiful 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.250
 not so easy but he knows that 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.169
 gracious trials player of the video 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.359
 Of course, look at it all by itself 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.410
 is not that difficult but needs first 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:11.450
 such a small hand for it 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.889
 get so I'm already now 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.419
 because the video is about to end 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:16.340
 That's just another one 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:17.359
 small addendum to partly frontier 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.780
 been 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.840
 I was just when I was one 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.000
 the whole thing first look who for 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.680
 which course is then there or if 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.939
 to dust it off later cheap 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.039
 and not always again 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:32.330
 little time has to bridge in those 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.530
 I just do not want to communicate 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.330
 just a little bit for me trials 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.490
 go gamble then I would for 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.569
 I will certainly be closer later 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.039
 picking up so much that 's it 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:44.210
 Thank you for this video 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.530
 for watching and see you 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.699
 Of course another video has one 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.919
 a little something good is a chimpanzee 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:55.900
 gamer me there's now facebook 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.900
 google + twitter and tv
