 look like nothing else serves as protection 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.030
 and we also see the various 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.260
 joints that you have for example 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.000

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.780
 the thickest part is the one that goes down 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.060
 next to the base and then to put the 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.560

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:56.039
 sleep 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.640

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.780
 faces we have first what is the 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.780
 hair we take off in this way 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.050
 then we have the face we are going to choose 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.110
 if we want we take this away so 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.610

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.870
 under pressure 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.670
