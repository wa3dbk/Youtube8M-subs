00:00:00.032 --> 00:00:01.050
 How are you? 

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.077
 That's it, nothing special. 

00:00:03.077 --> 00:00:06.051
 It’s his x’s uncomfortable...xxxx to the extreme! 

00:00:06.051 --> 00:00:08.012
 But everyone has this time. 

00:00:08.012 --> 00:00:10.060
 Well, do you know that there is something that most people won't do? 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.040
 They won’t be bowling like this one in the film. 

00:00:16.084 --> 00:00:20.045
 This guy is great, obviously he is participating in the qualifiers of the US team. 

00:00:20.045 --> 00:00:23.086
 Even if he failed, it was still very strong, and the bottle was still down! 

00:00:32.021 --> 00:00:34.076
 This video has 600,000 viewers in a week. 

00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:36.016
 I think you should like it too. 

00:00:36.016 --> 00:00:40.021
 This guy is great, he goes to the front and knocks down the opponent's bottle, just like saying 

00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:41.007
 "Don't mess with me... 

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:43.035
 Otherwise, I will knock down the bottle like this!!" 

00:00:43.035 --> 00:00:46.060
 But I guess one of his fingers might have stuck in the ball. 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.027
 So the ball will slide out like this uncontrollably 

00:00:49.044 --> 00:00:52.066
 He also made a fist gesture to celebrate his hitting. 

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.098
 It’s like he’s deliberately going to lose the ball like this. 

00:00:53.098 --> 00:00:55.088
 Wow, yeah! 

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:58.001
 Well, I don't know, but he did help to add this film to the point. 

00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:00.057
 And to be honest, I also play bowling like this. 

00:01:00.057 --> 00:01:02.025
 But I am playing like a drunkard. 

00:01:02.025 --> 00:01:06.050
 I really like watching the types of movies I have never seen before. 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.018
 Yesterday, a viewer friend sent me a video like this. 

00:01:08.018 --> 00:01:09.082
 This video was uploaded to YouTube a year ago. 

00:01:09.082 --> 00:01:13.083
 However, this film became popular after it was poured into 1.3 million people in the past 2 days. 

00:01:13.083 --> 00:01:14.067
 God! 

00:01:14.067 --> 00:01:17.073
 The woman in the film is very clear about what happened in the film. 

00:01:17.073 --> 00:01:19.008
 what are you doing? 

00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:21.059
 I boiled the water in the kettle. 

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:24.006
 So this is hot water, now I pour it here. 

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:27.012
 Then I sprinkle it into the air and it will evaporate 

00:01:27.012 --> 00:01:28.094
 Ready? 

00:01:28.094 --> 00:01:32.045
 It's now! 

00:01:32.045 --> 00:01:34.051
 amazing 

00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:39.027
 Usually if the weather is warm, the water should fall on the snow, but... 

00:01:39.027 --> 00:01:41.095
 Um.. This is really great, right? 

00:01:41.095 --> 00:01:44.005
 I guess this film was taken in the northwestern part of Canada. 

00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:47.020
 It’s where the caribou runs around and there are no French, I guess 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.073
 In short, I am not sure why I want to ask this question. 

00:01:49.073 --> 00:01:52.017
 But have you seen the modern version of the witchcraft show? 

00:01:52.017 --> 00:01:53.088
 I can't believe it is true. 

00:01:53.088 --> 00:01:56.008
 This kind of thing should happen only in a cold place. 

00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:58.069
 The temperature there must be colder than the heart of the woman. 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.016
 God, it’s so cold. 

00:02:00.016 --> 00:02:02.043
 It’s so cold that you have to put things in the refrigerator and heat them up. 

00:02:02.043 --> 00:02:06.064
 It’s too cold, it’s cold to the fire station and I recommend everyone to arson at home. 

00:02:06.064 --> 00:02:09.042
 It's quite cold there, um.. this is the point 

00:02:09.042 --> 00:02:11.003
 It is not ordinary cold there. 

00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:13.093
 And she used this method to make more snow. 

00:02:13.093 --> 00:02:17.021
 As can be seen from her behavior, they should really want more snow. 

00:02:17.021 --> 00:02:18.063
 Look, how interesting it is. 

00:02:18.063 --> 00:02:20.099
 I often wonder, what kind of entertainment do these Canadians usually do? 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.037
 Finally, the film that I want to introduce to everyone should be very popular, but it doesn’t 

00:02:25.037 --> 00:02:27.087
 I think it's really funny, but you also know 

00:02:27.087 --> 00:02:28.064
 What am I supposed to be? 

00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:30.051
 So far, this film has only 400,000 viewers. 

00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:33.067
 The content is about the "Attack of the Show" program, I think it is on the ESPN channel. 

00:02:33.067 --> 00:02:35.053
 This is the NBA game scene. 

00:02:35.053 --> 00:02:39.000
 Now pay attention to the jazz of the Utah Jazz - Jazz Bear 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.014
 Disputed with fans of the Cleveland Cavaliers 

00:02:42.014 --> 00:02:44.072
 This is fake! Because the Cleveland Cavaliers have no fans at all. 

00:02:44.072 --> 00:02:46.026
 Calm down! Ugly 

00:02:46.026 --> 00:02:48.009
 Wow, I haven’t heard from you for a while. Yeah, ugly 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:49.033
 Screw you 

00:02:49.033 --> 00:02:50.065
 OK OK 

00:02:50.065 --> 00:02:54.038
 Anyway, I think the guards should escort this guy out. 

00:02:54.038 --> 00:02:56.038
 Then the mascot continues to provoke him. 

00:03:09.067 --> 00:03:13.043
 This film is funny when he was knocked down by a huge teddy bear. 

00:03:13.043 --> 00:03:16.025
 I usually don't comment on the movies that humans fight, but 

00:03:16.025 --> 00:03:19.083
 First, they are not really fighting. At most, there is a guy whose butt is knocked over. 

00:03:19.083 --> 00:03:22.042
 Second, if you must judge the film, 

00:03:22.042 --> 00:03:23.088
 I will say that this film is fake. 

00:03:23.088 --> 00:03:27.074
 Because I think this Utah Jazz was deliberately arranged to sizzle the atmosphere. 

00:03:27.074 --> 00:03:32.000
 After all, that guy is too easy to break free of guards. 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.059
 And the guy wearing a 40-pound bear costume has even won. 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:39.097
 I don't know, but in real life, things usually don't develop like this. 

00:03:39.097 --> 00:03:44.031
 His actions started like a crane, but in the end it was like a karate kid. 

00:03:44.031 --> 00:03:46.090
 Um... so I dare say that this film should be fake. 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.074
 I don’t know if the guy who filmed is also informed and involved. 

00:03:49.074 --> 00:03:53.035
 But he did not shoot very well with his iPhone. 

00:03:53.035 --> 00:03:54.088
 I mean the guy who is photography. 

00:03:54.088 --> 00:03:58.036
 You just took this perfect situation in a perfect angle, I really doubt it... 

00:03:58.036 --> 00:04:00.009
 Um.. This is probably a conspiracy. 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:01.093
 People from the entire stadium may be involved 

00:04:01.093 --> 00:04:02.097
 And I think again 

00:04:02.097 --> 00:04:06.030
 This bear is likely to also assist in planning the moon landing for fraud. 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.028
 In fact, I dare say that all Canadians are also involved in the fraud. 

00:04:09.028 --> 00:04:11.006
 But do you know who might not be involved? 

00:04:11.006 --> 00:04:13.073
 The audience asked today is called -- 

00:04:13.073 --> 00:04:14.057
 They asked... 

00:04:14.057 --> 00:04:15.057
 Hey everyone 

00:04:15.057 --> 00:04:17.075
 Our problem today is 

00:04:17.075 --> 00:04:20.022
 What exactly is hidden in Lady Gaga's pants? 

00:04:20.022 --> 00:04:24.068
 Ok, there are five naked guys asking this question today. 

00:04:24.068 --> 00:04:26.040
 well 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.058
 So, what is hidden in Lady Gaga's pants? 

00:04:29.058 --> 00:04:32.084
 Leave your interesting or creative answers in the comments section below 

00:04:32.084 --> 00:04:34.052
 Or leave a message on Facebook or Twitter. 

00:04:34.052 --> 00:04:36.046
 Thank you for watching today's show. 

00:04:36.046 --> 00:04:38.072
 The above message was provided by Ray William Johnson 

00:04:38.072 --> 00:04:39.080
 So everyone, tell me. 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.023
 What is your taste? 

00:04:41.023 --> 00:04:46.048
 (This is personal privacy) (snozberries of the chocolate factory) (to ask the zombie who bites me) (dismembered mint) (repent and shame) 

00:04:48.048 --> 00:04:53.033
