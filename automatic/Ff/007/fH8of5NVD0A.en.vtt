00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:04.759
 his statements in a small setback 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.799
 investors initially knew 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:10.729
 really in a fake 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:14.219
 it's always a shame because you can go the fact 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.390
 has the statistic 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.869
 he expects it 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.359
 can work here 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.899
 also working on it was all wrong, however, it is a crushing afp 

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:26.369
 ebb 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.000
 he is going to enter into a collaboration and yes you get it 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.780
 they are standing he goes to the hospital 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.530
 then knowing that by e-mail, he still scored extra money 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.070
 end of February 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.560
 but I think I am always open 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.680
 then I go back to my body removed from the water 7 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.870
 but that's it then 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.870
 there is 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.020
 waste of money 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.230
 the number of incidents 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.190
 to be after 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.190
 the Hague 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.910
 we're really here 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.440
 9 but I think we don't 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.530
 that is 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.860
 we have each other 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.830
 in st i just have to wait 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.480
 it is all true 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.740
 I see the same recipe 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.050
 7 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.050
 during my studies 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.940
 with that name 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.210
