bucks<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.550> way<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.210> Amazon<00:00:51.539> stuff<00:00:51.870> does

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
bucks that way and so Amazon stuff does

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.660 
bucks that way and so Amazon stuff does
move<00:00:52.260> pretty<00:00:52.440> quickly<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.070> two<00:00:53.219> months<00:00:53.550> you
