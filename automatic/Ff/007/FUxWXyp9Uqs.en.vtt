00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
that's correct I got 3 percent fat 3

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.470 
that's correct I got 3 percent fat 3
percent<00:00:59.280> which<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.489> only<00:00:59.699> one<00:00:59.879> tablespoon<00:01:00.359> of

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
percent which is only one tablespoon of

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.139 
percent which is only one tablespoon of
oil<00:01:00.600> mmm<00:01:01.260> that's<00:01:02.219> correct

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
oil mmm that's correct

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.729 
oil mmm that's correct
ok<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.840> don't<00:01:03.870> have<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.170> pre-soak<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
ok so you don't have to pre-soak the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.859 
ok so you don't have to pre-soak the
chips<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.369> them<00:01:05.549> no<00:01:05.760> pre-soaking<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
chips on them no pre-soaking and the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.170 
chips on them no pre-soaking and the
fact<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.470> works<00:01:07.830> with<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.070> paddle<00:01:08.520> rotating

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
fact is it works with a paddle rotating

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.910 
fact is it works with a paddle rotating
around<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.720> don't<00:01:09.960> need<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.229> take<00:01:10.439> out<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
around so you don't need to take out the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.190 
around so you don't need to take out the
bowl<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.369> give<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.760> shape<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.720> therefore<00:01:13.110> it

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
bowl to give it a shape so therefore it

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.630 
bowl to give it a shape so therefore it
doesn't<00:01:13.229> allow<00:01:13.799> things<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.159> stick<00:01:14.460> together

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
doesn't allow things to stick together

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.910 
doesn't allow things to stick together
and<00:01:15.060> you've<00:01:15.360> got<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.630> clear<00:01:15.990> lid<00:01:16.619> which

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
and you've got the clear lid which

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.679 
and you've got the clear lid which
allows<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.549> view<00:01:17.759> what<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.060> are<00:01:18.299> cooking

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
allows you to view what you are cooking

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.300 
allows you to view what you are cooking
and<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.170> makes<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.470> easy<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.830> see<00:01:20.009> what<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.220> can

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
and it makes it easy to see what you can

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.160 
and it makes it easy to see what you can
test<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.670> well<00:01:20.820> let's<00:01:21.000> say<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.840> piece<00:01:22.020> of

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
test it well let's say the the piece of

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:55.410 
test it well let's say the the piece of
equipment<00:01:22.310> doing<00:01:23.310> its<00:01:23.430> thing

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.240 

so<00:01:56.420> as<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:56.780> can<00:01:56.869> see<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:57.229> Actifry<00:01:57.649> Express

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
so as you can see the Actifry Express

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.859 
so as you can see the Actifry Express
has<00:01:58.430> a<00:01:58.460> lot<00:01:58.670> more<00:01:58.700> than<00:01:58.969> just<00:01:59.000> cook<00:01:59.420> chips<00:01:59.689> then

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
has a lot more than just cook chips then

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.779 
has a lot more than just cook chips then
doesn't<00:02:00.140> it<00:02:00.229> that's<00:02:00.680> correct<00:02:01.009> your<00:02:01.340> no<00:02:01.520> and

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
doesn't it that's correct your no and

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.310 
doesn't it that's correct your no and
the<00:02:01.969> thing<00:02:02.000> is<00:02:02.329> it's<00:02:02.509> something<00:02:02.869> that<00:02:03.020> I<00:02:03.049> have

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
the thing is it's something that I have

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.289
