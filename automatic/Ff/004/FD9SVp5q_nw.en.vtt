00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 all right 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.880
 hello welcome once again to the drawing 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.129
 online today we are going to review 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.120
 the male profile figure already 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:16.340
 we review a basic profile figure and 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.680
 we already reviewed the basic profile figure 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.759
 female so if you want to not have 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.399
 problems with this figure you 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:24.290
 we recommend having reviewed the videos 

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:25.640
 previous this video served much 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.800
 for 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.560
 reaffirm those previously seen or for 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.750
 practice a little bit well as usual 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.340
 we make a line of proportion the 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.960
 we divide this half in half 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.329
 belonged to the legs of this half 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.399
 belong to the body including the 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.820
 head we draw a pretty circle 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:46.910
 small let's say something like a fourth 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.440
 part of this line and we add this 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.050
 small corner that will be the chin 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.129
 of the head very well as we had 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.829
 said earlier the ellipses with the 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.960
 that we draw the body are ellipses 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.539
 that they have in the case of the body this 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.720
 direction and in the case of the pelvic area 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:09.050
 this direction are opposed ellipses 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.050
 where the body generates more or less 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.780
 this curve in the front part and this 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.830
 curve in the back it gets 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.080
 the figure the look much more 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.590
 aesthetics with more movement more 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.149
 credible well let's do it we said that 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.490
 these these ellipses have to be 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.500
 within the proportion line the 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.390
 only difference in terms of the figure 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.860
 of the woman is that in this case 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.900
 the ellipse for the body we can 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.170
 draw bigger than in the case of the 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.170
 woman 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.350
 very well and in this case the pelvic box 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.390
 it's smaller and also the boxes 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.229
 public pelvic boxes both the 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.229
 rib cage are 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.390
 a little wider than in the case of the 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.900
 woman 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.760
 as you can notice well also 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.040
 we draw the neck almost straight inside 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.290
 the center line of proportion 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.300
 just as we had done in the 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.080
 Previous cases of more or less profile 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.330
 in the middle of the line we draw the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.060
 part below the knee is to say the 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.620
 knee will be up here and like 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.680
 that in the case of the woman from within 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:24.409
 this ellipse we will draw the leg 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:30.219
 we said that this line is straight is 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:30.219
 slightly curved and now this is curved 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.280
 and this is straight the line of the shin 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.500
 very well we draw the sole of the foot the 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.090
 tip of the sole of the foot more or less 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.049
 must correspond with the part of 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.049
 different from the body 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.190
 and we said that the blockades are by 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.060
 below the center line so 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.060
 We can do this 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:09.560
 we will also draw now the arms the 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.180
 which are thinning according to 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.250
 come to the wrists now in the case 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.859
 of man we will draw the arms more 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.859
 thicker than in the case of women 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.450
 and the dolls well now we will talk about 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:26.000
 a few things that not of which 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.700
 we do not talk before we can draw 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.150
 under the neck the union of 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.739
 clavicles this small bump 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.739
 then we draw the chest 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:42.100
 something like that and this is chemistry that we draw 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.600
 next here is where the 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.750
 rib cage 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.940
 this is the rib cage of all this 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.880
 we will detail when we talk about anatomy 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.610
 the soon only is a comment 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:58.240
 this rib cage has a hole here and 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:03.600
 this little dot is this point that stands out 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.600
 here after makes a hole 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.620
 the hollow of the belly 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:19.430
 well in a general way this is the figure 

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:22.160
 male profile as we discussed to 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.009
 difference from the female figure of the 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.449
 rib cage we can look for the most 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:29.120
 large than in the case of the figure 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:31.729
 feminine and we can draw wider 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.160
 the ellipses also the legs the arm 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.039
 in general these are the simple ones 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.199
 differences that we can find in 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:42.530
 both figures only we have left 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:45.410
 Detail and draw a picture so you can see 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.710
 what can be done with this 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.710
 Sketch 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.540
 and with the 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.490
 today's class remember that of the 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.170
 details we will be talking little by little 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.510
 the only important thing today was 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:21.360
 review the form only the form 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.630
 basic of this profile figure and up 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.630
 the next
