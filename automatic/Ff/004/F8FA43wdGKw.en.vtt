 Producer of shows, and my troupe of vegetables, 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.600
 That I cast in a tank, between a bud and a bulb, 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.100
 I picked my salad in a supermarket, 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.800
 but I am made carrot, it grows in sachet. 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.300
 Me and my bunch of reason, I do not think about it, 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.800
 To see bagged grow knowing you know, 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.100
 That I was born in greenhouses without worries, Ready of an artichoke heart, Who told me: 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.400
 "the nettle sticks, 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.800

 Growing turnips, yes I know it's sad, 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.400
 To taste in the press, the good juice of critics, 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.000
 Disgusts me and hurts me, it's good there, I think I'm abdicating, 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.400
 Finally let's stay carbohydrate, concentrate, consenting, 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.000
 I prefer the sun to the neon of nothingness, 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.500
 I go back to my country, near my artichoke heart, 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.400
