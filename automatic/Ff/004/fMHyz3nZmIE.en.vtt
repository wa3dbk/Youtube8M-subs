00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.239
 Puls can be used in peace of mind 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.280
 too happy for the referee 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.769
 has seen a foul on the keeper here 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.210

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.219
 a supposed offside position of 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.939
 is light gives Frauenstein can 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.799

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.049
 ice cold remains in front of the gate and that 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.049
 regular 1 0 for the jfv can achieve 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.789
 Fulda is safe behind and leaves 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.680
 do not burn anything and give up 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.520
 Increases good opportunities higher 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.380
 ball in the middle 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.670
 four blue ones against three white ones 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.500
 opposing penalty area 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.479
 delgado sancho and rolex look 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.439
 comfortable and no one can do the ball 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.119
 clarify decisively 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.159
 Puls stands alone on the mother 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.679
 elfmeter point and can rest in all a 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.770
 nod the decision that 2 0 for the 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.770
 house men 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.409
 last minute free kick from good 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.240
 position times for women's stone rossel 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.360
 Come on and bring the shot on goal 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.670
 but robin drastic consequently no problem 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.590
 for fulda and that is for the jfv 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.120
 reach for three after played 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.750
 minutes if the referee the 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.459
 partie 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.740
 the women's stone continues into the crisis 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.140
 but crashes for the jfv important three 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.860
 points brings us at the microphone atilla 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.900
 give as important victory 2 0 in the end 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.540
 first half time defensively good and 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.920
 then we have that too , that comes good 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.570
 we did not have allowed 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.120
 maybe sv have to do it 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.980
 After all, like the gate then 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.840
 the spell is broken and 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.370
 what I have to reproach my team 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.959
 is just the chance rating than had 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.620
 here too 56 0 can go out in the 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.140
 second half time 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.480
 and that's a pity, but still 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.540
 Regardless of the team as she has 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.739
 deserved this victory and that was 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.280
 important that we have three points again 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.280
