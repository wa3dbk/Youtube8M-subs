00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.120 
they're not Apple but you might or just
experiment<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.079> got<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.200> pod<00:02:01.530> iPhone

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
experiment so you got I pod iPhone

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.240 
experiment so you got I pod iPhone
iPhone<00:02:02.460> 4<00:02:03.119> iPad<00:02:03.630> Apple<00:02:03.930> TV<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.770> then<00:02:04.920> normal

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
iPhone 4 iPad Apple TV and then normal

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.010 
iPhone 4 iPad Apple TV and then normal
and<00:02:05.340> high<00:02:05.430> profiles<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.240> normal<00:02:06.899> things

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
and high profiles just normal things

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.839 
and high profiles just normal things
like<00:02:07.200> mp4<00:02:08.420> mp4<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.660> then<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:11.129> can<00:02:11.340> change<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
like mp4 mp4 and then you can change the

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.760 
like mp4 mp4 and then you can change the
container<00:02:12.330> which<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:12.629> just<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.080> file<00:02:13.260> format

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
container which is just the file format

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.680 
container which is just the file format
you<00:02:14.010> choose<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.280> large<00:02:14.580> file<00:02:14.820> size<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.450> keep

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
you choose a large file size to keep

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.710 
you choose a large file size to keep
this<00:02:16.400> at<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.580> highest<00:02:17.760> quality<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:18.540> if<00:02:18.630> you

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
this at the highest quality so if you

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.660 
this at the highest quality so if you
want<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.870> put<00:02:19.020> on<00:02:19.140> TV<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.220> course<00:02:20.280> choose

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
want to put on TV and of course choose

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.550 
want to put on TV and of course choose
web<00:02:20.910> optimized<00:02:21.450> which<00:02:21.780> will<00:02:22.050> make<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.380> file

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
web optimized which will make the file

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.410 
web optimized which will make the file
smaller<00:02:22.800> but<00:02:23.400> still<00:02:23.550> at<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.850> highest<00:02:24.030> quality

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
smaller but still at the highest quality

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.730 
smaller but still at the highest quality
it<00:02:24.780> can<00:02:24.840> do<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.320> then<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:26.280> size<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.930> the

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
it can do and then the size and the the

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.890 
it can do and then the size and the the
word<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.130> can't<00:02:29.400> read<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.880> they<00:02:30.270> can<00:02:30.510> choose<00:02:30.750> to

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
word I can't read and they can choose to

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.270 
word I can't read and they can choose to
crop<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.350> so<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.590> got<00:02:31.710> any<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.040> right

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
crop it so you got any of the right

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.400 
crop it so you got any of the right
amount<00:02:32.490> pixels<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.090> then<00:02:33.660> if<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.260> have

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
amount pixels and then if you have

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.870 
amount pixels and then if you have
multiple<00:02:34.800> things<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:35.130> can<00:02:35.280> just<00:02:35.490> click<00:02:35.700> Add

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
multiple things you can just click Add

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.360 
multiple things you can just click Add
to<00:02:35.910> queue<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.480> add<00:02:37.170> more<00:02:37.830> than<00:02:37.860> one<00:02:38.070> thing

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
to queue and add more than one thing

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.010 
to queue and add more than one thing
just<00:02:38.610> keep<00:02:38.790> clicking<00:02:38.970> sources<00:02:39.630> I'll<00:02:39.810> have<00:02:39.990> a

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
just keep clicking sources I'll have a

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.420 
just keep clicking sources I'll have a
bunch<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.350> queue<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:40.680> can<00:02:40.800> show<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.160> queue

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
bunch of queue you can show the queue

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.640 
bunch of queue you can show the queue
and<00:02:41.610> then<00:02:42.150> it'll<00:02:42.390> do<00:02:42.660> all<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.050> at<00:02:43.260> once<00:02:43.410> and

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
and then it'll do all that at once and

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.220 
and then it'll do all that at once and
then<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:44.160> can<00:02:44.580> show<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.210> preview<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.110> video

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
then you can show a preview of the video

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.620 
then you can show a preview of the video
and<00:02:46.590> then<00:02:46.800> when<00:02:46.920> you're<00:02:47.040> done<00:02:47.160> ready<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.210> start

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
and then when you're done ready to start

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.600 
and then when you're done ready to start
just<00:02:48.990> click<00:02:49.290> start<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.830> then<00:02:49.890> I'll<00:02:50.310> be<00:02:50.430> back

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
just click start and then I'll be back

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.610 
just click start and then I'll be back
when<00:02:50.760> it's<00:02:50.910> done<00:02:51.060> okay<00:02:51.600> as<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:51.990> can<00:02:52.080> see<00:02:52.320> it

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
when it's done okay as you can see it

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.300 
when it's done okay as you can see it
translated<00:02:53.490> it<00:02:53.760> into<00:02:53.880> a<00:02:54.350> m4v<00:02:55.350> file<00:02:55.980> which<00:02:56.160> is

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
translated it into a m4v file which is

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.740 
translated it into a m4v file which is
in<00:02:56.460> mp4<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.210> the<00:02:57.690> size<00:02:57.990> has<00:02:58.590> stayed<00:02:59.510> the<00:03:00.510> file

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
in mp4 and the size has stayed the file

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.630 
in mp4 and the size has stayed the file
size<00:03:01.020> is<00:03:01.260> actually<00:03:01.440> increased<00:03:02.160> but<00:03:02.400> it's<00:03:02.550> a

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
size is actually increased but it's a

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.460 
size is actually increased but it's a
higher<00:03:02.790> quality<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.990> know<00:03:04.140> different

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
higher quality and you know different

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.180 
higher quality and you know different
formats<00:03:04.980> different<00:03:05.990> file<00:03:06.990> sizes<00:03:07.320> so<00:03:07.680> my

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
formats different file sizes so my

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.070 
formats different file sizes so my
largest<00:03:08.490> experiment<00:03:09.270> with<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.480> file<00:03:09.660> size<00:03:09.900> is

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
largest experiment with the file size is

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.410 
largest experiment with the file size is
to<00:03:10.230> get<00:03:10.350> smaller<00:03:10.650> or<00:03:10.770> bigger<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.310> so<00:03:12.090> this<00:03:12.240> is

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
to get smaller or bigger and so this is

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.960 
to get smaller or bigger and so this is
just<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.780> sort<00:03:12.960> of<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.200> basic<00:03:13.640> tutorials<00:03:14.640> on

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
just the sort of a basic tutorials on

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.880 
just the sort of a basic tutorials on
handbrake<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.480> I'll<00:03:15.810> get<00:03:16.050> more<00:03:16.200> advanced<00:03:16.620> as

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
handbrake and I'll get more advanced as

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.860
