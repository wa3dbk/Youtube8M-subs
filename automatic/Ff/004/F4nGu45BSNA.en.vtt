00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
me many times but it looks like it's

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.060

working pretty well now

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.250

so<00:04:27.410> just<00:04:29.120> not<00:04:30.120> really<00:04:30.450> actually<00:04:30.660> sure<00:04:31.050> what

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
so just not really actually sure what

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.100 
so just not really actually sure what
this<00:04:31.410> button<00:04:31.680> does<00:04:33.140> but<00:04:35.060> if<00:04:36.060> it<00:04:36.570> shows<00:04:36.810> a<00:04:36.840> map

this button does but if it shows a map
and<00:04:37.350> I<00:04:37.500> think<00:04:37.890> it's<00:04:38.070> intended<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:39.030> show<00:04:39.780> you

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
and I think it's intended to show you

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.640 
and I think it's intended to show you
the<00:04:40.440> placement<00:04:40.950> of<00:04:41.040> a<00:04:41.190> certain<00:04:42.440> tweet<00:04:43.440> or
