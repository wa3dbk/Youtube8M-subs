00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 That was 2 beta battlefield hardline 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.770
 which took place as early as several 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.410
 months after originally 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.509
 scheduled release of the game what for 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.450
 rc electronics is rather strange but 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.520
 just exactly right for 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.010
 most players the second stage 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.920
 testing was supposed to be decisive and 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.500
 finally answer the question whether 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.510
 take the game and in the next few minutes 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.840
 I will tell you about her in all 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.840
 details 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.750
 for those who are sitting in front of the monitor now 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.510
 foil hats battlefield hardline 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.360
 it's the coolest modern spin-off 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.000
 multiplayer military shooter who 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.700
 created by forces in the studio visceral games 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.070
 sponsored by the dead space of and the finest 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.619
 dante inferno it would seem that these guys 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.610
 there can be no idea how to 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.890
 do battle 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.170
 but still when you play online 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.780
 it becomes clear that the game is perfect 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:21.060
 just created under steadfast 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:23.160
 father's attention in the days studio series 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.530
 in the eyes of the gaming community this game 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.740
 looks like anything but not like that 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.270
 what it really is the most 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.550
 widespread criticism aside 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.610
 hardline and this is what he is 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.940
 addon vp-4 which stands as a whole 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.670
 a game 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.789
 but let's get everything in order than they are 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.890
 similar engine from bf4 was moved to 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.530
 online virtually unchanged 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.299
 the graphics remained exactly the same but due to 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.150
 scale down actions on screen 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.670
 There is much less lawlessness than in 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.520
 last game but thanks to it grew 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.040
 level detail if in 4 inside 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.909
 the buildings were bare walls here everything is like 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.950
 should have been done a long time ago 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.590
 what they do not like yes to almost everyone 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.899
 the rest as for shooting at everything 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.700
 weapons recoil increased but with it 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.950
 accuracy is thereby for the player 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.130
 the direction of the bullets has become much more 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.959
 obvious than it was in the last game 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.360
 character's movement speed has increased 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.519
 made the fights more dynamic plus to 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.769
 this in the game added tracks for which 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.570
 you can move the plane on the plane 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.000
 ecliptic with which you can 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.860
 climb the buildings what it did 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.140
 the game is much more dynamic and gave 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.310
 the opportunity for everyone to be worn on the level of us 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.310
 new speed feeds 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.870
 the main theme of this game is 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.519
 confrontation of cops and gangsters from it 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.190
 the main plus follows 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.680
 and for you to make a purchase is new 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.379
 modes 1 and already familiar to us mode 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.360
 last beta is a robbery where bandits 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.459
 need to steal money from a certain 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.890
 points and deliver them to a safe place 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.049
 although in the case of the card the bank is not quite 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.239
 safe and because this is a helicopter well 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.830
 trenches accordingly justify their 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.349
 salary and prevent theft 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.900
 cash from legal 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.569
 institutions and no matter what they can 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.200
 this destroy the floor area 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.780
 the duration of such a match 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.360
 is usually about ten minutes to ten 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.690
 minutes of action packed to the blood from 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.690
 ears 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.690
 second mode hijacking completely idiotic 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.610
 sounds in words on the map there are several 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.709
 points that need to be captured 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.780
 but is not inside the car then 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.000
 there is to capture the point you need to hijack 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.400
 car and keep constantly on 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.980
 him high speed this way 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.930
 the map moves several cars for 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.209
 chases them a few machines and 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.220
 pedestrians ambush them 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.470
 but despite the theory in gameplay 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.840
 the plan of this turns out incredibly 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.280
 saturated action 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.050
 saturation is a word that is generally in 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.880
 principle characterizes online 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.070
 it becomes clear when you come in 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.080
 standard capture mode which is here 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.920
 felt like a collection of people with disabilities 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.169
 activists 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.690
 in addition, the game will be present 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.850
 blood money mode where two teams 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.850
 From the middle of the card you need to fill your 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.430
 pockets in dead presidents and drag 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.100
 to force the base or steal them right from 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.950
 enemy base is also known about the mode 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.780
 hostage sort of analog 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.610
 counter-strike where there is no possibility 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.280
 respawna only now who needs it 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.650
 not clear when in 10 minutes in a robbery 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.720
 you get fun in the sea and fun 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.570
 here you will be half the time 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.610
 idle but apparently this 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.450
 the mode is intended for clan war of and 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.340
 eSports fans 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:56.039
 summing up I will say that I personally still 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.320
 I decided to buy a game of Asian lunch and much 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.780
 hesitated of course considering the new prices 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.970
 on games especially console worth 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.250
 think more than once but it seems to me 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.200
 great battlefield substitute more 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.070
 just under the gameplay reminiscent of bad 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.740
 company 2 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.169
 about the same scale is also a bit 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.270
 technology and based on all this I think 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.700
 pass the time for the next shooter 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.530
 days you can be with you teams channel 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.360
 subscribe to the channel for everyone to be 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.360
 good and all bye
