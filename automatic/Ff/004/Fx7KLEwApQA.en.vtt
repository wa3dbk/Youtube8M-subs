00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.120
 Khayat and I share your life 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:12.480
 of kingston and a computer assembled 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.480
 one 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:31.419
 a hard disk solid state 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:31.419
 hundreds of lives memories and ex 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.500
 very well 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:50.110
 is running the crisis game is a 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:53.400
 screen 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.780
 death to their 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.590
 it's time 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.590
 and 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.520
 the credit watching a ring and right now 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.570
 we'll see 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.460
 inside 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.140
 it has 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.180
 but such when I study feeling the 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.130
 specifications of one that does not want 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.130
 have 17 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:21.049
 with memories they have video card of 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:23.469
 the successor brand narrated a game so 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.469
 it's okay 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.950
 the solid state hard disk 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.020
 cooling with water allows to distribute 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.680
 never to be able to say that he always 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:53.830
 find why yes 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:53.830
 but especially all want to have 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.060
 it was little by little with everything 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.060
 why not
