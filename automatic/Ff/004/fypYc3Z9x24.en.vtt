 You learn how to make this German pie 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.820
 mass will require two 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:20.600
 cans of cream 4 gems 250 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.230
 grams of salty marina 250 grams of 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.100
 sugar and a pack of crackers 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.410
 to the roof 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.230
 You'll need 8 tablespoons 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.810
 chopped a tablespoon of 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.380
 margarine two tablespoons of 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.460
 chocolate 50% cocoa two tablespoons 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.930
 sugar soup and two cups milk 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.780
 before you start making pie 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.740
 does not even give a hint as to cream 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.690
 of milk 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.420
 one day before starting to make the pie 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.420
 you get the two cans of sour cream 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.460
 or in the refrigerator to leave it very cold and 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.570
 It is easier to separate the gold 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.430
 of the cream 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.450
 here in this recipe to use the cream of 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.400
 milk and the gold closed is reserved for 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:10.100
 start making pie then we 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:12.800
 will mix 250 grams of butter 4 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:22.640
 Egg yolks and sugar hit everything in the 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:25.010
 beaters beat those three ingredients 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.000
 in the mixer, leave the dough well 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.730
 homogeneous 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.790
 Yes, you will. 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.790
 milk 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.010
 So the premier is ready, I 'm going to the 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.170
 Mount the dish where we had the bosch 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:48.080
 I'm going to put it in the bottom and 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:50.390
 with the first stage mounted on the 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.310
 catches the cream of the cream and a 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.470
 gourmet brush 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.230
 take a look at what it takes if 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.800
 rubbers and then think of the people 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.250
 half of the pie crust and put on the 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.250
 cookies 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.169
 in a riding note 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:22.160
 in this first step it goes to the 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:24.740
 freezer or freezer is the ideal 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:30.070
 cap the pie with foil a 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.070
 classic movie hands and notary 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.639
 so while the class was freezing 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.500
 We'll team up with the coverage 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.380
 which is based on chocolate 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:47.450
 we have here a tablespoon of 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:51.290
 margarine two cups milk two 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:57.320
 spoons of sugar 8 tablespoons 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:05:01.389
 chocolate powder the normal of the south they of 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.389
 whip in khost 50% cocoa 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:14.599
 so here we have a German pie 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:19.370
 I I had already done one day 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:22.240
 before the high freezing cold not okay 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:33.740
 I'll put the cover still warm 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:36.650
 it is frozen only after it has spread 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:40.810
 cover over the snake pie again 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.810
 foil and back by a player 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:49.969
 the next day she is ready to slap 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.819
 the ideal which is the following I am focused 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:54.680
 in a freezer that made it is usually more 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:06:01.250
 ice cream freezer 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:02.360

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.460

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.189
 sour cream in the refrigerator one day 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.589
 to separate the serum is not 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:24.169
 beat the cream on the mixer and 

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:30.560
 take a few minutes before the freezer 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:33.770
