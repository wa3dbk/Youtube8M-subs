that<00:00:13.430> I<00:00:13.580> derp<00:00:13.940> pretty<00:00:14.330> hard<00:00:14.800> quite<00:00:15.800> an<00:00:15.950> anti

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
that I derp pretty hard quite an anti

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.179 
that I derp pretty hard quite an anti
climatic<00:00:16.699> ending<00:00:17.050> but<00:00:18.050> not<00:00:18.289> to<00:00:18.410> worry<00:00:18.439> the

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
climatic ending but not to worry the

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.009 
climatic ending but not to worry the
rest<00:00:19.519> of<00:00:19.699> the<00:00:19.789> games<00:00:19.999> will<00:00:20.269> probably<00:00:20.839> be

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:21.019 
rest of the games will probably be

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.579 
rest of the games will probably be
anticlimactic<00:00:21.289> as<00:00:22.099> well<00:00:22.429> cough<00:00:23.089> cough

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:23.589 
anticlimactic as well cough cough

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:27.489

anyways<00:00:24.589> so<00:00:25.400> now<00:00:25.669> dark<00:00:25.939> atomic<00:00:26.539> is<00:00:26.720> leading<00:00:27.140> 3

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:27.499 
anyways so now dark atomic is leading 3

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.130 
anyways so now dark atomic is leading 3
to<00:00:27.529> 2<00:00:27.890> and<00:00:28.159> he<00:00:28.609> is<00:00:28.699> one<00:00:28.970> win<00:00:28.999> away<00:00:29.300> from<00:00:29.509> taking

this match was played a really really

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.510 
this match was played a really really
really<00:00:35.180> really<00:00:35.390> long<00:00:35.960> time<00:00:36.289> ago<00:00:36.649> and<00:00:36.859> you<00:00:37.280> guys

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
really really long time ago and you guys

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.000 
really really long time ago and you guys
are<00:00:37.879> only<00:00:38.059> just<00:00:38.329> watching<00:00:39.140> this<00:00:39.289> now<00:00:39.559> because

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
are only just watching this now because

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.189 
are only just watching this now because
I<00:00:40.039> am<00:00:40.190> too<00:00:40.519> lazy<00:00:40.789> to<00:00:41.149> commentate<00:00:41.660> all<00:00:41.899> of<00:00:42.079> the

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
I am too lazy to commentate all of the

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.560 
I am too lazy to commentate all of the
king<00:00:42.440> of<00:00:42.590> the<00:00:42.649> hill<00:00:42.890> matches<00:00:43.399> so<00:00:44.000> I<00:00:44.030> spread

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
king of the hill matches so I spread

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.840 
king of the hill matches so I spread
them<00:00:44.809> out<00:00:44.960> over<00:00:45.019> a<00:00:45.440> few<00:00:45.800> weeks<00:00:46.100> so<00:00:46.340> I<00:00:46.370> can<00:00:46.699> have

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
them out over a few weeks so I can have

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.779 
them out over a few weeks so I can have
more<00:00:47.059> time<00:00:47.390> to<00:00:47.660> commentate<00:00:48.199> them<00:00:48.469> I<00:00:48.649> guess<00:00:49.579> the

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
more time to commentate them I guess the

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.389 
more time to commentate them I guess the
problem<00:00:50.030> about<00:00:50.449> that<00:00:50.719> is<00:00:50.899> I<00:00:51.170> am<00:00:51.620> dragging<00:00:52.039> out

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
problem about that is I am dragging out

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.880 
problem about that is I am dragging out
the<00:00:52.609> series<00:00:52.910> way<00:00:53.390> too<00:00:53.449> much<00:00:53.839> so<00:00:54.559> it<00:00:54.710> would

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
the series way too much so it would

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.799 
the series way too much so it would
probably<00:00:55.160> be<00:00:55.670> better<00:00:56.000> to<00:00:56.239> have<00:00:56.359> all<00:00:56.570> the

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
probably be better to have all the

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.259 
probably be better to have all the
matches<00:00:57.260> in<00:00:57.440> one<00:00:57.679> video<00:00:57.890> which<00:00:58.670> some<00:00:58.969> of<00:00:59.000> you

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
matches in one video which some of you

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.729 
matches in one video which some of you
have<00:00:59.480> suggested<00:01:00.109> and<00:01:00.320> yes<00:01:01.219> I<00:01:01.489> certainly<00:01:02.300> agree

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
have suggested and yes I certainly agree

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.290 
have suggested and yes I certainly agree
but<00:01:03.739> that<00:01:03.980> would<00:01:04.220> make<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.640> video<00:01:04.970> pretty

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
but that would make the video pretty

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.230 
but that would make the video pretty
damn<00:01:05.600> long<00:01:05.930> and<00:01:06.439> as<00:01:06.710> you<00:01:06.860> know<00:01:07.040> i<00:01:07.310> cannot<00:01:07.909> took
