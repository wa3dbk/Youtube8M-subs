so<00:01:36.299> we're<00:01:36.420> going<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.600> loosen<00:01:36.900> those<00:01:37.049> just<00:01:37.380> a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
so we're going to loosen those just a

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.999 
so we're going to loosen those just a
little<00:01:37.710> bit<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:39.810> then<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.049> allows<00:01:40.110> us<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.680> spin

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
little bit and then it allows us to spin

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.190 
little bit and then it allows us to spin
this<00:01:41.189> ring<00:01:41.490> back<00:01:42.030> here<00:01:42.329> behind<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:42.899> there's

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
this ring back here behind this there's

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.170 
this ring back here behind this there's
a<00:01:43.229> little<00:01:43.470> plastic<00:01:43.890> ring<00:01:44.399> some<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.939> older

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
a little plastic ring some of the older

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.719 
a little plastic ring some of the older
ones<00:01:45.420> were<00:01:45.600> metal<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> little<00:01:47.610> more

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
ones were metal and a little more

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.840 
ones were metal and a little more
finesse<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.360> think

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
finesse and I think

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.880 
finesse and I think
it<00:01:49.360> really<00:01:49.630> is<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.840> little<00:01:50.170> bit<00:01:50.260> tight<00:01:50.560> but<00:01:50.590> if

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
it really is a little bit tight but if

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.410 
it really is a little bit tight but if
you<00:01:50.979> work<00:01:51.189> with<00:01:51.220> it<00:01:51.520> enough<00:01:51.729> it'll<00:01:51.939> fall<00:01:52.210> down

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
you work with it enough it'll fall down

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.350 
you work with it enough it'll fall down
like<00:01:52.600> that<00:01:52.840> right<00:01:53.610> put<00:01:54.610> that<00:01:54.759> back<00:01:54.939> up<00:01:55.180> there

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
like that right put that back up there

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.060 
like that right put that back up there
so<00:01:55.600> it<00:01:55.659> won't<00:01:55.840> go<00:01:55.960> anywhere<00:01:56.170> let's<00:01:56.740> see<00:01:56.890> we<00:01:57.040> got

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
so it won't go anywhere let's see we got

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.100 
so it won't go anywhere let's see we got
here<00:01:57.430> now<00:01:58.090> there's<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.450> old<00:01:58.630> one<00:01:58.840> there<00:01:59.049> and

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
here now there's the old one there and

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.620 
here now there's the old one there and
there's<00:01:59.470> the<00:01:59.619> old<00:01:59.710> one<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.729> this<00:02:01.210> is<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.479> new

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
there's the old one and this is the new

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.929 
there's the old one and this is the new
one<00:02:01.659> that's<00:02:02.200> gonna<00:02:02.440> be<00:02:02.619> going<00:02:02.890> in<00:02:03.009> there<00:02:03.159> and

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
one that's gonna be going in there and

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.609 
one that's gonna be going in there and
how<00:02:04.090> hard<00:02:04.330> is<00:02:04.450> this<00:02:04.479> installation<00:02:04.960> it's<00:02:05.320> this

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
how hard is this installation it's this

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.380 
how hard is this installation it's this
a<00:02:05.649> little<00:02:05.890> bit<00:02:06.070> tricky<00:02:06.399> but<00:02:06.490> it's<00:02:06.640> not<00:02:06.820> bad<00:02:07.119> and

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
a little bit tricky but it's not bad and

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.330 
a little bit tricky but it's not bad and
you<00:02:07.450> want<00:02:07.630> to<00:02:07.720> make<00:02:07.840> sure<00:02:07.869> that<00:02:08.200> this<00:02:08.830> comes<00:02:09.160> in

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
you want to make sure that this comes in

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.370 
you want to make sure that this comes in
contact<00:02:09.610> with<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.090> tank<00:02:10.360> back<00:02:10.630> here<00:02:10.929> right<00:02:11.170> here

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
contact with a tank back here right here

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.110 
contact with a tank back here right here
so<00:02:11.709> we're<00:02:11.860> going<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.069> bend<00:02:12.430> these<00:02:12.550> tabs<00:02:12.910> a

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
so we're going to bend these tabs a

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.490 
so we're going to bend these tabs a
little<00:02:13.330> bit<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.540> make<00:02:13.660> room<00:02:13.900> for<00:02:13.959> this<00:02:14.200> bigger

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
little bit to make room for this bigger

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.229 
little bit to make room for this bigger
one<00:02:14.739> because<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.100> won't<00:02:15.400> quite<00:02:15.670> fit<00:02:16.030> with

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
one because it won't quite fit with

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.000 
one because it won't quite fit with
these<00:02:16.390> tabs<00:02:16.720> in<00:02:16.959> place<00:02:17.230> they've<00:02:17.500> changed<00:02:17.770> it

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
these tabs in place they've changed it

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.470 
these tabs in place they've changed it
obviously<00:02:18.520> it's<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.700> little<00:02:18.910> different<00:02:19.120> so

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
obviously it's a little different so

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.880 
obviously it's a little different so
bend<00:02:19.690> your<00:02:19.810> tabs<00:02:20.020> back<00:02:20.319> and<00:02:20.650> give<00:02:20.800> yourself

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
bend your tabs back and give yourself

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.530 
bend your tabs back and give yourself
some<00:02:21.280> clearance<00:02:21.700> make<00:02:21.940> sure<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.239> get<00:02:22.360> this

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
some clearance make sure you get this

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.030 
some clearance make sure you get this
spring<00:02:22.930> in<00:02:23.050> there<00:02:23.200> goes<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.440> spring<00:02:23.769> is<00:02:23.890> what

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
spring in there goes the spring is what

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.130 
spring in there goes the spring is what
keeps<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.430> pressure<00:02:24.580> against<00:02:25.239> this<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.720> see

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
keeps the pressure against this I see

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.590 
keeps the pressure against this I see
now<00:02:27.040> make<00:02:27.220> sure<00:02:27.250> it's<00:02:27.610> seated<00:02:27.940> against<00:02:28.420> that

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
now make sure it's seated against that

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.590 
now make sure it's seated against that
tank<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.500> they're<00:02:29.620> carefully<00:02:30.160> you<00:02:30.250> got<00:02:30.370> it

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
tank and they're carefully you got it

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.729 
tank and they're carefully you got it
absolutely<00:02:31.600> have<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:31.930> make<00:02:32.080> sure<00:02:32.319> it's<00:02:32.470> seated

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
absolutely have to make sure it's seated

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.740 
absolutely have to make sure it's seated
or<00:02:32.980> it's<00:02:33.100> going<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.280> overheat<00:02:33.610> mm-hmm<00:02:34.480> it

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
or it's going to overheat mm-hmm it

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.380 
or it's going to overheat mm-hmm it
won't<00:02:34.930> be<00:02:35.110> effective<00:02:35.700> there's<00:02:36.700> your<00:02:36.880> last<00:02:37.120> leg

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
won't be effective there's your last leg

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.610 
won't be effective there's your last leg
and<00:02:37.569> I<00:02:37.600> think<00:02:37.810> we're<00:02:37.959> in<00:02:37.989> there<00:02:38.230> yeah<00:02:38.440> it's<00:02:38.560> a

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
and I think we're in there yeah it's a

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.140 
and I think we're in there yeah it's a
little<00:02:38.830> bit<00:02:38.920> of<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.069> tight<00:02:39.340> fit<00:02:39.610> but<00:02:39.640> it's<00:02:39.940> worth

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
little bit of a tight fit but it's worth

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.660 
little bit of a tight fit but it's worth
it<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:40.750> then<00:02:40.900> we<00:02:41.260> have<00:02:41.410> these<00:02:41.560> adapters<00:02:42.190> here

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
it and then we have these adapters here

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.509 
it and then we have these adapters here
that<00:02:43.120> go<00:02:43.269> for<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.600> wiring<00:02:44.069> some<00:02:45.069> of<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.220> older

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
that go for the wiring some of the older

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.400 
that go for the wiring some of the older
models<00:02:45.670> had<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.150> larger<00:02:46.569> spades<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.260> newer

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
models had the larger spades and a newer

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.440 
models had the larger spades and a newer
one<00:02:47.650> has<00:02:47.920> a<00:02:47.950> smaller<00:02:48.430> space<00:02:48.819> so<00:02:49.060> they<00:02:49.180> give<00:02:49.330> you

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
one has a smaller space so they give you

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.910 
one has a smaller space so they give you
an<00:02:49.510> adapter<00:02:50.049> to<00:02:50.170> run<00:02:50.319> it<00:02:50.410> to<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.560> smaller

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
an adapter to run it to the smaller

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.640 
an adapter to run it to the smaller
speed<00:02:51.390> make<00:02:52.390> sure<00:02:52.750> that<00:02:53.019> that<00:02:53.049> stays<00:02:53.470> up

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
speed make sure that that stays up

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.400 
speed make sure that that stays up
against<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.100> tank<00:02:54.370> right<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.570> then<00:02:55.720> your

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
against the tank right and then your

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.850 
against the tank right and then your
wires<00:02:56.620> go<00:02:56.920> on<00:02:57.070> here<00:02:57.900> one<00:02:58.900> on<00:02:59.019> each<00:02:59.049> side<00:02:59.200> and

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
wires go on here one on each side and

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.920 
wires go on here one on each side and
the<00:03:00.489> beauty<00:03:00.820> of<00:03:00.880> this<00:03:00.970> now<00:03:01.180> is<00:03:01.239> you<00:03:01.420> can<00:03:01.570> adjust

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
the beauty of this now is you can adjust

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.420 
the beauty of this now is you can adjust
the<00:03:02.049> temperature<00:03:02.350> absolutely<00:03:03.160> now<00:03:03.310> they

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
the temperature absolutely now they

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.830 
the temperature absolutely now they
