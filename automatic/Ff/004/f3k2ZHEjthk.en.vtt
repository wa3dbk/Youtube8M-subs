so<00:03:51.070> I<00:03:51.100> guess<00:03:51.280> I'll<00:03:51.459> make<00:03:51.580> another<00:03:51.850> video<00:03:52.090> later

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
so I guess I'll make another video later

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.660 
so I guess I'll make another video later
on<00:03:52.720> you<00:03:53.140> shouldn't<00:03:53.410> take<00:03:53.530> long<00:03:53.769> to<00:03:53.980> clean<00:03:54.519> him

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
on you shouldn't take long to clean him

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.070 
on you shouldn't take long to clean him
up<00:03:54.820> put<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.120> stickers<00:03:55.450> back<00:03:55.630> home<00:03:57.989> and<00:03:58.989> I

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080
