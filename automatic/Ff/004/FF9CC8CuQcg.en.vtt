today<00:00:09.360> we're<00:00:09.660> going<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.019> look<00:00:10.290> at<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:11.630> 606<00:00:12.630> and

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:12.930 
today we're going to look at the 606 and

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.350 
today we're going to look at the 606 and
the<00:00:12.990> 607<00:00:13.680> or<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.400> five<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:14.940> 15-pound

the 607 or the five and the 15-pound

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.739 
the 607 or the five and the 15-pound
stuffer<00:00:16.019> and<00:00:16.759> take<00:00:17.759> the<00:00:17.909> gears<00:00:18.119> off<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.630> show

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:18.749 
stuffer and take the gears off and show

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:22.489 
stuffer and take the gears off and show
you<00:00:18.869> how<00:00:18.929> it<00:00:19.109> works<00:00:19.230> yeah<00:00:19.829> are<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.519> LEM<00:00:21.019> 5<00:00:22.019> and

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:22.499 
you how it works yeah are the LEM 5 and

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:26.540 
you how it works yeah are the LEM 5 and
15<00:00:22.800> pound<00:00:23.369> stuffers<00:00:24.210> are<00:00:25.369> essentially<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
15 pound stuffers are essentially the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.999 
15 pound stuffers are essentially the
same<00:00:26.929> just<00:00:27.929> one<00:00:28.259> little<00:00:28.409> bigger<00:00:28.679> the<00:00:28.890> other

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
same just one little bigger the other

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.969 
same just one little bigger the other
but<00:00:29.970> i<00:00:30.029> want<00:00:30.239> to<00:00:30.300> show<00:00:30.479> you<00:00:30.509> how<00:00:30.839> to<00:00:31.050> change<00:00:31.409> the

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:31.979 
but i want to show you how to change the

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:36.680 
but i want to show you how to change the
gears<00:00:32.570> on<00:00:33.570> these<00:00:34.220> periodically<00:00:35.220> they<00:00:35.730> slipper

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
gears on these periodically they slipper

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.230 
gears on these periodically they slipper
or<00:00:37.640> pop<00:00:38.640> for<00:00:38.910> some<00:00:39.090> reason<00:00:39.860> and<00:00:41.000> people<00:00:42.000> seem

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:42.240 
or pop for some reason and people seem

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.390 
or pop for some reason and people seem
to<00:00:42.270> struggle<00:00:42.570> with<00:00:43.050> how<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.710> change<00:00:44.070> them<00:00:44.370> so

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
to struggle with how to change them so

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.070 
to struggle with how to change them so
we're<00:00:45.240> going<00:00:45.330> to<00:00:45.420> go<00:00:45.450> through<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.810> procedure

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.080 
we're going to go through that procedure

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.180 
we're going to go through that procedure
today<00:00:46.880> I've<00:00:48.170> removed<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.350> couple<00:00:49.650> pieces<00:00:49.830> off

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
today I've removed a couple pieces off

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.060 
today I've removed a couple pieces off
of<00:00:50.220> this<00:00:50.490> to<00:00:50.820> simplify<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.630> procedure<00:00:52.200> but

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
of this to simplify the procedure but

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.610 
of this to simplify the procedure but
basically<00:00:53.930> everything<00:00:54.930> has<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.350> come<00:00:55.380> out

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
basically everything has to come out

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.180 
basically everything has to come out
through<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.980> bottom<00:00:56.210> so<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.240> have<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.780> take

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
through the bottom so you have to take

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:19.860 
through the bottom so you have to take
will<00:00:59.190> not<00:00:59.400> soggy<00:00:59.670> bottom

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.780 

remove<00:01:20.870> the<00:01:21.080> bottom<00:01:22.810> and<00:01:24.130> it's<00:01:25.130> easiest<00:01:25.640> just

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
remove the bottom and it's easiest just

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.420 
remove the bottom and it's easiest just
to<00:01:26.030> slide<00:01:26.420> this<00:01:26.660> out<00:01:26.870> now<00:01:27.170> I've<00:01:27.950> taken<00:01:28.310> off<00:01:28.610> the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
to slide this out now I've taken off the

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.800 
to slide this out now I've taken off the
piston<00:01:31.430> down<00:01:31.580> here<00:01:31.880> just<00:01:32.090> to<00:01:32.210> simplify<00:01:32.600> this

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
piston down here just to simplify this

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.110 
piston down here just to simplify this
for<00:01:33.170> today<00:01:33.470> longer<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.370> pit<00:01:34.550> somebody<00:01:35.000> on

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
for today longer the pit somebody on

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.790 
for today longer the pit somebody on
there<00:01:35.360> but<00:01:35.600> that<00:01:35.750> should<00:01:36.170> slide<00:01:36.500> right<00:01:36.530> off

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
there but that should slide right off

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.040 
there but that should slide right off
with<00:01:37.160> a<00:01:37.220> pistol<00:01:37.550> mounted<00:01:37.730> this<00:01:38.450> is<00:01:38.660> the<00:01:38.780> shout

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
with a pistol mounted this is the shout

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.470 
with a pistol mounted this is the shout
that<00:01:39.320> we<00:01:39.500> have<00:01:39.680> to<00:01:39.890> get<00:01:40.010> off<00:01:40.160> now<00:01:40.550> you'll

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
that we have to get off now you'll

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.510 
that we have to get off now you'll
notice<00:01:41.690> this<00:01:42.020> shaft<00:01:42.290> has<00:01:42.590> a<00:01:42.650> groove<00:01:42.980> down<00:01:43.280> it

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
notice this shaft has a groove down it

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.490 
notice this shaft has a groove down it
and<00:01:43.840> it<00:01:44.840> stops<00:01:45.260> right<00:01:45.560> here<00:01:46.780> so<00:01:47.780> you<00:01:47.870> can't<00:01:48.230> go

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
and it stops right here so you can't go

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.290 
and it stops right here so you can't go
that<00:01:48.920> way<00:01:48.980> because<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:49.730> will<00:01:49.820> catch<00:01:50.030> in<00:01:50.180> the

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
that way because it will catch in the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.410 
that way because it will catch in the
gears<00:01:50.480> it<00:01:50.720> has<00:01:50.870> to<00:01:51.080> come<00:01:51.110> down<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:52.210> this<00:01:53.210> can

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
gears it has to come down and this can

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.200 
gears it has to come down and this can
be<00:01:53.540> done<00:01:53.690> simply<00:01:54.050> by<00:01:54.290> cranking<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:55.210> mechanism

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
be done simply by cranking the mechanism

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.690 
be done simply by cranking the mechanism
down<00:01:59.500> and<00:02:00.500> you<00:02:00.620> should<00:02:00.800> see<00:02:01.010> it's<00:02:01.190> going<00:02:01.520> down

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
down and you should see it's going down

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.530 
down and you should see it's going down
into<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.180> gears<00:02:03.550> and<00:02:04.550> should<00:02:04.880> fall<00:02:05.120> off<00:02:05.330> the

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
into the gears and should fall off the

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:18.010 
into the gears and should fall off the
bottom<00:02:05.870> here<00:02:06.020> push<00:02:06.260> way<00:02:16.360> through<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.810> now<00:02:17.960> we

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
bottom here push way through and now we

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.120 
bottom here push way through and now we
simply<00:02:18.500> have<00:02:18.710> to<00:02:20.260> unscrew<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.440> you<00:02:21.950> can

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
simply have to unscrew it and you can

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.070 
simply have to unscrew it and you can
see<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.610> groove<00:02:22.970> on<00:02:23.270> this<00:02:23.510> goes<00:02:23.780> all<00:02:24.050> the

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
see that the groove on this goes all the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.260 
see that the groove on this goes all the
way<00:02:24.320> to<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.530> top<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:25.340> stops<00:02:25.640> at<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:25.910> bottom

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
way to the top it stops at the bottom

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.820 
way to the top it stops at the bottom
and<00:02:26.330> that's<00:02:26.540> why<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:26.780> have<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.260> come<00:02:27.470> this<00:02:27.500> way

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
and that's why you have to come this way

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
and that's why you have to come this way
now<00:02:28.370> your<00:02:28.550> gears<00:02:28.880> are<00:02:29.239> simply<00:02:29.930> set<00:02:30.200> in<00:02:30.410> here

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
now your gears are simply set in here

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.880 
now your gears are simply set in here
your<00:02:31.850> larger<00:02:32.690> gear<00:02:32.989> has<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:34.370> brass<00:02:34.790> bushing

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
your larger gear has a brass bushing

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.860 
your larger gear has a brass bushing
water<00:02:36.890> on<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.310> top<00:02:37.520> of<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:37.820> and<00:02:38.060> this<00:02:38.600> takes

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
water on the top of it and this takes

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.380 
water on the top of it and this takes
the<00:02:39.020> brunt<00:02:39.410> of<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:40.070> of<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.850> thrust<00:02:41.180> when

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
the brunt of the of the thrust when

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.460 
the brunt of the of the thrust when
you're<00:02:41.570> stopping<00:02:43.570> your<00:02:44.570> arms<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:45.020> little<00:02:45.050> gear

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
you're stopping your arms a little gear

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.540 
you're stopping your arms a little gear
simply<00:02:45.890> slides<00:02:46.220> out<00:02:47.410> there<00:02:48.410> is<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.620> nylon

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
simply slides out there is a nylon

simply slides out there is a nylon
bushing<00:02:50.180> that<00:02:50.420> fits<00:02:51.170> in<00:02:51.350> here<00:02:51.410> like<00:02:51.709> that<00:02:51.770> and

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
bushing that fits in here like that and

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.090 
bushing that fits in here like that and
you<00:02:52.310> can<00:02:52.520> see<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.850> end<00:02:53.000> of<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.180> right<00:02:53.420> there

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
you can see the end of it right there

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.390 
you can see the end of it right there
occasionally<00:02:55.690> this<00:02:56.690> will<00:02:56.989> require<00:02:57.200> a<00:02:57.500> spacer

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
occasionally this will require a spacer

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.400 
occasionally this will require a spacer
which<00:02:59.090> will<00:02:59.360> move<00:02:59.600> this<00:03:00.580> this<00:03:01.690> year<00:03:02.690> over<00:03:03.019> to

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
which will move this this year over to

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.050 
which will move this this year over to
the<00:03:03.530> left<00:03:03.769> and<00:03:04.010> force<00:03:04.580> it<00:03:04.640> into<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:07.060> large

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
the left and force it into the large

this<00:03:13.730> unit<00:03:14.150> doesn't<00:03:14.360> need<00:03:14.660> it<00:03:14.840> so<00:03:14.989> I'm<00:03:15.140> going

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
this unit doesn't need it so I'm going

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.740 
this unit doesn't need it so I'm going
to<00:03:15.440> take<00:03:15.680> it<00:03:15.800> back<00:03:15.950> off<00:03:16.330> and<00:03:17.330> i'll<00:03:17.510> show<00:03:17.540> you

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
to take it back off and i'll show you

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.710 
to take it back off and i'll show you
how<00:03:17.840> they<00:03:18.290> have<00:03:18.470> to<00:03:18.680> be<00:03:18.800> aligned<00:03:19.420> okay<00:03:20.420> so

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
how they have to be aligned okay so

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.210 
how they have to be aligned okay so
let's<00:03:20.930> put<00:03:21.110> it<00:03:21.200> back<00:03:21.350> together<00:03:21.560> here<00:03:22.040> we're

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
let's put it back together here we're

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.790 
let's put it back together here we're
going<00:03:22.310> to<00:03:22.400> set

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
going to set

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.660 
going to set
gear<00:03:23.100> in<00:03:23.310> here<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:24.680> then<00:03:25.680> we're<00:03:25.890> going<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.250> run

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
gear in here and then we're going to run

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:35.590 
gear in here and then we're going to run
up<00:03:32.270> the<00:03:33.270> rod<00:03:33.480> back<00:03:33.750> up<00:03:34.020> once<00:03:34.920> they<00:03:35.100> get<00:03:35.220> up<00:03:35.340> line

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
up the rod back up once they get up line

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.480 
up the rod back up once they get up line
it<00:03:36.600> will<00:03:36.750> run<00:03:36.930> up<00:03:37.080> so<00:03:37.350> far<00:03:38.480> by<00:03:39.480> hand<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:40.170> then

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
it will run up so far by hand and then

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.280 
it will run up so far by hand and then
it<00:03:41.490> has<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.730> line<00:03:42.120> up<00:03:42.330> with<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:42.720> key<00:03:43.050> way

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
it has to line up with that key way

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.030 
it has to line up with that key way
right<00:03:43.620> there<00:03:43.890> so<00:03:44.340> once<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:46.590> groom<00:03:46.890> is

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
right there so once the the groom is

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.070 
right there so once the the groom is
lined<00:03:47.340> up<00:03:47.490> with<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.760> with<00:03:48.300> the<00:03:48.390> shaft<00:03:48.660> you

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
lined up with the with the shaft you

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.260 
lined up with the with the shaft you
simply<00:03:49.500> continue<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.460> twist<00:03:52.130> and<00:03:53.270> sometimes

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
simply continue to twist and sometimes

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.670 
simply continue to twist and sometimes
it<00:03:54.420> catches<00:03:54.600> a<00:03:54.840> little<00:03:55.080> bit<00:03:55.200> coming<00:03:55.410> through

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
it catches a little bit coming through

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.870 
it catches a little bit coming through
during<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.100> have<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.400> use<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:58.140> handle

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
during you have to use the the handle

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.510 
during you have to use the the handle
and<00:03:59.880> you'll<00:04:00.210> see<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.690> shaft<00:04:01.280> back<00:04:02.280> through

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
and you'll see the shaft back through

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.910 
and you'll see the shaft back through
the<00:04:02.640> center<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.600> your<00:04:04.050> use<00:04:04.290> or<00:04:04.530> put<00:04:04.740> back

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
the center and your use or put back

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.620 
the center and your use or put back
together<00:04:05.100> now<00:04:05.370> what's<00:04:05.760> critical<00:04:06.300> in<00:04:06.450> this

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
together now what's critical in this

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.390 
together now what's critical in this
process<00:04:07.110> is<00:04:07.650> that<00:04:07.890> this<00:04:08.070> gear<00:04:08.430> here<00:04:09.080> meshes

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
process is that this gear here meshes

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.290 
process is that this gear here meshes
with<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:12.330> big<00:04:12.540> gear<00:04:12.960> just<00:04:13.800> where<00:04:14.550> the<00:04:14.970> two

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
with the big gear just where the two

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.970 
with the big gear just where the two
gears<00:04:15.600> come<00:04:15.930> together<00:04:16.290> whether<00:04:16.650> they<00:04:16.799> were

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
gears come together whether they were

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.580 
gears come together whether they were
they<00:04:17.100> start<00:04:17.370> to<00:04:17.489> bellow<00:04:17.700> if<00:04:18.209> you<00:04:18.420> push<00:04:19.140> that<00:04:19.320> in

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
they start to bellow if you push that in

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.550 
they start to bellow if you push that in
too<00:04:19.859> far<00:04:20.220> that<00:04:21.000> gear<00:04:21.269> will<00:04:21.450> not<00:04:21.720> work<00:04:21.959> it<00:04:22.260> will

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
too far that gear will not work it will

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.800 
too far that gear will not work it will
Clank<00:04:23.160> and<00:04:23.430> bang<00:04:23.700> and<00:04:24.000> just<00:04:24.300> tear<00:04:24.510> everything

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
Clank and bang and just tear everything

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.170 
Clank and bang and just tear everything
up<00:04:25.080> in<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.680> top<00:04:25.920> too<00:04:26.160> far<00:04:26.460> it<00:04:26.790> will<00:04:26.970> actually

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
up in the top too far it will actually

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.310 
up in the top too far it will actually
skip<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:28.010> skip<00:04:29.010> it<00:04:29.280> tooth<00:04:29.490> during<00:04:29.910> during

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
skip and skip it tooth during during

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.080 
skip and skip it tooth during during
stuffing<00:04:31.320> and<00:04:31.470> then<00:04:32.220> you'll<00:04:32.460> destroy<00:04:32.910> the

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
stuffing and then you'll destroy the

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.020 
stuffing and then you'll destroy the
gear<00:04:33.300> set<00:04:33.540> now<00:04:34.260> put<00:04:35.100> it<00:04:35.130> back<00:04:35.220> together<00:04:35.550> is

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
gear set now put it back together is

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.300 
gear set now put it back together is
simply<00:04:36.419> a<00:04:36.450> matter<00:04:36.720> of<00:04:36.900> reversing<00:04:37.380> what<00:04:38.010> we<00:04:38.130> did

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
simply a matter of reversing what we did
