Morgan<00:02:45.820> you<00:02:46.030> can<00:02:46.180> see<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.450> docking<00:02:46.840> master<00:02:47.230> is

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
Morgan you can see the docking master is

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.800 
Morgan you can see the docking master is
shaped<00:02:48.040> like<00:02:48.160> a<00:02:48.280> boat<00:02:48.520> that's<00:02:49.030> because<00:02:49.630> I

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
shaped like a boat that's because I

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.300 
shaped like a boat that's because I
didn't<00:02:49.990> realize<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.290> that's<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:51.010> help<00:02:51.190> you

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
what buttons you're pushing the two

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.490 
what buttons you're pushing the two
black<00:02:57.670> buttons<00:02:58.060> are<00:02:58.240> the<00:02:58.360> engines<00:02:58.750> mm-hmm

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
black buttons are the engines mm-hmm

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.130 
black buttons are the engines mm-hmm
these<00:03:00.460> two<00:03:00.700> back<00:03:00.910> buttons<00:03:01.330> put<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.810> engines

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
these two back buttons put the engines

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.250 
these two back buttons put the engines
in<00:03:02.290> Reverse<00:03:02.410> you<00:03:03.100> can<00:03:03.310> one<00:03:03.820> or<00:03:03.940> two<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:05.080> two

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
in Reverse you can one or two the two

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.190 
in Reverse you can one or two the two
top<00:03:05.800> black<00:03:06.250> buttons<00:03:06.670> put<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.750> engines<00:03:08.020> in

gear<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:08.740> forward<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.610> then<00:03:10.510> these<00:03:10.690> two

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
gear and forward and then these two

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.950 
gear and forward and then these two
buttons<00:03:11.640> run<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.760> bow<00:03:12.880> thruster<00:03:13.360> push<00:03:13.780> the

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
buttons run the bow thruster push the

boat<00:03:14.110> sideways<00:03:14.380> we're<00:03:15.010> trying<00:03:15.250> they<00:03:15.550> really

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
boat sideways we're trying they really

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.190 
boat sideways we're trying they really
made<00:03:16.060> this<00:03:16.210> simple<00:03:16.860> get<00:03:17.860> how<00:03:17.950> smooth<00:03:18.340> it<00:03:18.460> is

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
made this simple get how smooth it is

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.840 
made this simple get how smooth it is
now<00:03:20.200> how<00:03:20.500> does<00:03:20.560> this<00:03:20.980> handheld<00:03:21.370> device

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
now how does this handheld device

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.370 
now how does this handheld device
actually<00:03:22.210> communicate<00:03:22.840> with<00:03:22.990> the<00:03:23.110> engines

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
actually communicate with the engines

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.260 
actually communicate with the engines
well<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.010> transmitter<00:03:24.490> sends<00:03:24.790> a<00:03:24.850> signal<00:03:25.030> to

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
well the transmitter sends a signal to

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.450 
well the transmitter sends a signal to
the<00:03:25.630> receivers<00:03:26.170> one<00:03:26.710> of<00:03:26.860> which<00:03:26.980> is<00:03:27.010> in<00:03:27.370> the

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460 
the receivers one of which is in the

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.190 
the receivers one of which is in the
wheelhouse<00:03:27.640> and<00:03:28.120> I<00:03:28.540> can<00:03:28.690> show<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:28.930> that<00:03:29.050> if

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
wheelhouse and I can show you that if

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.740 
wheelhouse and I can show you that if
you<00:03:29.290> like<00:03:29.470> okay<00:03:30.130> thanks

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.230 

this<00:03:34.750> device<00:03:35.230> is<00:03:35.290> amazing<00:03:36.250> how<00:03:36.730> much<00:03:36.850> control

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
this device is amazing how much control

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.970 
this device is amazing how much control
does<00:03:37.360> it<00:03:37.510> give<00:03:37.630> you<00:03:37.660> oh<00:03:37.990> I<00:03:38.320> have<00:03:38.560> full<00:03:38.830> control

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
does it give you oh I have full control

does it give you oh I have full control
over<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.640> whole<00:03:39.790> operation<00:03:39.940> of<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:40.510> boat

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
over the whole operation of the boat

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.780 
over the whole operation of the boat
I've<00:03:41.140> got<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.770> engine<00:03:41.920> transmissions

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
I've got the engine transmissions

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.610 
I've got the engine transmissions
forward<00:03:43.270> in<00:03:43.420> Reverse<00:03:43.720> I<00:03:43.960> can<00:03:44.140> move<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.440> boat

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
forward in Reverse I can move the boat

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.920 
forward in Reverse I can move the boat
forward<00:03:44.980> reverse<00:03:45.340> side<00:03:45.970> ways<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.450> can<00:03:46.690> remove

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
forward reverse side ways I can remove

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.810 
forward reverse side ways I can remove
the<00:03:47.110> valve<00:03:47.260> sideways<00:03:47.860> with<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.250> bow<00:03:48.370> thruster

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
the valve sideways with the bow thruster

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.630 
the valve sideways with the bow thruster
control<00:03:49.380> it<00:03:50.380> also<00:03:50.560> has<00:03:50.890> an<00:03:51.040> option<00:03:51.340> to<00:03:51.370> raise

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
control it also has an option to raise

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.690 
control it also has an option to raise
and<00:03:51.850> lower<00:03:51.880> your<00:03:52.150> anchor<00:03:52.480> and<00:03:53.250> another<00:03:54.250> option

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
and lower your anchor and another option

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.760 
and lower your anchor and another option
to<00:03:54.910> have<00:03:55.270> steering<00:03:55.660> put<00:03:55.960> in<00:03:56.080> it<00:03:56.230> so<00:03:56.410> you<00:03:56.440> can

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
to have steering put in it so you can

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.170 
to have steering put in it so you can
turn<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.160> wheel<00:03:57.310> while<00:03:57.580> your<00:03:57.760> docking<00:03:58.090> the

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
turn the wheel while your docking the

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.910 
turn the wheel while your docking the
boat<00:03:58.210> so<00:03:59.020> it<00:03:59.080> kind<00:03:59.230> of<00:03:59.260> makes<00:03:59.410> driving<00:03:59.620> a<00:03:59.830> boat

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
boat so it kind of makes driving a boat

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.220 
boat so it kind of makes driving a boat
a<00:03:59.980> no-brainer<00:04:00.400> or<00:04:00.850> it<00:04:01.240> makes<00:04:01.780> it<00:04:01.960> very<00:04:02.110> much

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
a no-brainer or it makes it very much
