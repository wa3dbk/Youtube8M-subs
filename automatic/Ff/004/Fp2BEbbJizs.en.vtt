00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.619
 is it so 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.630
 I am sony cpic fan and today 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.759
 I will mention some curiosities of the 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.580
 game sonic colors or better called 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.770
 sonic colors in europe and australia as 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.260
 always all the curiosities are 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.650
 taken from the sonic wiki visit their page 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:38.019
 for more curiosities warning this 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.059
 video contains a lot of spoiler so no 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:43.199
 I would recommend that you watch this video if 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.940
 follow it or you're playing it let's start 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.190
 many say that sonic colors looks like 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.780
 much to super mario galaxy since the 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.549
 theme is space and sonny that is 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.519
 helped by the widgets just like 

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:56.260
 mario by the flashes in act 1 in 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.350
 the first part you can slide 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.510
 infinitely the beginning of music 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.369
 of Act 3 of Aquarium Park 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.580
 it looks a lot like the sonic song 

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:08.650
 weird heroes always confuse this 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.960
 game and they are the subtitles in the scene 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.939
 of the second boss are and they say the 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.549
 problems are solved by kicking him the 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:18.689
 I blame the robots when I should say 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.689
 kicking his ass 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.150
 in game land if you press a button at 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.220
 random sonic will change color in the mode 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.470
 multiplayer you control some onix 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.140
 robots with red antenna called virtual 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.080
 head box this could refer to 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.020
 sound and this is the last game of 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.390
 sonic for wii and 10 when they are 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.760
 The magazine was announced 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.620
 nintendo club from latin america 'put no 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.320
 miss for nothing of the sonic world 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.090
 colors for nintendo 3ds confusing 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.210
 many fans if it was sonic 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.100
 generations or sonic colors this is one 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.070
 of the few games where in the battle 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.390
 end is not used to super sonic 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.570
 except for the version of ds in 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.610
 where a secret final boss appears in 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.470
 the 10 6 man version uses all the 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.930
 guys while in the wii version 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.140
 only use a celestial laser was pink 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.239
 blue cube and purple frenzy in this 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.400
 game you can easily notice the change of the 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.230
 sound boost being here they are and should 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.970
 use the interim of the white guys and 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.370
 when you run waves of different 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.500
 colors that cover sonic sides 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.510
 several people complained about the 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.480
 battle of the wii version for not being 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.519
 with his person in some scenes of 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.530
 game you can see that because the 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.540
 Ekman amusement park is in 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.569
 the space to get to it must be 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.099
 climb up a super speed elevator 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.040
 ironically this elevator has a form 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:57.040
 of snail in the version of nintendo 10 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.319
 you come out and you'll see him talking with are both 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.909
 spikes like hover contain skills 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.250
 which are and could be used in games 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:05.290
 previous spikes can do the spin 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.420
 touch while over can cross 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.489
 between the skill rings that you see in 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.609
 sonic adventure sonic adventure 2 and 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.040
 2006 sound if a consumer pre 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.019
 ordered the game in gamespot got 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.200
 free a hat with the shape of 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.540
 zombie picks during an act if you 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.519
 activate the super sonic mode you can not 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.430
 use any wisp except the wish 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.560
 white in a scene you can see that 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.349
 are and breaks the fourth wall talking to 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.420
 the person who plays the game some 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.700
 parts of the music of the final boss will 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.110
 it seems a bit to endless possibility of 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.510
 sonic unleashed 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.090
 in the nintendo club magazine of mexico 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.210
 considered this game a spin-off and not 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.220
 part of the original canon in the voices not 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.070
 used of the game sound is not 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.290

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.750
