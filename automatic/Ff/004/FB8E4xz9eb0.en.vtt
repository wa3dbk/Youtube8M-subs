00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.600 
i am using kik and as the attachment i'm
using<00:00:59.050> the<00:00:59.290> silencer<00:00:59.770> this<00:01:00.070> was<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.400> best

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
using the silencer this was the best

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.600 
using the silencer this was the best
option<00:01:00.850> I<00:01:01.270> found<00:01:01.660> you<00:01:02.410> can<00:01:02.560> also<00:01:02.710> try<00:01:03.070> and<00:01:03.340> use

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
option I found you can also try and use

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.660 
option I found you can also try and use
the<00:01:04.050> red<00:01:05.050> dot<00:01:05.260> but<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:08.170> iron<00:01:08.830> sights<00:01:09.100> are<00:01:09.430> very

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
the red dot but the iron sights are very

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.180 
the red dot but the iron sights are very
good<00:01:09.910> at<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.390> ACR<00:01:10.780> so<00:01:11.230> you<00:01:11.290> don't<00:01:11.890> need<00:01:12.070> them

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
good at the ACR so you don't need them

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.399 
good at the ACR so you don't need them
and

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.620 

it<00:01:16.950> will<00:01:17.189> increase<00:01:17.429> the<00:01:17.640> Equality<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.420> use

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
it will increase the Equality if you use

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.169 
it will increase the Equality if you use
it<00:01:18.899> with<00:01:19.280> silencer<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:21.030> see<00:01:21.149> some

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
it with silencer you can see some

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:24.499 
it with silencer you can see some
gameplay<00:01:21.659> with<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.960> red<00:01:22.289> dot<00:01:22.499> here<00:01:23.509> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
gameplay with the red dot here the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.849 
gameplay with the red dot here the
equality<00:01:24.929> is<00:01:25.020> good<00:01:25.289> but<00:01:26.179> if<00:01:27.179> you<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:27.859> play

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:28.859 
equality is good but if you can play

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:31.539 
equality is good but if you can play
with<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> ACR<00:01:29.609> without<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> red<00:01:30.179> dots<00:01:30.450> do<00:01:31.170> it

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
with the ACR without the red dots do it

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.440 
with the ACR without the red dots do it
another<00:01:32.549> good<00:01:32.789> choice<00:01:33.000> will<00:01:33.299> be<00:01:33.799> the<00:01:34.799> use<00:01:34.950> of

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
another good choice will be the use of

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.809 
another good choice will be the use of
attachments<00:01:36.770> proficiency<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.890> use<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.369> with
