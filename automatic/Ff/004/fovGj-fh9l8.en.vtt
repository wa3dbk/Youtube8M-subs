00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.800
 God 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.710
 sun 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.300
 he wants to write his incorporation 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.300
 the leader of the organization what to say 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.340
 commented but I understand 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.030
 they say 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.720
 top of his advice 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.720
 d 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.320
 one 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.870
 one day he gives back the opportunity to speak well my friend 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.290
 I'm intrigued with tito thesis 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.700
 and I find it difficult to contain the urge to put it to the test 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.060
 but still 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.330
 nor worries about the stability of the worlds 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.630
 and it also worries me 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.270
 the doors that have appeared 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.440
 the place that look for it without heart 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.440
 I'm afraid that my research has caused all this 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.060
 I'm not hansen with regard to the experiment that presented the other day 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.180
 with your permission I would like to continue 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.540
 the project 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.540
 forget it said of the doors and the heart of all the worlds the 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.960
 place should not be desecrated 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.700
 but a teacher in percent 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.700
 I've been thinking 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.459
 be what it is 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.459
 it will be better to forget about all that 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:38.629
 I already remember 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:39.560
 despite this 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.919
 the president of the cen 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.619
 he also has the obligation to defend himself 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:46.389
 in that year
