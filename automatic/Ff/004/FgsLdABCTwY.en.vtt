long distance it's a bit tougher and the
famas<00:05:20.740> does<00:05:20.979> beat<00:05:21.130> at<00:05:21.310> that<00:05:21.430> range<00:05:21.639> but<00:05:21.910> every

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
famas does beat at that range but every

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.089 
famas does beat at that range but every
game<00:05:22.600> in<00:05:22.750> this<00:05:22.810> every<00:05:23.229> map<00:05:23.380> in<00:05:23.560> this<00:05:23.680> game<00:05:23.889> is

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:24.099 
game in this every map in this game is

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:27.089 
game in this every map in this game is
