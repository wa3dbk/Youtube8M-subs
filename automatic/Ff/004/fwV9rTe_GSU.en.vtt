barble<00:01:57.050> hmm<00:01:58.479> again<00:01:59.479> it's<00:01:59.600> working<00:01:59.780> well<00:02:00.080> at

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
barble hmm again it's working well at

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.890 
barble hmm again it's working well at
the<00:02:00.290> moment<00:02:00.409> then<00:02:00.770> one<00:02:01.009> just<00:02:01.450> yeah<00:02:02.509> clayji

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
the moment then one just yeah clayji

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.139 
the moment then one just yeah clayji
swim<00:02:03.290> just<00:02:03.710> didn't<00:02:04.159> like<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.430> feel<00:02:04.670> of<00:02:04.700> it

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
swim just didn't like the feel of it

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.690 
swim just didn't like the feel of it
stiffness<00:02:05.570> in<00:02:06.050> what<00:02:06.229> happens<00:02:06.619> though<00:02:06.830> is<00:02:07.670> that

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
stiffness in what happens though is that

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.910 
stiffness in what happens though is that
the<00:02:08.390> fish<00:02:08.569> in<00:02:08.720> this<00:02:08.840> woman<00:02:09.140> lifts<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.709> line
