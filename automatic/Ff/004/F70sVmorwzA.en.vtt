00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
this guy here is basically a sky golem

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.510 
this guy here is basically a sky golem
recolored<00:00:20.660> so<00:00:21.380> has<00:00:21.530> four<00:00:21.770> new<00:00:21.890> abilities<00:00:22.310> the

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
recolored so has four new abilities the

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.400 
recolored so has four new abilities the
first<00:00:22.789> one<00:00:23.030> is<00:00:23.210> jumped<00:00:23.539> powerup<00:00:23.990> this<00:00:24.260> one

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
first one is jumped powerup this one

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.260 
first one is jumped powerup this one
here<00:00:24.770> is<00:00:24.980> one<00:00:25.520> you're<00:00:25.610> gonna<00:00:25.699> be<00:00:25.850> using<00:00:26.090> most

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
here is one you're gonna be using most

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.300 
here is one you're gonna be using most
often<00:00:26.480> jump<00:00:26.930> to<00:00:27.050> a<00:00:27.110> power<00:00:27.320> makes<00:00:27.740> you<00:00:27.920> immune

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
often jump to a power makes you immune

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.550 
often jump to a power makes you immune
to<00:00:28.490> all<00:00:28.580> the<00:00:28.760> traps<00:00:29.029> second<00:00:29.900> one<00:00:29.990> is<00:00:30.080> battery

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
to all the traps second one is battery

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.320 
to all the traps second one is battery
you<00:00:30.770> can<00:00:30.859> reusing<00:00:31.250> this<00:00:31.369> this<00:00:31.850> will<00:00:32.029> store

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 
you can reusing this this will store

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.119 
you can reusing this this will store
power<00:00:32.689> and<00:00:32.989> then<00:00:33.170> you<00:00:33.290> can<00:00:33.470> activate<00:00:33.830> it<00:00:33.890> later

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
power and then you can activate it later

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.400 
power and then you can activate it later
so<00:00:35.090> that's<00:00:35.239> very<00:00:35.330> important<00:00:35.870> third<00:00:36.170> ability

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
so that's very important third ability

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.410 
so that's very important third ability
is<00:00:36.949> the<00:00:37.460> one<00:00:37.579> that<00:00:37.700> requires<00:00:37.850> your<00:00:38.180> reagent

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
is the one that requires your reagent

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.780 
is the one that requires your reagent
it's<00:00:38.780> over<00:00:39.140> right<00:00:39.260> we're<00:00:40.040> not<00:00:40.160> gonna<00:00:40.280> we're

this<00:01:24.860> bit<00:01:25.069> is<00:01:25.160> very<00:01:25.220> important<00:01:25.759> what<00:01:25.849> a<00:01:25.880> leap

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
this bit is very important what a leap

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.790 
this bit is very important what a leap
to<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.569> next<00:01:26.599> powerup<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:27.319> then<00:01:27.500> collect

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
to the next powerup and then collect

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.410 
to the next powerup and then collect
them<00:01:27.979> with<00:01:28.190> the<00:01:28.310> number<00:01:28.520> two<00:01:28.700> with<00:01:29.300> your

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
them with the number two with your

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.919 
them with the number two with your
battery<00:01:30.819> make<00:01:31.819> it<00:01:31.970> to<00:01:32.090> this<00:01:32.240> next<00:01:32.750> checkpoint

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
battery make it to this next checkpoint

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:35.080 
battery make it to this next checkpoint
before<00:01:33.530> you<00:01:33.619> leap<00:01:33.800> to<00:01:34.520> collect<00:01:34.729> this<00:01:34.849> thing

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
before you leap to collect this thing

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.609 
before you leap to collect this thing
you<00:01:35.240> do<00:01:35.390> that<00:01:35.569> so<00:01:35.899> you<00:01:35.959> keep<00:01:36.319> the<00:01:36.470> water

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
you do that so you keep the water

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.620 
you do that so you keep the water
walking<00:01:36.920> going<00:01:37.190> this<00:01:37.819> bit<00:01:38.000> here<00:01:38.209> is<00:01:38.390> pretty

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
walking going this bit here is pretty

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
much are in Jesus you're gonna need a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.330 
much are in Jesus you're gonna need a
rocket<00:01:41.360> which<00:01:42.259> is<00:01:42.289> the<00:01:42.530> next<00:01:42.800> one<00:01:42.890> after<00:01:43.039> this

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
rocket which is the next one after this

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.210

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
would be a pretty slow Trek and you

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.300 
would be a pretty slow Trek and you
would<00:02:03.289> lose

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
would lose

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.210

quickly as possible and the reason you
collect<00:02:22.740> those<00:02:22.890> boots<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.730> because<00:02:24.030> once<00:02:24.210> you

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
collect those boots is because once you

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.670 
collect those boots is because once you
get<00:02:24.480> down<00:02:24.780> here<00:02:24.810> you're<00:02:25.230> not<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.440> roughly

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
get down here you're not the roughly

get down here you're not the roughly
water<00:02:25.830> walk<00:02:26.070> so<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.000> activate<00:02:27.690> them<00:02:27.810> they're

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
water walk so you activate them they're

through this zoo section and there you

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:51.590 
through this zoo section and there you
go

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
go

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.780

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519

would<00:04:32.930> be<00:04:33.050> more<00:04:33.229> satisfying<00:04:33.410> if<00:04:33.800> I<00:04:33.860> had<00:04:34.010> just

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
would be more satisfying if I had just

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.460 
would be more satisfying if I had just
died
