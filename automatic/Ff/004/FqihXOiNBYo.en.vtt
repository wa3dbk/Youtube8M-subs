favorite<00:02:55.360> out<00:02:55.480> of<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.600> three<00:02:55.690> because<00:02:56.350> her

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
favorite out of the three because her

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.340 
favorite out of the three because her
design<00:02:57.400> is<00:02:57.580> a<00:02:57.610> little<00:02:57.910> more<00:02:58.090> complex<00:02:58.810> compared

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
design is a little more complex compared

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.960 
design is a little more complex compared
to<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.530> other<00:02:59.709> swaddle<00:03:00.400> is<00:03:00.550> probably<00:03:00.850> the

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
to the other swaddle is probably the

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.850 
to the other swaddle is probably the
second<00:03:01.390> most<00:03:01.420> because<00:03:01.840> they<00:03:02.500> really<00:03:02.739> went

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
second most because they really went

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.050 
second most because they really went
through<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.040> lot<00:03:03.190> of<00:03:03.310> trouble<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.700> get<00:03:03.850> that

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
through a lot of trouble to get that

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.720 
through a lot of trouble to get that
leaf<00:03:04.390> in<00:03:04.690> that<00:03:04.870> design<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.500> older<00:03:05.830> like<00:03:06.580> the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
leaf in that design and older like the

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.729 
leaf in that design and older like the
details<00:03:07.239> with<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.480> little<00:03:07.810> hole<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.530> the

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
details with the little hole and the

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.060 
details with the little hole and the
lining<00:03:09.250> on<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.459> leaves<00:03:09.790> on<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.300> leaf<00:03:11.260> around

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
lining on the leaves on the leaf around

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.350 
lining on the leaves on the leaf around
is<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:13.330> leaf<00:03:13.540> collar<00:03:13.930> around<00:03:14.200> his<00:03:14.530> neck<00:03:15.360> that

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
is the leaf collar around his neck that

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.630 
is the leaf collar around his neck that
was<00:03:16.510> some<00:03:16.690> good<00:03:16.840> craftsmanship<00:03:17.640> especially

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
was some good craftsmanship especially

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.210 
was some good craftsmanship especially
for<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:18.940> plush<00:03:19.450> that's<00:03:19.840> found<00:03:20.560> in<00:03:20.739> a<00:03:20.799> UFO

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
for a plush that's found in a UFO

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.350 
for a plush that's found in a UFO
catcher<00:03:23.489> swaddling<00:03:24.489> is<00:03:24.670> probably<00:03:24.970> one<00:03:25.209> of<00:03:25.239> the

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
catcher swaddling is probably one of the

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.780 
catcher swaddling is probably one of the
easier<00:03:25.810> ones<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:26.200> make<00:03:26.380> but<00:03:26.680> not<00:03:27.310> saying<00:03:27.640> it's

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
easier ones to make but not saying it's

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.910 
easier ones to make but not saying it's
the<00:03:27.910> easiest<00:03:28.330> thing<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.750> make<00:03:28.930> cuz<00:03:29.170> even<00:03:29.560> she

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
the easiest thing to make cuz even she

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.000 
the easiest thing to make cuz even she
has<00:03:30.040> some<00:03:30.250> complexity<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.330> a<00:03:31.360> design<00:03:33.150> but<00:03:34.150> yeah

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
has some complexity to a design but yeah

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.520 
has some complexity to a design but yeah
overall<00:03:36.239> I'm<00:03:37.239> very<00:03:37.299> happy<00:03:38.140> that<00:03:38.230> I<00:03:38.260> finally
