our<00:01:11.280> year<00:01:11.580> doing<00:01:11.940> urban<00:01:12.210> build<00:01:12.540> which<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.050> I'm

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
our year doing urban build which is I'm

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.110 
our year doing urban build which is I'm
sure<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> lot<00:01:14.190> of<00:01:14.250> people<00:01:14.520> have<00:01:14.610> heard<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.909> but

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
a house and it's a competition so

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.560 
a house and it's a competition so
there's<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.610> break<00:01:20.790> off<00:01:20.970> into<00:01:21.150> groups<00:01:21.240> of

three or four and then the winning

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.200 
three or four and then the winning
proposal<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.650> actually<00:01:26.190> built<00:01:26.490> by<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.880> kids

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
proposal is actually built by the kids

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.930 
framing it out right now we have this
huge<00:01:41.369> idea<00:01:41.760> that<00:01:42.090> kind<00:01:42.510> of<00:01:42.659> risque<00:01:43.470> how<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
huge idea that kind of risque how the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.160 
huge idea that kind of risque how the
neutral<00:01:44.940> ground<00:01:44.970> works<00:01:45.390> it's<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.960> little

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
neutral ground works it's a little

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.780 
neutral ground works it's a little
controversial<00:01:46.530> because<00:01:46.920> neutral<00:01:47.490> ground<00:01:47.670> is

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
controversial because neutral ground is

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.260 
controversial because neutral ground is
such<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.390> strong<00:01:48.659> image<00:01:49.380> here<00:01:49.740> but

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
such a like this strong image here but

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.969 
such a like this strong image here but
it's<00:01:51.270> kind<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.510> cut<00:01:51.659> off<00:01:51.780> by<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.170> cars<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:52.860> we

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
it's kind of cut off by the cars so we

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.920 
it's kind of cut off by the cars so we
want<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.250> bring<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.580> public<00:01:53.909> stake<00:01:54.119> public

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
want to bring that public stake public

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.490 
want to bring that public stake public
space<00:01:55.110> back<00:01:55.409> into<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:57.119> street<00:01:57.500> inside

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
space back into like the street inside

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.920 
space back into like the street inside
law<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.909> have<00:02:00.119> an<00:02:00.210> idea<00:02:00.479> where<00:02:00.689> I'd<00:02:00.780> like

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
law like I have an idea where I'd like

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.649 
law like I have an idea where I'd like
to<00:02:01.110> do

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
to do

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.749 
to do
a grocery<00:02:02.590> store<00:02:02.890> that's<00:02:03.219> mixed<00:02:03.609> with<00:02:03.640> a

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
a grocery store that's mixed with a

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.700 
a grocery store that's mixed with a
farmers<00:02:04.210> market<00:02:04.240> mixed<00:02:04.960> with<00:02:05.079> restaurant<00:02:05.590> so

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
farmers market mixed with restaurant so

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.499 
farmers market mixed with restaurant so
it's<00:02:05.859> like<00:02:05.979> this<00:02:06.159> new<00:02:06.399> mixed-use<00:02:06.909> kind<00:02:07.450> of

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
it's like this new mixed-use kind of

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.330 
it's like this new mixed-use kind of
development<00:02:08.050> which<00:02:08.410> like<00:02:08.679> I<00:02:08.890> mean<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.160> area

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
development which like I mean the area

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.610 
development which like I mean the area
doesn't<00:02:10.149> even<00:02:10.239> have<00:02:10.509> any<00:02:10.690> grocery<00:02:11.140> stores<00:02:11.440> I

doesn't even have any grocery stores I

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.470 
doesn't even have any grocery stores I
mean<00:02:11.769> this<00:02:11.920> is<00:02:12.129> like<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.849> plan<00:02:13.120> which<00:02:13.360> was

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
mean this is like the plan which was

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.920 
mean this is like the plan which was
developed<00:02:13.930> already<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.500> is<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:14.920> mean<00:02:15.610> in<00:02:15.930> there

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
developed already and is I mean in there

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.240 
developed already and is I mean in there
they're<00:02:17.260> planning<00:02:17.620> on<00:02:17.680> building<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:18.129> they

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
they're planning on building it they
