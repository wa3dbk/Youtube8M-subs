there that I think that would make a
nice<00:00:38.940> book<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.989> good<00:00:40.559> book<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.219> think<00:00:41.550> that

you know at some point of course you
know<00:05:54.970> we<00:05:55.090> have<00:05:55.120> to<00:05:55.600> the<00:05:56.260> mainstream<00:05:56.470> media<00:05:56.979> is

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
know we have to the mainstream media is

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.820 
know we have to the mainstream media is
going<00:05:57.340> to<00:05:57.550> focus<00:05:57.850> its<00:05:58.360> its<00:05:58.720> magnifying<00:05:59.500> glass

going to focus its its magnifying glass
on<00:06:00.040> us<00:06:00.190> and<00:06:00.370> there's<00:06:00.520> nothing<00:06:00.669> that<00:06:00.940> we<00:06:01.030> can<00:06:01.060> do

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
on us and there's nothing that we can do

on us and there's nothing that we can do
about<00:06:01.570> that<00:06:01.630> but<00:06:02.590> i<00:06:02.650> think<00:06:02.800> that<00:06:03.430> you<00:06:03.880> know<00:06:04.320> we

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
about that but i think that you know we

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.860 
about that but i think that you know we
we<00:06:05.950> should<00:06:06.400> be<00:06:06.520> very<00:06:06.729> suspicious<00:06:07.060> of<00:06:07.479> this<00:06:07.630> i

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
we should be very suspicious of this i

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.190 
we should be very suspicious of this i
think<00:06:08.290> that<00:06:08.620> we<00:06:08.740> shouldn't<00:06:08.950> we<00:06:09.820> shouldn't

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
think that we shouldn't we shouldn't
