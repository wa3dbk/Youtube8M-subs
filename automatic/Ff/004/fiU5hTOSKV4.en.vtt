00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
down and try these out I basically just

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.920 
down and try these out I basically just
go<00:04:04.440> by<00:04:04.650> word<00:04:04.890> of<00:04:05.010> mouth<00:04:05.070> and<00:04:05.550> then<00:04:05.700> um<00:04:06.540> what<00:04:06.900> I

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
go by word of mouth and then um what I
