and a couple of reasons why this is kind
of<00:03:07.739> cool<00:03:07.920> play<00:03:08.609> one<00:03:08.850> is<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.090> zoom<00:03:09.269> here<00:03:09.480> is

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
of cool play one is the zoom here is

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.750 
of cool play one is the zoom here is
played<00:03:09.829> upside<00:03:10.829> down<00:03:11.070> with<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:11.519> guitar

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
played upside down with a guitar

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.270 
played upside down with a guitar
basically<00:03:12.420> this<00:03:12.630> angle<00:03:12.989> here<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.890> what<00:03:14.190> he

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
basically this angle here and what he

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.390 
basically this angle here and what he
said<00:03:14.489> he<00:03:14.609> liked<00:03:14.850> was<00:03:15.209> that<00:03:15.390> he<00:03:15.450> could<00:03:15.570> changed

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
said he liked was that he could changed

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.860 
said he liked was that he could changed
going<00:03:17.400> from<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.640> triple<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.239> bait<00:03:18.540> to

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
going from the triple to the bait to

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.080 
going from the triple to the bait to
their<00:03:19.049> base<00:03:19.260> like<00:03:19.680> that<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:20.160> also<00:03:20.579> right<00:03:20.790> here

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
their base like that and also right here

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.509 
their base like that and also right here
is<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.329> volume<00:03:21.690> knob<00:03:21.900> so

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
is the volume knob so

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:30.959 
is the volume knob so
the<00:03:24.969> way<00:03:25.090> bars<00:03:25.420> a<00:03:25.510> little<00:03:25.959> bit<00:03:26.109> weird<00:03:28.829> area<00:03:29.969> and

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:30.969 
the way bars a little bit weird area and

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:32.160 
the way bars a little bit weird area and
of<00:03:31.030> course<00:03:31.209> right<00:03:31.629> there<00:03:31.810> is<00:03:31.900> going<00:03:32.049> to<00:03:32.109> be

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
of course right there is going to be

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.839 
of course right there is going to be
where<00:03:32.349> the<00:03:32.530> jack<00:03:32.799> goes<00:03:33.010> into<00:03:33.689> but<00:03:34.689> you<00:03:34.959> know

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
where the jack goes into but you know

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.959 
where the jack goes into but you know
for<00:03:36.849> an<00:03:36.939> expensive<00:03:37.299> guitar<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:39.459> see<00:03:39.609> sort<00:03:39.939> of

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:39.969 
for an expensive guitar to see sort of

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:41.309 
for an expensive guitar to see sort of
how<00:03:40.030> Jimmy<00:03:40.540> hitters<00:03:40.719> with<00:03:40.810> a<00:03:40.870> boy<00:03:40.989> to<00:03:41.049> play<00:03:41.260> the

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:43.689 
guitar it's kind of cool and if I need

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:44.879 
guitar it's kind of cool and if I need
to<00:03:43.750> change<00:03:43.780> back<00:03:44.079> to<00:03:44.109> a<00:03:44.200> left-handed<00:03:44.560> guitar

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
to change back to a left-handed guitar

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.649 
to change back to a left-handed guitar
it's<00:03:45.280> no<00:03:45.400> problem<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:46.209> one<00:03:46.359> thing<00:03:46.510> that's

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
it's no problem the one thing that's

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:47.940 
it's no problem the one thing that's
kind<00:03:46.750> of<00:03:46.840> interesting<00:03:47.049> is<00:03:47.379> it's<00:03:47.680> kind<00:03:47.920> of

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
kind of interesting is it's kind of

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.649 
kind of interesting is it's kind of
weird<00:03:48.219> to<00:03:48.400> go<00:03:48.579> this<00:03:48.819> way<00:03:49.060> instead<00:03:49.209> of<00:03:49.389> that<00:03:49.480> way

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
weird to go this way instead of that way

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:52.379 
weird to go this way instead of that way
on<00:03:50.079> a<00:03:50.109> Stratocaster<00:03:51.069> so<00:03:52.000> it's<00:03:52.120> taking<00:03:52.329> a

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
on a Stratocaster so it's taking a

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:53.789 
on a Stratocaster so it's taking a
little<00:03:52.599> bit<00:03:52.900> of<00:03:52.959> time<00:03:53.109> to<00:03:53.260> get<00:03:53.349> used<00:03:53.500> to<00:03:53.650> it

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
little bit of time to get used to it

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.050 
little bit of time to get used to it
these<00:03:54.069> are<00:03:54.219> new<00:03:54.310> strings<00:03:54.639> and<00:03:56.489> so<00:03:57.489> forth<00:03:57.760> one

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
these are new strings and so forth one

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.039 
these are new strings and so forth one
other<00:03:58.150> thing<00:03:58.389> let<00:03:58.510> me<00:03:58.540> talk<00:03:58.720> about<00:03:58.750> the

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
other thing let me talk about the

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.330 
other thing let me talk about the
hitting<00:03:59.859> the<00:03:59.950> nut<00:04:00.189> here<00:04:02.040> actually<00:04:03.040> needed<00:04:03.250> hit

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
hitting the nut here actually needed hit

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.970 
hitting the nut here actually needed hit
it<00:04:03.400> pretty<00:04:03.669> hard<00:04:04.209> about<00:04:04.569> three<00:04:04.959> times<00:04:05.590> or<00:04:05.859> how

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
it pretty hard about three times or how

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.830 
it pretty hard about three times or how
many<00:04:06.159> times<00:04:06.340> I<00:04:06.519> wanted<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.120> kind<00:04:07.599> of<00:04:07.629> solve

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
many times I wanted to kind of solve

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.800 
many times I wanted to kind of solve
like<00:04:07.989> 20<00:04:08.349> times<00:04:08.560> maybe<00:04:09.370> 40<00:04:09.760> times<00:04:10.000> and<00:04:10.269> then

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
like 20 times maybe 40 times and then

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.569 
like 20 times maybe 40 times and then
that<00:04:11.349> was<00:04:11.469> either<00:04:11.590> way<00:04:11.799> to<00:04:12.069> get<00:04:12.219> that<00:04:12.370> net<00:04:12.549> up

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
that was either way to get that net up

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.809 
that was either way to get that net up
there<00:04:12.939> a<00:04:13.120> bit<00:04:13.750> and<00:04:13.900> I<00:04:14.590> would<00:04:15.219> be<00:04:15.310> careful<00:04:15.489> I

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
there a bit and I would be careful I

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.580 
there a bit and I would be careful I
wouldn't<00:04:16.180> do<00:04:16.269> this<00:04:16.359> on<00:04:16.479> a<00:04:16.539> guitar<00:04:17.019> as<00:04:17.139> super

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
wouldn't do this on a guitar as super

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.589 
wouldn't do this on a guitar as super
expensive<00:04:17.859> you<00:04:18.220> know<00:04:18.340> hundred<00:04:19.120> dollar<00:04:19.239> job

don't mind most people usually break the
nut<00:04:34.870> so<00:04:35.289> I<00:04:35.740> would<00:04:36.070> have<00:04:36.190> a<00:04:36.250> replacement<00:04:36.729> or<00:04:37.120> at

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:42.519 
anyways some minor little things on the

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:44.309 
anyways some minor little things on the
guitar<00:04:42.610> I<00:04:43.149> probably<00:04:43.749> play<00:04:44.019> right<00:04:44.229> a<00:04:44.259> little

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:44.319 
guitar I probably play right a little

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:47.249 
guitar I probably play right a little
bit<00:04:44.439> of<00:04:44.589> intonation<00:04:44.769> on<00:04:45.779> on<00:04:46.779> the<00:04:46.959> guitar

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
bit of intonation on on the guitar

00:04:47.259 --> 00:05:02.550 
bit of intonation on on the guitar
they're<00:04:48.099> going<00:04:48.369> but

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.110 

so<00:05:03.130> there<00:05:03.280> we<00:05:03.370> go<00:05:03.990> it's<00:05:04.990> plane<00:05:05.260> and<00:05:05.790> right<00:05:06.790> now

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
so there we go it's plane and right now

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.230 
so there we go it's plane and right now
