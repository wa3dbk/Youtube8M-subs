episode<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:17.880> index<00:00:18.300> dot<00:00:18.480> HTML<00:00:19.050> file<00:00:19.260> so

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
episode so that index dot HTML file so

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.170 
episode so that index dot HTML file so
let's<00:00:20.250> get<00:00:20.430> started

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
let's get started

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.040 
let's get started
so<00:00:22.930> here's<00:00:23.470> the<00:00:23.680> main<00:00:23.830> directory<00:00:24.400> of<00:00:24.490> my

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
so here's the main directory of my

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.960 
so here's the main directory of my
folder<00:00:26.050> of<00:00:26.140> all<00:00:26.320> my<00:00:26.619> files<00:00:27.189> in<00:00:27.369> from<00:00:27.550> a<00:00:27.610> website

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
folder of all my files in from a website

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.600 
folder of all my files in from a website
we've<00:00:28.449> got<00:00:28.630> the<00:00:28.720> index<00:00:29.050> here<00:00:29.289> the<00:00:29.650> info<00:00:30.310> I<00:00:30.369> had

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
we've got the index here the info I had

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.549 
we've got the index here the info I had
for<00:00:30.820> it<00:00:30.849> and<00:00:31.210> basically<00:00:32.050> going<00:00:32.320> to<00:00:32.379> create

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
for it and basically going to create

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.560 
for it and basically going to create
folder<00:00:32.829> called<00:00:33.010> images<00:00:33.129> and<00:00:33.640> inside<00:00:34.420> there

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
folder called images and inside there

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.000 
folder called images and inside there
we're<00:00:34.720> going<00:00:34.840> to<00:00:34.900> put<00:00:35.020> in<00:00:35.110> our<00:00:35.170> header<00:00:35.410> now<00:00:35.949> we

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
we're going to put in our header now we

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.930 
we're going to put in our header now we
made<00:00:36.400> the<00:00:36.930> width<00:00:37.930> of<00:00:38.140> our<00:00:38.290> main<00:00:38.590> content<00:00:39.100> 960

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
made the width of our main content 960

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.240 
made the width of our main content 960
so<00:00:40.300> you<00:00:40.360> want<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.600> width<00:00:40.750> to<00:00:40.870> be<00:00:40.960> 960<00:00:41.739> and<00:00:41.920> the

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
so you want the width to be 960 and the

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.430 
so you want the width to be 960 and the
height<00:00:42.460> I've<00:00:42.790> put<00:00:42.940> 150<00:00:43.720> but<00:00:43.930> that<00:00:44.260> could<00:00:44.410> be

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
height I've put 150 but that could be

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.619 
height I've put 150 but that could be
whatever<00:00:44.710> you<00:00:45.100> want<00:00:45.309> but<00:00:45.940> try<00:00:46.210> not<00:00:46.239> to<00:00:46.420> get

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
whatever you want but try not to get

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.850 
whatever you want but try not to get
larger<00:00:47.110> than<00:00:47.320> half<00:00:47.710> of<00:00:47.860> that<00:00:47.920> so<00:00:48.360> 960<00:00:49.360> by<00:00:49.860> 400

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
larger than half of that so 960 by 400

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.650 
larger than half of that so 960 by 400
and<00:00:51.180> let's<00:00:52.180> see

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
and let's see

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.229 
and let's see
but<00:00:52.930> 470<00:00:53.769> 500<00:00:54.100> don't<00:00:54.610> get<00:00:54.729> any<00:00:54.850> bigger<00:00:55.059> than

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
but 470 500 don't get any bigger than

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.259 
but 470 500 don't get any bigger than
that<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:56.890> that's<00:00:57.280> basically<00:00:57.549> my<00:00:57.790> header<00:00:58.030> is

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
that but that's basically my header is

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.609 
that but that's basically my header is
so<00:00:58.629> we<00:00:59.260> have<00:00:59.650> our<00:00:59.799> header<00:01:00.430> in<00:01:00.729> the<00:01:00.970> locals

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:01.619 
so we have our header in the locals

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:04.549 
so we have our header in the locals
folder<00:01:02.619> of<00:01:02.799> our<00:01:03.010> website

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
folder of our website

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.550 
folder of our website
so<00:01:05.250> now<00:01:05.430> I'm<00:01:05.489> going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.820> open<00:01:06.390> my<00:01:06.450> index<00:01:06.840> file

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
so now I'm going to open my index file

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.219 
so now I'm going to open my index file
so<00:01:07.770> go<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.340> files<00:01:08.610> find<00:01:09.540> your<00:01:09.780> index<00:01:10.080> you

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
so go to the files find your index you

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.320 
so go to the files find your index you
see<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> images<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.100> here<00:01:11.280> correctly<00:01:11.790> which

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
see the images in here correctly which

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.590 
see the images in here correctly which
go<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.659> index<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.530> have<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.700> open<00:01:15.180> ready<00:01:15.420> to

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
go to index and have that open ready to

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.460 
go to index and have that open ready to
put<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.810> our<00:01:15.930> header

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
put in our header

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.410 
put in our header
so<00:01:18.070> how<00:01:18.370> we're<00:01:18.580> going<00:01:18.670> to<00:01:18.760> input<00:01:18.910> this<00:01:19.150> image

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
so how we're going to input this image

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.550 
so how we're going to input this image
is<00:01:19.570> going<00:01:19.720> to<00:01:19.840> be<00:01:19.900> the<00:01:20.020> easiest<00:01:20.350> way<00:01:20.530> possible

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
is going to be the easiest way possible

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.340 
is going to be the easiest way possible
and<00:01:21.070> that<00:01:21.130> is<00:01:21.280> to<00:01:21.430> find<00:01:21.610> your<00:01:21.820> image<00:01:22.060> and<00:01:22.450> we're

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
and that is to find your image and we're

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.350 
and that is to find your image and we're
going<00:01:23.380> to<00:01:23.560> hold<00:01:23.830> that<00:01:23.980> hold<00:01:24.640> left<00:01:24.940> click<00:01:25.030> can't

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
going to hold that hold left click can't

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.780 
going to hold that hold left click can't
hold<00:01:25.570> that<00:01:25.660> and<00:01:25.960> drag<00:01:26.230> it<00:01:26.410> onto<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:27.100> header

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
hold that and drag it onto the header

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.110 
hold that and drag it onto the header
tag<00:01:28.270> so<00:01:29.200> that<00:01:29.320> was<00:01:29.440> at<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.680> top<00:01:30.120> alternate

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120

what this image code says is that this
image<00:01:53.140> source<00:01:53.890> sort<00:01:54.220> of<00:01:54.340> image<00:01:55.150> we<00:01:55.270> use<00:01:55.420> in

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
image source sort of image we use in

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.630 
image source sort of image we use in
this<00:01:55.660> inside<00:01:56.230> the<00:01:56.500> folder<00:01:56.740> images<00:01:56.890> slash

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
this inside the folder images slash

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.790 
this inside the folder images slash
header<00:01:57.910> dot<00:01:58.090> PNG<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.990> width<00:01:59.230> is<00:01:59.470> going<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.710> be

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
header dot PNG the width is going to be

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.680 
header dot PNG the width is going to be
96<00:02:00.190> teks<00:02:00.460> that's<00:02:00.670> what<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.120> width<00:02:01.270> of<00:02:01.390> it<00:02:01.510> was

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
96 teks that's what the width of it was

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.810 
96 teks that's what the width of it was
and<00:02:01.900> then<00:02:02.200> Heights<00:02:02.500> 150<00:02:03.100> except<00:02:03.430> what<00:02:03.580> it<00:02:03.670> was

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
and then Heights 150 except what it was

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.930 
and then Heights 150 except what it was
so<00:02:04.270> if<00:02:04.330> you<00:02:04.420> put<00:02:04.600> 150<00:02:05.170> to<00:02:05.290> 100

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
so if you put 150 to 100

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.130 
so if you put 150 to 100
you<00:02:07.000> can<00:02:07.150> see<00:02:07.300> it<00:02:07.390> squash<00:02:07.690> that's<00:02:07.900> could<00:02:08.110> be

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
you can see it squash that's could be

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.109 
you can see it squash that's could be
changed<00:02:08.500> to<00:02:08.619> side<00:02:08.800> so<00:02:09.550> we<00:02:09.640> can<00:02:09.760> also<00:02:09.880> change

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
changed to side so we can also change

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.550 
changed to side so we can also change
the<00:02:10.330> height<00:02:10.510> and<00:02:10.690> width<00:02:10.810> here<00:02:10.960> so<00:02:11.230> I'll<00:02:11.320> put<00:02:11.470> it

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
the height and width here so I'll put it

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.270 
the height and width here so I'll put it
back<00:02:11.650> 250<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.840> that's<00:02:13.840> our<00:02:14.110> header<00:02:14.530> inputted

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
back 250 and that's our header inputted

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.370 
back 250 and that's our header inputted
into<00:02:15.490> our<00:02:15.970> main<00:02:16.810> page

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
into our main page

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.680 
into our main page
so<00:02:19.220> in<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.460> lot<00:02:19.610> of<00:02:19.700> websites<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:20.480> would<00:02:20.600> have

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
so in a lot of websites you would have

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.330 
so in a lot of websites you would have
seen<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.170> header<00:02:21.380> when<00:02:21.800> you<00:02:21.890> click<00:02:22.160> it

which<00:02:39.950> we're<00:02:40.190> already<00:02:40.550> on<00:02:40.760> so<00:02:41.300> if<00:02:41.390> you<00:02:41.480> look<00:02:41.570> at

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
which we're already on so if you look at

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.180 
which we're already on so if you look at
the<00:02:41.750> code<00:02:41.960> for<00:02:42.110> this<00:02:42.230> it's<00:02:42.530> see<00:02:42.740> it's<00:02:43.010> got<00:02:43.160> a

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
the code for this it's see it's got a

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.730 
the code for this it's see it's got a
tag<00:02:43.790> that<00:02:43.850> says<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.390> which<00:02:44.750> means<00:02:45.020> link<00:02:45.260> and

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
tag that says a which means link and

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.320 
tag that says a which means link and
then<00:02:45.830> hate<00:02:46.010> ref<00:02:46.280> is<00:02:46.400> what<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.790> link<00:02:47.150> is<00:02:47.180> going

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
then hate ref is what the link is going

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.910 
then hate ref is what the link is going
to<00:02:47.390> be<00:02:47.450> then<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:47.960> speech<00:02:48.170> box<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:48.530> put<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:48.860> so

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
to be then the speech box you put it so

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.040 
to be then the speech box you put it so
index.html<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:49.880> then<00:02:50.480> we<00:02:50.570> put<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.780> image

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
index.html and then we put the image

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.080 
index.html and then we put the image
code<00:02:51.590> inside<00:02:51.980> of<00:02:52.130> that<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:52.400> then<00:02:52.640> we<00:02:52.730> end<00:02:52.940> that

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
code inside of that and then we end that

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.900 
code inside of that and then we end that
link<00:02:53.360> so<00:02:53.420> anything<00:02:53.930> inside<00:02:54.170> those<00:02:54.440> days<00:02:55.070> means
