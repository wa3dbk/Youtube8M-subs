00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
problem with wearable technology is that

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.770

unlike<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.610> past<00:00:41.820> where<00:00:42.180> Apple<00:00:42.570> was

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
unlike in the past where Apple was

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.600 
unlike in the past where Apple was
always<00:00:43.079> loaded<00:00:43.350> as<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.129> innovator

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
always loaded as the innovator

ipod ipad and even the iphone to a large

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.479 
ipod ipad and even the iphone to a large
extent<00:00:51.510> was<00:00:51.780> really<00:00:52.289> around<00:00:53.070> there<00:00:53.340> as<00:00:53.430> a

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
extent was really around there as a

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.389 
extent was really around there as a
first<00:00:53.850> touchscreen<00:00:54.570> smartphone<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:56.100> problem

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
first touchscreen smartphone the problem

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.490 
first touchscreen smartphone the problem
of<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> watch<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.000> they<00:00:57.420> not<00:00:57.960> only<00:00:58.170> not

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
of the watch is that they not only not

of the watch is that they not only not
first<00:00:58.890> but<00:00:59.520> they're<00:00:59.699> already<00:00:59.879> some<00:01:00.329> very

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
first but they're already some very

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.399 
first but they're already some very
compelling<00:01:01.070> good<00:01:02.070> smart<00:01:02.820> watches<00:01:03.510> out<00:01:04.049> there

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.870 

problem<00:01:07.409> for<00:01:07.530> Apple<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.040> its<00:01:08.310> SmartWatch

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
problem for Apple is that its SmartWatch

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.899 
problem for Apple is that its SmartWatch
only<00:01:09.330> works<00:01:09.540> with<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.080> iphone<00:01:10.110> yeah<00:01:10.909> we're

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
only works with the iphone yeah we're

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.460 
only works with the iphone yeah we're
that's<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.360> shrinking<00:01:12.780> market<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.439> other

that's a shrinking market the other
smartwatches<00:01:14.390> work<00:01:15.390> with<00:01:15.689> most<00:01:16.200> other

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
smartwatches work with most other

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.580 
smartwatches work with most other
devices<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.850> fact<00:01:18.060> if<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.330> run<00:01:18.810> down<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.140> cna

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
what will that translate to in south

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.369 
what will that translate to in south
african<00:02:09.539> rands<00:02:10.539> that<00:02:10.629> are<00:02:10.750> rapidly<00:02:11.230> becoming

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
african rands that are rapidly becoming

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.089 
african rands that are rapidly becoming
worthless<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:12.879> know<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:14.349> think<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.830> might<00:02:15.040> be

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
worthless you know you think it might be

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.240 
worthless you know you think it might be
300<00:02:15.790> 3<00:02:15.940> 30<00:02:16.330> thousand<00:02:16.900> dragon<00:02:17.379> but<00:02:17.890> that's<00:02:18.069> just

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
300 3 30 thousand dragon but that's just

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.640 
300 3 30 thousand dragon but that's just
straight<00:02:18.730> conversion<00:02:19.360> I<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.629> suspect<00:02:20.380> will<00:02:20.500> be

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
straight conversion I I suspect will be

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.740 
straight conversion I I suspect will be
significantly<00:02:21.400> more<00:02:21.489> than<00:02:21.849> that<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:22.209> mean

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
significantly more than that I mean

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.690 
significantly more than that I mean
think<00:02:23.260> about<00:02:23.319> it<00:02:23.470> would<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.099> spend<00:02:24.400> four

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
think about it would you spend four

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.420 
think about it would you spend four
thousand<00:02:25.120> Rand<00:02:25.269> on<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.569> watch<00:02:26.430> essentially

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
thousand Rand on a watch essentially

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.559 
thousand Rand on a watch essentially
that's<00:02:27.550> more<00:02:27.819> than<00:02:27.940> what<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.120> pay<00:02:28.330> for<00:02:28.510> this

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
that's more than what you pay for this

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.460 
that's more than what you pay for this
iPad<00:02:28.989> yeah<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:29.950> is<00:02:30.099> true<00:02:30.900> now<00:02:31.900> is<00:02:32.080> this<00:02:32.260> watch

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
iPad yeah that is true now is this watch

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.039 
iPad yeah that is true now is this watch

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
couldn't put it on an arm and really

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.120 
couldn't put it on an arm and really
test<00:03:21.489> it<00:03:21.639> up<00:03:21.819> and<00:03:22.090> that<00:03:23.049> kind<00:03:23.410> of<00:03:23.530> gives<00:03:23.769> me<00:03:23.889> the

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
test it up and that kind of gives me the

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.740 
test it up and that kind of gives me the
impression<00:03:24.220> that<00:03:24.579> maybe<00:03:24.819> even<00:03:25.180> Apple<00:03:25.600> is<00:03:25.720> a

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
impression that maybe even Apple is a

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.599 
impression that maybe even Apple is a
bit<00:03:25.959> nervous<00:03:26.139> that<00:03:26.380> it<00:03:26.709> may<00:03:26.889> not<00:03:27.100> work<00:03:27.160> as

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
bit nervous that it may not work as

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.670 
bit nervous that it may not work as
perfectly<00:03:28.239> as<00:03:28.359> they'd<00:03:28.810> like<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.079> we've<00:03:29.470> seen

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
perfectly as they'd like and we've seen

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.400 
perfectly as they'd like and we've seen
companies<00:03:30.389> like<00:03:31.389> some<00:03:31.660> time<00:03:31.870> for<00:03:32.019> example

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
companies like some time for example

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.830 
companies like some time for example
struggle<00:03:32.859> with<00:03:33.069> that<00:03:33.519> first<00:03:33.910> generation<00:03:34.150> of

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
struggle with that first generation of

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.559 
struggle with that first generation of
wearable<00:03:35.590> technology<00:03:36.130> that<00:03:36.310> kind<00:03:37.150> of<00:03:37.299> works

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
wearable technology that kind of works

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.870 
wearable technology that kind of works
but<00:03:38.470> not<00:03:38.650> one<00:03:39.010> hundred<00:03:39.160> percent<00:03:39.370> of<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.790> time

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
but not one hundred percent of the time

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.240 
but not one hundred percent of the time
and<00:03:40.209> not<00:03:40.299> perfectly<00:03:40.780> so<00:03:41.049> that<00:03:41.079> is<00:03:41.920> going<00:03:42.100> to<00:03:42.160> be

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
and not perfectly so that is going to be

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.580 
and not perfectly so that is going to be
a<00:03:42.280> big<00:03:42.459> challenge<00:03:42.639> and<00:03:42.940> we<00:03:43.090> will<00:03:43.389> only<00:03:43.690> see<00:03:44.109> how

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
a big challenge and we will only see how

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.229 
a big challenge and we will only see how
it<00:03:44.799> performs<00:03:45.100> when<00:03:45.459> it's<00:03:45.670> widely<00:03:45.970> available

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
it performs when it's widely available

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.979 
it performs when it's widely available
in<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.690> market<00:03:47.049> now<00:03:47.470> in<00:03:48.340> your<00:03:48.579> opinion<00:03:48.670> it<00:03:49.269> in
