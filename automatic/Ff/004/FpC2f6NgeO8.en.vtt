alone<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.330> might<00:00:30.660> just<00:00:30.929> do<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.170> cheap

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
alone I might just do the cheap

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.920 
alone I might just do the cheap
two-player<00:00:32.369> thing<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.000> have<00:00:33.510> her<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.780> the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
I'm feeling it will okay maybe not

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.850 
I'm feeling it will okay maybe not
I<00:02:24.960> think<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.350> kind<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.650> overshot<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.370> there<00:02:27.860> but

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
I think I kind of overshot it there but

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.860 
I think I kind of overshot it there but
either<00:02:28.980> way<00:02:29.250> pose<00:02:29.580> are<00:02:29.910> super<00:02:30.300> easy<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.600> kill

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
either way pose are super easy to kill

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.090 
either way pose are super easy to kill
cuz<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.230> should<00:02:31.350> wait<00:02:31.470> for<00:02:31.710> them<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.950> shoot

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
cuz you should wait for them to shoot

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.070 
cuz you should wait for them to shoot
some<00:02:32.370> sort<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.670> blast<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.450> then<00:02:33.570> you<00:02:33.720> attack

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
some sort of blast and then you attack

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.010 
some sort of blast and then you attack
him<00:02:34.320> from<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.530> rear<00:02:34.860> end<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.510> do<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.720> rush

chest doesn't appear in the like to keep

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.879 
chest doesn't appear in the like to keep
your<00:05:37.770> in<00:05:38.090> but<00:05:39.090> then<00:05:39.330> right<00:05:40.260> after<00:05:40.500> this<00:05:40.590> cuts

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:40.889 
your in but then right after this cuts

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:43.129 
your in but then right after this cuts
in<00:05:41.070> here<00:05:41.400> when<00:05:41.970> we<00:05:42.090> see<00:05:42.270> Agatha<00:05:42.660> holding<00:05:43.020> it

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
in here when we see Agatha holding it

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.440 
in here when we see Agatha holding it
we're<00:05:43.470> not<00:05:43.590> there<00:05:43.889> we're<00:05:44.400> back<00:05:44.610> in<00:05:44.849> the<00:05:45.240> room

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
we're not there we're back in the room

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.029 
we're not there we're back in the room
we<00:05:45.810> were<00:05:45.960> in<00:05:45.990> so<00:05:46.440> it's<00:05:46.530> kind<00:05:46.710> of<00:05:46.740> weird<00:05:46.860> how

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
we were in so it's kind of weird how

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.040 
we were in so it's kind of weird how
that<00:05:47.190> works<00:05:47.510> so<00:05:48.510> you<00:05:48.599> just<00:05:48.690> don't<00:05:48.780> want<00:05:48.990> to

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
that works so you just don't want to

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.850 
that works so you just don't want to
animate<00:05:49.349> it<00:05:49.650> or<00:05:49.860> something<00:05:50.310> like<00:05:51.530> have<00:05:52.530> each

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
animate it or something like have each

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.620 
animate it or something like have each
chest<00:05:53.280> up<00:05:53.430> here<00:05:53.550> in<00:05:53.639> the<00:05:53.700> exact<00:05:54.060> room<00:05:54.360> you<00:05:54.479> were

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
chest up here in the exact room you were

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.240 
chest up here in the exact room you were
in<00:05:54.840> I<00:05:55.110> think<00:05:55.169> it'd<00:05:55.380> be<00:05:55.410> a<00:05:55.530> little<00:05:55.680> difficult<00:05:55.950> I

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
in I think it'd be a little difficult I

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.080 
in I think it'd be a little difficult I
have<00:05:56.280> no<00:05:56.580> idea

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
have no idea

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.360 
have no idea
there's<00:05:57.720> a<00:05:57.810> small<00:05:58.139> subtle<00:05:58.620> thing<00:05:58.800> I<00:05:58.919> noticed
