 and also a teacher who comes up 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.180

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.840
 the Italians especially of those typhois 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.130

 arrives at jae c, the most beautiful and legendary number that is 100 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.180
 and that somehow marks a very long road traveled 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.310
 only with highs and lows 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.310

 the 21st century with products of excellence with a man at the world level 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.870

 due to differences of opinion with the administrative committee and supervisions 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.409
 euro aburto corp left the company in 1909 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.979
 and quickly established a second car company in chicago 

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:57.709
 because sepes was already in use and a protected trademark chose to 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.809
 production of his stamp in Latin to give name to his new company then

 technology of motors and suspensions to start channeling more energy 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:28.920
 In the area 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.729
 of safety and ease of handling and emilio of 23 and a type m 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:37.899

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:39.139

 October 1909 the sec the sales of the extensive and expensive models of six and 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.319
 eight cylinders collapsed 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.849
 the owner of hair responded this commission of oli to develop a 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.889
 small rear-wheel-drive cadore car that was launched in 1931 with great 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:05.749
 success 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:08.689
 at the request of the state bank of Saxony 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:12.299
 I feel Aaron emotion again the audi marks and better 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:19.199
 together with de carole they formed although union aje on June 29, 1932 and this 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.300
 new entity simultaneously ended with an agreement with its own flag 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.560
 decision the usufructs of its automotive division 

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:34.020
 to increase the profile of your live audience of 34 new company decided 

00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:37.730
 be interested in the races of the highest level grand prix and wishes 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.680
 years 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.620
 he saw how his auth union cars named city to offer square 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.830
 they won convincing races and championships and remembered world 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.830
 around the world but especially euros 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:53.629
 one of the keys to success the still young confusion was the allocation of 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:57.059
 specific markets for each of the brands says as well as the 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:58.080
 forgotten 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.720
 specifically to mark something different 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.050
 lupus osoro be the favorite up to the mild set a medium size car 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.099
 -can be that the new group was able to stabilize 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.099
 your benefit 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:13.639
 yes 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.199
 6 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.889
 this challenge is probably going to really make me personally liked 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.360
 a lot because it has a lot to do with what week after week 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.990
 I call them to the cars that are the race cars 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.449
 race car that make us feel different things but pardoned motor 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.070
 who is responsible 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.330
 In short, there is no race to race cars 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.640
 cars without automotive industry without any doubt but at the same time the cars of 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.740
 career are those that feed motivational talent new technologies and 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.159
 that make automotive endesa can sell 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:50.059
