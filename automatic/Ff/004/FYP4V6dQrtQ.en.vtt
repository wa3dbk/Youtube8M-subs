00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
off and put this inside now you're going

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.190 
off and put this inside now you're going
to<00:01:25.380> need<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.799> wash<00:01:26.549> off<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.909> bristles<00:01:27.600> with

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
to need to wash off the bristles with

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.590 
to need to wash off the bristles with
acetone<00:01:29.159> once<00:01:29.729> you're<00:01:29.880> done<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.270> put<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.479> back

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
acetone once you're done to put it back

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.850 
acetone once you're done to put it back
in<00:01:30.780> because<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.170> bristles<00:01:31.500> will<00:01:31.650> have

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
in because the bristles will have

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.880 
in because the bristles will have
basically<00:01:32.729> dried<00:01:33.210> together<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.290> it'll<00:01:34.770> be<00:01:34.860> a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
basically dried together and it'll be a

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.950 
basically dried together and it'll be a
one<00:01:35.130> clump<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.700> annoying<00:01:36.210> bristles<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.810> you'll

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
one clump of annoying bristles so you'll

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.120 
one clump of annoying bristles so you'll
need<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.229> clean<00:01:37.409> them<00:01:37.560> off<00:01:37.680> when<00:01:37.860> you're<00:01:37.979> done

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
acetone and so I'll just put that to the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.310 
acetone and so I'll just put that to the
side<00:01:44.909> now<00:01:45.750> I'm<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:45.899> going<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.170> take<00:01:46.290> some

just<00:03:42.269> gonna<00:03:42.390> sort<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.290> blow<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:44.040> shake<00:03:44.700> all

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
just gonna sort of blow and shake all

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.539 
just gonna sort of blow and shake all
stuff<00:03:45.209> off<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.750> top<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:47.190> then<00:03:47.310> we're<00:03:47.459> gonna

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
stuff off the top and then we're gonna

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.740 
stuff off the top and then we're gonna
screw<00:03:48.090> on<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.390> top<00:03:48.769> and<00:03:49.769> do<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.820> same<00:03:51.000> sort<00:03:51.299> of

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
screw on the top and do the same sort of

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.050 
screw on the top and do the same sort of
rolling<00:03:52.560> thing<00:03:55.340> so<00:03:56.340> this<00:03:56.459> is<00:03:56.549> what<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:56.850> looks

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
rolling thing so this is what it looks

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.449 
rolling thing so this is what it looks
like<00:03:57.180> right<00:03:57.870> now<00:03:57.900> is<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.590> very<00:03:58.739> thick

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
like right now is a very thick

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.220 
like right now is a very thick
consistency<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.390> what<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.510> think<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:00.930> can<00:04:01.079> do

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
consistency and what I think you can do

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.199 
consistency and what I think you can do
to<00:04:01.590> test<00:04:01.829> this<00:04:02.040> out<00:04:02.220> is<00:04:02.430> actually<00:04:02.820> if<00:04:02.910> you<00:04:03.030> do

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
to test this out is actually if you do

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.240 
to test this out is actually if you do
have<00:04:03.390> a<00:04:03.420> shiny<00:04:03.690> bag<00:04:03.989> or<00:04:04.380> just<00:04:05.100> whatever

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
have a shiny bag or just whatever

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.729 
have a shiny bag or just whatever
surface<00:04:05.579> you're<00:04:05.880> working<00:04:06.299> on<00:04:06.420> you<00:04:07.380> can<00:04:07.440> just

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
surface you're working on you can just

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.220 
surface you're working on you can just
paint<00:04:07.950> a<00:04:08.160> little<00:04:08.370> bit<00:04:08.519> of<00:04:08.820> it<00:04:09.060> on<00:04:09.209> there<00:04:09.720> and

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
paint a little bit of it on there and

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.199 
paint a little bit of it on there and
wait<00:04:10.860> till<00:04:11.070> it<00:04:11.100> dries<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.700> see<00:04:11.820> if<00:04:11.910> it<00:04:11.970> dries

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
wait till it dries and see if it dries

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.090 
wait till it dries and see if it dries
matte<00:04:12.570> or<00:04:12.780> not<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.140> if<00:04:13.230> it<00:04:13.320> doesn't<00:04:13.620> dry<00:04:13.890> matte

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
matte or not and if it doesn't dry matte

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.380 
matte or not and if it doesn't dry matte
then<00:04:14.670> you<00:04:14.730> know<00:04:14.850> you<00:04:14.910> need<00:04:15.090> to<00:04:15.120> add<00:04:15.360> more

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
then you know you need to add more

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.490 
then you know you need to add more
cornstarch

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
cornstarch

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.740 
cornstarch

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
Wow sorry guys I just shook the camera

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.890 
Wow sorry guys I just shook the camera
and<00:04:19.739> if<00:04:20.220> it's<00:04:20.400> mat<00:04:20.760> then<00:04:21.030> it's<00:04:21.269> time<00:04:21.479> to<00:04:21.510> put<00:04:21.810> on

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
and if it's mat then it's time to put on

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.450 
and if it's mat then it's time to put on
your<00:04:22.019> name<00:04:22.169> I'm<00:04:22.320> having<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.680> hard<00:04:22.890> time<00:04:22.979> trying

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
your name I'm having a hard time trying

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.820 
your name I'm having a hard time trying
to<00:04:23.550> figure<00:04:23.669> out<00:04:23.880> if<00:04:24.060> it's<00:04:24.270> matte<00:04:24.690> or<00:04:25.200> if<00:04:25.590> it's

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
to figure out if it's matte or if it's

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.350 
to figure out if it's matte or if it's
still<00:04:25.950> shiny<00:04:26.280> just<00:04:26.669> put<00:04:26.880> a<00:04:26.910> normal

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
still shiny just put a normal

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.689 
still shiny just put a normal
top<00:04:27.509> coat<00:04:27.780> right<00:04:28.379> next<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:29.099> as<00:04:29.189> you<00:04:29.340> can<00:04:29.460> tell

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
top coat right next and as you can tell

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.429 
top coat right next and as you can tell
the<00:04:29.969> one<00:04:30.120> on<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.449> right<00:04:30.780> is<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:30.990> little<00:04:31.259> bit

00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:31.439 
the one on the right is a little bit

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:34.010 
the one on the right is a little bit
more<00:04:31.590> matte<00:04:31.800> but<00:04:32.039> it<00:04:32.129> still<00:04:32.639> is<00:04:32.969> almost<00:04:33.629> shiny

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
more matte but it still is almost shiny

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.990 
more matte but it still is almost shiny
so<00:04:34.319> we're<00:04:34.439> going<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.650> add<00:04:34.800> a<00:04:35.099> little<00:04:35.789> bit<00:04:35.969> more

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
so we're going to add a little bit more

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.950 
so we're going to add a little bit more
cornstarch<00:04:36.900> to<00:04:37.590> make<00:04:37.830> it<00:04:38.009> completely<00:04:38.550> matte

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
cornstarch to make it completely matte

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.480 
cornstarch to make it completely matte
so<00:04:39.960> I'm<00:04:40.020> just<00:04:40.169> gonna<00:04:40.319> go<00:04:40.560> in<00:04:40.800> with<00:04:41.009> my<00:04:41.159> little

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
so I'm just gonna go in with my little

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.920 
so I'm just gonna go in with my little
spoon<00:04:41.759> again<00:04:43.340> and<00:04:44.340> just<00:04:44.639> sort<00:04:44.849> of<00:04:45.000> go<00:04:45.689> like

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
spoon again and just sort of go like

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.689 
spoon again and just sort of go like
that<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:46.860> tap<00:04:48.740> if<00:04:49.740> you<00:04:49.919> had<00:04:50.099> a<00:04:50.129> funnel<00:04:50.520> that

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
that and tap if you had a funnel that

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.670 
that and tap if you had a funnel that
would<00:04:50.819> work<00:04:51.000> really<00:04:51.599> well<00:04:51.750> for<00:04:51.930> this<00:04:52.259> but<00:04:52.650> I

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
would work really well for this but I

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.610 
would work really well for this but I
don't<00:04:52.949> have<00:04:53.069> a<00:04:53.159> funnel<00:04:53.520> so<00:04:53.669> I<00:04:54.379> can't<00:04:55.379> use<00:04:55.560> it

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
don't have a funnel so I can't use it

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.730 
don't have a funnel so I can't use it
but<00:04:56.099> I<00:04:56.400> think<00:04:56.789> if<00:04:57.060> you<00:04:57.360> do<00:04:57.539> have<00:04:57.780> one<00:04:57.810> that

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
but I think if you do have one that

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.119 
but I think if you do have one that
would<00:04:58.889> be<00:04:59.039> a<00:04:59.069> great<00:04:59.610> use<00:04:59.639> for<00:05:00.539> it

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:01.129 
would be a great use for it

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:03.830 
would be a great use for it
this<00:05:02.129> would<00:05:02.279> be<00:05:02.430> a<00:05:02.460> great<00:05:02.819> project<00:05:03.120> to<00:05:03.389> use<00:05:03.659> it

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
this would be a great project to use it

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.990 
this would be a great project to use it
in<00:05:03.960> because<00:05:04.439> it'll<00:05:05.340> really<00:05:05.370> help<00:05:05.819> the

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
in because it'll really help the

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.999 
in because it'll really help the
cornstarch<00:05:06.360> not<00:05:06.750> too<00:05:06.960> absolutely<00:05:07.650> everywhere

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
cornstarch not too absolutely everywhere

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.730 
cornstarch not too absolutely everywhere
and<00:05:08.279> it<00:05:08.490> is<00:05:08.669> absolutely<00:05:09.389> everywhere<00:05:09.719> on<00:05:10.379> my

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
and it is absolutely everywhere on my

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.999 
and it is absolutely everywhere on my
vanity<00:05:10.949> right<00:05:11.279> now<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:12.090> ooh<00:05:12.509> top<00:05:13.409> packing<00:05:13.919> on

the<00:05:16.020> bottle<00:05:16.379> and<00:05:18.110> just<00:05:19.110> roll<00:05:19.650> it<00:05:19.889> again<00:05:20.810> we're

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
the bottle and just roll it again we're

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.649 
the bottle and just roll it again we're
gonna<00:05:21.930> test<00:05:22.259> it<00:05:22.439> one<00:05:22.860> more<00:05:23.099> time<00:05:23.490> and<00:05:24.300> see<00:05:24.509> how

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:24.659 
gonna test it one more time and see how

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:32.079 
gonna test it one more time and see how
it<00:05:24.840> dries<00:05:28.849> so<00:05:29.849> as<00:05:29.939> you<00:05:30.029> can<00:05:30.120> see<00:05:30.360> this<00:05:30.750> one<00:05:31.110> is

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:32.089 
it dries so as you can see this one is

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:35.240 
it dries so as you can see this one is
almost<00:05:33.089> matte<00:05:33.659> so<00:05:34.409> now<00:05:34.529> we're<00:05:34.680> gonna<00:05:34.770> see<00:05:35.039> how

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
almost matte so now we're gonna see how

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.890 
almost matte so now we're gonna see how
this<00:05:35.729> one<00:05:36.000> dries

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
this one dries

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.040 
this one dries
this<00:05:37.620> one's<00:05:37.830> drawing<00:05:38.190> a<00:05:38.400> lot<00:05:38.699> more<00:05:38.879> matte<00:05:39.150> so

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
this one's drawing a lot more matte so

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
you just put it on with no topcoat so

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.920 
you just put it on with no topcoat so
we'll<00:06:02.550> let<00:06:02.699> that<00:06:02.759> dry<00:06:03.120> for<00:06:03.150> about<00:06:03.479> five

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
we'll let that dry for about five

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.929 
we'll let that dry for about five
minutes<00:06:04.319> and<00:06:04.620> come<00:06:05.009> back<00:06:05.250> so<00:06:05.490> you<00:06:05.520> guys<00:06:05.699> can

00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:05.939

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
see the difference all right so it's

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.499 
see the difference all right so it's
been<00:06:07.889> about<00:06:08.039> 15<00:06:08.279> minutes<00:06:08.819> of<00:06:08.909> nail<00:06:09.089> polishes

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:09.509 
been about 15 minutes of nail polishes

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:12.379 
been about 15 minutes of nail polishes
finally<00:06:10.199> dry<00:06:10.469> but<00:06:11.159> you<00:06:11.250> can<00:06:11.460> see<00:06:11.819> the

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389 
finally dry but you can see the

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:15.260 
finally dry but you can see the
difference<00:06:13.069> it's<00:06:14.069> a<00:06:14.129> lot<00:06:14.339> less<00:06:14.520> shiny<00:06:14.819> it's<00:06:15.120> a

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
difference it's a lot less shiny it's a

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.079 
difference it's a lot less shiny it's a
little<00:06:15.629> bit<00:06:15.779> lighter<00:06:16.229> I<00:06:16.729> guess<00:06:17.729> from<00:06:17.939> the

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:18.089 
little bit lighter I guess from the

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:23.300 
little bit lighter I guess from the
cornstarch<00:06:19.159> but<00:06:20.839> it's<00:06:21.839> a<00:06:22.199> lot<00:06:22.770> more<00:06:23.009> matte

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
cornstarch but it's a lot more matte

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.670 
cornstarch but it's a lot more matte
than<00:06:23.909> this<00:06:24.120> one<00:06:24.360> the<00:06:24.870> light<00:06:25.080> still<00:06:25.379> kind<00:06:25.650> of

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
than this one the light still kind of

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.929 
than this one the light still kind of
reflects<00:06:26.009> off<00:06:26.189> of<00:06:26.219> it<00:06:26.370> just<00:06:26.400> because<00:06:26.669> light

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:26.939 
reflects off of it just because light

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:30.019 
reflects off of it just because light
reflects<00:06:27.300> off<00:06:27.509> basically<00:06:28.139> everything<00:06:29.029> but

00:06:30.019 --> 00:06:30.029 
reflects off basically everything but

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:31.519 
reflects off basically everything but
that's<00:06:30.210> what<00:06:30.389> it<00:06:30.479> looks<00:06:30.509> like<00:06:30.870> it's<00:06:31.110> super

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:31.529 
that's what it looks like it's super

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:34.730 
that's what it looks like it's super
