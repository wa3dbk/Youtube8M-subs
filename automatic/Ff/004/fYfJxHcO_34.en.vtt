Thomas and Mack and there isn't anything
like<00:05:13.340> it<00:05:13.370> so<00:05:13.700> it's<00:05:13.880> not<00:05:14.000> like<00:05:14.240> you<00:05:14.390> can<00:05:14.419> do<00:05:14.780> a

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
like it so it's not like you can do a

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.450 
like it so it's not like you can do a
little<00:05:14.960> homework<00:05:15.230> before<00:05:15.860> you<00:05:15.980> get<00:05:16.160> here<00:05:16.340> and

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
little homework before you get here and

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.730 
little homework before you get here and
it<00:05:16.580> is<00:05:16.610> a<00:05:16.760> blind<00:05:17.060> first<00:05:17.419> barrel<00:05:17.810> and<00:05:17.960> so<00:05:18.260> you

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
it is a blind first barrel and so you

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.320 
it is a blind first barrel and so you
got<00:05:18.830> a<00:05:18.860> lot<00:05:19.010> of<00:05:19.040> action<00:05:19.460> going<00:05:19.490> on<00:05:19.760> around<00:05:20.060> you

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
got a lot of action going on around you

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.480 
got a lot of action going on around you
it's<00:05:20.450> real<00:05:20.690> noisy<00:05:21.200> in<00:05:21.260> that<00:05:21.440> tunnel<00:05:21.680> and<00:05:22.010> you

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
it's real noisy in that tunnel and you

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.190 
it's real noisy in that tunnel and you
blow<00:05:22.730> into<00:05:22.940> the<00:05:23.150> arena<00:05:23.360> and<00:05:23.570> the<00:05:23.600> first<00:05:23.840> barrel

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
blow into the arena and the first barrel

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.110 
blow into the arena and the first barrel
is<00:05:24.380> right<00:05:24.830> there<00:05:25.220> so<00:05:25.550> you<00:05:25.640> better<00:05:25.820> be<00:05:25.970> thinking

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
is right there so you better be thinking

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.909 
is right there so you better be thinking
about<00:05:26.390> turning<00:05:26.720> it<00:05:27.020> before<00:05:27.380> you<00:05:27.500> get<00:05:27.650> in<00:05:27.800> the

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
about turning it before you get in the

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.730 
about turning it before you get in the
arena<00:05:28.250> and<00:05:28.520> so<00:05:28.729> it's<00:05:29.120> a<00:05:29.240> tough<00:05:29.600> tough<00:05:29.960> it's<00:05:30.620> a
