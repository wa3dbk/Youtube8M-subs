that<00:02:44.820> makes<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.180> hut<00:02:45.360> sort<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.810> um<00:02:46.080> a<00:02:46.320> lot

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
that makes the hut sort of um a lot

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.440 
that makes the hut sort of um a lot
bigger<00:02:47.310> than<00:02:47.400> just<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.790> bit<00:02:47.970> that's<00:02:48.060> on<00:02:48.240> top

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
bigger than just the bit that's on top

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.810 
bigger than just the bit that's on top
that<00:02:49.320> makes<00:02:49.440> any<00:02:49.650> sense<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.489> then<00:02:50.580> there's

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
that makes any sense and then there's

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.780 
that makes any sense and then there's
the<00:02:50.970> water<00:02:51.120> bottle<00:02:51.570> there<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:52.610> don't<00:02:53.610> know<00:02:53.670> if

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
the water bottle there I don't know if

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.930 
the water bottle there I don't know if
it<00:02:53.880> leaks<00:02:54.060> yet<00:02:54.330> because<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:54.600> haven't<00:02:54.780> tried<00:02:55.050> it

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
it leaks yet because I haven't tried it

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.310 
it leaks yet because I haven't tried it
this<00:02:56.940> is<00:02:57.120> all<00:02:57.270> brand<00:02:58.050> new<00:02:59.480> and<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.630> think<00:03:00.660> that's

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
this is all brand new and I think that's

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.180 
this is all brand new and I think that's
everything<00:03:03.739> for<00:03:04.739> me<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:05.340> say<00:03:05.489> about<00:03:05.610> this<00:03:05.850> cage

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
everything for me to say about this cage

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.229 
everything for me to say about this cage
it<00:03:08.190> seems<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.520> be<00:03:08.640> really<00:03:08.850> well<00:03:09.030> made<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:11.580> close

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
it seems to be really well made to close

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.860 
it seems to be really well made to close
it<00:03:12.480> you<00:03:12.570> have<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.900> click<00:03:13.020> them<00:03:14.600> there<00:03:15.600> you<00:03:15.630> can

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
it you have to click them there you can

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:23.649 
it you have to click them there you can
see<00:03:16.130> once<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.670> then

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:23.659 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:29.720 

and<00:03:24.659> then<00:03:24.840> twice<00:03:27.170> they're<00:03:28.170> not<00:03:28.860> shot<00:03:29.159> properly

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
and then twice they're not shot properly

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.119 
and then twice they're not shot properly
now<00:03:31.340> so<00:03:32.340> anyway<00:03:32.610> that's<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:34.500> catch<00:03:34.680> all<00:03:34.890> those

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
now so anyway that's the catch all those

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.449 
now so anyway that's the catch all those
two<00:03:35.340> handles<00:03:35.790> on<00:03:35.879> top<00:03:36.120> as<00:03:36.330> well<00:03:36.510> one<00:03:36.780> here<00:03:37.019> and

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
two handles on top as well one here and

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:43.729 
two handles on top as well one here and
one<00:03:38.459> here<00:03:39.049> and<00:03:40.049> it's<00:03:41.090> it's<00:03:42.090> fairly<00:03:42.420> heavy<00:03:42.810> only

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
one here and it's it's fairly heavy only

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.890 
one here and it's it's fairly heavy only
have<00:03:43.860> a<00:03:43.890> minute<00:03:44.040> left<00:03:44.220> able<00:03:44.750> but<00:03:45.750> it's

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
have a minute left able but it's

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.170
