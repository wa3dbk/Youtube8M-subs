posted that link on my channel and it

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.740 
posted that link on my channel and it
was<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.130> link<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.939> video<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.300> someone<00:00:21.539> making

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
was a link to a video of someone making

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.740 
was a link to a video of someone making
one<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.109> these<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.590> piranha<00:00:23.250> plant<00:00:23.580> from<00:00:23.910> Ed

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
one of these the piranha plant from Ed

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.630 
one of these the piranha plant from Ed
Mario<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.949> thought<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.189> was<00:00:26.279> kind<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.430> cool

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
Mario and I thought it was kind of cool

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.279 
Mario and I thought it was kind of cool
so<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.880> decided<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.359> make<00:00:27.510> my<00:00:27.630> own<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:28.109> that's

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
so I decided to make my own so that's

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.290 
so I decided to make my own so that's
that<00:00:28.470> there<00:00:28.740> did<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> few<00:00:29.880> things<00:00:30.090> slightly

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
that there did a few things slightly

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.740 
that there did a few things slightly
that<00:00:30.570> for<00:00:30.750> me<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.109> didn't<00:00:31.439> use<00:00:31.560> real<00:00:31.679> soil<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.000> I

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
that for me I didn't use real soil and I

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.090 
that for me I didn't use real soil and I
thought<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.350> was<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.500> bit<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> strange<00:00:35.010> thing

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
thought it was a bit of a strange thing

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.650 
thought it was a bit of a strange thing
to<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:35.520> because<00:00:35.700> obviously<00:00:36.000> these<00:00:36.360> are<00:00:36.570> going

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
to do because obviously these are going

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.770 
to do because obviously these are going
to<00:00:36.750> get<00:00:36.930> probably<00:00:37.829> knocked<00:00:38.070> over<00:00:38.489> them<00:00:38.579> if<00:00:39.210> you

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
to get probably knocked over them if you

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.060 
to get probably knocked over them if you
have<00:00:39.899> your<00:00:40.079> soil<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.559> there's<00:00:40.710> going<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.920> make

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
have your soil and there's going to make

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.350 
have your soil and there's going to make
a<00:00:41.100> real<00:00:41.309> mess<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.700> also<00:00:41.940> it's<00:00:42.030> not<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.210> real

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
a real mess and also it's not a real

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.889 
a real mess and also it's not a real
plant<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.980> yeah<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.190> basically<00:00:44.370> just<00:00:44.640> used<00:00:45.030> some

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
soil and yeah I made one of these as

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.290

images and see if anyone else had made
them<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.330> yes<00:01:06.750> I'm<00:01:06.930> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.080> made<00:01:07.229> one<00:01:07.380> of

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
them and yes I'm going to made one of

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.539 
them and yes I'm going to made one of
these<00:01:07.590> before<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:08.010> thought<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.280> was<00:01:08.369> close

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
these before I thought it was close

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:08.960 
these before I thought it was close
enough

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
enough

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.300 
enough
I<00:01:09.020> thought<00:01:10.020> I'd<00:01:10.170> make<00:01:10.320> my<00:01:10.470> own<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:11.100> is

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
I thought I'd make my own and this is

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.940 
I thought I'd make my own and this is
the<00:01:11.520> pea<00:01:12.060> shooter<00:01:12.330> from<00:01:12.689> plants<00:01:13.260> vs.<00:01:13.560> zombies

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
the pea shooter from plants vs. zombies

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.929 
the pea shooter from plants vs. zombies
and<00:01:14.780> again<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:15.960> use<00:01:16.229> some<00:01:16.470> foam<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.700> these

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
and again just use some foam and these

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.200 
and again just use some foam and these
are<00:01:18.090> reveal<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:19.770> reveal<00:01:20.009> for<00:01:20.100> air<00:01:20.520> these

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
are reveal and the reveal for air these

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.980 
are reveal and the reveal for air these
are<00:01:21.950> terracotta<00:01:23.210> pots<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:24.540> get<00:01:24.689> them<00:01:24.840> in

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
are terracotta pots we can get them in

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.410 
are terracotta pots we can get them in
garden<00:01:25.799> centers<00:01:26.220> or<00:01:26.250> your<00:01:26.490> hardware<00:01:27.030> stores<00:01:27.330> I

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
garden centers or your hardware stores I

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.810 
garden centers or your hardware stores I
think<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.630> hit<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.840> bit<00:01:28.070> 50<00:01:29.070> pence<00:01:29.310> or<00:01:29.579> something

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
think I hit a bit 50 pence or something

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.910 
think I hit a bit 50 pence or something
for<00:01:29.970> these<00:01:30.060> really<00:01:30.270> really<00:01:30.420> cheap<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.049> yeah

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
for these really really cheap and yeah

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.740 
for these really really cheap and yeah
just<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.490> one<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.729> there<00:01:32.939> look<00:01:33.299> can<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.479> kill

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
just that one in there look can I kill

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.499 
just that one in there look can I kill
so<00:01:34.470> these<00:01:34.590> are<00:01:34.770> made<00:01:34.920> with<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.509> parallel

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
so these are made with and parallel

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.730 
so these are made with and parallel
beads<00:01:36.720> are<00:01:37.340> hollow<00:01:38.340> bees<00:01:41.180> and<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:43.259> cold<00:01:43.500> power

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
beads are hollow bees and the cold power

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.990 
beads are hollow bees and the cold power
beats<00:01:44.009> here<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> UK<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.700> think<00:01:44.759> they're

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
beats here in the UK I think they're

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.020 
beats here in the UK I think they're
