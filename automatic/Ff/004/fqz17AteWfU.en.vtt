00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
are going in this area well in this area

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.870 
are going in this area well in this area
in<00:03:04.790> Cebu<00:03:05.090> we<00:03:05.420> have<00:03:05.720> now<00:03:05.960> set<00:03:06.380> up<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.980> operation

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
in Cebu we have now set up a operation

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.300 
in Cebu we have now set up a operation
center<00:03:08.330> so<00:03:09.020> that's<00:03:09.590> going<00:03:09.770> to<00:03:09.860> be<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.100> main

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
center so that's going to be the main

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.880 
center so that's going to be the main
hub<00:03:10.880> for<00:03:11.120> all<00:03:11.600> of<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.050> distributions<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:12.800> the

hub for all of the distributions and the

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.680 
hub for all of the distributions and the
aid<00:03:13.100> that's<00:03:13.310> being<00:03:13.580> sent<00:03:13.850> out<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.150> all<00:03:14.390> of<00:03:14.570> the

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
affected areas not just in Cebu so that

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.870 
affected areas not just in Cebu so that

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
distributed from that point and also it

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.900 
distributed from that point and also it
will<00:03:24.050> be<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.260> center<00:03:24.590> for<00:03:24.620> logistics<00:03:25.580> and

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
will be the center for logistics and

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.520 
will be the center for logistics and
telecoms<00:03:26.630> and<00:03:26.810> everything<00:03:27.140> will<00:03:27.260> be<00:03:27.290> based

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
telecoms and everything will be based

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.290 
telecoms and everything will be based
there<00:03:27.800> what<00:03:28.550> are<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:28.730> biggest<00:03:28.910> challenges

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
there what are the biggest challenges

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.150 
there what are the biggest challenges
that<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:30.080> Red<00:03:30.200> Cross<00:03:30.230> is<00:03:30.620> facing<00:03:31.010> right<00:03:31.040> now

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
that the Red Cross is facing right now

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.900 
that the Red Cross is facing right now
in<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.460> region

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
in the region

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.300 
in the region
I<00:03:31.940> think<00:03:32.540> access<00:03:33.110> is<00:03:33.320> the<00:03:33.470> biggest<00:03:33.830> challenge

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
I think access is the biggest challenge

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.920 
I think access is the biggest challenge
for<00:03:34.640> us<00:03:34.670> still<00:03:35.060> even<00:03:35.450> though<00:03:35.570> there's<00:03:35.780> been

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
for us still even though there's been

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.020 
for us still even though there's been
some<00:03:36.110> improvement<00:03:36.710> to<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.490> conditions<00:03:37.970> of

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
some improvement to the conditions of

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.760 
some improvement to the conditions of
the<00:03:38.090> roads<00:03:38.390> there's<00:03:38.870> still<00:03:39.080> areas<00:03:39.410> in<00:03:39.650> the

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
the roads there's still areas in the

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.430 
the roads there's still areas in the
north<00:03:39.980> of<00:03:40.310> Leyte<00:03:40.910> island<00:03:41.090> that<00:03:42.050> are<00:03:42.110> very

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
north of Leyte island that are very

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.380 
north of Leyte island that are very
difficult<00:03:42.860> to<00:03:43.010> get<00:03:43.130> through<00:03:43.370> and<00:03:43.580> also

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
difficult to get through and also

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.260 
difficult to get through and also
communication<00:03:45.140> is<00:03:45.440> still<00:03:45.790> not<00:03:46.790> functioning

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
communication is still not functioning

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.330 
communication is still not functioning
fully<00:03:47.510> although<00:03:48.050> some<00:03:48.290> mobile<00:03:48.500> networks<00:03:48.980> are

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
fully although some mobile networks are

fully although some mobile networks are
working<00:03:50.180> now<00:03:50.360> so<00:03:50.570> all<00:03:51.260> of<00:03:51.440> these<00:03:51.530> things

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
working now so all of these things

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.170 
working now so all of these things
present<00:03:51.950> a<00:03:52.130> challenge<00:03:52.280> for<00:03:52.550> communication

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
present a challenge for communication

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.730 
present a challenge for communication
between<00:03:53.300> different<00:03:53.630> teams<00:03:54.050> that<00:03:54.410> are<00:03:54.500> coming
