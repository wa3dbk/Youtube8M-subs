00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
gameplay in the bars this is probably

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.699 
gameplay in the bars this is probably
one<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.879> best<00:02:16.379> instruction<00:02:17.379> booklets

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
one of the best instruction booklets

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.530 
one of the best instruction booklets
I've<00:02:17.830> seen<00:02:18.129> in<00:02:18.310> quite<00:02:18.459> a<00:02:18.610> long<00:02:18.730> time<00:02:18.910> and

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
I've seen in quite a long time and

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.760 
I've seen in quite a long time and
that's<00:02:19.720> probably<00:02:20.080> because<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.410> game<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.620> made

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
that's probably because the game is made

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.470 
that's probably because the game is made
by<00:02:20.800> Atlas<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.550> they<00:02:21.640> usually<00:02:21.970> do<00:02:22.120> stuff<00:02:22.150> like

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
by Atlas and they usually do stuff like

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.449 
by Atlas and they usually do stuff like
that<00:02:22.629> so<00:02:23.410> that<00:02:23.590> is<00:02:23.739> really<00:02:23.770> neat<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:24.280> then<00:02:24.370> of

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
that so that is really neat and then of

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:25.650 
that so that is really neat and then of
course<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.730> second<00:02:25.030> half<00:02:25.150> is<00:02:25.300> in<00:02:25.330> another

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
course the second half is in another

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.150 
course the second half is in another

what<00:04:06.810> games<00:04:06.989> they've<00:04:07.230> made<00:04:07.500> but<00:04:07.950> they're<00:04:08.820> good

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970

about<00:04:10.799> this<00:04:11.100> game<00:04:11.370> I'm<00:04:12.150> getting<00:04:12.329> pumped<00:04:12.720> for

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
about this game I'm getting pumped for

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:13.970 
about this game I'm getting pumped for
it<00:04:13.079> because<00:04:13.290> it's<00:04:13.590> something<00:04:13.769> completely

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
it because it's something completely

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.330 
it because it's something completely
different<00:04:14.549> from<00:04:14.790> what<00:04:14.970> I<00:04:15.000> usually<00:04:15.209> do<00:04:15.540> and
