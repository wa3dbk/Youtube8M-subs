00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:46.649 
the bat the new sheath which for me is
probably<00:00:45.879> going<00:00:45.999> to<00:00:46.059> be<00:00:46.149> one<00:00:46.239> of<00:00:46.300> the<00:00:46.420> biggest

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:46.659 
probably going to be one of the biggest

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:48.569 
probably going to be one of the biggest
highlights<00:00:46.749> really<00:00:47.559> like<00:00:47.739> it<00:00:47.949> really<00:00:48.129> useful
