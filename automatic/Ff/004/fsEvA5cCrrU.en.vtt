I'm<00:00:07.319> going<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.470> talk<00:00:07.680> about<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:08.069> clean<00:00:08.400> or<00:00:08.730> the

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
I'm going to talk about the clean or the

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.759 
I'm going to talk about the clean or the
power<00:00:09.059> clean<00:00:09.510> but<00:00:09.990> we're<00:00:10.469> going<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.620> talk

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
power clean but we're going to talk

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.039 
power clean but we're going to talk
about<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.040> basis<00:00:11.550> rather<00:00:12.000> clean<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.840> what

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
about the basis rather clean that what

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.320 
about the basis rather clean that what
four<00:00:13.320> key<00:00:13.530> things<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.920> look<00:00:14.160> for<00:00:14.490> it's<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.210> good

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
four key things to look for it's a good

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.450 
four key things to look for it's a good
place<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.570> start<00:00:16.130> again<00:00:17.130> it's<00:00:17.250> just<00:00:17.310> the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
place to start again it's just the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.160 
place to start again it's just the
basics<00:00:17.880> just<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.240> tip<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.570> iceberg

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
basics just the tip of the iceberg

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.160 
basics just the tip of the iceberg
yeah<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:20.340> as<00:00:21.150> always<00:00:21.359> if<00:00:21.600> you're<00:00:21.689> interested

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
yeah and as always if you're interested

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.900 
yeah and as always if you're interested
in<00:00:22.230> learning<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.619> Olympic<00:00:23.130> lifts<00:00:23.430> not<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.730> bad

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
in learning the Olympic lifts not a bad

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.970 
in learning the Olympic lifts not a bad
idea<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.300> seek<00:00:24.480> out<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.660> coach<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.380> but<00:00:25.590> these

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
idea to seek out a coach that but these

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.710 
idea to seek out a coach that but these
are<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.250> four<00:00:26.910> key<00:00:27.090> things<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.359> we<00:00:27.480> do<00:00:27.599> look

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
are the four key things that we do look

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.029 
are the four key things that we do look
important<00:00:28.199> awesome<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.710> clean<00:00:28.920> is

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
important awesome so the clean is

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.560 
important awesome so the clean is
probably<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.429> easiest<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.150> movements<00:00:30.510> to

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
probably the easiest of the movements to

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.540 
probably the easiest of the movements to
get<00:00:30.689> into<00:00:31.050> we're<00:00:31.650> going<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.830> show<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.160> basics

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
get into we're going to show the basics

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.930 
get into we're going to show the basics
for<00:00:32.669> all<00:00:32.940> movements<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.960> then<00:00:34.500> show<00:00:34.800> me<00:00:35.040> going

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
for all movements and then show me going

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.729 
for all movements and then show me going
through<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.360> what<00:00:36.870> coach<00:00:37.140> critique<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.680> me

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
through it what coach critique and me

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.600 
through it what coach critique and me
several<00:00:37.980> can<00:00:38.190> follow<00:00:38.399> along

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
several can follow along

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.580 
several can follow along
so<00:00:38.790> first<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.329> form<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:39.899> those<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.379> want<00:00:40.530> to

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
so first the form so those that want to

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.200 
so first the form so those that want to
try<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.829> out<00:00:40.980> can<00:00:41.160> try<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.399> out<00:00:41.489> at<00:00:41.670> home<00:00:41.700> so

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
try it out can try it out at home so

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.910 
try it out can try it out at home so
each<00:00:42.450> key<00:00:42.719> position<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.410> we'll<00:00:43.559> be<00:00:43.680> going

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
each key position that we'll be going

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.979 
each key position that we'll be going
over<00:00:44.040> for<00:00:44.399> all<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.329> Olympic<00:00:45.690> lifts

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
over for all of the Olympic lifts

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.500 
over for all of the Olympic lifts
require<00:00:46.410> adequate<00:00:46.890> mobility<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:48.059> if<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.329> find

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
require adequate mobility so if you find

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.119 
require adequate mobility so if you find
yourself<00:00:48.690> not<00:00:49.140> being<00:00:49.350> able<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.559> get<00:00:49.770> into

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
yourself not being able to get into

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.260 
yourself not being able to get into
these<00:00:51.030> four<00:00:51.719> key<00:00:51.960> positions<00:00:52.640> usually<00:00:53.640> we<00:00:54.030> look

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
these four key positions usually we look

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.319 
these four key positions usually we look
at<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.840> loss<00:00:55.350> or<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> lack<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.280> mobility<00:00:56.489> as<00:00:57.090> being

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
at a loss or a lack of mobility as being

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.930 
at a loss or a lack of mobility as being
the<00:00:57.449> culprit<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.680> again<00:00:59.489> these<00:00:59.670> four

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
the culprit for that so again these four

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.970 
the culprit for that so again these four
key<00:01:00.090> positions<00:01:00.539> are<00:01:00.719> crucial<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.800> lift

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
key positions are crucial to do the lift

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.490 
key positions are crucial to do the lift
properly<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.910> if<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.090> can't<00:01:03.329> get<00:01:04.110> into<00:01:04.290> those

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
properly and if you can't get into those

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.320 
properly and if you can't get into those
positions<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:05.220> would<00:01:05.460> first<00:01:05.700> address<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.210> with

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
positions we would first address it with

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.500 
positions we would first address it with
mobility<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.920> clean<00:01:08.250> has<00:01:08.760> four<00:01:09.180> key

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
mobility so the clean has four key

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.649 
mobility so the clean has four key
positions<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.350> we're<00:01:10.530> looking<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:11.000> to<00:01:12.000> be<00:01:12.630> a

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
positions that we're looking for to be a

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.830 
positions that we're looking for to be a
correct<00:01:13.260> or<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.830> correctly<00:01:14.430> executed<00:01:15.180> clean<00:01:15.540> or

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
correct or a correctly executed clean or

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.740 
correct or a correctly executed clean or
power<00:01:16.080> clean<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:17.369> first<00:01:17.610> position<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.270> called

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
power clean the first position is called

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.649 
power clean the first position is called
the<00:01:18.869> start<00:01:19.140> position<00:01:20.000> it<00:01:21.000> begins<00:01:21.390> with<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
the start position it begins with the
