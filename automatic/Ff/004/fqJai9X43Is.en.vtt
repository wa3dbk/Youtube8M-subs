00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.830
 I have so much trouble and so many pictures that I 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:36.870
 it's costing a lot to find it 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:39.940
 not what I have found 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.110

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.420

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.760
 looking but while I leave you with a 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.199
 compilation of the best photos that 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.199
 have passed through our contest 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.040
 Y 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.190
 Y 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.950
 and kittens hundreds of kittens are very 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.260
 good for virals on the internet and 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.680
 here we have also had our ration 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.680
 from them 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.230
 have been more than 1700 photos that we 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.780
 you have sent we have been more than one 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.250
 week watching the and selecting to 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.650
 to be able to make this selection we have 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.780
 taken a few liters of coffee 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.330
 how many kilos of chips for 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.450
 to be able to feed us on the road and 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:52.060
 result has been that the winning photo 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.060
 is this 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:01.059
 and I have to say that it has been super 

00:04:59.589 --> 00:05:03.610
 complicated to decide the winning photo 

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:05.229
 because there were many photos and lots of 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.449
 quality but as we only had one 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.849
 prize we had to decide for a 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:12.939
 in general the photos have been very good 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:15.159
 has been very creative and seemed worthy 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:17.169
 from a photo camera so many 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:18.809
 thank you all for participating and we 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.189
 we see in the following contest 

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:23.740
 we promise to try to make them with more 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:27.330
 ease for everyone to have many 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.330
 more options goodbye triplets
