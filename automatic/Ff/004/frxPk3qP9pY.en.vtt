belly side up like this and with a knife

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:38.430 
belly side up like this and with a knife
make<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:31.960> very<00:02:33.330> shallow<00:02:34.800> insertion<00:02:35.800> I<00:02:37.260> will<00:02:38.260> do

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
make a very shallow insertion I will do

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:47.540 
make a very shallow insertion I will do
two<00:02:39.160> more<00:02:39.690> just<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.840> belly<00:02:41.110> side<00:02:41.470> up<00:02:41.740> and

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:57.540 

maybe<00:02:49.590> about<00:02:50.590> five<00:02:50.950> insertions<00:02:52.350> 1<00:02:53.350> 2<00:02:54.310> 3<00:02:54.930> 4<00:02:56.550> 45

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
maybe about five insertions 1 2 3 4 45

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.790 
maybe about five insertions 1 2 3 4 45
and<00:02:57.970> as<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:58.900> said<00:02:58.960> I<00:02:59.440> am<00:02:59.650> NOT<00:02:59.920> making<00:03:00.250> this

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
and as I said I am NOT making this

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.990 
and as I said I am NOT making this
crosswise<00:03:02.800> cut<00:03:03.190> but<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.810> little<00:03:05.170> bit<00:03:05.290> slanted

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
crosswise cut but a little bit slanted

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.390 
crosswise cut but a little bit slanted
because<00:03:07.000> when<00:03:07.209> you<00:03:07.360> do<00:03:07.510> cross<00:03:07.810> cut<00:03:08.110> you<00:03:09.100> are

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
because when you do cross cut you are

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.380 
because when you do cross cut you are
going<00:03:10.330> to<00:03:10.510> break<00:03:10.750> your<00:03:11.350> shrimp<00:03:11.770> when<00:03:12.490> you<00:03:13.120> move

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
going to break your shrimp when you move

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.640 
going to break your shrimp when you move
to<00:03:13.420> next<00:03:14.040> step<00:03:15.180> okay<00:03:16.180> here's<00:03:16.510> an<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:17.230> next

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
to next step okay here's an the next

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.290 
to next step okay here's an the next
step<00:03:18.510> bend<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.890> shrimp<00:03:22.320> just<00:03:23.320> a<00:03:23.470> backward

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
step bend the shrimp just a backward

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:31.979 
step bend the shrimp just a backward
Bend<00:03:25.320> Bend<00:03:26.320> and<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:29.260> becomes<00:03:29.980> like<00:03:30.190> this<00:03:30.989> so

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
Bend Bend and it becomes like this so

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.259 
Bend Bend and it becomes like this so
now<00:03:32.430> this<00:03:33.430> is<00:03:33.670> ready<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.510> deep-fry<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:36.610> do

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
now this is ready to deep-fry to do

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.270 
now this is ready to deep-fry to do
tempura<00:03:38.050> the<00:03:38.590> trying<00:03:39.010> we<00:03:39.970> use<00:03:40.650> Templar<00:03:41.650> flour
