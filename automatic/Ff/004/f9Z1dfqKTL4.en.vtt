00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
haven't even looked at lea board yet so

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.540 
haven't even looked at lea board yet so
I<00:00:19.980> don't<00:00:20.039> know<00:00:20.449> usually<00:00:21.449> on<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.439> monday<00:00:22.980> i'll

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550
