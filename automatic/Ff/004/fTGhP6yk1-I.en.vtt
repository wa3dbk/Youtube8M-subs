you could explain it better but what we

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.020 
you could explain it better but what we
do<00:02:26.020> is<00:02:26.200> we<00:02:26.320> do<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.500> partial<00:02:26.860> deconstruction<00:02:27.850> and

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
do is we do a partial deconstruction and

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.910 
do is we do a partial deconstruction and
then<00:02:28.270> I'm<00:02:28.420> reconstructed<00:02:29.410> in<00:02:29.560> another<00:02:29.800> way

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
then I'm reconstructed in another way

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.320 
then I'm reconstructed in another way

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
and when we do that parts of the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.610 
and when we do that parts of the
construction<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:31.840> actually<00:02:32.260> have<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.590> know

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620
