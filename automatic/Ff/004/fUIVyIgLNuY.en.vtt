00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.550
 so here we are to the mÃ³nica teacher 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.360
 gos 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.060
 very happy to come back delighted 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.420
 we also here thank you very much 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:21.900
 well we have a pretty picture something 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.210
 very romantic romantic very cute let's go 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.970
 It is a simple job with several steps 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.980
 so we're going to do and good has 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.630
 a kind of pickling also has a 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.910
 of layer where the first one we are going to do 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.940
 the pickling and then we will work 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.520
 on glass a lot of decoupage under 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.740
 glass and paintings on vermont glass 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.560
 let's see - we hear thank you 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.720
 Well, how are you doing? 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.410
 said standard let's work first the 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.440
 part of the frame that is an I what I did 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.470
 if you do not see here dirty or stained 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.570
 with black acrylic base I'm 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.060
 working with the eternal products 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.460
 and then on the basis of acrylic 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.309
 black what I'm going to work with is a 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.130
 spatula and to put will be the natural wax 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.450
 of floors so that you do not take 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.140
 after painting 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.110
 and I'm going to put on this white with 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.039
 that I will form the pickling once 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.250
 I put wax in the places where I believed 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:25.799
 that I had to go what I'm going to do is 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.990
 with white acrylic base this I'm going to 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.899
 do in the frame and in this framework 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.679
 What I'm going to do is paint 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:38.370
 with white acrylic base on the sidewalk 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:40.770
 and on black this is very fast 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.530
 it's not worth it that we do it then 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.620
 we paint everything with white and what 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.650
 we are going to be better said this 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.710
 If here I have everything painted as I go 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.410
 make the pickling very simple with a 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.250
 spatula I will go over and 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:02.170
 you are going to see where I have and 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.049
 where I put sera 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.140
 is going to get up the white paint and I 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:11.099
 everything is black so it's done 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.170
 this framework and this framework is also 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:17.920
 fijense comes out perfectly and we 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.350
 we save the subject of the sandpaper so to 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.950
 Sometimes it costs us a lot then I go to 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:27.370
 remove all the paint is white and 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:31.810
 libero color and I have left the 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.819
 black very well that would be the frame and 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.890
 Now I 'm going to work on glass 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.760
 because I told him norm that this 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.340
 It has like two steps 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.250
 I will work then with glass the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.120
 I'm going to have to clean it with glass 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.340
 alcohol I clean it with alcohol and then 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.709
 I'm going to work with a sheet that I 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.409
 cut you look for the sheet that you 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.860
 like and will cut the size of the 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:00.810
 glass this glass has 15 x 15 and 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.970
 with one of the stickers of eternal 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.879
 eternal has a line of stickers in 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.970
 this case I'm using the varnish and 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:12.060
 flexible decoupage what I do is a 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.519
 generous layer but what I ask is 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.040
 Do not leave these little sticks 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.889
 you see here but they stretch very 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:25.260
 well the glass will previously be 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:28.769
 clean with alcohol if you then applied 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.709
 a generous layer and then I'm going to take my 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:35.010
 sheet if this sheet that you see 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.170
 here and I will support it 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.769
 I will support better said the glass on 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.670
 the foil to stick it from behind 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:48.020
 Once pasted notice 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.540
 and fit it well with a spatula these 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.209
 rubber spatulas or a card too 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.930
 it can be plastic I'm going to make pressure 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:04:00.410
 so that the sheet adheres to the glass 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:04.130
 and also to get the material 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.590
 surplus all the material that exceeds 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.620
 that I put in more will come through 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.860
 from the glass in again to the sides 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.260
 of glass and there was a thousand sheets 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.010
 stuck there we had made a 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.919
 decoupage 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:22.430
 I could leave my work like this and place 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:25.450
 the frame here but keep working on 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.070
 this case with acrylic enamels 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.169
 you remember that the enamel 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.020
 acrylic what they have to do is 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:36.070
 stir well the bottle that is 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.810
 stir with a stick with a stick the 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.450
 product so that the 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.450
 emulsion and now I'm going to work on this 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.600
 case the little bird I worked with three 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.900
 colors 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.930
 with eternal color acrylic enamel 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.570
 white and I'm going to do the little bit I chose 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.790
 one of the images I have here 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:00.080
 you could paint everything could 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:03.390
 simply paint the butterfly then 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.120
 I'm going to paint with acrylic enamel 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.740
 white that adheres perfectly on 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.890
 glass but remember that glass 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.050
 It must be clean firm previously 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.740
 with alcohol if it does not adhere to the material 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:20.820
 so now I'm going with the ocher and I'm going to 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:24.720
 integrate making a wet on wet 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:29.280
 how is this bird's chest can I 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:32.100
 work trusting the material by striking 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.280
 with a brush to integrate a color to 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:39.190
 another here I am working with white and 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:42.670
 I'm working with ocher 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:45.880
 and then later it's going to come you see 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.440
 that is not like being glass is like 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.770
 the material slips a little bit then 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.729
 let's work with another layer on top and 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:57.830
 now I'm going to 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:06:00.559
 body and the plumage of the wings 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:04.219
 sorry and there I will work with white and 

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:08.029
 I'm going to integrate it with talo blue 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:10.490
 notice and then I use the image 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:12.300
 that I have below this bird for 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:16.669
 paint 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.669
 I transformed it into a blue bird 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.580
 there I go I integrate the target with 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.659
 the blue 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:28.670
 this is very fast we would have to paint 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:31.760
 he also 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.500
 only this is shown and then this 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.780
 I know immediately the enamel and 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.120
 grab on the entire surface then 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.070
 once I finished painting this 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.680
 little bird that is very simple only 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.930
 follow what I have below me what 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.720
 I'm going to do is apply the 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:52.280
 glasses exactly in this frame and 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:54.890
 then it would go the glass that in which 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:58.400
 I did the decoupage on the or under the 

00:06:54.890 --> 00:07:01.580
 You put the glass on and put the 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.920
 marquito beautiful we see that a cut 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:08.660
 precious means thank you I'm glad 

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:11.310
 love that they do it if it succeeds 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:15.270
 vintage style 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:18.620
 totally thank you thank you so many 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.620
 thanks to you
