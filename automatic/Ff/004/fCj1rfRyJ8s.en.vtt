00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.039 
complex ship basically how it works is
when<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.189> take<00:01:44.340> control<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.939> engine<00:01:45.360> as

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
when you take control of the engine as

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.749 
when you take control of the engine as
you<00:01:46.439> rotate<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> engine<00:01:47.130> around<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.490> actually

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
you rotate the engine around it actually

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.940 
you rotate the engine around it actually
rotates<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.479> entire<00:01:48.810> ship<00:01:49.259> around<00:01:49.500> as<00:01:49.799> you

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
rotates the entire ship around as you

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.380 
rotates the entire ship around as you
can<00:01:50.009> see<00:01:50.250> here<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.000> only<00:01:51.180> ship

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
can see here this is the only ship

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.569 
can see here this is the only ship
that's<00:01:51.540> like<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.470> it's<00:01:52.860> probably<00:01:53.340> the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
that's like that and it's probably the

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.149 
that's like that and it's probably the
most<00:01:53.700> complex<00:01:54.090> ship<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.630> game<00:01:54.920> it<00:01:55.920> can<00:01:56.040> be

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
most complex ship in the game it can be

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.999 
most complex ship in the game it can be
really<00:01:56.640> crazy<00:01:57.180> especially<00:01:57.509> for<00:01:58.020> Adam<00:01:58.560> here<00:01:58.829> as

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
really crazy especially for Adam here as

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.590 
really crazy especially for Adam here as
he's<00:01:59.189> trying<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.520> deal<00:01:59.939> with<00:02:00.119> what<00:02:00.270> I'm<00:02:00.360> doing

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
he's trying to deal with what I'm doing

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.760 
he's trying to deal with what I'm doing
at<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.750> same<00:02:00.869> time<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.290> trying<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.649> work

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
at the same time this is trying to work

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.120 
at the same time this is trying to work
the<00:02:01.890> shield<00:02:02.659> but<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:04.200> does<00:02:04.439> give<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> little

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
the shield but it does give you a little

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.709 
the shield but it does give you a little
more<00:02:05.310> control<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.850> some<00:02:05.969> freedom<00:02:06.299> if<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.509> if

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
more control and some freedom if you if

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.660 
more control and some freedom if you if
you<00:02:06.840> can

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
you can

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.699 
you can
the<00:02:08.860> craziness<00:02:09.860> of<00:02:09.979> it

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.410 

so<00:02:13.040> we're<00:02:13.190> also<00:02:13.340> being<00:02:13.580> blown<00:02:13.849> around<00:02:14.000> by<00:02:14.270> the

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
so we're also being blown around by the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.970 
so we're also being blown around by the
winter<00:02:15.020> snowstorm<00:02:15.319> which<00:02:15.590> is<00:02:15.709> one<00:02:15.830> of<00:02:15.920> the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
winter snowstorm which is one of the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.530 
winter snowstorm which is one of the
hazards<00:02:16.310> in<00:02:16.400> Orion<00:02:16.670> but<00:02:17.209> we're<00:02:17.330> just<00:02:17.360> gonna

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
hazards in Orion but we're just gonna

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.580 
hazards in Orion but we're just gonna
grab<00:02:17.780> this<00:02:18.020> power<00:02:18.290> up<00:02:18.590> here<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:20.020> you<00:02:21.020> can<00:02:21.050> when

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
grab this power up here and you can when

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.830 
grab this power up here and you can when
you<00:02:21.680> find<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:22.099> presence<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:23.180> open<00:02:23.450> them<00:02:23.569> up<00:02:23.660> and

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
you find a presence you open them up and

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.120 
you find a presence you open them up and
there's<00:02:23.989> different<00:02:24.140> kinds<00:02:24.470> of<00:02:24.530> gems<00:02:24.800> in<00:02:24.950> them

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
there's different kinds of gems in them

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.590 
there's different kinds of gems in them
and<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.430> can<00:02:25.459> put<00:02:25.730> them<00:02:25.880> anywhere<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:26.270> want

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
and you can put them anywhere you want

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.120 
and you can put them anywhere you want
like<00:02:26.780> I<00:02:26.840> just<00:02:26.930> put<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.230> on<00:02:27.410> a<00:02:27.530> shield<00:02:27.830> so

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
like I just put that on a shield so

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.830 
like I just put that on a shield so
you're<00:02:28.250> gonna<00:02:28.370> help<00:02:28.640> Adam<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:29.510> makes<00:02:29.660> it<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.780> lot

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
you're gonna help Adam it makes it a lot

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.420 
you're gonna help Adam it makes it a lot
easier<00:02:29.900> for<00:02:30.170> me<00:02:30.319> to<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.980> be<00:02:31.069> able<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.280> block

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
easier for me to to be able to block

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.590 
easier for me to to be able to block
these<00:02:31.640> things<00:02:31.850> because<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.120> shield's<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.450> lot

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
these things because the shield's a lot

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.850 
these things because the shield's a lot
bigger<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:33.020> now<00:02:33.230> we're<00:02:33.350> just<00:02:33.410> gonna<00:02:33.530> check

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
bigger and now we're just gonna check

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.320 
bigger and now we're just gonna check
the<00:02:33.980> map<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.220> see<00:02:34.610> where<00:02:34.640> we<00:02:34.850> can<00:02:34.970> go<00:02:35.180> so

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
the map and see where we can go so

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.660 
the map and see where we can go so
there's<00:02:35.480> a<00:02:35.510> destination<00:02:35.930> below<00:02:36.380> us<00:02:36.590> so<00:02:37.010> let's

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
there's a destination below us so let's

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.410 
there's a destination below us so let's
let's<00:02:38.360> head<00:02:38.510> there<00:02:39.580> you<00:02:40.580> can<00:02:40.700> track<00:02:40.910> down<00:02:41.030> to

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
let's head there you can track down to

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.640 
let's head there you can track down to
find<00:02:41.630> out<00:02:41.690> where<00:02:41.810> where<00:02:42.080> bunnies<00:02:42.380> and

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
find out where where bunnies and

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.680 
find out where where bunnies and
different<00:02:42.920> animals<00:02:43.010> are<00:02:43.250> yeah<00:02:43.760> so<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.510> maps

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
different animals are yeah so the maps

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.539 
different animals are yeah so the maps
are<00:02:44.840> really<00:02:45.260> important<00:02:45.590> even<00:02:45.739> for<00:02:45.860> us<00:02:46.130> because

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
are really important even for us because

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.670 
are really important even for us because
all<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:47.510> levels<00:02:47.810> in<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:47.959> game<00:02:48.140> are<00:02:48.350> randomly

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
all the levels in the game are randomly

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.770 
all the levels in the game are randomly
generated<00:02:49.220> so<00:02:49.310> you<00:02:49.400> never<00:02:49.519> know<00:02:49.750> kind<00:02:50.750> of

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
generated so you never know kind of

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.050 
generated so you never know kind of
where<00:02:51.080> everything's<00:02:51.560> gonna<00:02:51.739> be<00:02:51.980> so<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:52.819> kind

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
where everything's gonna be so you kind

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.220 
where everything's gonna be so you kind
of<00:02:53.090> have<00:02:53.239> to<00:02:53.330> constantly<00:02:53.690> be<00:02:53.780> checking<00:02:54.019> your

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
of have to constantly be checking your

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.740 
of have to constantly be checking your
map<00:02:54.410> to<00:02:54.680> know<00:02:55.640> where<00:02:55.970> you're<00:02:56.090> gonna<00:02:56.150> go<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.450> it

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
map to know where you're gonna go to it

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.699 
map to know where you're gonna go to it
to<00:02:56.930> keep<00:02:57.080> progressing<00:02:57.230> through<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.620> game

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
to keep progressing through the game

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.380 
to keep progressing through the game
yeah<00:02:58.069> each<00:02:58.310> as<00:02:58.610> you<00:02:58.910> go<00:02:59.000> through<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.239> game

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
yeah each as you go through the game

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.120 
yeah each as you go through the game
each<00:02:59.569> levels<00:02:59.900> got<00:03:00.080> like<00:03:00.319> certain<00:03:00.680> themes<00:03:00.950> and

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
each levels got like certain themes and

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.289 
each levels got like certain themes and
certain<00:03:01.310> hazards<00:03:01.670> that<00:03:01.760> you'll<00:03:01.910> but<00:03:02.150> you'll

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
certain hazards that you'll but you'll

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:03.759 
certain hazards that you'll but you'll
encounter<00:03:02.569> that<00:03:02.840> are<00:03:02.959> always<00:03:03.110> in<00:03:03.350> that<00:03:03.380> level

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
encounter that are always in that level

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.830 
encounter that are always in that level
but<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.040> layouts<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.940> enemy<00:03:05.299> placement<00:03:05.750> is

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
but the layouts and enemy placement is

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.630 
but the layouts and enemy placement is
always<00:03:06.110> different<00:03:06.980> each<00:03:07.190> time<00:03:07.489> so<00:03:09.160> yeah<00:03:10.160> so

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640

perfect weather for this very well here

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.849 
perfect weather for this very well here
you<00:03:56.720> think<00:03:56.870> as<00:03:57.019> developers<00:03:57.470> we'd<00:03:57.620> be<00:03:57.709> better

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
you think as developers we'd be better

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.039 
you think as developers we'd be better
at<00:03:58.010> room<00:03:58.190> yeah<00:03:58.400> we're<00:03:58.790> we're<00:03:59.600> taking<00:03:59.930> some

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
at room yeah we're we're taking some

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.170 
at room yeah we're we're taking some
damage<00:04:00.200> okay<00:04:00.590> but<00:04:01.220> we're<00:04:01.430> okay<00:04:01.760> we're<00:04:01.940> we're

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
damage okay but we're okay we're we're

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.330 
damage okay but we're okay we're we're
in<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.359> clear<00:04:02.510> now<00:04:02.720> so<00:04:03.019> so<00:04:03.470> that's<00:04:04.069> that's

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
in the clear now so so that's that's

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.830 
in the clear now so so that's that's
pretty<00:04:04.579> good

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
pretty good

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.259 
pretty good
okay<00:04:06.799> so<00:04:07.130> yeah<00:04:07.459> now<00:04:07.700> we're<00:04:07.790> just<00:04:07.850> gonna<00:04:07.970> skip

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
okay so yeah now we're just gonna skip

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:09.520 
okay so yeah now we're just gonna skip
ahead<00:04:08.359> to<00:04:08.540> a<00:04:08.569> bit<00:04:08.720> further<00:04:08.930> in<00:04:09.350> the<00:04:09.440> Orion

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
ahead to a bit further in the Orion

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.259 
ahead to a bit further in the Orion
constellation<00:04:09.859> now<00:04:10.430> we're<00:04:10.549> in<00:04:10.639> like<00:04:10.790> like<00:04:11.239> a

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
constellation now we're in like like a

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.970 
constellation now we're in like like a
Dyson<00:04:11.720> cave<00:04:11.930> it's<00:04:12.109> like<00:04:12.200> a<00:04:12.290> cave<00:04:12.500> surrounding

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
Dyson cave it's like a cave surrounding

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:13.559 
Dyson cave it's like a cave surrounding
nice

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
nice

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:14.910 
nice
okay<00:04:13.719> that's<00:04:14.049> a<00:04:14.140> Dyson<00:04:14.439> cave<00:04:14.620> for<00:04:14.829> the

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
okay that's a Dyson cave for the

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.170 
okay that's a Dyson cave for the
physicists<00:04:15.609> out<00:04:15.700> there<00:04:15.879> they'll<00:04:16.030> know<00:04:16.060> what

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
physicists out there they'll know what

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.969 
physicists out there they'll know what
I'm<00:04:16.299> talking<00:04:16.570> about<00:04:16.630> it's<00:04:17.410> like<00:04:17.500> a<00:04:17.590> cave

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
I'm talking about it's like a cave

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.460 
I'm talking about it's like a cave
that's<00:04:18.310> surrounding<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:18.910> Sun<00:04:19.239> here<00:04:19.539> so<00:04:20.139> the

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
that's surrounding the Sun here so the

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.469 
that's surrounding the Sun here so the
trench<00:04:20.680> is<00:04:20.769> gonna<00:04:21.009> yeah<00:04:21.609> I'm<00:04:22.000> on<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.210> turret

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
trench is gonna yeah I'm on the turret

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.450 
trench is gonna yeah I'm on the turret
and<00:04:22.600> I<00:04:22.690> tried<00:04:23.560> to<00:04:23.680> shoot<00:04:23.860> one<00:04:23.979> of<00:04:24.009> these<00:04:24.130> like

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
and I tried to shoot one of these like

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.629 
and I tried to shoot one of these like
ice-covered<00:04:25.389> enemies<00:04:25.930> but<00:04:26.800> my<00:04:27.490> regular

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
ice-covered enemies but my regular

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.279 
ice-covered enemies but my regular
bullets<00:04:28.030> can't<00:04:28.240> penetrate<00:04:28.509> the<00:04:28.750> ice<00:04:28.780> armor<00:04:29.169> so

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
bullets can't penetrate the ice armor so

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:30.570 
bullets can't penetrate the ice armor so
I<00:04:29.320> need<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.590> shoot<00:04:29.770> into<00:04:29.979> the<00:04:30.009> Sun<00:04:30.280> you<00:04:30.400> can<00:04:30.490> see

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
I need to shoot into the Sun you can see

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.279 
I need to shoot into the Sun you can see
I'm<00:04:30.970> generating<00:04:31.389> these<00:04:31.479> like<00:04:31.660> solar<00:04:31.930> flares

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
I'm generating these like solar flares

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:33.900 
I'm generating these like solar flares
that<00:04:32.440> are<00:04:32.710> melting<00:04:33.039> the<00:04:33.070> ice<00:04:33.160> and<00:04:33.340> killing<00:04:33.849> the

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
that are melting the ice and killing the

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.700 
that are melting the ice and killing the
bad<00:04:34.060> guys<00:04:34.300> for<00:04:35.020> us<00:04:35.050> check<00:04:35.860> the<00:04:36.039> map<00:04:36.250> and<00:04:37.710> you

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
bad guys for us check the map and you

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.560 
bad guys for us check the map and you
can<00:04:38.740> see<00:04:38.860> we're<00:04:39.099> in<00:04:39.190> orbit<00:04:39.400> right<00:04:39.729> now<00:04:40.000> -<00:04:40.060> like

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
can see we're in orbit right now - like

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.240 
can see we're in orbit right now - like
you<00:04:40.960> can<00:04:41.139> in<00:04:41.470> this<00:04:41.620> game<00:04:41.800> you<00:04:41.889> can<00:04:41.919> orbit

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
you can in this game you can orbit

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.719 
you can in this game you can orbit
around<00:04:42.660> suns<00:04:43.660> and<00:04:43.930> certain<00:04:44.139> planets<00:04:44.669> so<00:04:45.669> you

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
around suns and certain planets so you

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:47.790 
around suns and certain planets so you
can<00:04:45.849> stay<00:04:46.120> moving<00:04:46.270> even<00:04:46.599> when<00:04:46.750> someone's<00:04:47.740> not

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
can stay moving even when someone's not

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.710 
can stay moving even when someone's not
on<00:04:47.949> the<00:04:48.190> engine<00:04:48.610> and<00:04:48.789> so<00:04:49.270> yeah<00:04:49.449> when<00:04:49.599> you're

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
on the engine and so yeah when you're

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.820 
on the engine and so yeah when you're
when<00:04:49.900> you're<00:04:49.960> shooting<00:04:50.110> these<00:04:50.320> solar<00:04:50.590> players

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
when you're shooting these solar players

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.900 
when you're shooting these solar players
I<00:04:50.979> mean<00:04:51.009> they<00:04:51.220> do<00:04:51.310> a<00:04:51.340> lot<00:04:51.520> of<00:04:51.639> damage<00:04:51.880> to

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
I mean they do a lot of damage to

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.370 
I mean they do a lot of damage to
enemies<00:04:52.270> big<00:04:52.449> else<00:04:52.599> have<00:04:52.780> to<00:04:52.870> be<00:04:52.930> careful<00:04:53.289> if

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
enemies big else have to be careful if

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.240
