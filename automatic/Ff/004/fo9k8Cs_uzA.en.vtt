00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
sound let's talk about how the leica is

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.850 
sound let's talk about how the leica is
a<00:02:11.390> rangefinder<00:02:11.870> compared<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.620> a<00:02:12.650> lot<00:02:12.800> of

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
a rangefinder compared to a lot of

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.339 
a rangefinder compared to a lot of
people<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:13.160> are<00:02:13.310> used<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.640> DSLRs<00:02:14.569> it's

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
people that are used to DSLRs it's

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.170 
people that are used to DSLRs it's
smaller<00:02:15.740> it's<00:02:15.920> non<00:02:16.220> intrusive<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:16.940> you<00:02:17.060> can

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
smaller it's non intrusive and you can

type of canvases exactly and that's the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.449 
type of canvases exactly and that's the
reason<00:02:28.060> why<00:02:28.239> people<00:02:28.540> are<00:02:28.750> using<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.260> leica<00:02:29.470> it

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
actually contacted us and asked us

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.640 
actually contacted us and asked us
questions<00:04:41.760> about<00:04:42.480> it<00:04:42.630> we<00:04:42.750> have<00:04:42.900> now<00:04:43.140> decided

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
questions about it we have now decided

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.230 
questions about it we have now decided
to<00:04:44.010> actually<00:04:44.190> offer<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:44.820> upgrades

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
to actually offer the upgrades

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.750 
to actually offer the upgrades
independently<00:04:46.140> from<00:04:46.320> each<00:04:46.470> other<00:04:46.740> so<00:04:47.370> you<00:04:47.460> can

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
independently from each other so you can

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.880 
independently from each other so you can
either<00:04:47.880> get<00:04:48.210> only<00:04:48.510> the<00:04:48.750> sapphire<00:04:49.230> glass<00:04:49.470> which

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
either get only the sapphire glass which

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.920 
either get only the sapphire glass which
makes<00:04:50.160> the<00:04:50.580> screen<00:04:51.090> completely<00:04:51.600> scratch

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
makes the screen completely scratch

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.860 
makes the screen completely scratch
resistant<00:04:52.530> or<00:04:52.680> you<00:04:53.310> can<00:04:53.490> also<00:04:53.640> go<00:04:54.000> and<00:04:54.240> get<00:04:54.750> an

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
resistant or you can also go and get an

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.680 
resistant or you can also go and get an
even<00:04:55.200> quieter<00:04:55.530> shutter<00:04:56.070> which<00:04:56.730> seems

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
even quieter shutter which seems

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.690 
even quieter shutter which seems
unbelievable<00:04:58.380> because<00:04:58.560> shutter<00:04:59.100> is<00:04:59.310> already

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
unbelievable because shutter is already

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.460 
unbelievable because shutter is already
so<00:05:00.000> quiet<00:05:01.670> this<00:05:02.670> also<00:05:03.000> allows<00:05:03.720> you<00:05:04.140> to<00:05:04.260> take

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
so quiet this also allows you to take

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.560 
so quiet this also allows you to take
pictures<00:05:04.680> more<00:05:05.670> on<00:05:05.790> the<00:05:05.910> true<00:05:06.120> self<00:05:06.390> and

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
pictures more on the true self and

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.350 
pictures more on the true self and
really<00:05:07.470> at<00:05:07.560> spin-off<00:05:07.920> moment<00:05:08.370> well<00:05:09.000> that's<00:05:09.180> I

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
really at spin-off moment well that's I

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.460 
really at spin-off moment well that's I
mean<00:05:09.480> it's<00:05:09.690> a<00:05:09.780> really<00:05:09.960> amazing<00:05:10.140> you<00:05:10.350> can

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
mean it's a really amazing you can

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.840 
mean it's a really amazing you can
actually<00:05:10.620> make<00:05:10.860> it<00:05:10.980> quieter<00:05:11.190> because<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:11.730> way

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
actually make it quieter because the way

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.790 
actually make it quieter because the way
the<00:05:11.970> shutter<00:05:12.180> mechanism<00:05:12.330> is<00:05:12.780> on<00:05:12.930> the<00:05:13.020> EMA<00:05:13.290> you

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
the shutter mechanism is on the EMA you

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.010 
the shutter mechanism is on the EMA you
can't<00:05:14.040> hear<00:05:14.580> it<00:05:14.670> anyway<00:05:14.900> there<00:05:15.900> is<00:05:15.990> a

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
can't hear it anyway there is a

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.540 
can't hear it anyway there is a
difference<00:05:16.410> if<00:05:16.530> you're<00:05:16.650> in<00:05:16.740> a<00:05:16.770> quiet<00:05:16.980> room<00:05:17.100> and

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
difference if you're in a quiet room and

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.100 
difference if you're in a quiet room and
you<00:05:17.910> have<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.240> original<00:05:18.720> and<00:05:18.840> then<00:05:18.990> the

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
you have the original and then the

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.480 
you have the original and then the
upgraded<00:05:19.590> version<00:05:19.620> is<00:05:20.010> a<00:05:20.040> little<00:05:20.130> bit<00:05:20.460> of

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
upgraded version is a little bit of

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.950 
upgraded version is a little bit of
difference<00:05:20.669> there's<00:05:21.270> a<00:05:21.419> little<00:05:21.570> bit<00:05:21.720> of<00:05:21.780> a

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
difference there's a little bit of a

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.400 
difference there's a little bit of a
difference<00:05:22.350> and<00:05:22.620> you<00:05:23.040> know<00:05:23.160> you<00:05:23.460> can<00:05:23.490> always

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
difference and you know you can always

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.770 
difference and you know you can always
perfect<00:05:25.410> it<00:05:25.560> even<00:05:26.160> more<00:05:26.700> and<00:05:27.030> I<00:05:27.330> think<00:05:27.390> the

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
perfect it even more and I think the

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.659 
perfect it even more and I think the
important<00:05:28.260> information<00:05:28.830> about<00:05:28.890> the<00:05:29.160> Leica<00:05:29.370> is

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
important information about the Leica is

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.540 
important information about the Leica is
it's<00:05:30.240> really<00:05:30.630> a<00:05:30.660> camera<00:05:31.140> for<00:05:31.350> life<00:05:31.530> we<00:05:32.370> will
