00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:09.219
 Hello everyone, today I am going to talk to you about 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.679
 how do I take care of my hair in summer like 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.410
 you know in this season of the hair 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.460
 it always breaks down more than normal and 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.670
 we have to take care 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.519
 specific to get hair 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.130
 we were totally searched and then 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:27.159
 summer we do not have to cut a 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.569
 span two now thing of a month publish 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:30.849
 an entry in my blog in which you 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:33.460
 how he prepared the hair before 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.230
 summer I explain here briefly and 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.010
 then I leave the link below in case 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.240
 you want to know a little more about the subject 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.390
 basically I usually cut a couple of 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.820
 fingers the length of the hair so that 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.770
 the hair is totally healthy if you already 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.140
 you have before the summer the hair a 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.750
 little bit spoiled and you add water 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.940
 of the sea the chlorine of the pool and 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.040
 sunbeams surely at the end of 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.740
 summer it's your turn to cut yourself almost a span 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.300
 so I prefer to leave it perfect and 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.970
 end of summer if it is necessary to cut 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.340
 another pair of fingers but that's the way I have it 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.270
 solved and it is not necessary after 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.250
 paste the 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.439
 patch that is what usually gives us things 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.149
 girls with long hair part 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.549
 to cut my hair before summer 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:18.130
 I also always made a 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.649
 treatment either hydration or 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.880
 hair fiber restructuring my 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.579
 hair breaks down a lot then 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.500
 I need you to be perfect before 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:31.250
 summer but at the end of summer 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.760
 I may need a cut of a span to 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.440
 big span in the hair and neither is 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.900
 What I'm looking for I'm one of those who thinks 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.550
 that it is better to prevent than to cure so 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.170
 when I go to expose myself to the sun always 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.930
 I use a sunscreen for my hair 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.080
 There are many types of sunscreen 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.350
 for the hair there are in gel that are 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.920
 like a gel, it's like a gel that 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.479
 it does not leave the hair fixed but you have it 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.460
 that I put for example last year 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.470
 I'm using one but it did not convince me 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.970
 so this year not repeated because 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.690
 of course you have to put it from the root 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.729
 to the tips and what happened to me is that 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.259
 I noticed that the hair like that despite not 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.260
 to have fixation I stayed like 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.450
 pasted as dirty then I do not 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.450
 like how good I am on the beach or in 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.940
 the pool that I will not go to take 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.680
 the perfect hair because you can not 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.220
 this year I have decided to use it again in 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.720
 spray that is as comfortable as I think 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.700
 if you are going short hair we will care 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.260
 use an angel because it seems that at the same time 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.630
 He combs it a bit but with long hair 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.700
 from which you have to use a lot 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.000
 gel 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.760
 in me I do not like the result then 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.290
 this time I have taken this voucher I'm going to 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.870
 leave the name down here because I do not know 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.120
 if you can see it is a sunscreen 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.910
 for spray hair then I'm 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.739
 just before leaving home or 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.500
 when you get to the pool or the beach 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.610
 that sprays it on all the hair and already 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.250
 is 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.110
 like all sunscreens I 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.670
 what re applied every two hours this spray 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.709
 you can only find it in 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.209
 Hairdressers that works in the firm I 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.750
 I bought it in mine that is called 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.519
 Lethem is in Valencia I put you here 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.599
 down the address in case one is 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.180
 interested 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.730
 It cost me thirteen euros and it takes 150 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.160
 milliliters with this really has is 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.390
 enough for the whole summer because 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.380
 neither is it a product that you are going to use 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.720
 every day 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.160
 every day I mean I go out to the 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.260
 street to buy the bread I do not get 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.760
 sunscreen on the hair after 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.989
 I also bought this shampoo from the 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.120
 same line 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.140
 it cost me ten euros and this shampoo what 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.200
 make 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.310
 is to eliminate chlorine and salt very well 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.319
 from sea 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.840
 apart from repairing a little hair 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.310
 It will also remove the remains and 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.310
 will do a deep cleaning of the 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.900
 hair that is very important because if 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.300
 we go to the beach and we do not wash 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.500
 properly the hair the salt is going to 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.030
 be hurting hair 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.550
 continuously until we do not 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.020
 we will do and retire it well to continue 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.750
 affecting the I also bought this 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.569
 mask that cost me 16 euros is a 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.290
 repairing and very moisturizing mask 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:07.360
 I like it a lot because I notice that the hair 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.380
 go back to being like before going to the 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.760
 beach I do not notice it dry or curled 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.310
 nor heavy has a smell 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.160
 to summer they explained to us it's not a smell 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.800
 fruit is not a characteristic smell of 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.229
 nothing that can remind you of it 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.720
 although it seems in the boat that is very 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.759
 I do not know if you can see it later 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.560
 Once you apply it, it's very light and it's 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:33.479
 very very comfortable to use me 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.240
 really liking the sun mask 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.629
 I only use it when I go to expose myself to 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.060
 Sun 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:41.550
 then the days that I will not take the 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.340
 sun or I wash my hair after 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.860
 gym still using oil 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.349
 moroccanoil what I notice is that I 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.080
 Leaves hair more care more 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:54.509
 bright more more lawful less 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.219
 then curled I use it more as 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.960
 Finishing product that as a treatment 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:59.430
 to hydrate the hair for the rest 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.919
 of days that I do not go to the beach I'm 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.240
 using a shampoo often used I'm going 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.719
 four times a week to the gym 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.780
 then the hair you want or not the head 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:11.909
 sweat and the hair gets dirty then 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.120
 although I wash it very often more than 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:17.430
 that he should have used a soft trampuz that 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.710
 I retired a little the sweat and it is already 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.759
 because really no overnight 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.610
 it only gets dirty 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:24.900
 I'm using this now it's inter 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.069
 apotheke this you can buy it in 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.409
 pharmacies 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:29.280
 this is the family size that brings 750 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:31.970
 milliliters 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.340
 and I a simply clean dispenser 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.260
 no more is what I look for during the week and 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.630
 especially when I go to the gym that 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.060
 I took off the sweat a little I can 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.770
 have in the hair and a little bit more because 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.710
 then for treatment and use always 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.230
 the masks or conditioners now 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.389
 in summer the dryer banished him 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.389
 totally my life does not usually use 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:56.190
 dryers and irons unless you have 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:59.400
 a special event and I want to go 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:01.590
 good hairstyle this is my hair routine 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.690
