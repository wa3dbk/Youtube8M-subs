move<00:03:02.389> into<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.659> room<00:03:02.840> though<00:03:03.019> and<00:03:03.260> I<00:03:03.949> suppose

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:04.189 
move into the room though and I suppose

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.159 
move into the room though and I suppose
with<00:03:04.459> a<00:03:04.489> spear<00:03:05.000> action<00:03:05.389> she's<00:03:05.599> going<00:03:06.049> to

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:06.169 
with a spear action she's going to

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:08.199 
with a spear action she's going to
search<00:03:06.500> for<00:03:06.739> secret<00:03:07.069> doors<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:07.370> traps<00:03:07.579> okay

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
search for secret doors and traps okay

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.379 
search for secret doors and traps okay
so<00:03:08.269> she<00:03:08.419> moves<00:03:08.750> adjacent<00:03:09.439> to<00:03:09.439> her<00:03:10.389> companion

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
so she moves adjacent to her companion

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:13.959 
so she moves adjacent to her companion
and<00:03:12.159> attempts<00:03:13.159> to<00:03:13.189> search<00:03:13.430> for<00:03:13.579> secret<00:03:13.819> doors

and attempts to search for secret doors

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:17.259 
and attempts to search for secret doors
and<00:03:14.090> traps<00:03:14.269> now<00:03:14.650> she<00:03:15.650> actually<00:03:16.099> finds<00:03:16.730> in<00:03:17.060> the

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.819 
standing that there's actually a pit
trap<00:03:25.120> so<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.150> timely<00:03:26.599> search<00:03:26.840> has<00:03:27.079> proven<00:03:27.620> once
