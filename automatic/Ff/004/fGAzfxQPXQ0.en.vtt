00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
send it to a faction because we have

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.480 
send it to a faction because we have
factions<00:05:55.259> because<00:05:55.949> then<00:05:56.100> we<00:05:56.160> can<00:05:56.280> without

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:26.240 
we're going to work on defenses here at
the<00:06:24.690> base<00:06:24.900> and<00:06:24.930> then<00:06:25.320> eventually<00:06:25.620> when<00:06:26.099> we're

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
the base and then eventually when we're

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.760 
the base and then eventually when we're
prepared<00:06:26.669> we<00:06:27.270> go<00:06:27.419> raid<00:06:27.690> some<00:06:27.960> people<00:06:28.289> I<00:06:28.470> think

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
prepared we go raid some people I think

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.830 
prepared we go raid some people I think
that's<00:06:28.919> going<00:06:29.039> to<00:06:29.099> happen<00:06:29.250> soon<00:06:29.849> sooner<00:06:30.660> than

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
that's going to happen soon sooner than

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.920 
that's going to happen soon sooner than
later<00:06:31.760> I<00:06:32.760> think<00:06:33.210> the<00:06:33.300> server<00:06:33.570> is<00:06:33.660> going<00:06:33.720> to<00:06:33.870> be

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
later I think the server is going to be

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.689 
later I think the server is going to be
a<00:06:33.960> lot<00:06:34.139> more<00:06:34.169> fun<00:06:34.500> than<00:06:34.740> the<00:06:34.860> old<00:06:35.070> bowl<00:06:35.370> because
