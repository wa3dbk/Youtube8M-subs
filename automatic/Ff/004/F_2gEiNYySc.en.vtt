00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
dish when we do this as a family we tend

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.100 
dish when we do this as a family we tend
to<00:00:47.340> make<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:47.879> mass<00:00:48.239> because<00:00:48.750> then<00:00:48.930> there's

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
to make it on mass because then there's

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.049 
to make it on mass because then there's
loads<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.530> us<00:00:49.710> helping<00:00:50.280> get<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.820> quicker

loads of us helping get to it quicker

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.240 
loads of us helping get to it quicker
and<00:00:51.360> then<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:51.989> do<00:00:52.140> dry<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.949> we've<00:00:53.070> got

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
cutter you could just get a fork a

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.710 
cutter you could just get a fork a
simple<00:01:42.570> form<00:01:42.810> just<00:01:43.229> press<00:01:43.799> your<00:01:44.070> fork<00:01:44.720> down

are<00:02:24.910> really<00:02:25.660> really<00:02:25.989> really<00:02:26.170> little<00:02:26.410> thin

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
are really really really little thin

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.240 
are really really really little thin
they're<00:02:27.459> almost<00:02:27.670> like<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:29.010> thickness<00:02:30.010> of<00:02:30.160> a

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
they're almost like the thickness of a

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.670 
they're almost like the thickness of a
spaghetti<00:02:30.489> but<00:02:31.000> they're<00:02:31.180> squished<00:02:31.510> flat<00:02:31.720> pop

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
spaghetti but they're squished flat pop

them on a tray with a bit of polenta or

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.449 
them on a tray with a bit of polenta or
semolina<00:02:35.049> because<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:35.769> stops<00:02:36.129> it<00:02:36.280> from

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
semolina because that stops it from

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.970 
semolina because that stops it from
sticking<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.540> as<00:02:37.989> we<00:02:38.170> said<00:02:38.379> before<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.829> more

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
sticking and as we said before the more

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.920 
sticking and as we said before the more
flour<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.430> add<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.819> heavier<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.299> pasta<00:02:40.780> and

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
flour you add the heavier the pasta and

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.720 
flour you add the heavier the pasta and
just<00:02:41.140> make<00:02:41.349> sure<00:02:41.590> they're<00:02:41.769> separate<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.370> now

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
just make sure they're separate and now

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.449 
just make sure they're separate and now
they<00:02:42.910> can<00:02:43.090> air<00:02:43.329> dry<00:02:43.660> for<00:02:44.019> a<00:02:44.230> little<00:02:44.470> bit<00:02:44.680> if

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
they can air dry for a little bit if

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.150 
they can air dry for a little bit if
however<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.989> want<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.230> make<00:02:47.379> Talia<00:02:47.950> they'll

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:06.639 
a heavier sauce because obviously the

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.420 
a heavier sauce because obviously the
pasta<00:03:07.030> can<00:03:07.209> can<00:03:07.720> hold<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.470> sauce<00:03:08.680> much<00:03:08.950> better

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
pasta can can hold the sauce much better

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.460 
pasta can can hold the sauce much better
whereas<00:03:10.060> linguini<00:03:10.480> might<00:03:10.840> take<00:03:11.079> a<00:03:11.109> more

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
whereas linguini might take a more

whereas linguini might take a more
delicate<00:03:11.680> sauce<00:03:12.160> like<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.430> fish<00:03:12.700> sauce<00:03:12.970> so

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
delicate sauce like a fish sauce so

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:14.759 
delicate sauce like a fish sauce so

really simple we've tried a few

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:18.300 
really simple we've tried a few
different<00:03:16.810> shapes<00:03:17.049> but<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.500> possibilities

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
different shapes but the possibilities

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.520
