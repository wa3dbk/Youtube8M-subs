wml I always think what better way to
test<00:00:33.020> like<00:00:33.290> sit<00:00:33.500> on<00:00:33.560> shotguns<00:00:34.100> because<00:00:34.340> if

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:34.490 
test like sit on shotguns because if

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.470 
test like sit on shotguns because if
anything<00:00:34.700> is<00:00:34.880> going<00:00:35.000> to<00:00:35.059> give<00:00:35.180> them<00:00:35.239> problems

it's going to be the pump-action shot

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.850 
it's going to be the pump-action shot
anyway<00:00:38.570> we'll<00:00:38.960> get<00:00:39.080> back<00:00:39.230> into<00:00:39.470> the<00:00:39.590> rest<00:00:39.770> of

here is the factory 104 lumen LED light

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.470 
here is the factory 104 lumen LED light
in<00:00:54.380> it<00:00:54.530> use<00:00:55.400> this<00:00:55.550> as<00:00:55.700> a<00:00:55.730> control<00:00:56.000> and<00:00:56.300> all<00:00:56.390> my

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
in it use this as a control and all my

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.700 
in it use this as a control and all my
tests<00:00:56.720> there's<00:00:57.020> a<00:00:57.050> lot<00:00:57.170> of<00:00:57.260> guys<00:00:57.380> just<00:00:57.410> aren't

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
tests there's a lot of guys just aren't

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.230 
tests there's a lot of guys just aren't
familiar<00:00:57.860> with<00:00:58.160> tack<00:00:58.340> lights<00:00:58.579> and<00:00:58.790> just<00:00:59.060> the

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.240 
familiar with tack lights and just the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.730 
familiar with tack lights and just the
kind<00:00:59.450> of<00:00:59.570> light<00:00:59.750> they<00:00:59.870> put<00:01:00.079> out<00:01:00.200> so<00:01:00.470> this<00:01:00.590> is

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:00.740 
kind of light they put out so this is

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.319 
kind of light they put out so this is
the<00:01:00.829> control<00:01:01.070> we're<00:01:01.220> going<00:01:01.340> to<00:01:01.400> be<00:01:01.460> using<00:01:01.640> then

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
the control we're going to be using then

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.229 
the control we're going to be using then
we<00:01:02.480> have<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:02.960> obviously<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:04.089> enforced<00:01:05.089> light

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
we have the obviously the enforced light

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.370 
we have the obviously the enforced light
you've<00:01:05.780> seen<00:01:05.990> throughout<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.290> review

you've seen throughout the review
already<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:06.920> then<00:01:07.550> a<00:01:07.640> surefire<00:01:08.020> this<00:01:09.020> one

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
already and then a surefire this one

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.050 
already and then a surefire this one
here<00:01:09.470> is<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.680> x300<00:01:10.490> this<00:01:10.580> is<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.759> ultra<00:01:11.030> the

the Maglite 104 lumen LED mag light and
then<00:01:21.140> here<00:01:21.530> we<00:01:21.619> have<00:01:21.649> the<00:01:22.160> enforce<00:01:22.910> wml<00:01:23.869> so<00:01:24.860> my

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
then here we have the enforce wml so my

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.700 
then here we have the enforce wml so my
light<00:01:25.600> wml<00:01:26.600> you<00:01:26.780> can<00:01:26.869> see<00:01:27.050> it's<00:01:27.170> much<00:01:27.440> brighter

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
the enforce not quite so much

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.309 
the enforce not quite so much
obviously<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.490> 200<00:02:05.240> versus<00:02:05.539> 500<00:02:05.959> lumen<00:02:06.170> gap

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
obviously the 200 versus 500 lumen gap

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.630 
obviously the 200 versus 500 lumen gap
is<00:02:06.530> kind<00:02:06.740> of<00:02:06.800> showing<00:02:06.950> there<00:02:07.220> and<00:02:07.340> they<00:02:07.399> shot

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
is kind of showing there and they shot

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.359 
is kind of showing there and they shot
but<00:02:08.539> you<00:02:08.810> can<00:02:08.990> see<00:02:09.170> either<00:02:09.380> way<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:10.039> target

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
and when you're ready to go ahead and

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.630 
and when you're ready to go ahead and
use<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.530> light<00:03:40.650> you<00:03:40.739> just<00:03:40.769> push<00:03:41.040> down<00:03:41.070> on<00:03:41.280> it

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
use the light you just push down on it

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.970 
use the light you just push down on it
um<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.900> mounting<00:03:43.260> system<00:03:43.410> is<00:03:43.680> something

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
um the mounting system is something

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.630 
um the mounting system is something
that's<00:03:44.100> very<00:03:44.610> very<00:03:44.959> a<00:03:45.959> big<00:03:46.890> positive<00:03:47.160> if<00:03:47.519> you

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
that's very very a big positive if you

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.009 
that's very very a big positive if you
although<00:03:47.970> like<00:03:48.150> I<00:03:48.330> really<00:03:48.690> don't<00:03:48.810> know<00:03:48.870> how<00:03:48.959> to

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
although like I really don't know how to

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.900 
although like I really don't know how to
say<00:03:49.380> it<00:03:49.500> but<00:03:49.709> comes<00:03:50.220> in<00:03:50.370> with<00:03:50.519> a<00:03:50.549> built-in

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
say it but comes in with a built-in

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.280 
say it but comes in with a built-in
mount<00:03:51.120> as<00:03:51.330> you<00:03:51.420> see<00:03:51.570> here<00:03:51.720> so<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:51.930> don't<00:03:52.080> need

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
mount as you see here so you don't need

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.900 
mount as you see here so you don't need
an<00:03:52.410> external<00:03:52.680> mount<00:03:52.980> for<00:03:53.220> it<00:03:53.340> or<00:03:53.670> an

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
an external mount for it or an

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.460 
an external mount for it or an
additional<00:03:54.299> Mouse<00:03:54.420> so<00:03:54.720> when<00:03:55.170> you'll<00:03:55.290> get<00:03:55.410> the

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
price at this light you got to take that

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.240 
price at this light you got to take that
in<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:56.970> into<00:03:57.630> account<00:03:57.840> as<00:03:57.930> well<00:03:58.100> I'll<00:03:59.100> show

in the 1930s style rail and just go

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.219 
in the 1930s style rail and just go
ahead<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:16.169> put<00:04:16.829> it<00:04:16.919> down<00:04:17.040> on<00:04:17.720> by<00:04:18.720> pushing<00:04:18.989> up

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
ahead and put it down on by pushing up

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.080 
ahead and put it down on by pushing up
on<00:04:19.380> it<00:04:19.530> let<00:04:20.100> me<00:04:20.280> kick<00:04:20.549> it<00:04:20.669> off<00:04:20.760> and<00:04:20.790> show<00:04:21.030> you

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
on it let me kick it off and show you

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.570 
on it let me kick it off and show you
guys<00:04:21.269> what<00:04:21.900> I<00:04:21.930> mean<00:04:22.109> bet<00:04:22.229> you<00:04:22.380> can<00:04:22.500> push<00:04:22.860> and

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
guys what I mean bet you can push and

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.370 
guys what I mean bet you can push and
that<00:04:23.640> will<00:04:23.850> leave<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.270> pressure<00:04:24.479> on<00:04:24.660> it<00:04:24.690> just

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
that will leave the pressure on it just

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.409 
that will leave the pressure on it just
go<00:04:25.530> ahead<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:25.740> line<00:04:25.860> it<00:04:25.890> up<00:04:26.070> push<00:04:26.550> down<00:04:26.729> and

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
go ahead and line it up push down and

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.990 
go ahead and line it up push down and
then<00:04:27.510> tighten<00:04:27.840> it<00:04:27.870> down<00:04:28.460> and<00:04:29.460> that<00:04:29.640> thing<00:04:29.880> is

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
then tighten it down and that thing is

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.400 
then tighten it down and that thing is
snug<00:04:30.300> on<00:04:30.479> there<00:04:30.510> it<00:04:30.810> is<00:04:30.870> not<00:04:30.930> going<00:04:31.110> to<00:04:31.320> go

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
snug on there it is not going to go

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.890 
snug on there it is not going to go
anywhere<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:32.460> can<00:04:32.610> jerk<00:04:32.910> on<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.270> recoil

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
anywhere you can jerk on it recoil

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.110 
anywhere you can jerk on it recoil
nothing<00:04:34.800> it's<00:04:34.950> not<00:04:35.070> going<00:04:35.250> to<00:04:35.310> look<00:04:35.520> it's<00:04:36.000> not

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
nothing it's not going to look it's not

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.640 
nothing it's not going to look it's not
going<00:04:36.240> to<00:04:36.330> come<00:04:36.419> off<00:04:36.450> and<00:04:36.960> to<00:04:37.110> take<00:04:37.260> it<00:04:37.380> off<00:04:37.470> and

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
going to come off and to take it off and

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.559 
going to come off and to take it off and
very<00:04:37.770> very<00:04:37.950> simple<00:04:38.220> again<00:04:38.430> you<00:04:38.669> just<00:04:38.849> reverse

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 
very very simple again you just reverse

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:43.579 
very very simple again you just reverse
process<00:04:39.929> twist<00:04:40.770> out<00:04:40.919> pull<00:04:41.819> up<00:04:41.969> and<00:04:42.439> the<00:04:43.439> light

00:04:43.579 --> 00:04:43.589 
process twist out pull up and the light

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:45.499 
process twist out pull up and the light
is<00:04:43.740> off<00:04:43.919> now<00:04:44.699> that<00:04:44.819> you<00:04:44.909> got<00:04:44.999> a<00:04:45.059> close-up<00:04:45.240> look

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:45.509 
is off now that you got a close-up look

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:46.700 
is off now that you got a close-up look
at<00:04:45.689> it<00:04:45.839> let's<00:04:45.990> go<00:04:46.139> over<00:04:46.289> some<00:04:46.439> of<00:04:46.469> the<00:04:46.559> specs

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
at it let's go over some of the specs

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.929 
at it let's go over some of the specs
that<00:04:46.860> I<00:04:46.889> haven't<00:04:47.069> covered<00:04:47.189> so<00:04:47.460> far

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:47.939 
that I haven't covered so far

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:50.329 
that I haven't covered so far
first<00:04:48.389> up<00:04:48.599> obviously<00:04:49.199> it's<00:04:49.469> 200<00:04:49.860> lumen<00:04:50.099> like<00:04:50.219> I

00:04:50.329 --> 00:04:50.339 
first up obviously it's 200 lumen like I

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:52.100 
first up obviously it's 200 lumen like I
did<00:04:50.490> say<00:04:50.669> there<00:04:50.849> but<00:04:50.879> that<00:04:51.089> 200<00:04:51.449> lumens<00:04:51.749> is

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
did say there but that 200 lumens is

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.100 
did say there but that 200 lumens is
powered<00:04:52.559> by<00:04:52.770> one<00:04:53.459> cr123<00:04:54.449> battery<00:04:54.749> so<00:04:54.959> there's

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
powered by one cr123 battery so there's

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.689 
powered by one cr123 battery so there's
only<00:04:55.169> one<00:04:55.409> battery<00:04:55.709> in<00:04:55.860> there<00:04:55.979> versus<00:04:56.490> a<00:04:56.550> lot

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
only one battery in there versus a lot

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.279 
only one battery in there versus a lot
of<00:04:56.789> tact<00:04:56.969> lights<00:04:57.149> that<00:04:57.300> are<00:04:57.389> running<00:04:57.599> to<00:04:57.779> the

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
of tact lights that are running to the

00:04:58.289 --> 00:04:59.869 
of tact lights that are running to the
advantage<00:04:58.740> of<00:04:58.800> that<00:04:58.949> is<00:04:59.159> obviously<00:04:59.459> cost<00:04:59.729> to

00:04:59.869 --> 00:04:59.879 
advantage of that is obviously cost to

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:01.249 
advantage of that is obviously cost to
the<00:04:59.969> batteries<00:05:00.300> so<00:05:00.479> you're<00:05:00.899> not<00:05:01.020> going<00:05:01.169> to

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 
the batteries so you're not going to

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.709 
the batteries so you're not going to
spend<00:05:01.439> as<00:05:01.559> much<00:05:01.709> and<00:05:01.949> and<00:05:02.819> it's<00:05:03.240> also<00:05:03.389> lighter

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:03.719 
spend as much and and it's also lighter

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:05.719 
spend as much and and it's also lighter
this<00:05:03.959> light<00:05:04.199> only<00:05:04.860> weighs<00:05:05.009> three<00:05:05.369> ounces

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
this light only weighs three ounces

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:07.189 
this light only weighs three ounces
that's<00:05:05.909> with<00:05:06.179> the<00:05:06.300> battery<00:05:06.599> it's<00:05:07.020> got<00:05:07.169> a

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
that's with the battery it's got a

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
honestly I think this is about perfect

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.119 
honestly I think this is about perfect
in<00:05:49.019> terms<00:05:49.229> of<00:05:49.319> positioning<00:05:49.680> that's<00:05:49.860> where<00:05:50.099> I

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:50.129 
in terms of positioning that's where I

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:51.920 
in terms of positioning that's where I
generally<00:05:50.580> keep<00:05:50.759> my<00:05:50.879> thumb<00:05:51.029> anyway<00:05:51.419> when

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
generally keep my thumb anyway when

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.089 
generally keep my thumb anyway when
firing<00:05:52.319> you<00:05:52.379> can<00:05:52.499> either<00:05:52.649> keep<00:05:52.769> it<00:05:52.919> a<00:05:52.949> little

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099 
firing you can either keep it a little

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:54.920 
firing you can either keep it a little
bit<00:05:53.219> above<00:05:53.399> a<00:05:53.669> little<00:05:53.879> bit<00:05:53.969> below<00:05:54.119> either<00:05:54.719> way

bit above a little bit below either way

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.089 
bit above a little bit below either way
and<00:05:55.050> still<00:05:55.259> get<00:05:55.349> a<00:05:55.379> good<00:05:55.559> purchase<00:05:55.769> on<00:05:56.009> the

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
and still get a good purchase on the

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:57.769 
and still get a good purchase on the
grip<00:05:56.279> same<00:05:56.819> applies<00:05:57.089> if<00:05:57.300> you're<00:05:57.449> running<00:05:57.569> the

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:02.969 
think it's just about perfect because

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:04.040 
think it's just about perfect because
the<00:06:03.149> way<00:06:03.269> it's<00:06:03.419> set<00:06:03.569> up<00:06:03.599> there

00:07:00.239 --> 00:07:00.249 
kind of I always mentioned if there is a

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:01.649 
kind of I always mentioned if there is a

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:04.149 
in battery runtime so in my opinion

00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:06.629 
in battery runtime so in my opinion
Alice<00:07:04.659> a<00:07:04.779> 100<00:07:05.439> hundred<00:07:05.739> 25<00:07:06.039> lumens<00:07:06.249> and<00:07:06.519> up

Alice a 100 hundred 25 lumens and up

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:07.829 
Alice a 100 hundred 25 lumens and up
it's<00:07:06.999> probably<00:07:07.300> going<00:07:07.389> to<00:07:07.449> work<00:07:07.569> for<00:07:07.749> most

00:07:07.829 --> 00:07:07.839
