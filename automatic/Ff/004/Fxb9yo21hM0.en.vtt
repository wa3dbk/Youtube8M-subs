00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
fantastic exercise it builds mobility

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.260 
fantastic exercise it builds mobility
and<00:00:19.100> stability<00:00:19.990> on<00:00:20.990> the<00:00:21.200> single<00:00:21.470> legs<00:00:22.180> and<00:00:23.180> a

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
and stability on the single legs and a

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.820 
and stability on the single legs and a
lot<00:00:23.420> of<00:00:23.450> strength<00:00:23.750> as<00:00:23.960> well<00:00:24.080> and<00:00:24.380> it's<00:00:24.650> great

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
lot of strength as well and it's great

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.010 
lot of strength as well and it's great
because<00:00:24.920> generally<00:00:25.640> you<00:00:25.730> don't<00:00:25.880> need<00:00:26.120> any

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
because generally you don't need any

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.360 
because generally you don't need any
equipment<00:00:27.230> to<00:00:27.560> do<00:00:27.680> it<00:00:27.710> so<00:00:27.890> you<00:00:27.980> can<00:00:28.100> do<00:00:28.190> it<00:00:28.310> if

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:28.370 
equipment to do it so you can do it if

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.010 
equipment to do it so you can do it if
you're<00:00:28.460> on<00:00:28.760> holiday<00:00:29.180> or<00:00:29.420> if<00:00:29.570> you're<00:00:29.690> traveling

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
you're on holiday or if you're traveling

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.240 
you're on holiday or if you're traveling
you're<00:00:30.170> doing<00:00:30.380> a<00:00:30.440> hotel<00:00:30.800> room<00:00:30.980> or<00:00:31.100> anything

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
you're doing a hotel room or anything

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.779 
you're doing a hotel room or anything
like<00:00:31.400> that

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
like that

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.080 
like that
now<00:00:32.419> the<00:00:32.480> basic<00:00:32.960> pistol<00:00:33.410> squat<00:00:33.710> is<00:00:34.460> actually

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
now the basic pistol squat is actually

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.090 
now the basic pistol squat is actually
the<00:00:35.570> hardest<00:00:35.900> version<00:00:36.350> of<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:36.530> pistol<00:00:36.860> squat

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
the hardest version of the pistol squat

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.319 
the hardest version of the pistol squat
so<00:00:37.520> this<00:00:37.670> is<00:00:37.820> a<00:00:37.850> standard<00:00:38.480> pistol<00:00:39.020> squat

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.270 

as<00:00:44.929> you<00:00:45.019> can<00:00:45.079> see<00:00:45.320> a<00:00:45.530> little<00:00:45.829> bit<00:00:45.980> of<00:00:46.100> balance

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
as you can see a little bit of balance

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.950 
as you can see a little bit of balance
required<00:00:46.730> only<00:00:46.909> lost<00:00:47.269> my<00:00:47.359> balance<00:00:47.600> there<00:00:47.870> at

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
required only lost my balance there at

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.299 
required only lost my balance there at
the<00:00:48.079> end<00:00:48.230> a<00:00:48.409> little<00:00:48.500> bit<00:00:49.010> of<00:00:49.159> stability

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
the end a little bit of stability

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.279 
the end a little bit of stability
required<00:00:50.000> a<00:00:50.269> little<00:00:50.480> bit<00:00:50.690> of<00:00:50.780> flexibility

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
required a little bit of flexibility

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.860 
required a little bit of flexibility
required<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:53.300> be<00:00:53.390> honest<00:00:53.629> a<00:00:53.690> lot<00:00:53.809> of

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
required and to be honest a lot of

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.289 
required and to be honest a lot of
people<00:00:54.140> have<00:00:54.320> great<00:00:54.859> difficulty<00:00:55.460> doing<00:00:55.789> that

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:56.299 
people have great difficulty doing that

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:58.630 
people have great difficulty doing that
version<00:00:56.539> of<00:00:56.839> the<00:00:56.960> pistol<00:00:57.320> squat<00:00:57.559> so<00:00:58.309> I'm<00:00:58.489> going

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
version of the pistol squat so I'm going

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.310 
version of the pistol squat so I'm going
to<00:00:58.670> show<00:00:58.879> you<00:00:58.940> a<00:00:59.030> few<00:00:59.299> different<00:00:59.780> versions<00:00:59.960> and

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
to show you a few different versions and

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.829 
to show you a few different versions and
some<00:01:00.500> progressions<00:01:01.070> you<00:01:01.189> can<00:01:01.369> use<00:01:01.629> so<00:01:02.629> that

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
some progressions you can use so that

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.329 
some progressions you can use so that
you<00:01:02.899> can<00:01:03.019> build<00:01:03.140> up<00:01:03.350> to<00:01:03.469> that<00:01:03.500> that<00:01:04.009> single

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
you can build up to that that single

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:05.620 
you can build up to that that single
exercise<00:01:04.549> the<00:01:04.850> other<00:01:04.970> thing<00:01:05.119> with<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.299> pistol

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
exercise the other thing with the pistol

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.389 
exercise the other thing with the pistol
squat<00:01:05.840> too<00:01:05.990> is<00:01:06.110> it<00:01:06.229> going<00:01:06.799> deep<00:01:07.009> a<00:01:07.130> lot<00:01:07.310> of

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
squat too is it going deep a lot of

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:11.740 
squat too is it going deep a lot of
people<00:01:09.280> doing<00:01:10.280> that<00:01:10.429> will<00:01:10.909> find<00:01:11.210> it's

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
people doing that will find it's

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.999 
people doing that will find it's
actually<00:01:11.990> quite<00:01:12.140> hard<00:01:12.350> on<00:01:12.470> these<00:01:12.679> so<00:01:12.860> if<00:01:12.950> you

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
actually quite hard on these so if you

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:14.410 
actually quite hard on these so if you
like<00:01:13.189> me<00:01:13.369> and<00:01:13.399> you<00:01:13.520> have<00:01:13.580> had<00:01:13.700> a<00:01:13.880> few<00:01:14.119> need

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
like me and you have had a few need

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.450 
like me and you have had a few need
troubles<00:01:14.750> over<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.049> years<00:01:15.340> there's<00:01:16.340> some

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
troubles over the years there's some

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.440 
troubles over the years there's some
other<00:01:16.610> ones<00:01:16.789> here<00:01:16.850> that<00:01:16.940> are<00:01:17.119> a<00:01:17.149> little<00:01:17.240> bit

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
other ones here that are a little bit

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.919 
other ones here that are a little bit
more<00:01:17.479> knee<00:01:17.750> friendly<00:01:18.200> anyway<00:01:19.159> the<00:01:19.310> first

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
more knee friendly anyway the first

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.120 
more knee friendly anyway the first
simplest<00:01:20.929> progression<00:01:21.409> of<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.560> pistol<00:01:21.890> squat

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
simplest progression of the pistol squat

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.770 
simplest progression of the pistol squat
and<00:01:22.819> this<00:01:22.940> is<00:01:23.030> where<00:01:23.179> I<00:01:23.209> would<00:01:23.330> say<00:01:23.569> most

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
and this is where I would say most

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.480 
and this is where I would say most
people<00:01:23.869> start<00:01:24.380> is<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:24.770> pistol<00:01:25.100> box<00:01:25.280> squat

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
people start is the pistol box squat

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.230 
people start is the pistol box squat
basically<00:01:25.970> you<00:01:26.060> get<00:01:26.209> a<00:01:26.259> box<00:01:27.259> like<00:01:27.470> that<00:01:28.240> stick

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
basically you get a box like that stick

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.730 
basically you get a box like that stick
your<00:01:29.390> leg<00:01:29.509> yet

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.760 

come<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.579> now<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.090> obviously<00:01:33.420> easier

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
come on now this is obviously easier

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.990 
come on now this is obviously easier
because<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.920> don't<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.310> go<00:01:35.399> down<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:35.790> far

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
because you don't have to go down so far

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.450 
because you don't have to go down so far
there's<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.479> slightly<00:01:36.750> lower<00:01:37.470> range<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.950> motion

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
there's a slightly lower range of motion

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.100 
there's a slightly lower range of motion
and<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.210> increase<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.720> range<00:01:40.020> of

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
and you can increase that range of

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.170 
and you can increase that range of
motion<00:01:40.170> by<00:01:40.500> gradually<00:01:40.920> reducing<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.970> height

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
motion by gradually reducing the height

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.820 
motion by gradually reducing the height
of<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.390> box<00:01:42.600> until<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.990> eventually<00:01:43.350> get<00:01:43.680> down

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
of the box until you eventually get down

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.770 
of the box until you eventually get down
to<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:46.369> ground<00:01:47.369> level<00:01:47.549> version<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.600> once

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
to the ground level version so once

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.279 
to the ground level version so once
you've<00:01:48.930> sort<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.740> mastered<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.250> version

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
you've sort of mastered that version

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.980 
you've sort of mastered that version
another<00:01:52.289> version<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.710> can<00:01:52.860> do<00:01:53.039> is<00:01:53.250> by

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
another version you can do is by

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.529 
another version you can do is by
standing<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.289> box<00:01:55.649> now<00:01:56.009> what<00:01:56.220> this<00:01:56.369> does

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
standing on the box now what this does

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.350 
standing on the box now what this does
it<00:01:57.539> allows<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.289> allow<00:01:59.009> this<00:01:59.250> leg<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.670> trial

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
it allows you to allow this leg to trial

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.539 
it allows you to allow this leg to trial
a<00:02:00.720> little<00:02:01.560> bit<00:02:01.649> closer<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.039> your<00:02:02.159> body<00:02:02.250> doesn't

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
a little bit closer to your body doesn't

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.430 
a little bit closer to your body doesn't
have<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.820> stick<00:02:03.030> out<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.390> far<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:04.170> you're<00:02:04.350> not

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
have to stick out so far so you're not

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.370 
have to stick out so far so you're not
restricted<00:02:05.190> by<00:02:05.220> flexibility<00:02:05.940> so<00:02:06.090> much

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.690 

there<00:02:10.380> also<00:02:10.530> it's<00:02:10.799> easy<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.100> balance<00:02:11.250> when<00:02:11.519> you

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
there also it's easy to balance when you

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.150 
there also it's easy to balance when you
legs<00:02:12.239> all<00:02:12.420> in<00:02:12.569> line<00:02:12.720> like<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.019> so<00:02:14.690> that's<00:02:15.690> the

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
legs all in line like that so that's the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.759 
legs all in line like that so that's the
next<00:02:17.160> version<00:02:17.549> of<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.760> pistol<00:02:18.209> squat<00:02:18.769> another

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
next version of the pistol squat another

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.460 
next version of the pistol squat another
really<00:02:20.250> good<00:02:20.430> way<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.910> do<00:02:21.660> pistol<00:02:22.049> squats<00:02:22.319> that

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
really good way to do pistol squats that

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.910 
really good way to do pistol squats that
is<00:02:22.739> quite<00:02:22.980> easy<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.930> by<00:02:24.930> simply<00:02:25.319> holding<00:02:25.680> on<00:02:25.799> to

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
is quite easy is by simply holding on to

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.949 
is quite easy is by simply holding on to
something<00:02:26.299> one<00:02:27.299> of<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.450> problems<00:02:27.840> people

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
something one of the problems people

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.110 
something one of the problems people
have<00:02:28.260> with<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.530> pistol<00:02:28.890> squad<00:02:29.100> is<00:02:29.220> they<00:02:29.400> will

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
have with the pistol squad is they will

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.809 
have with the pistol squad is they will
balance<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:30.750> tend<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:30.989> fall<00:02:31.140> backwards<00:02:31.819> so

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
balance and tend to fall backwards so

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.370 
balance and tend to fall backwards so
you<00:02:32.849> can<00:02:33.060> do<00:02:33.299> I've<00:02:33.720> just<00:02:33.900> got<00:02:34.049> a<00:02:34.080> strap<00:02:34.349> here

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
you can do I've just got a strap here

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.770 
you can do I've just got a strap here
but<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.980> can<00:02:35.130> use<00:02:35.280> hold<00:02:36.090> either<00:02:36.269> side<00:02:36.600> of<00:02:36.720> a

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
but you can use hold either side of a

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.420 
but you can use hold either side of a
door<00:02:36.989> handle<00:02:37.200> we<00:02:37.410> can<00:02:37.560> use<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.739> towel<00:02:38.070> around<00:02:38.100> a

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
door handle we can use a towel around a

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.780 
door handle we can use a towel around a
pole<00:02:38.720> basically

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.910 

and<00:02:45.629> having<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:46.049> ability<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.560> hold<00:02:46.709> onto

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
and having that ability to hold onto

and having that ability to hold onto
something<00:02:47.159> and<00:02:47.489> lean<00:02:47.939> back<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.239> little<00:02:48.500> allows

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
something and lean back a little allows

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.149 
something and lean back a little allows
you<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:50.120> perform<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.420> pistol<00:02:52.110> squat<00:02:52.319> everyday

you to perform the pistol squat everyday

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.940 
you to perform the pistol squat everyday
yeah<00:02:53.459> anyway<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.930> last<00:02:55.110> version<00:02:55.409> I'm<00:02:55.799> going

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
yeah anyway the last version I'm going

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.520 
yeah anyway the last version I'm going
to<00:02:56.010> show<00:02:56.159> you<00:02:56.220> is<00:02:56.659> the<00:02:57.659> weighted<00:02:58.019> pistols<00:02:58.379> took

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
to show you is the weighted pistols took

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.199 
to show you is the weighted pistols took
what<00:02:58.709> now<00:02:59.340> believe<00:02:59.579> it<00:02:59.700> or<00:02:59.760> not<00:02:59.849> this<00:03:00.000> is

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
what now believe it or not this is

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.809 
what now believe it or not this is
actually<00:03:00.810> for<00:03:01.200> many<00:03:01.349> people<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:01.890> easier

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
actually for many people and easier

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.220 
actually for many people and easier
Virginie<00:03:03.299> but<00:03:03.510> even<00:03:03.780> though<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:03.959> have<00:03:04.079> to

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
Virginie but even though you have to

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.220 
Virginie but even though you have to
lift<00:03:04.379> some<00:03:05.250> weight<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.579> similar<00:03:05.909> to<00:03:06.230> having

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
lift some weight and similar to having

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.630 
lift some weight and similar to having
their<00:03:07.379> to<00:03:07.500> hold<00:03:07.680> on<00:03:07.799> to<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.099> weight<00:03:08.250> actually

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
their to hold on to the weight actually

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.720 
their to hold on to the weight actually
acts<00:03:09.060> as<00:03:09.329> a<00:03:09.989> counter<00:03:10.470> belt<00:03:10.650> so<00:03:11.459> when<00:03:11.549> you<00:03:11.609> have

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
acts as a counter belt so when you have

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:12.800 
acts as a counter belt so when you have
it<00:03:11.760> out<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.030> front<00:03:12.180> you're<00:03:12.359> less<00:03:12.480> likely<00:03:12.510> to

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
it out the front you're less likely to

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.960 
it out the front you're less likely to
fall<00:03:13.019> over<00:03:13.349> backwards<00:03:13.500> so<00:03:13.890> I've<00:03:14.010> got<00:03:14.159> a<00:03:14.189> 10

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
fall over backwards so I've got a 10

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:23.449 
fall over backwards so I've got a 10
kilo<00:03:15.120> dumbbell<00:03:15.540> here<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:22.069> adding<00:03:23.069> weight<00:03:23.190> is

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
kilo dumbbell here and adding weight is

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.089 
kilo dumbbell here and adding weight is
a<00:03:23.810> good<00:03:24.810> way<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:24.989> add<00:03:25.170> progression<00:03:25.799> to<00:03:25.980> the

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
a good way to add progression to the

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.800 
a good way to add progression to the
exercise<00:03:26.549> so<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:26.849> can<00:03:27.000> set<00:03:27.209> hardly<00:03:27.540> more<00:03:27.690> and

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
exercise so you can set hardly more and

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.690 
exercise so you can set hardly more and
more<00:03:27.900> weights<00:03:28.109> at<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.319> front<00:03:28.650> there<00:03:29.519> you<00:03:29.549> know

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
more weights at the front there you know

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.190 
more weights at the front there you know
does<00:03:29.879> act<00:03:30.090> as<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.239> counterbalance<00:03:30.599> so<00:03:31.019> the

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
does act as a counterbalance so the

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.020 
does act as a counterbalance so the
extra<00:03:31.500> weight<00:03:31.680> is<00:03:32.099> offset<00:03:32.489> somewhat<00:03:32.849> by<00:03:32.970> the

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
extra weight is offset somewhat by the

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.000 
extra weight is offset somewhat by the
fact<00:03:33.299> that<00:03:33.359> you're<00:03:33.659> losing<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.560> balance<00:03:34.739> but

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
fact that you're losing the balance but

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.789 
fact that you're losing the balance but
it's<00:03:35.129> a<00:03:35.190> good<00:03:35.340> way<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.459> strengthen<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.970> legs

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
it's a good way to strengthen the legs

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.069 
it's a good way to strengthen the legs
so<00:03:37.799> there's<00:03:38.310> a<00:03:38.430> couple<00:03:38.609> of<00:03:38.790> simple<00:03:39.079> versions

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
so there's a couple of simple versions

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.780 
so there's a couple of simple versions
of<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.260> pistol<00:03:40.560> squat<00:03:40.739> you<00:03:40.829> can<00:03:40.889> do<00:03:41.099> it's<00:03:41.760> a

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
of the pistol squat you can do it's a

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.119 
of the pistol squat you can do it's a
really<00:03:42.030> good<00:03:42.150> one<00:03:42.269> for<00:03:42.389> your<00:03:42.510> vertical<00:03:42.840> jump

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
really good one for your vertical jump

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.530 
really good one for your vertical jump
and<00:03:44.129> if<00:03:44.400> you've<00:03:44.549> seen<00:03:44.579> some<00:03:44.879> videos<00:03:44.940> of<00:03:45.329> could
