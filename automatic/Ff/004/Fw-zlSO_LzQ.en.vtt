00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.690 

hi<00:00:00.539> I'm<00:00:01.140> Steve<00:00:01.469> Jones<00:00:01.500> and<00:00:01.920> I'm<00:00:02.010> going<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.399> tell

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
hi I'm Steve Jones and I'm going to tell

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.840 
hi I'm Steve Jones and I'm going to tell
you<00:00:02.879> about<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.389> isotope<00:00:04.140> of<00:00:04.470> phosphorus<00:00:05.370> or

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
you about the isotope of phosphorus or

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.459 
you about the isotope of phosphorus or
should<00:00:06.089> I<00:00:06.210> say<00:00:06.420> actually<00:00:07.340> isotopes<00:00:08.340> of

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:09.469 
should I say actually isotopes of

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.140 
should I say actually isotopes of
phosphorus<00:00:10.469> because<00:00:11.040> there<00:00:11.340> isn't<00:00:11.460> one

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
phosphorus because there isn't one

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.539 
phosphorus because there isn't one
there<00:00:12.450> are<00:00:12.570> actually<00:00:13.080> three<00:00:13.740> now<00:00:14.490> the

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
there are actually three now the

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.060 
there are actually three now the
question<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.000> what<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.360> in<00:00:15.480> an<00:00:15.599> isotope<00:00:16.070> first

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
question is what is in an isotope first

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.560 
question is what is in an isotope first
of<00:00:17.250> all<00:00:17.510> within<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:19.140> nucleus<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.160> an<00:00:20.369> atom

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
of all within the nucleus of an atom

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.599 
of all within the nucleus of an atom
let's<00:00:21.570> say<00:00:21.779> that's<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.170> nucleus<00:00:22.560> we<00:00:23.310> draw<00:00:23.519> it

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
let's say that's the nucleus we draw it

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.250 
let's say that's the nucleus we draw it
as<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.789> billiard<00:00:24.150> ball<00:00:24.180> but<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.750> isn't<00:00:24.960> really

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
as a billiard ball but it isn't really

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.950 
as a billiard ball but it isn't really
like<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.470> within<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.670> there<00:00:27.240> are<00:00:27.390> 15

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
like that within that there are 15

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.730 
like that within that there are 15
protons<00:00:28.680> if<00:00:29.310> it's<00:00:29.880> phosphorus<00:00:30.840> there<00:00:31.199> are<00:00:31.349> 15

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
protons if it's phosphorus there are 15

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.030 
protons if it's phosphorus there are 15
protons<00:00:32.309> but<00:00:33.210> within<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:34.110> nucleus<00:00:34.710> there

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
protons but within that nucleus there

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.160 
protons but within that nucleus there
are<00:00:35.130> also<00:00:35.309> neutrons<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.550> stable

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
are also neutrons and in the stable

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.560 
are also neutrons and in the stable
isotope<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.190> stable

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
isotope this is stable

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.220 
isotope this is stable
it's<00:00:43.140> called<00:00:43.500> phosphorus<00:00:44.070> 31<00:00:44.930> there<00:00:45.930> are

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
it's called phosphorus 31 there are

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.590 
it's called phosphorus 31 there are
actually<00:00:47.160> 16<00:00:48.120> neutrons<00:00:49.250> around<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.640> there

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
actually 16 neutrons around this there

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.850 
actually 16 neutrons around this there
will<00:00:51.899> be<00:00:52.129> automatically<00:00:53.129> something<00:00:54.030> like<00:00:54.860> 15

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
will be automatically something like 15

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.020 
will be automatically something like 15
electrons<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.600> neutral<00:00:58.109> atom<00:00:59.030> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
electrons in a neutral atom the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.150 
electrons in a neutral atom the
difference<00:01:00.570> between<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.379> different

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
difference between the different

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.240 
difference between the different
isotopes<00:01:03.090> are<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:04.140> instead<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.010> there<00:01:05.220> being

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
isotopes are that instead of there being

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:13.399 
isotopes are that instead of there being
16<00:01:06.119> there<00:01:06.930> can<00:01:07.170> also<00:01:07.350> be<00:01:08.450> 17<00:01:09.450> or<00:01:10.280> 18<00:01:12.409> neutrons

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
16 there can also be 17 or 18 neutrons

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.390 
16 there can also be 17 or 18 neutrons
in<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.040> nucleus<00:01:14.659> which<00:01:15.659> mean<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.159> have

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
in the nucleus which mean that we have

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.910 
in the nucleus which mean that we have
three<00:01:18.210> types<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:19.100> phosphorus<00:01:20.100> phosphorus<00:01:20.909> 31

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
three types of phosphorus phosphorus 31

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.359 
three types of phosphorus phosphorus 31
phosphorus-32<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.490> phosphorus<00:01:24.330> 33

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
phosphorus-32 and phosphorus 33

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.600 
phosphorus-32 and phosphorus 33
phosphorus<00:01:26.369> 32<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.090> 33<00:01:27.600> are<00:01:28.140> not<00:01:28.650> stable

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
phosphorus 32 and 33 are not stable

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.460 
phosphorus 32 and 33 are not stable
they<00:01:30.360> are<00:01:31.020> radioactive<00:01:32.150> they<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.960> nucleus

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
they are radioactive they the nucleus

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.090 
they are radioactive they the nucleus
will<00:01:34.710> literally<00:01:35.130> split<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.990> spit<00:01:36.990> out<00:01:37.100> a

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
will literally split and spit out a

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.310 
will literally split and spit out a
particle<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.119> change<00:01:39.720> into<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> different

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
particle and change into a different

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.679 
particle and change into a different
chemical<00:01:40.950> substance<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.030> these<00:01:42.270> are<00:01:42.540> not

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
chemical substance so these are not

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.100 
chemical substance so these are not
stable<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.579> this<00:01:44.579> typically<00:01:45.149> has<00:01:46.079> a

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
stable and this typically has a

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.190 
stable and this typically has a
half-life<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:47.009> 14<00:01:47.520> days<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.450> 14<00:01:48.990> days

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
half-life of 14 days that is in 14 days

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.620 
half-life of 14 days that is in 14 days
in<00:01:49.439> two<00:01:49.619> weeks<00:01:49.890> half<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.030> will<00:01:51.270> have<00:01:51.390> turned

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
in two weeks half of it will have turned

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.109 
in two weeks half of it will have turned
into<00:01:51.869> something<00:01:52.350> else<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.909> after<00:01:53.909> another

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
into something else and after another

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.679 
into something else and after another
two<00:01:54.390> weeks<00:01:54.570> another<00:01:54.960> half<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.770> on

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
two weeks another half and so on

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.350 
two weeks another half and so on
phosphorous<00:01:57.689> 33<00:01:58.320> well<00:01:59.009> slightly<00:01:59.909> longer

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
phosphorous 33 well slightly longer

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.679 
phosphorous 33 well slightly longer
half-life<00:02:00.960> 24<00:02:01.770> days<00:02:02.040> but<00:02:02.640> still<00:02:02.939> quite<00:02:03.299> short

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
half-life 24 days but still quite short

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.880 
half-life 24 days but still quite short
so<00:02:04.350> these<00:02:04.590> are<00:02:04.799> aren't<00:02:05.189> stable<00:02:06.110> there<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.140> one

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
so these are aren't stable there is one

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.949 
so these are aren't stable there is one
stable<00:02:08.729> isotope<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.840> phosphorus<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:11.580> is

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
stable isotope of phosphorus and that is

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.520 
stable isotope of phosphorus and that is
phosphorus

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
phosphorus

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.160 
phosphorus
