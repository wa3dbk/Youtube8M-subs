00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
the first question on this tag is how

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.040 
the first question on this tag is how
would<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.270> describe<00:00:39.480> my<00:00:40.050> skin<00:00:40.440> well<00:00:42.050> there's

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
would I describe my skin well there's

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.190 
would I describe my skin well there's
nothing<00:00:43.379> really<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.770> describe<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.640> it's<00:00:44.850> a

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
nothing really to describe it it's a

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.850 
nothing really to describe it it's a
little<00:00:46.200> bit<00:00:46.289> dry<00:00:47.719> is<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> little<00:00:49.110> bit<00:00:49.230> oily<00:00:49.620> I

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
little bit dry is it a little bit oily I

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.520 
little bit dry is it a little bit oily I
think<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.399> little<00:00:50.460> bit<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:50.969> t-zone<00:00:51.750> oily

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.910 
think it's a little bit like t-zone oily
but<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.370> rest<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.850> kind<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.210> dry<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:57.920> it's

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
but the rest is kind of dry and it's

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.810

like<00:00:59.250> once<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.270> month<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:01.320> kind<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.980> gets<00:01:02.550> worse

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
like once a month it kind of gets worse

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.490 
like once a month it kind of gets worse
and<00:01:04.939> then<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:05.970> gets<00:01:06.150> better<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.659> then<00:01:06.840> again

and stuff but you can't really do

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.259 
and stuff but you can't really do
anything<00:02:13.360> about<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:13.690> so<00:02:14.610> no<00:02:15.610> need<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.150> be

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
anything about that so no need to be
