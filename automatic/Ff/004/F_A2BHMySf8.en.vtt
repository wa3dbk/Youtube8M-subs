00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.780
 today is a great day for 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.040
 george 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.930
 after these four weeks of training 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.910
 intensive he will have to show what he 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.250
 worth in front of the three ruthless jury 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.350
 in the program for georges dive into 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.350
 the pool from this 45 m building 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.780
 and well according to georges ensa beat 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.880
 not too stressed for what's waiting for you 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.900
 well a bit but it's okay because it's 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.700
 very long time I'm training to do 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.780
 this jump to take four weeks I'm 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.190
 really got in without stopping 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.660
 so here I think I have all the 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.130
 assets in hand to make this dive 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.460
 so here I think it's going well 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.260
 pass 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.940
 I am confident and looking ben listening 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.810
 really great for you i think the 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.460
 trust is really a key to 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.870
 success for this dive so 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.920
 as you said to all the assets in 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.150
 hand to succeed 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.590
 so I have more than good wish 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.670
 chance to tackle is to prepare for 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.670
