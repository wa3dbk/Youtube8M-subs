00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.320 
every time I come to one of these shows

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.029 
every time I come to one of these shows
it<00:00:08.559> seems<00:00:08.769> like<00:00:08.950> optic<00:00:09.370> is<00:00:09.549> always<00:00:10.059> innovating

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:11.039 
it seems like optic is always innovating

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:13.859 
it seems like optic is always innovating
I'm<00:00:12.039> Terry<00:00:12.280> Jackson<00:00:12.669> with<00:00:12.820> op<00:00:12.969> tech<00:00:13.150> USA<00:00:13.629> and

I'm Terry Jackson with op tech USA and

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:15.180 
I'm Terry Jackson with op tech USA and
just<00:00:14.049> want<00:00:14.230> to<00:00:14.289> introduce<00:00:14.440> a<00:00:14.740> couple<00:00:14.980> of<00:00:15.070> our

just want to introduce a couple of our

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.300 
just want to introduce a couple of our
new<00:00:15.309> products<00:00:15.700> this<00:00:15.820> year<00:00:16.710> one<00:00:17.710> of<00:00:17.830> them<00:00:17.920> is<00:00:18.070> a

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
new products this year one of them is a

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.490 
new products this year one of them is a
standard<00:00:19.029> item<00:00:19.630> that<00:00:19.779> most<00:00:19.960> people<00:00:20.259> still

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
standard item that most people still

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.890 
standard item that most people still
have<00:00:20.769> but<00:00:21.160> we've<00:00:21.369> improved<00:00:21.699> upon<00:00:22.029> the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
have but we've improved upon the

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.439 
have but we've improved upon the
standard<00:00:23.320> lens<00:00:23.529> mount<00:00:23.769> cap<00:00:24.009> to<00:00:24.849> wear<00:00:24.880> one<00:00:25.269> we

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:25.449 
standard lens mount cap to wear one we

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.240 
standard lens mount cap to wear one we
actually<00:00:25.869> have<00:00:26.289> incorporated<00:00:26.589> to<00:00:27.009> where<00:00:27.130> we

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
actually have incorporated to where we

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.480 
actually have incorporated to where we
build<00:00:27.400> a<00:00:27.580> double<00:00:27.910> lens<00:00:28.470> cap<00:00:29.470> to<00:00:30.189> wear<00:00:30.220> now<00:00:30.429> you

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
build a double lens cap to wear now you

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.100 
build a double lens cap to wear now you
can<00:00:30.789> tandemly<00:00:31.179> mount<00:00:31.449> two<00:00:31.660> of<00:00:31.749> your<00:00:31.839> lenses

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
can tandemly mount two of your lenses

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.569 
can tandemly mount two of your lenses
together<00:00:32.439> so<00:00:32.650> they<00:00:32.770> fit<00:00:32.920> better<00:00:32.950> in<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:33.399> bag

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
together so they fit better in the bag

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.270 
together so they fit better in the bag
so<00:00:34.180> you<00:00:34.270> handle<00:00:34.539> the<00:00:34.629> full<00:00:34.780> depth<00:00:35.020> as<00:00:35.260> well<00:00:36.100> as

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
so you handle the full depth as well as

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.240 
so you handle the full depth as well as
we've<00:00:36.489> now<00:00:36.640> added<00:00:36.670> a<00:00:37.090> ring<00:00:37.570> seal<00:00:37.870> on<00:00:38.079> it<00:00:38.250> so

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
we've now added a ring seal on it so

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.930 
we've now added a ring seal on it so
that<00:00:39.280> it<00:00:39.610> actually<00:00:39.789> seals<00:00:40.239> out<00:00:41.280> dust<00:00:42.280> but<00:00:42.850> it

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
that it actually seals out dust but it

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.569 
that it actually seals out dust but it
also<00:00:43.090> allows<00:00:43.690> friction<00:00:44.289> so<00:00:44.980> that<00:00:45.160> now<00:00:45.280> that

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
also allows friction so that now that

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.880 
also allows friction so that now that
when<00:00:45.730> I<00:00:45.760> put<00:00:46.090> the<00:00:46.210> cap<00:00:46.420> on<00:00:46.629> it's<00:00:47.320> less<00:00:47.530> likely

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
when I put the cap on it's less likely

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.099 
when I put the cap on it's less likely
to<00:00:48.010> turn<00:00:48.219> and<00:00:48.430> fall<00:00:48.609> off<00:00:48.820> of<00:00:48.850> to<00:00:49.480> actually<00:00:49.750> open

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109 
to turn and fall off of to actually open

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.119 
to turn and fall off of to actually open
up<00:00:50.320> your<00:00:50.469> lens<00:00:50.680> to<00:00:50.949> exposure<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:53.530> also<00:00:53.829> is<00:00:53.949> nice

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
up your lens to exposure it also is nice

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:55.650 
up your lens to exposure it also is nice
that<00:00:54.370> way<00:00:54.550> when<00:00:54.730> you<00:00:54.879> have<00:00:55.090> putting<00:00:55.510> two

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
that way when you have putting two

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.000 
that way when you have putting two
together<00:00:55.809> that<00:00:56.109> you<00:00:56.320> don't<00:00:56.469> worry<00:00:56.649> that<00:00:56.859> one's

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
together that you don't worry that one's

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.709 
together that you don't worry that one's
going<00:00:57.250> to<00:00:57.309> turn<00:00:57.489> loose<00:00:57.760> and<00:00:58.149> actually<00:00:58.539> allow

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
going to turn loose and actually allow

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.900 
going to turn loose and actually allow
it<00:00:58.870> to<00:00:58.899> fall<00:00:59.109> off<00:00:59.379> introducing<00:01:00.160> our<00:01:00.340> latest

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
it to fall off introducing our latest

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.970 
it to fall off introducing our latest
addition<00:01:01.359> to<00:01:01.390> our<00:01:01.570> range<00:01:01.960> sleeve<00:01:02.199> line<00:01:02.410> we've

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
addition to our range sleeve line we've

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.219 
addition to our range sleeve line we've
now<00:01:03.160> added<00:01:03.190> a<00:01:03.550> flash<00:01:03.760> version<00:01:04.059> so<00:01:04.839> that<00:01:05.140> you

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
now added a flash version so that you

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.920 
now added a flash version so that you
can<00:01:05.379> add<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:05.860> camera<00:01:06.460> mounted<00:01:06.549> flash<00:01:06.939> on<00:01:07.270> to<00:01:07.840> the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
can add a camera mounted flash on to the

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.320 
can add a camera mounted flash on to the
unit<00:01:08.259> as<00:01:08.380> well<00:01:08.890> as<00:01:09.280> it<00:01:09.400> still<00:01:09.610> handles<00:01:09.970> up<00:01:10.210> to

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
unit as well as it still handles up to

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.530 
unit as well as it still handles up to
the<00:01:10.450> 7<00:01:10.780> inch<00:01:10.900> diameter<00:01:11.439> of<00:01:12.000> lens<00:01:13.000> and<00:01:13.299> this<00:01:13.390> one

extends<00:01:13.990> out<00:01:14.110> to<00:01:14.290> 14<00:01:14.680> inches<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.970> that<00:01:16.240> you<00:01:16.420> can

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
extends out to 14 inches so that you can

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.850 
extends out to 14 inches so that you can
handle<00:01:16.750> most<00:01:17.049> lenses<00:01:17.290> that<00:01:17.530> you<00:01:17.680> would<00:01:17.770> ever

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
handle most lenses that you would ever

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.240 
handle most lenses that you would ever
