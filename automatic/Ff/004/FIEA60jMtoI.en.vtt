puts a bit of tension in the zip which
makes<00:03:14.169> it<00:03:14.260> a<00:03:14.319> lot<00:03:14.409> easier<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:14.919> unzip<00:03:15.099> and<00:03:15.579> also

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
makes it a lot easier to unzip and also

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.520 
makes it a lot easier to unzip and also
zip<00:03:16.060> up<00:03:16.239> as<00:03:16.389> well<00:03:18.090> we<00:03:19.090> open<00:03:19.359> up<00:03:19.419> the<00:03:19.569> suit<00:03:19.870> again

good quality zipper at the top here and

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:29.809 
good quality zipper at the top here and
also<00:03:27.280> Marv<00:03:27.849> is<00:03:27.970> is<00:03:28.150> little<00:03:29.139> ziplock<00:03:29.739> and

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
also Marv is is little ziplock and

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.300 
also Marv is is little ziplock and
mechanism<00:03:31.139> bit<00:03:32.139> rubberized<00:03:32.590> material<00:03:32.709> that

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
mechanism bit rubberized material that

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.830 
mechanism bit rubberized material that
just<00:03:33.489> sits<00:03:33.669> underneath<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.269> zip<00:03:34.479> when<00:03:34.750> it

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
just sits underneath the zip when it

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.809 
just sits underneath the zip when it
zipped<00:03:35.139> up<00:03:35.349> and<00:03:35.650> prevents<00:03:36.250> it<00:03:36.340> from<00:03:36.489> sliding

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
zipped up and prevents it from sliding

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.149 
zipped up and prevents it from sliding
down<00:03:37.090> when<00:03:37.389> you've<00:03:37.479> got<00:03:37.599> the<00:03:37.720> suit<00:03:37.930> on<00:03:38.169> really

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159

simple<00:03:39.430> bit<00:03:39.579> of<00:03:39.669> technology<00:03:40.180> but<00:03:40.299> very

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
simple bit of technology but very

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.360 
simple bit of technology but very
effective<00:03:41.079> because<00:03:41.650> obvious<00:03:41.979> you<00:03:42.040> don't<00:03:42.220> want

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
effective because obvious you don't want

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.280 
effective because obvious you don't want
that<00:03:42.459> zip<00:03:42.699> from<00:03:42.940> coming<00:03:43.389> undone<00:03:43.750> obviously

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
that zip from coming undone obviously

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.839 
that zip from coming undone obviously
allowing<00:03:44.560> all<00:03:44.680> that<00:03:44.829> water<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.220> get<00:03:45.430> inside

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
allowing all that water to get inside

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.039 
allowing all that water to get inside
making<00:03:46.449> your<00:03:46.659> bit<00:03:46.750> cold<00:03:48.090> we<00:03:49.090> open<00:03:49.299> it<00:03:49.389> up<00:03:49.419> I've

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
making your bit cold we open it up I've

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.539 
making your bit cold we open it up I've
got<00:03:50.169> that<00:03:50.260> baffle<00:03:50.620> on<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.799> inside<00:03:51.190> here<00:03:51.430> as

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
got that baffle on the inside here as

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:52.890 
got that baffle on the inside here as
well<00:03:51.729> which<00:03:51.940> again<00:03:52.150> just<00:03:52.389> prevents<00:03:52.720> any<00:03:52.840> of

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
well which again just prevents any of

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.520 
well which again just prevents any of
this<00:03:52.959> water<00:03:53.169> from<00:03:53.349> flushing<00:03:53.799> through<00:03:53.919> the<00:03:54.069> zip

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
this water from flushing through the zip

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.199 
this water from flushing through the zip
so<00:03:56.530> a<00:03:56.709> great<00:03:56.979> little<00:03:57.250> note<00:03:57.400> point<00:03:57.669> five<00:03:57.909> mil

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
so a great little note point five mil

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.240 
so a great little note point five mil
suit<00:03:58.569> just<00:03:59.379> to<00:03:59.439> give<00:03:59.560> you<00:03:59.650> that<00:03:59.680> extra<00:03:59.859> bit<00:04:00.129> of

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
thermal protection in the water and all

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:03.479 
thermal protection in the water and all
these<00:04:02.530> actually<00:04:02.949> little<00:04:03.129> bits<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:03.430> pieces

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
these actually little bits and pieces

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:04.770 
these actually little bits and pieces
we've<00:04:03.819> got<00:04:03.909> in<00:04:04.000> here<00:04:04.180> actually<00:04:04.479> nice<00:04:04.750> and
