 that's all you need let's 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.000
 to start 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.480
 do a few fashion and lockers first 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.480
 in the mug 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.960
 then we take the honey and we 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.440
 add 2 spoons tool to the 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.440
 mint leaves 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.860
 then we can do everything very well 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.510
 each other and make sure the coin 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.510
 leaves are made completely stiff 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.549
 so becomes a mask and then looks like 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.590
 then we cut the cucumber 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.060
 slices 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.060
 two discs are enough 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.719
 then it's time to take off the mask 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.979
 but before I do that 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.179
 I first put my hair in a tail 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.179
 so it doesn't get in the way 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.750
 it's time to put on the mask 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.590
 and that does with a spoon with which 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.590
 I also listen 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.360

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.770

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.560
 these lay on our eyes 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.149
 then let the mask sit for 15 minutes 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:09.899
 and I take it off with a washcloth 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:12.540
