 Hi, they like me because I keep joining 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:28.220
 issues but that is not going to happen today 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:30.460
 definitely do not know what happened 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.439
 step you take like the new girl 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.789

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.789

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.290

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:52.100
 okay 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:54.500
 they are your great friend although what is 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.510
 like having a thorn in your finger 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.840
 fat that every time he supports her this 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.840
 it hurt 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:08.690
 like a thorn 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.690
 stuck in the heart I have your love 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:17.450
 It is horrible and corny 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:21.049
 maybe I should talk to tomÃ¡s no 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.049
 unspeakable that happened to me 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.630
 you know now that I have a book of 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.430
 query as well as an oracle of 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.490
 wisdom 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.690
 phrasebook says I asked him 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.570
 answer wants to see 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.080
 to see I go and tell him to take that I want 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.080
 be his girlfriend 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.950
 I imagine that the greatest misfortune that a 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.950
 man can have is 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:02:00.940
 I'm not going to make an orange juice 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.740
 see if it takes away the bitterness we 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.770
 we see each the next time in the video 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.770
