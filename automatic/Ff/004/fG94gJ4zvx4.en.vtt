00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.950
 well let's go here on the way to the hotel 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:27.260
 puntocom pepinero and as you can see the tournament 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.310
 of expansion so far 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.510
 is entertaining because enough 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.489
 teams other than those that are already 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.489
 playing the expansion and there are those from there 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.910
 beyond the we can find the goal 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.390
 in another in another tournament that is not the 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.949
 our is pretty good 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.600
 in addition to play is played here also in 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.979
 the same study on a good chip in 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.670
 another separate study lend to the side 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:57.670
 course 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.930
 good as you see the possibilities of 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.339
 tomorrow before h 2 here the truth is that no 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.770
 I think it's going to be a 30 but I 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.390
 I would love it to be, but well I know 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.830
 that can make us 30 and us 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.330
 we can only do to them because the 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.530
 two we are very strong teams so 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.720
 we have to pass I do not know why good 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.179
 tell us what we are going to do now let's go 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.190
 on the way from the hotel to catch the 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:23.960
 peripherals if we can play now 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.280
 there in the study they have for the 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.200
 computers that do not play tournaments 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.539
 trophies we do not do anything the teams 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.770
 now it's pretty good because if we 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.810
 they leave some ordered to be able 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.049
 train him to warm up a bit for the 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.049
 day tomorrow 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.360
 good as is the rite of treatment 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.360
 now 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.260
 I think the truth is pretty good 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.760
 right now they are taking us to what 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.560
 he after having brought us know if 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.180
 they could have told us that it is there and 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.320
 they are carrying the truth very well 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.340
 Well, we closed this interview here 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.630
 where express express roll and the guys 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.619
