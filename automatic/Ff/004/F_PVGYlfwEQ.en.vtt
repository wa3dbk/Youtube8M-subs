normal basis and you turn off and turn

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.350 
normal basis and you turn off and turn
on<00:06:25.870> it's<00:06:26.380> pretty<00:06:26.590> quick<00:06:26.860> to<00:06:27.010> turn<00:06:27.130> on<00:06:27.370> probably

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
on it's pretty quick to turn on probably

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.900

at<00:06:28.420> three<00:06:28.660> seconds<00:06:29.170> to<00:06:29.890> say<00:06:30.070> they've<00:06:30.670> that

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:30.910 
at three seconds to say they've that

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:35.160 
at three seconds to say they've that
quick<00:06:31.920> so<00:06:32.920> this<00:06:33.070> part<00:06:33.310> takes<00:06:33.490> some<00:06:34.240> time<00:06:34.420> so

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:35.170 
quick so this part takes some time so

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:42.590 
quick so this part takes some time so
