 sheet 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:38.569
 somewhere a centimeter take and otnegnem 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.880
 now this line is visible to the centers 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:15.640
 this line we go to the center and here it turned out 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:24.350
 a thick layer of soap serapis chased 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:26.620
 it is necessary now this edge of fire in this 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.620
 line 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.960

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:08.450
 but now this edge is fire to the middle 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:10.820
 so here is that a bunch of bends but these 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:23.410
 bends will lead us to the desired shape 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:23.410
 airplane speed jet sparring 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:36.210
 this is a short run here 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.210
