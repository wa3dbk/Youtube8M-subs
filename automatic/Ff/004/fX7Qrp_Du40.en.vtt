00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
this for other plants I planned this

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.039 
this for other plants I planned this
tomato<00:00:10.920> about<00:00:11.340> I'm<00:00:11.940> about<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> week<00:00:12.570> ago<00:00:12.870> and

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
tomato about I'm about a week ago and

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.620 
tomato about I'm about a week ago and
you<00:00:13.500> can<00:00:13.679> see<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.219> essentially<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:15.420> is

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
you can see that essentially this is

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.320 
you can see that essentially this is
sitting<00:00:15.960> are<00:00:16.800> planted<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.369> my<00:00:17.520> garden<00:00:17.880> soil<00:00:18.119> so

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
sitting are planted in my garden soil so

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.810 
sitting are planted in my garden soil so
when<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.570> rains<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.830> rain<00:00:20.010> comes<00:00:20.340> hits<00:00:20.640> the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
when it rains the rain comes hits the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.480 
when it rains the rain comes hits the
garden<00:00:21.150> soil<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.840> splashes<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.949> soil<00:00:23.250> up

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
garden soil and it splashes the soil up

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.820 
garden soil and it splashes the soil up
onto<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> plant<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.480> can<00:00:24.660> see<00:00:24.930> along<00:00:25.650> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
onto the plant and you can see along the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.509 
onto the plant and you can see along the
whole<00:00:26.010> stem<00:00:26.369> here<00:00:27.140> soil<00:00:28.140> dried<00:00:28.949> along<00:00:29.310> there

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
whole stem here soil dried along there

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.849 
whole stem here soil dried along there
that's<00:00:29.820> how<00:00:30.119> disease<00:00:30.390> spores<00:00:30.869> get<00:00:31.470> from<00:00:31.710> your

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
that's how disease spores get from your

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.370 
that's how disease spores get from your
garden<00:00:32.130> soil<00:00:32.550> onto<00:00:33.510> your<00:00:33.630> tomato<00:00:33.930> plant<00:00:34.230> and

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
garden soil onto your tomato plant and

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.290 
garden soil onto your tomato plant and
if<00:00:34.530> you've<00:00:34.680> ever<00:00:34.800> had<00:00:34.920> leaf<00:00:35.280> spot<00:00:35.670> that's<00:00:36.149> how

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
if you've ever had leaf spot that's how

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.990 
if you've ever had leaf spot that's how
leaf<00:00:36.480> spot<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.960> spread<00:00:37.460> here's<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.550> leaf<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.790> I

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
leaf spot is spread here's a leaf that I

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.610 
leaf spot is spread here's a leaf that I
cut<00:00:39.270> off<00:00:39.590> from<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> bottom<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.280> see

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
cut off from the bottom and you can see

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.840 
cut off from the bottom and you can see
all<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.010> soil<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.460> has<00:00:44.610> splashed

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
all the soil that has splashed

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.090 
all the soil that has splashed
underneath<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.840> on<00:00:46.440> top<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.920> and

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
underneath of it and on top of it and

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.279 
underneath of it and on top of it and
this<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.340> one<00:00:47.700> way<00:00:47.940> creating<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.989> splash

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
this is one way creating the splash

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.410 
this is one way creating the splash
barrier<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.489> really<00:00:50.730> reduce

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
barrier that you can really reduce

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.410 
barrier that you can really reduce
disease<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:52.170> your<00:00:52.199> garden<00:00:52.789> so<00:00:53.789> all<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.120> do<00:00:54.300> is

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
disease in your garden so all you do is

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.910 
disease in your garden so all you do is
when<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.660> plant<00:00:54.899> your<00:00:55.020> tomato<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.559> usually

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
when you plant your tomato and I usually

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.680 
when you plant your tomato and I usually
do<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.190> almost<00:00:56.489> at<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.820> same<00:00:57.000> time<00:00:57.329> as<00:00:57.539> you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
do this almost at the same time as you

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.360 
do this almost at the same time as you
can<00:00:57.870> put<00:00:58.320> down<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.590> barrier<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.219> put

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
can put down the barrier you can put

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.520 
can put down the barrier you can put
down<00:00:59.520> newspaper<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.359> then<00:01:00.960> maybe<00:01:01.079> put<00:01:01.199> wood

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
down newspaper and then maybe put wood

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.080 
down newspaper and then maybe put wood
chips<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:01.920> top<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.520> yes<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.789> can<00:01:02.940> use

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
chips on top of that and yes you can use

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.060 
chips on top of that and yes you can use
wood<00:01:03.300> chips<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.719> top<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.140> your<00:01:04.229> soil<00:01:04.409> that

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
wood chips on top of your soil that

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.530 
wood chips on top of your soil that
creates<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.489> barrier<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.180> put<00:01:06.360> down<00:01:06.479> your

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
creates a barrier you can put down your

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.270 
creates a barrier you can put down your
green<00:01:06.990> grass<00:01:07.229> clippings<00:01:07.740> if<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.130> that

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
green grass clippings if you do that

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.030 
green grass clippings if you do that
only<00:01:08.970> put<00:01:09.150> down<00:01:09.180> about<00:01:09.540> an<00:01:09.720> inch<00:01:09.900> maybe<00:01:10.439> two<00:01:10.590> of

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
only put down about an inch maybe two of

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.010 
only put down about an inch maybe two of
the<00:01:11.549> green<00:01:11.760> grass<00:01:12.030> clippings<00:01:12.570> because<00:01:12.869> it's

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
the green grass clippings because it's

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.050 
the green grass clippings because it's
green<00:01:13.260> it's<00:01:13.530> gonna<00:01:13.710> heat<00:01:14.010> up<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.369> compost<00:01:14.820> and

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
green it's gonna heat up and compost and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.850 
green it's gonna heat up and compost and
that<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.720> damage<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.170> stem<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.470> your<00:01:16.590> plant

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
that can damage the stem of your plant

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.469 
that can damage the stem of your plant
and<00:01:16.920> also<00:01:17.310> can<00:01:17.490> smell<00:01:17.759> bad<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.119> by<00:01:18.330> putting

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
and also can smell bad so by putting

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.600 
and also can smell bad so by putting
again<00:01:18.689> an<00:01:18.840> inch<00:01:19.020> or<00:01:19.200> two<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.860> Sun<00:01:20.130> will<00:01:20.310> dry<00:01:20.549> it

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
again an inch or two the Sun will dry it

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.289 
again an inch or two the Sun will dry it
out<00:01:20.790> turn<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.570> yellow<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.229> then<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.299> have

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
out turn it yellow and then you can have

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.910 
out turn it yellow and then you can have
the<00:01:24.450> disease<00:01:24.720> barrier<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.259> add<00:01:25.380> more<00:01:25.590> grass

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
the disease barrier and add more grass

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.320 
the disease barrier and add more grass
so<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.159> always<00:01:26.369> add<00:01:26.640> an<00:01:26.880> inch<00:01:27.060> or<00:01:27.180> two<00:01:27.299> of

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
so you always add an inch or two of

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.060 
so you always add an inch or two of
green<00:01:27.689> grass<00:01:27.900> clippings<00:01:28.350> over<00:01:28.590> time<00:01:28.770> never

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
green grass clippings over time never

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.730 
green grass clippings over time never
pile<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.000> high<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:30.930> not<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.259> good<00:01:31.500> thing

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
pile it on high it's not a good thing

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.920 
pile it on high it's not a good thing
I'm<00:01:32.400> going<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.000> use<00:01:34.880> composted<00:01:35.880> well<00:01:36.119> I'm

going to use leaves and stuff for my
compost<00:01:40.200> pile<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.740> not<00:01:40.890> fully<00:01:41.159> composted

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
compost pile this is not fully composted

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.600 
compost pile this is not fully composted
but<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.780> will<00:01:42.930> create<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.320> splash<00:01:44.159> barrier

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
but this will create a splash barrier

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.490 
but this will create a splash barrier
too<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.090> all<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.630> do<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.049> spread<00:01:46.380> them

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
too and all you do is you spread them

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.760 
too and all you do is you spread them
about<00:01:47.040> an<00:01:47.220> inch<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.579> material<00:01:48.409> you<00:01:49.409> do<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.680> all

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
about an inch of material you do it all

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.340 
about an inch of material you do it all
the<00:01:49.860> way<00:01:49.950> around<00:01:50.100> at<00:01:50.490> least<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:51.060> foot<00:01:51.360> maybe<00:01:51.810> 16

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
the way around at least a foot maybe 16

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.109 
the way around at least a foot maybe 16
inches<00:01:52.590> around<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.920> tomato<00:01:53.220> but<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.700> do<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
inches around the tomato but I do the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.969 
inches around the tomato but I do the
whole<00:01:54.240> bed<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.570> what<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.020> does<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.530> it

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
whole bed and what this does is it

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.090 
whole bed and what this does is it
prevents<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:57.509> rain<00:01:57.780> or<00:01:58.110> when<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.590> water<00:01:58.799> it

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
prevents the rain or when you water it

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.649 
prevents the rain or when you water it
prevents<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.610> water<00:01:59.640> from<00:01:59.850> hitting<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.420> soil

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
prevents the water from hitting the soil

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.139 
prevents the water from hitting the soil
and<00:02:00.950> splashing<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.070> soil<00:02:02.340> up<00:02:02.579> onto<00:02:03.000> your

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
and splashing the soil up onto your

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.270 
and splashing the soil up onto your
tomato<00:02:03.600> plant<00:02:03.899> which<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.530> how<00:02:04.649> spores<00:02:05.040> get

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
tomato plant which is how spores get

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.719 
tomato plant which is how spores get
onto<00:02:05.490> there<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.360> can<00:02:06.540> see<00:02:06.780> here<00:02:07.580> this<00:02:08.580> was

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
onto there and you can see here this was

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.059 
onto there and you can see here this was
in<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.970> earth<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.330> hear<00:02:09.660> how<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.349> soil<00:02:10.800> just

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
in the earth to hear how the soil just

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.500 
in the earth to hear how the soil just
splashed<00:02:11.489> all<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.790> way<00:02:11.849> up<00:02:11.940> on<00:02:12.090> here<00:02:12.300> during

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
splashed all the way up on here during

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.110 
splashed all the way up on here during
the<00:02:12.660> hard<00:02:12.870> rain

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
the hard rain

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.640 
the hard rain
so<00:02:14.250> again<00:02:15.250> this<00:02:15.430> disease<00:02:15.849> barrier<00:02:16.650> prevents

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
so again this disease barrier prevents

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.410 
so again this disease barrier prevents
your<00:02:17.920> soil<00:02:18.190> from<00:02:18.370> splashing<00:02:18.940> up<00:02:19.060> onto<00:02:19.330> the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
your soil from splashing up onto the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.360 
your soil from splashing up onto the
plant<00:02:19.659> even<00:02:20.049> the<00:02:20.290> top<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.739> plant<00:02:20.950> has<00:02:21.159> it

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
plant even the top of the plant has it

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.399 
plant even the top of the plant has it
on<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:22.000> top<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.629> leaves<00:02:22.840> on<00:02:23.230> the

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
on the top of the leaves on the

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.899 
on the top of the leaves on the
underside<00:02:23.799> of<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.950> leaves<00:02:24.159> now<00:02:24.640> when<00:02:24.819> this

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
underside of the leaves now when this

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:29.070 
underside of the leaves now when this
gets<00:02:25.120> bigger<00:02:25.420> maybe<00:02:26.099> to<00:02:27.239> 16<00:02:28.239> to<00:02:28.390> 18<00:02:28.780> inches

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
gets bigger maybe to 16 to 18 inches

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.890 
gets bigger maybe to 16 to 18 inches
you're<00:02:29.680> gonna<00:02:29.829> cut<00:02:30.159> off<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.760> bottom<00:02:31.120> stems<00:02:31.540> I

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
you're gonna cut off the bottom stems I

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.770 
you're gonna cut off the bottom stems I
cut<00:02:32.709> one<00:02:32.829> off<00:02:33.010> already<00:02:33.310> to<00:02:33.549> show<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:33.819> and<00:02:34.329> you

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
cut one off already to show you and you

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.970 
cut one off already to show you and you
would<00:02:34.989> just<00:02:35.200> cut<00:02:35.440> this<00:02:35.799> one<00:02:36.010> off<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:38.739> can

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
would just cut this one off and you can

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.559 
would just cut this one off and you can
see<00:02:39.010> all<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.459> dirt<00:02:39.640> on<00:02:39.760> there<00:02:39.970> this<00:02:40.510> is

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
see all the dirt on there this is

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.899 
see all the dirt on there this is
another<00:02:41.049> method<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:41.769> create<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.519> disease

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
another method to create a disease

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.180 
another method to create a disease
barrier<00:02:43.329> as<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.900> tomato<00:02:44.200> grows<00:02:44.530> taller<00:02:44.920> you

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
barrier as the tomato grows taller you

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.979 
barrier as the tomato grows taller you
don't<00:02:45.310> want<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.489> do<00:02:45.609> it<00:02:45.730> too<00:02:45.879> fast<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.780> get<00:02:46.959> a

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
don't want to do it too fast you get a

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.369 
don't want to do it too fast you get a
cut<00:02:47.230> off<00:02:47.379> about<00:02:48.250> 10<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.970> 12<00:02:49.239> inches<00:02:49.569> of<00:02:49.629> the

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
cut off about 10 to 12 inches of the

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:51.990 
cut off about 10 to 12 inches of the
bottom<00:02:50.410> leaves<00:02:50.890> so<00:02:51.220> even<00:02:51.609> if<00:02:51.700> there<00:02:51.819> was

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
bottom leaves so even if there was

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.300 
bottom leaves so even if there was
splash<00:02:52.390> now<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.019> soil<00:02:53.319> can't<00:02:53.680> reach<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.129> leaf

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
splash now the soil can't reach the leaf

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.330 
splash now the soil can't reach the leaf
so<00:02:54.609> you<00:02:55.090> have<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.720> first<00:02:55.959> barrier<00:02:56.260> which<00:02:57.160> are

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
so you have the first barrier which are

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.490 
so you have the first barrier which are
these<00:02:57.609> leaves<00:02:57.909> or<00:02:58.299> grass<00:02:58.329> or<00:02:58.870> woodchips<00:02:59.349> or

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
these leaves or grass or woodchips or

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.649 
these leaves or grass or woodchips or
something<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.040> then<00:03:00.459> you<00:03:00.489> have<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:00.760> space<00:03:01.209> from

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
something and then you have a space from

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.630 
something and then you have a space from
the<00:03:01.959> bottom<00:03:02.290> of<00:03:02.440> your<00:03:02.470> plant<00:03:02.829> to<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.430> top

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
the bottom of your plant to the top

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.819 
the bottom of your plant to the top
leaves<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.269> this<00:03:04.959> will<00:03:05.140> help<00:03:05.319> prevent

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
leaves and this will help prevent

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.009 
leaves and this will help prevent
diseases<00:03:06.190> from<00:03:06.579> hitting<00:03:07.060> your<00:03:07.299> tomato<00:03:07.629> plants

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
diseases from hitting your tomato plants

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.720 
diseases from hitting your tomato plants
