 the day of the game on the server 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:18.540
 little things or something like that 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:21.960
 or even these are generally all from 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.450
 you need to throw off the ip server 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:30.060

 at the same time all of this was not played 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:17.230
