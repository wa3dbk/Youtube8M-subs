way<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.309> thinking<00:01:06.200> where<00:01:07.200> you're<00:01:07.380> looking

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
way of thinking where you're looking

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.280

less<00:01:08.400> at<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> types<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.390> food<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.869> eat<00:01:09.900> and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
less at the types of food you eat and

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.800 
less at the types of food you eat and
more<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.310> macro<00:01:11.850> nutrients<00:01:12.360> held<00:01:12.600> within

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
more at the macro nutrients held within

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.609 
more at the macro nutrients held within
the<00:01:13.260> idea<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.689> proteins<00:01:16.140> carbs<00:01:16.470> and

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
the idea is that the proteins carbs and

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.920 
the idea is that the proteins carbs and
fats<00:01:16.950> help<00:01:17.310> both<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.610> food<00:01:17.880> are<00:01:18.150> really<00:01:18.780> what

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
fats help both in food are really what

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.600 
fats help both in food are really what
you<00:01:19.110> need<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.500> worried<00:01:19.890> about<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.340> don't

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
you need to be worried about you don't

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.100 
you need to be worried about you don't
need<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.150> worried<00:01:21.509> about<00:01:21.570> things<00:01:21.930> like

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
need to be worried about things like

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.920 
need to be worried about things like
types<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.799> foods<00:01:23.130> whether<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.150> food<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.509> clean

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
types of foods whether a food is clean

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.020 
types of foods whether a food is clean
or<00:01:25.170> not<00:01:25.229> none<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.070> stuff<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.640> really

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
or not none of that stuff is really

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.880 
or not none of that stuff is really
going<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.540> affect<00:01:27.869> your<00:01:27.990> results<00:01:28.409> but<00:01:28.740> we're

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
going to affect your results but we're

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.940 
going to affect your results but we're
much<00:01:29.100> more<00:01:29.310> concerned<00:01:29.759> with<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.950> quantity

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
much more concerned with is the quantity

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.249 
much more concerned with is the quantity
of<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> macronutrients<00:01:32.670> we're<00:01:33.479> eating<00:01:33.750> that

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
of the macronutrients we're eating that

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.240 
of the macronutrients we're eating that
is<00:01:34.439> going<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.890> make<00:01:35.100> your<00:01:35.610> result<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:37.020> why<00:01:37.799> do

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
is going to make your result so why do

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.010 
is going to make your result so why do
people<00:01:38.579> like<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.970> use<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.329> picture<00:01:39.659> macros

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
people like to use in the picture macros

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.410 
people like to use in the picture macros
because<00:01:40.439> there<00:01:40.860> are<00:01:40.979> no<00:01:41.280> restricted<00:01:42.090> foods

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420
