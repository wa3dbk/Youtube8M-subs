00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
like that but it just gets awkward to

carry<00:01:08.040> them<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.310> same<00:01:08.549> bag<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.060> get<00:01:09.240> to

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
carry them in the same bag and get to

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.940 
carry them in the same bag and get to
that<00:01:09.810> project<00:01:09.990> back<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.470> forth<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.520> anyway<00:01:12.030> um

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
that project back and forth so anyway um

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.880 
that project back and forth so anyway um
let's<00:01:13.950> get<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.280> with<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.610> demonstration<00:01:15.890> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
let's get on with the demonstration the

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
you get a good bit um when I first

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.969 
you get a good bit um when I first
started<00:01:32.329> doing<00:01:33.329> jobs<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.409> stuff<00:01:34.590> like<00:01:34.740> that

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
started doing jobs and stuff like that

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.499 
started doing jobs and stuff like that
you<00:01:35.280> know<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.400> had<00:01:35.579> gotten<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.939> cheaper<00:01:36.299> router

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
you know I had gotten a cheaper router

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.469 
you know I had gotten a cheaper router
and<00:01:37.400> also<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.640> wasn't<00:01:39.180> really<00:01:39.270> paying

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
and also I wasn't really paying

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.440 
and also I wasn't really paying
attention<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> actual<00:01:40.409> bits<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.070> got

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
attention to the actual bits that I got

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.080 
attention to the actual bits that I got
well<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.840> makes<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.259> huge<00:01:43.710> difference<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.939> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
well it makes a huge difference on the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.990 
well it makes a huge difference on the
bits<00:01:45.329> obviously<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:45.990> would<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.380> knew<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.799> would

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
bits obviously it would I knew it would

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.380 
bits obviously it would I knew it would
but<00:01:48.290> you<00:01:49.290> know<00:01:49.380> they<00:01:49.530> would<00:01:49.680> do<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.920> job<00:01:50.390> but

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
but you know they would do the job but

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.700 
but you know they would do the job but
when<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.600> work<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.899> on<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.049> boat<00:01:52.290> there's<00:01:52.560> so

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
when you work it on a boat there's so

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.530 
when you work it on a boat there's so
many<00:01:52.799> things<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.729> really<00:01:54.030> need<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
many things that you really need the

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.270 
many things that you really need the
precise<00:01:56.420> cuts<00:01:57.420> with<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.170> make<00:01:59.040> sure<00:01:59.070> you

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
precise cuts with so make sure you

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.609 
precise cuts with so make sure you
purchase<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.909> good<00:02:00.180> bit<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.930> small<00:02:01.409> bit

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
purchase a good bit this is a small bit

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.429

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.780 
which is great you know anything you get
from<00:02:04.619> Home<00:02:04.740> Depot<00:02:04.770> things<00:02:05.280> like<00:02:05.430> that

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
from Home Depot things like that

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.240 
from Home Depot things like that
be<00:02:05.970> like<00:02:06.120> bigger<00:02:06.570> bits<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.290> they're<00:02:08.070> going<00:02:08.190> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
be like bigger bits and they're going to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.040 
be like bigger bits and they're going to
be<00:02:08.610> taller<00:02:08.880> there'll<00:02:09.180> be<00:02:09.210> a<00:02:09.270> bigger<00:02:09.509> gap<00:02:09.810> right

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
be taller there'll be a bigger gap right

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.470 
be taller there'll be a bigger gap right
here<00:02:10.110> which<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.619> huge<00:02:10.710> deal<00:02:11.700> especially<00:02:11.940> on

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
here which is a huge deal especially on

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.110 
here which is a huge deal especially on
this<00:02:12.690> boat<00:02:12.870> because<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.800> can't<00:02:14.040> cut<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.670> inside

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
this boat because I can't cut the inside

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.840 
this boat because I can't cut the inside
corners<00:02:15.930> with<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.590> bit<00:02:16.950> that<00:02:17.250> has<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.460> gap

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
corners with a bit that has a gap

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.780 
corners with a bit that has a gap
between<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.990> bearing<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:20.340> cutting<00:02:20.640> edge

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
between the bearing and the cutting edge

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.960 
between the bearing and the cutting edge
what<00:02:21.780> happens<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.500> edge<00:02:23.250> actually<00:02:23.760> kind

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
what happens is that edge actually kind

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.060 
what happens is that edge actually kind
of<00:02:24.030> curves<00:02:24.270> down<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.570> little<00:02:24.900> bit<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.860> leaves

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
of curves down a little bit so it leaves

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.610 
of curves down a little bit so it leaves
a<00:02:26.430> little<00:02:26.580> edge<00:02:26.910> where<00:02:27.270> this<00:02:27.420> can't<00:02:27.750> cut<00:02:28.050> so

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
a little edge where this can't cut so

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.700 
a little edge where this can't cut so
you<00:02:28.650> need<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.100> bit<00:02:29.430> or<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:30.930> really<00:02:31.200> good<00:02:31.440> bit

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
you need this bit or a really good bit

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.440 
you need this bit or a really good bit
with<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.950> very<00:02:32.280> small<00:02:32.670> gap<00:02:32.910> between<00:02:32.970> the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
with a very small gap between the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.750 
with a very small gap between the
bearing<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.050> blade<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.640> will

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
bearing and the blade so that it will

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.570 
bearing and the blade so that it will
give<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.030> good<00:02:36.210> flush<00:02:36.480> cut<00:02:36.750> also<00:02:37.710> make<00:02:38.459> sure

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
give you a good flush cut also make sure

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.890 
give you a good flush cut also make sure
you<00:02:38.670> get<00:02:38.820> one<00:02:39.000> with<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.300> bearing<00:02:39.690> if<00:02:39.810> you

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
you get one with the bearing if you

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.130 
you get one with the bearing if you
don't<00:02:40.080> get<00:02:40.170> one<00:02:40.350> with<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.590> bearing<00:02:41.060> then

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
don't get one with the bearing then

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.080 
don't get one with the bearing then
it'll<00:02:43.140> end<00:02:43.290> up<00:02:43.530> burning<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.370> edge<00:02:44.700> that

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
it'll end up burning the edge that

00:02:45.090 --> 00:03:02.060 
it'll end up burning the edge that
you're<00:02:45.209> cutting<00:02:45.450> around

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.610
