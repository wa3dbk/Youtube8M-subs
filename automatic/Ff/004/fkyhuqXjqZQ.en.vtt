00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.050 
of a tapered look or you know maybe cut
the<00:02:31.330> bangs<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:32.080> you<00:02:32.920> know<00:02:33.040> define<00:02:33.550> them<00:02:33.790> more

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
the bangs and you know define them more

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.839 
the bangs and you know define them more
but<00:02:34.420> this<00:02:35.080> is<00:02:35.230> what<00:02:35.380> I<00:02:35.410> did<00:02:35.739> I<00:02:35.769> actually<00:02:36.370> kind

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
but this is what I did I actually kind

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.160 
but this is what I did I actually kind
of<00:02:37.110> followed<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.890> lady<00:02:39.730> who<00:02:39.880> originally<00:02:40.299> did

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
of followed the lady who originally did

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.550 
of followed the lady who originally did
the<00:02:41.440> review<00:02:42.220> on<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:44.069> her<00:02:45.069> style<00:02:45.819> yo<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:46.560> I

the review on you to her style yo and I

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.190 
the review on you to her style yo and I
followed<00:02:48.190> actually<00:02:48.640> what<00:02:48.880> she<00:02:49.060> did<00:02:49.269> and<00:02:49.510> of

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
followed actually what she did and of

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.050 
followed actually what she did and of
course<00:02:50.500> she's<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:50.950> better<00:02:51.190> scholar<00:02:51.519> than<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.880> am

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
course she's a better scholar than I am

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.420 
course she's a better scholar than I am
but<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:52.299> is<00:02:52.420> what<00:02:52.569> I<00:02:52.599> achieved<00:02:53.019> this<00:02:53.920> unit

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
but this is what I achieved this unit

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.319 
but this is what I achieved this unit
has<00:02:54.579> absolutely<00:02:55.329> no<00:02:56.140> combs<00:02:57.209> absolutely<00:02:58.209> no

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
has absolutely no combs absolutely no

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.210 
has absolutely no combs absolutely no
combs<00:02:58.630> it<00:02:58.900> only<00:02:59.049> has<00:02:59.290> an<00:02:59.470> adjustable<00:03:00.010> strap

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
combs it only has an adjustable strap

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.930 
combs it only has an adjustable strap
and<00:03:00.610> it's<00:03:01.150> very<00:03:01.510> very<00:03:01.780> big<00:03:02.049> on<00:03:02.620> my<00:03:02.980> head<00:03:03.250> so<00:03:03.610> I

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
and it's very very big on my head so I

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.170 
and it's very very big on my head so I
have<00:03:04.599> a<00:03:04.630> small<00:03:04.810> hair<00:03:05.170> of<00:03:05.260> course<00:03:05.440> so<00:03:05.799> I<00:03:06.180> don't

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
have a small hair of course so I don't

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.390 
have a small hair of course so I don't
know<00:03:07.329> if<00:03:07.540> your<00:03:07.720> head<00:03:07.900> is<00:03:07.930> average<00:03:08.650> too<00:03:09.130> large

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
know if your head is average too large

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.550 
know if your head is average too large
it<00:03:09.760> might<00:03:09.849> be<00:03:10.000> fine<00:03:10.239> but<00:03:10.269> if<00:03:11.079> you<00:03:11.170> have<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.319> small

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
it might be fine but if you have a small

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.890 
it might be fine but if you have a small
head<00:03:11.829> is<00:03:12.040> it's<00:03:12.880> going<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.150> be<00:03:13.239> really<00:03:13.569> loose

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
head is it's going to be really loose

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.199 
head is it's going to be really loose
and<00:03:14.260> I<00:03:14.440> actually<00:03:14.620> have<00:03:14.980> my<00:03:15.160> straps<00:03:15.489> very<00:03:15.910> tight

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
and I actually have my straps very tight

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.150 
and I actually have my straps very tight
so<00:03:16.930> that<00:03:16.959> means<00:03:17.380> I'm<00:03:17.590> gonna<00:03:17.799> have<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:18.040> actually

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
so that means I'm gonna have to actually

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.979 
so that means I'm gonna have to actually
put<00:03:18.370> some<00:03:18.519> hair<00:03:18.760> pins<00:03:18.940> in<00:03:19.180> it<00:03:19.269> or<00:03:19.420> else<00:03:19.630> I<00:03:19.900> will

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
put some hair pins in it or else I will

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.220 
put some hair pins in it or else I will
probably<00:03:20.680> lose<00:03:20.950> this<00:03:21.310> unit<00:03:21.730> when<00:03:22.359> I'm<00:03:22.540> out<00:03:23.019> and

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
probably lose this unit when I'm out and

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.170 
probably lose this unit when I'm out and
about<00:03:23.290> but<00:03:24.220> it's<00:03:24.400> in<00:03:24.549> the<00:03:24.670> night<00:03:24.819> and<00:03:25.090> the

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
about but it's in the night and the

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.370 
about but it's in the night and the
color<00:03:25.359> night<00:03:25.569> and<00:03:25.720> I'm<00:03:25.810> Jay<00:03:26.019> and<00:03:26.139> I<00:03:26.200> know<00:03:26.260> you

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
catch a couple of hues of it and I'm

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.599 
catch a couple of hues of it and I'm

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
the front and I'm gonna go to the side

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.650 
the front and I'm gonna go to the side
here<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:54.340> I<00:03:54.549> didn't<00:03:54.880> call<00:03:55.060> them<00:03:55.180> completely

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
out I wanted to leave a little bit of

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.539 
out I wanted to leave a little bit of
texture<00:03:58.299> and<00:03:58.690> definition<00:03:59.349> but<00:03:59.920> I<00:03:59.980> did<00:04:00.280> it

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
texture and definition but I did it

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:06.170 
texture and definition but I did it
brush<00:04:00.730> out<00:04:00.880> a<00:04:00.940> lot<00:04:03.930> this<00:04:04.930> is<00:04:05.109> the<00:04:05.260> back<00:04:05.470> and

brush out a lot this is the back and

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.670 
brush out a lot this is the back and
this<00:04:07.180> is<00:04:07.359> a<00:04:07.389> synthetic<00:04:07.690> unit

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.849 

and<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:12.189> other<00:04:12.489> side<00:04:16.169> and<00:04:17.169> back<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.709> front

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
and the other side and back to the front

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.279 
and the other side and back to the front
now<00:04:18.489> you<00:04:18.549> really<00:04:18.880> don't<00:04:19.180> have<00:04:19.449> to<00:04:19.509> style<00:04:20.109> it

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
now you really don't have to style it

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:23.600 
now you really don't have to style it
this<00:04:20.410> way<00:04:20.650> if<00:04:20.949> you<00:04:20.979> prefer<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.180> more<00:04:22.560> spirally

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
this way if you prefer the more spirally

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.490 
this way if you prefer the more spirally
ringlet<00:04:24.610> curls<00:04:24.940> you're<00:04:25.600> welcome<00:04:25.960> to<00:04:26.110> do<00:04:26.289> that

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
ringlet curls you're welcome to do that

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.900 
ringlet curls you're welcome to do that
you<00:04:26.710> don't<00:04:26.830> even<00:04:27.070> have<00:04:27.220> to<00:04:27.370> brush<00:04:27.580> them<00:04:27.789> to

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
you don't even have to brush them to

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.420 
you don't even have to brush them to
this<00:04:28.090> extent<00:04:28.660> but<00:04:29.229> I<00:04:29.259> wanted<00:04:29.710> to<00:04:29.889> achieve<00:04:29.979> more

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
this extent but I wanted to achieve more

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.570 
this extent but I wanted to achieve more
of<00:04:30.580> an<00:04:30.729> afro<00:04:31.240> style<00:04:31.599> so<00:04:31.990> that's<00:04:32.259> why<00:04:32.530> I<00:04:32.860> chose

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
of an afro style so that's why I chose

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.800 
of an afro style so that's why I chose
to<00:04:34.090> brush<00:04:34.449> mine<00:04:34.750> out<00:04:35.139> this<00:04:36.009> much<00:04:36.360> but<00:04:37.360> this<00:04:37.599> is

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
to brush mine out this much but this is
