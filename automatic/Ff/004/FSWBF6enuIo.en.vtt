I believer you raise your attack to how

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.359 
I believer you raise your attack to how
much<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.689> opponent<00:01:28.140> was<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.710> his<00:01:29.040> one<00:01:29.220> was

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
much the opponent was so his one was

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.179 
much the opponent was so his one was
like<00:01:30.049> 2,600<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.380> believe<00:01:31.619> 20<00:01:33.170> 620<00:01:34.170> 620<00:01:34.619> 800

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
like 2,600 I believe 20 620 620 800

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.859 
like 2,600 I believe 20 620 620 800
can't<00:01:35.369> remember<00:01:35.610> how<00:01:35.729> much<00:01:35.939> hopefully<00:01:36.180> he<00:01:36.659> has

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
can't remember how much hopefully he has

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.890 
can't remember how much hopefully he has
but<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.799> was<00:01:38.070> just<00:01:38.100> getting<00:01:38.850> attack<00:01:39.420> points

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
but it was just getting attack points

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.330 
but it was just getting attack points
and<00:01:39.960> then<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.680> add<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:41.009> one<00:01:41.189> could

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
and then you have to add this one could

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.760 
and then you have to add this one could
over<00:01:41.670> hundreds<00:01:42.119> which<00:01:42.659> stops<00:01:43.110> his<00:01:43.380> monster

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
over hundreds which stops his monster

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.819 
over hundreds which stops his monster
being<00:01:43.950> destroyed<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.310> they<00:01:44.700> still<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.829> boat

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
being destroyed and they still the boat

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.620 
being destroyed and they still the boat
expelled<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.549> think<00:01:47.939> it's<00:01:48.060> like<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.299> raise<00:01:48.479> it

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
expelled I think it's like just raise it

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.090 
expelled I think it's like just raise it
to<00:01:48.720> 100<00:01:48.869> but<00:01:49.259> your<00:01:49.500> opponent<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.920> keep

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
to 100 but your opponent can keep

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.490 
to 100 but your opponent can keep
attacking<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.579> he<00:01:50.700> was<00:01:50.820> keep<00:01:50.970> doing<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:51.500> lie

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
attacking and he was keep doing this lie

attacking and he was keep doing this lie
and<00:01:53.000> which<00:01:54.000> was<00:01:54.119> pretty<00:01:54.299> interesting<00:01:54.780> like

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
and which was pretty interesting like

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.160 
and which was pretty interesting like
