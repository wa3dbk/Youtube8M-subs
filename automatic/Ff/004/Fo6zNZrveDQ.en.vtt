game<00:03:23.070> I<00:03:23.280> think<00:03:23.549> all<00:03:23.700> four<00:03:23.880> maps<00:03:24.150> are<00:03:24.390> beautiful

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
game I think all four maps are beautiful

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.000 
game I think all four maps are beautiful
and<00:03:25.380> wonderful<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.010> awesome<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:28.620> first<00:03:28.829> map

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
and wonderful and awesome the first map

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.580 
and wonderful and awesome the first map
pack<00:03:29.220> wasn't<00:03:29.970> bad<00:03:30.120> but<00:03:30.630> this<00:03:31.290> one's<00:03:31.470> even

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
pack wasn't bad but this one's even

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.920 
pack wasn't bad but this one's even
better<00:03:32.209> although<00:03:33.209> i<00:03:33.239> think<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.510> zombies

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
better although i think the zombies

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.170 
better although i think the zombies
ascension<00:03:34.170> zombies<00:03:34.860> are<00:03:35.010> preferred<00:03:35.310> over<00:03:35.610> the

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
ascension zombies are preferred over the

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.479
