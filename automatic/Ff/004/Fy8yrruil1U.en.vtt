balloon as you can see right here limber

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.130 
balloon as you can see right here limber
up<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.160> fingers<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:45.149> assuming<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.870> have<00:00:46.110> a

red<00:00:46.410> qualitex<00:00:47.039> pump<00:00:47.309> we're<00:00:47.700> putting<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.149> three

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
red qualitex pump we're putting in three

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.540 
red qualitex pump we're putting in three
puffs<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.989> air<00:00:49.170> we're<00:00:49.559> basically<00:00:49.739> filling<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
puffs of air we're basically filling the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.180 
puffs of air we're basically filling the
balloon<00:00:50.640> slightly<00:00:51.329> past<00:00:51.539> halfway<00:00:52.070> then<00:00:53.070> we

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
balloon slightly past halfway then we

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.010 
balloon slightly past halfway then we
let<00:00:53.370> out<00:00:53.550> just<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.910> little<00:00:53.940> bit<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.420> air<00:00:54.570> before

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
let out just a little bit of air before

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.740 
let out just a little bit of air before
we<00:00:55.350> tie<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.620> into<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.920> knot<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.390> then<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:57.539> just

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
we tie it into a knot and then we just

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.779 
we tie it into a knot and then we just
simply<00:00:58.079> tuck<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.469> knot<00:00:58.680> underneath<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.640> two

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
simply tuck the knot underneath the two

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.180 
simply tuck the knot underneath the two
fingers<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.840> then<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:01.890> pull<00:01:02.070> it

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
fingers like that and then we pull it

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.100 
fingers like that and then we pull it
out<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.000> forms<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.420> perfect<00:01:03.600> little<00:01:03.960> knot

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
out and it forms a perfect little knot

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.380 
out and it forms a perfect little knot
and<00:01:04.350> then<00:01:05.159> we<00:01:05.339> just<00:01:05.549> stretch<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.060> balloon

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
and then we just stretch out the balloon

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.179 
and then we just stretch out the balloon
makes<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.960> little<00:01:07.080> bit<00:01:07.170> more<00:01:07.290> limber<00:01:07.680> less

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
makes a little bit more limber less

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.820 
makes a little bit more limber less
likely<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.640> pop<00:01:08.909> now<00:01:09.689> we<00:01:10.020> twist<00:01:10.320> one<00:01:10.530> bubble

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
likely to pop now we twist one bubble

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.950 
likely to pop now we twist one bubble
and<00:01:11.159> all<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:11.790> have<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.060> do<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.299> hold<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.659> that

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
and all we have to do is hold on to that

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.780 
and all we have to do is hold on to that
very<00:01:13.170> first<00:01:13.290> bubble<00:01:13.860> with<00:01:14.040> our<00:01:14.189> fingers<00:01:14.580> that

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
very first bubble with our fingers that

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.090 
very first bubble with our fingers that
you<00:01:14.820> see<00:01:15.090> right<00:01:15.270> there<00:01:15.619> now<00:01:16.619> we're<00:01:16.799> gonna<00:01:16.890> make

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
you see right there now we're gonna make

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.160 
you see right there now we're gonna make
four<00:01:17.460> bubbles<00:01:17.670> we're<00:01:18.150> gonna<00:01:18.240> make<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> big<00:01:18.960> one

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
four bubbles we're gonna make a big one

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.070 
four bubbles we're gonna make a big one
a<00:01:19.350> small<00:01:20.040> one<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.460> small<00:01:21.240> one<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.869> big<00:01:21.900> one

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
a small one a small one and a big one

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.530 
a small one a small one and a big one
and<00:01:22.500> as<00:01:23.189> long<00:01:23.400> as<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.670> hold<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.270> first

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
and as long as you hold on to that first

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.359 
and as long as you hold on to that first
bubble<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.439> don't<00:01:25.619> have<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.920> worry<00:01:26.040> about<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
bubble you don't have to worry about the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.600 
bubble you don't have to worry about the
others<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:27.990> anyway<00:01:28.320> we<00:01:28.680> twist<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.100> around<00:01:29.189> and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
others so anyway we twist it around and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.390 
others so anyway we twist it around and
then<00:01:30.210> we<00:01:30.689> push<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.170> through<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:32.040> here<00:01:32.310> is

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
then we push it through this here is

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.620 
then we push it through this here is
called<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.759> lock<00:01:33.030> twist

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
called a lock twist

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.319 
called a lock twist
it<00:01:33.930> basically<00:01:34.049> holds<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.770> balloon<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.280> place

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
it basically holds the balloon in place

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.910 
it basically holds the balloon in place
to<00:01:36.329> where<00:01:36.479> it's<00:01:36.720> not<00:01:36.930> going<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.229> become<00:01:37.500> undone

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
to where it's not going to become undone

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.550 
to where it's not going to become undone
or<00:01:38.189> unraveled<00:01:38.790> then<00:01:39.689> we<00:01:39.810> just<00:01:40.020> simply<00:01:40.380> make

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
or unraveled then we just simply make

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.649 
or unraveled then we just simply make
another<00:01:40.860> set<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.460> five<00:01:41.640> bubbles<00:01:41.850> we<00:01:42.299> start<00:01:42.570> off

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
another set of five bubbles we start off

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.690 
another set of five bubbles we start off
with<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> neck<00:01:43.170> holding<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.490> very

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
with the neck holding on to the very

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.090 
with the neck holding on to the very
first<00:01:45.000> bubble<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:46.200> make<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> big<00:01:46.649> bubble<00:01:46.860> a

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
first bubble so we make a big bubble a

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.560 
first bubble so we make a big bubble a
small<00:01:47.520> bubble<00:01:48.680> another<00:01:49.680> small<00:01:50.009> bubble<00:01:50.369> and

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
small bubble another small bubble and

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.850 
small bubble another small bubble and
then<00:01:51.570> we<00:01:51.720> make<00:01:51.869> another<00:01:52.170> big<00:01:52.380> bubble<00:01:52.680> and

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
then we make another big bubble and

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.889 
then we make another big bubble and
again<00:01:53.490> all<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:54.060> have<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.299> do<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.540> hold<00:01:54.689> on<00:01:54.869> to

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
again all we have to do is hold on to

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.859 
again all we have to do is hold on to
the<00:01:55.110> very<00:01:55.350> first<00:01:55.590> bubble<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.219> we're<00:01:56.369> fine<00:01:56.869> we

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
the very first bubble and we're fine we

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.050 
the very first bubble and we're fine we
twist<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.290> around<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.829> then<00:01:59.219> we<00:01:59.640> do<00:01:59.790> another

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
twist it around and then we do another

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.719 
twist it around and then we do another
lock<00:02:00.329> twist<00:02:00.890> this<00:02:01.890> one<00:02:02.070> here's<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.369> little<00:02:02.640> bit

lock twist this one here's a little bit

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.280 
lock twist this one here's a little bit
tricky<00:02:03.829> now<00:02:04.829> every<00:02:05.430> once<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.820> while<00:02:06.290> what

tricky now every once in a while what

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.320 
tricky now every once in a while what
may<00:02:07.439> happen<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:08.190> let<00:02:08.640> me<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:08.910> go<00:02:09.030> ahead<00:02:09.060> and

may happen is let me just go ahead and
show<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.509> here<00:02:09.750> buddy<00:02:09.989> unraveling<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.649> if

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
show you here buddy unraveling that if

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.670 
show you here buddy unraveling that if
that<00:02:11.220> happens<00:02:11.670> all<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.330> have<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.629> do<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:13.470> just
