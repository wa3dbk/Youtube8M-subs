00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
start getting LOC carpeting in there I

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.500 
start getting LOC carpeting in there I
think<00:00:14.910> -<00:00:15.420> so<00:00:16.850> we're<00:00:17.850> gonna<00:00:17.940> be<00:00:18.029> driving<00:00:18.449> this

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
think - so we're gonna be driving this

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.080 
think - so we're gonna be driving this
big<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.930> couple<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.230> days

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
big in a couple of days

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.189 
big in a couple of days
stay<00:00:21.090> tuned<00:00:23.840> alright

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
stay tuned alright

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.150 
stay tuned alright
I've<00:00:25.380> tried<00:00:25.650> our<00:00:25.980> turn<00:00:26.609> signal<00:00:27.000> switch<00:00:27.210> a

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
I've tried our turn signal switch a

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.140 
I've tried our turn signal switch a
couple<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.250> different<00:00:29.519> ways<00:00:29.640> trying<00:00:30.029> to

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
couple of different ways trying to

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.510 
couple of different ways trying to
utilize<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.929> original<00:00:31.500> wiring<00:00:31.710> harness<00:00:32.250> but

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
utilize the original wiring harness but

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.510 
utilize the original wiring harness but
looks<00:00:33.420> like<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.719> way<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.930> go<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.710> not<00:00:35.340> do

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
looks like the way to go is to not do

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.930 
looks like the way to go is to not do
that

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
that

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.350 
that
so<00:00:36.540> we'll<00:00:36.870> just<00:00:37.140> simply<00:00:37.320> get<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.940> feed<00:00:38.940> off<00:00:39.180> of

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
so we'll just simply get a feed off of

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.569 
so we'll just simply get a feed off of
our<00:00:39.480> accessory<00:00:40.050> line<00:00:40.290> from<00:00:40.680> our<00:00:40.890> ignition

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
our accessory line from our ignition

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.279 
our accessory line from our ignition
switch<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:43.010> put<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.100> our<00:00:44.219> fuse<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> link<00:00:44.850> and

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
switch and put in our fuse a link and

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.900 
switch and put in our fuse a link and
then<00:00:46.289> we'll<00:00:46.469> hook<00:00:46.649> up<00:00:46.800> our<00:00:47.010> flasher<00:00:47.489> like<00:00:47.670> this

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
then we'll hook up our flasher like this

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.520 
then we'll hook up our flasher like this
here<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.450> tie<00:00:48.629> everything<00:00:48.840> up<00:00:49.050> nice<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.289> neat

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
that when we put a turn on that it

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.090 
that when we put a turn on that it
doesn't<00:01:50.750> contact<00:01:51.170> our<00:01:51.410> outside<00:01:51.860> edge

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
doesn't contact our outside edge

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.580 
doesn't contact our outside edge
otherwise<00:01:52.700> it'll<00:01:52.940> just<00:01:53.000> below<00:01:53.409> so<00:01:54.409> what

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
otherwise it'll just below so what

otherwise it'll just below so what
you'll<00:01:54.770> do<00:01:54.950> is<00:01:55.130> we'll<00:01:55.280> take<00:01:55.460> your<00:01:55.670> wire<00:01:55.940> and

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
you'll do is we'll take your wire and

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.240 
you'll do is we'll take your wire and
you'll<00:01:57.710> put<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.600> turn<00:01:59.600> alone<00:01:59.869> down<00:02:00.080> there<00:02:00.250> make

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
you'll put a turn alone down there make

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.070 
you'll put a turn alone down there make
sure<00:02:01.280> you<00:02:01.520> use<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.759> shrink<00:02:02.060> wrap<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:02.750> then

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
sure you use the shrink wrap and then

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.410 
sure you use the shrink wrap and then
just<00:02:03.320> bend<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.710> end<00:02:03.890> so<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:04.729> it'll<00:02:05.000> slide

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
just bend the end so that it'll slide

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:14.530 
just bend the end so that it'll slide
right<00:02:06.130> into<00:02:07.130> our<00:02:07.160> bottom<00:02:07.670> here<00:02:11.080> like<00:02:12.080> such<00:02:13.540> now

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
right into our bottom here like such now

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.610 
right into our bottom here like such now
they're<00:02:14.780> also<00:02:14.930> going<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:15.200> put<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.650> ground<00:02:17.620> on

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
they're also going to put a ground on

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.720 
they're also going to put a ground on
here<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:20.230> lot<00:02:21.230> of<00:02:21.320> times<00:02:21.500> guys<00:02:22.220> won't<00:02:22.459> do<00:02:22.580> that

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
here a lot of times guys won't do that

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.090 
here a lot of times guys won't do that
because<00:02:23.330> this<00:02:23.750> does<00:02:24.019> ground<00:02:24.380> out<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.860> -

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
because this does ground out to the -

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.740 
because this does ground out to the -
but<00:02:25.790> there's<00:02:25.910> a<00:02:25.940> lot<00:02:26.060> of<00:02:26.150> power<00:02:26.360> going<00:02:26.600> through

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
but there's a lot of power going through

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.840 
but there's a lot of power going through
here<00:02:27.140> so<00:02:27.320> it's<00:02:27.470> best<00:02:27.800> to<00:02:27.950> terminal<00:02:28.459> this<00:02:28.640> off

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
here so it's best to terminal this off

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.509 
here so it's best to terminal this off
and<00:02:29.290> go<00:02:30.290> with<00:02:30.410> a<00:02:30.470> ground<00:02:32.950> when<00:02:33.950> I<00:02:33.980> installed

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
and go with a ground when I installed

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.490 
and go with a ground when I installed
our<00:02:34.780> remote<00:02:35.780> reservoir

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
our remote reservoir

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.729 
our remote reservoir
I<00:02:36.670> brought<00:02:37.670> my<00:02:37.820> lungs<00:02:38.030> down<00:02:38.269> here<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:39.380> blocked

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
I brought my lungs down here and blocked

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.979 
I brought my lungs down here and blocked
my<00:02:40.010> holes<00:02:40.329> where<00:02:41.329> the<00:02:41.540> brake<00:02:41.750> light<00:02:41.959> switch

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
my holes where the brake light switch

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.180 
my holes where the brake light switch
goes<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:43.730> no<00:02:44.030> big<00:02:44.180> deal<00:02:44.390> just<00:02:44.660> go<00:02:45.500> ahead<00:02:45.860> and

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
goes so no big deal just go ahead and

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.180 
goes so no big deal just go ahead and
mount<00:02:46.850> it<00:02:47.000> on<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.239> upside<00:02:47.690> in<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.799> future

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
mount it on the upside in the future

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.039 
mount it on the upside in the future
however<00:02:49.430> probably<00:02:50.209> what<00:02:50.420> I'll<00:02:50.510> do<00:02:50.690> is<00:02:50.840> take

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
however probably what I'll do is take

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.160 
however probably what I'll do is take
this<00:02:51.200> 45-degree<00:02:52.100> angle<00:02:52.430> here<00:02:52.820> and<00:02:53.049> bring<00:02:54.049> it

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
this 45-degree angle here and bring it

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.050 
this 45-degree angle here and bring it
down<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.799> our<00:02:55.370> corner<00:02:55.959> from<00:02:56.959> here<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:58.060> bypass

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
down to our corner from here and bypass

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.160 
down to our corner from here and bypass
all<00:02:59.269> this<00:02:59.390> jazz<00:03:01.690> okay<00:03:02.690> so<00:03:02.750> we<00:03:02.900> have<00:03:03.019> three

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
all this jazz okay so we have three

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.610 
all this jazz okay so we have three
wires<00:03:03.850> for<00:03:04.850> a<00:03:04.910> brake<00:03:05.150> light<00:03:05.360> switch<00:03:05.620> your

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
wires for a brake light switch your

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.400 
wires for a brake light switch your
orange<00:03:07.070> is<00:03:07.220> your<00:03:07.370> power<00:03:07.810> your<00:03:08.810> blue<00:03:09.079> is<00:03:09.290> your

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
orange is your power your blue is your

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.160 
orange is your power your blue is your
third<00:03:09.650> brake<00:03:10.459> light<00:03:10.489> and<00:03:10.970> your<00:03:11.150> white<00:03:11.420> is<00:03:11.900> just

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
third brake light and your white is just

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.050 
third brake light and your white is just
regular<00:03:12.440> brake<00:03:12.829> lights<00:03:13.070> so<00:03:13.760> if<00:03:13.820> you're<00:03:13.940> going

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
regular brake lights so if you're going

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.120 
regular brake lights so if you're going
old-school<00:03:14.299> unius<00:03:14.930> lee<00:03:15.079> the<00:03:15.290> light<00:03:15.860> blue

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
old-school unius lee the light blue

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.430 
old-school unius lee the light blue
third<00:03:16.730> light<00:03:16.970> out<00:03:17.180> but<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:17.780> usually<00:03:17.930> generally

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
third light out but I usually generally

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.229 
third light out but I usually generally
leave<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.739> in<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.250> stick<00:03:19.670> an<00:03:19.790> extra<00:03:20.060> light<00:03:20.209> in

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
leave it in and stick an extra light in

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.220 
leave it in and stick an extra light in
the<00:03:20.360> back<00:03:20.510> just<00:03:20.720> for<00:03:20.870> kicks

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
the back just for kicks

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.650 
the back just for kicks
so<00:03:21.769> we'll<00:03:21.920> splice<00:03:22.220> our<00:03:22.549> light<00:03:23.180> blue<00:03:23.360> and<00:03:23.630> a

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
so we'll splice our light blue and a

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.759 
so we'll splice our light blue and a
white<00:03:23.810> wire<00:03:24.079> together<00:03:25.540> put<00:03:26.540> on<00:03:26.660> our<00:03:26.870> shrink

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
white wire together put on our shrink

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.000 
white wire together put on our shrink
wrap<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.700> then<00:03:28.880> our<00:03:29.030> terminal<00:03:29.480> end

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
wrap and then our terminal end

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.830 
wrap and then our terminal end
right<00:03:32.010> so<00:03:32.250> basically<00:03:32.700> our<00:03:33.060> wirings<00:03:33.480> all<00:03:33.570> done

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
right so basically our wirings all done

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.630 
right so basically our wirings all done
after<00:03:34.440> we<00:03:34.470> get<00:03:34.620> our<00:03:34.740> fun<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.190> we<00:03:35.340> pull<00:03:35.550> the

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
after we get our fun and we pull the

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.910 
after we get our fun and we pull the
truck<00:03:35.880> out<00:03:36.060> we<00:03:36.690> can<00:03:36.840> do<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.050> electrical<00:03:37.590> on

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
truck out we can do the electrical on

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.300 
truck out we can do the electrical on
the<00:03:38.070> front<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:39.000> on<00:03:39.210> the<00:03:39.270> rear<00:03:39.540> but<00:03:40.110> now<00:03:40.560> we're
