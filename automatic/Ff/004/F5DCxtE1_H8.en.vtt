00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:47.349 
to get that first goal I think you know

to get that first goal I think you know
for<00:06:47.439> him<00:06:47.589> to<00:06:47.680> open<00:06:47.770> the<00:06:47.919> account<00:06:48.069> is<00:06:48.460> a<00:06:48.490> big

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:48.759 
for him to open the account is a big

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:51.329 
for him to open the account is a big
thing<00:06:48.969> for<00:06:49.000> us<00:06:49.300> so<00:06:50.050> it<00:06:50.680> led<00:06:50.889> throughout<00:06:51.219> the

00:06:51.329 --> 00:06:51.339 
thing for us so it led throughout the

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:52.559 
thing for us so it led throughout the
night<00:06:51.490> I<00:06:51.520> thought<00:06:51.729> guys<00:06:51.879> were<00:06:52.029> very<00:06:52.089> creative

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:52.569 
night I thought guys were very creative

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:54.529 
night I thought guys were very creative
on<00:06:52.810> the<00:06:52.900> offensive<00:06:53.199> side<00:06:53.409> of<00:06:53.589> the<00:06:53.680> puck<00:06:53.949> and

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:54.539 
on the offensive side of the puck and

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.879 
on the offensive side of the puck and
we're<00:06:55.539> dangerous<00:06:55.990> on<00:06:56.139> the<00:06:56.229> rush<00:06:56.379> we've<00:06:56.710> got

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:56.889 
we're dangerous on the rush we've got

00:06:56.889 --> 00:06:58.740 
we're dangerous on the rush we've got
that<00:06:57.099> one<00:06:57.339> lines<00:06:57.550> pretty<00:06:57.789> pretty<00:06:58.180> creative<00:06:58.419> I

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750 
that one lines pretty pretty creative I

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.119 
that one lines pretty pretty creative I
was<00:06:58.960> going<00:06:59.110> to<00:06:59.199> say<00:06:59.319> we're<00:06:59.500> not<00:06:59.529> a<00:06:59.620> one<00:06:59.889> line

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:00.129 
was going to say we're not a one line

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:02.279 
was going to say we're not a one line
team<00:07:00.370> by<00:07:00.520> any<00:07:00.699> means<00:07:01.210> of<00:07:01.389> the<00:07:01.509> imagination<00:07:01.930> but

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:02.289 
team by any means of the imagination but

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:04.619 
team by any means of the imagination but
that<00:07:02.469> first<00:07:02.680> unit<00:07:03.250> is<00:07:03.430> very<00:07:03.849> very<00:07:04.120> talented

00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:04.629 
that first unit is very very talented

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:06.779 
that first unit is very very talented
they're<00:07:05.139> very<00:07:05.289> good<00:07:05.439> I<00:07:05.650> think<00:07:05.770> they<00:07:06.129> they're

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:06.789 
they're very good I think they they're

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:08.010 
they're very good I think they they're
very<00:07:06.819> good<00:07:07.150> in<00:07:07.210> the<00:07:07.270> sense<00:07:07.449> they<00:07:07.629> moved<00:07:07.839> to

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020 
very good in the sense they moved to

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.659 
very good in the sense they moved to
areas<00:07:08.199> it's<00:07:08.650> not<00:07:08.680> necessarily<00:07:09.189> direct<00:07:09.430> direct

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:09.669 
areas it's not necessarily direct direct

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:11.640 
areas it's not necessarily direct direct
passes<00:07:10.150> but<00:07:10.930> they're<00:07:11.080> reading<00:07:11.349> off<00:07:11.469> each

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:11.650 
passes but they're reading off each

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.320 
passes but they're reading off each
other<00:07:11.800> very<00:07:12.099> very<00:07:12.520> quickly<00:07:12.819> early<00:07:13.180> in<00:07:13.270> the

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.330 
other very very quickly early in the

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.119 
other very very quickly early in the
season<00:07:13.539> which<00:07:13.750> is<00:07:13.900> great<00:07:14.199> and<00:07:14.680> I<00:07:14.770> think<00:07:14.919> a<00:07:14.979> lot

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:15.129 
season which is great and I think a lot

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:16.559 
season which is great and I think a lot
of<00:07:15.159> our<00:07:15.310> offense<00:07:15.699> is<00:07:15.849> generated<00:07:16.360> from<00:07:16.419> the

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:16.569 
of our offense is generated from the

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:17.850 
of our offense is generated from the
skating<00:07:16.810> of<00:07:17.020> our<00:07:17.139> defenseman<00:07:17.589> are<00:07:17.680> they<00:07:17.800> able

skating of our defenseman are they able

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.949 
skating of our defenseman are they able
