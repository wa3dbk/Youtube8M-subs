only one downside to it and that is a

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.310 
only one downside to it and that is a
lot<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.270> buildings<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.810> can't<00:01:07.080> actually

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
lot of the buildings you can't actually

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
everywhere you go pretty much has a

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.399 
everywhere you go pretty much has a
building<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.340> it's<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:14.729> awesome<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.840> as

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
building and it's just awesome and as

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.620 
building and it's just awesome and as
you<00:01:16.530> see<00:01:16.770> here<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.549> just<00:01:17.880> keep<00:01:18.090> looking

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
you see here you can just keep looking

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.960 
you see here you can just keep looking
around<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:19.259> don't<00:01:19.740> know<00:01:19.860> if<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.159> whole<00:01:20.400> map<00:01:20.670> is

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
around I don't know if the whole map is

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.789 
around I don't know if the whole map is
this<00:01:21.330> or<00:01:21.540> not<00:01:21.689> but<00:01:21.869> I'm<00:01:21.960> pretty<00:01:22.259> sure<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.680> is

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
this or not but I'm pretty sure it is

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.649 
this or not but I'm pretty sure it is
there's<00:01:23.220> I'm<00:01:23.580> pretty<00:01:23.790> sure<00:01:23.970> there's<00:01:24.240> nowhere

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
there's I'm pretty sure there's nowhere

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.410 
there's I'm pretty sure there's nowhere
else<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.350> whole<00:01:25.500> entire<00:01:25.619> map<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.850> isn't

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
else in the whole entire map that isn't

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.499 
else in the whole entire map that isn't
just<00:01:27.689> builds<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.500> right<00:01:29.369> here<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> little

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
just builds and right here is a little

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.270 
just builds and right here is a little
park<00:01:30.960> or<00:01:31.140> something<00:01:31.350> actually<00:01:31.590> didn't<00:01:31.979> notice

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
park or something actually didn't notice

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.770 
park or something actually didn't notice
this<00:01:32.460> looking<00:01:32.820> around<00:01:33.119> let's<00:01:33.360> see<00:01:33.479> what<00:01:33.630> this

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
this looking around let's see what this

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.590 
this looking around let's see what this
is<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.829> actually<00:01:35.340> looks<00:01:35.670> like<00:01:35.790> oh<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.540> a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
is it actually looks like oh is this a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.350 
is it actually looks like oh is this a
it's<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.229> cemetery<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:38.070> guess<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.700> think<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.270> is

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
it's a cemetery I guess I think it is

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.910 
it's a cemetery I guess I think it is
because<00:01:39.780> there's<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.140> cross<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.829> these

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
because there's the cross and these

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.219 
because there's the cross and these
could<00:01:41.159> be<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.310> gravestones<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.689> pretty<00:01:43.020> cool

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
could be the gravestones so pretty cool

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.590 
could be the gravestones so pretty cool
guys<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.189> an<00:01:44.340> awesome<00:01:44.790> map<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.329> will
