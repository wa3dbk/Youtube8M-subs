00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.189
 hello everyone again denis did not have time 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.570
 I just lay out the assembly 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:18.470
 video review your locations with the old 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:24.810
 very assemblages as Alexander threw me 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:30.599
 I would like to have a newer version of it 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:33.989
 show everything moves very fast and 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:42.390
 works despite the fact that it is 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:45.200
 The original location is a lot of 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.200
 parts there 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:56.030
 so and so comfortable through the phone 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.030
 uncomfortable to watch 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.500
 as you can see the menu works 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:14.170
 a little long time but in principle 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:17.160
 it is not critical on the location of the light yet 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.160
 no, as I said 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.250
 Light, I put up a little later well 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:29.770
 somewhere literally 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:34.940
 next couple of days 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:38.050
 somewhere next weekend I think if 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:44.530
 Alexander will share with me 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:48.490
 this version of the project, then lay out a video with 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:54.440
 already fully lit location 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:58.700
 if Andrey will be original to us 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.479
 weapons then we will put weapons to that 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.000
 there is only a location 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:09.369
 move very fast 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.369
 along with the menu is completely quite 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.290
 so loaded of course long but 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.830
 the camera does not want to focus 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.730
 loading is coming 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.440
 here 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:56.069
 I don't even know how so that everything 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.069
 was seen 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.890
 why go, go 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.450
 I do not know visible or invisible then on 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:22.590
 computer checked but everything moves 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:32.519
 Alexander did not set the fps sensor but yes 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:36.750
 let me write a video calmly so 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:46.170
 let's continue to give their own children 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:50.010
 ok so write down my card but although 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.769
 not my map from the original but by me 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.640
 slightly corrected added a few 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:59.430
 shaders and Alexander 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.090
 Why did you use a card with 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.610
 full with full 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:09.989
 one stammer with a full set of parts 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.900
 you after all they even partially superfluous air 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.979
 swim it all will need to end up 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:20.100
 cut a little touch controller 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:24.050
 the controller is rather small on such 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:29.400
 device as a result for example 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:33.330
 a little inconvenient fps in general, in general, 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.970
 quite myself just great even x even 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:41.970
 I do not know what he did to us all 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:44.880
 pretty well everything runs but here 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:49.099
 a lot too much compared to my 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:52.340
 Location much excess there's this 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.340
 detail and 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:05:02.580
 I think if you remove them then everything will start 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:04.220
 wiggle is even faster 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:09.750
 25-30 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:19.200
 places and 40 steadily so things are going 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:24.570
 ok no controller jump button 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:27.360
 for now it's all now and reach from to 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:30.170
 the place in which there were no terrible lags 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.170
 and see 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:38.540
 here the feeling that there seemed to be 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:42.630
 it slows down just walking speed 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:44.510
 probably would need a mouse is increased to 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:49.020
 here is this place 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:52.620
 together I have ghouls a sucker what horrible 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:56.520
 lag is not everything is fine everything is great 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:06:01.200
 just despite being present 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:05.150
 absolutely unnecessary details go see 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:09.330
 in the sky there is something there is not visible yes 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:13.500
 some unnecessary things are small 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:16.470
 objects that are lying there physics 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:21.380
 These items for example hangs sparingly 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:27.690
 the air is absolutely unnecessary interfering 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:31.020
 disturbing decisive disturbing so not 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:35.160
 removes extra physics 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:38.130
 I thought only adds you can not 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.190
 go through the act of stone in a year this 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.490
 a rock 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.390
 a brick is more true on superfluous physics such 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.110
 gives the load 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:07:00.000
 I think in the near future it's all tidy up 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:07:00.000
 and the location will fly here such a pattern 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:07.260
 can't dad 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.260
 Wait 

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:14.370
 but the children themselves will twist there 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:27.930
 the menu as you told works here bye 

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:30.630
 that nothing worked to achieve 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:33.410
 No, because I decided to make a cartoon 

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.410
 development 

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:48.939
 may need and do more for 

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:48.939
 my for example huge fingers 

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:55.700
 somehow complicated as he over this shock 

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:58.700
 We also think around the house to everyone thanks to everyone 

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.700
 good luck 

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:09.250
 shallow walk bye
