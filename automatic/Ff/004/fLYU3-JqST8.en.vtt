faster<00:01:58.520> than<00:01:58.640> I<00:01:58.729> did<00:01:58.940> because<00:01:59.030> I<00:01:59.240> was<00:01:59.270> slow

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
faster than I did because I was slow

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.510 
faster than I did because I was slow
anyway<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:00.320> main<00:02:00.470> thing<00:02:00.500> is<00:02:00.710> he<00:02:01.039> has<00:02:01.250> that

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
anyway the main thing is he has that

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.080 
anyway the main thing is he has that
some<00:02:02.380> secondary<00:02:03.380> that<00:02:04.009> that's<00:02:04.340> basically

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
some secondary that that's basically

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.910 
some secondary that that's basically
that<00:02:05.300> his<00:02:05.479> traits<00:02:05.899> rather<00:02:06.170> than<00:02:06.319> his<00:02:06.470> ability

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
that his traits rather than his ability

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.699 
that his traits rather than his ability
which<00:02:07.700> is<00:02:07.909> pretty<00:02:08.360> damn<00:02:08.750> awesome<00:02:08.989> basically

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
which is pretty damn awesome basically

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.820 
which is pretty damn awesome basically
it<00:02:09.800> increases<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.459> success<00:02:10.850> chance<00:02:11.180> on<00:02:11.450> all

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
it increases the success chance on all

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.229 
it increases the success chance on all
missions<00:02:12.830> that<00:02:13.069> he's<00:02:13.280> on<00:02:13.459> so<00:02:13.850> it's<00:02:14.090> not

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
get him a pretty damn low level two they

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.840

go<00:03:19.910> beat<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.870> quest<00:03:21.280> there<00:03:22.280> you<00:03:22.340> go<00:03:22.459> I<00:03:22.609> think

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
go beat the quest there you go I think

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.550 
go beat the quest there you go I think
it's<00:03:22.970> a<00:03:23.060> seventeen<00:03:23.570> percent<00:03:23.720> increase<00:03:24.260> by<00:03:24.500> the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
it's a seventeen percent increase by the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.740 
it's a seventeen percent increase by the
way<00:03:24.739> so<00:03:25.400> it's<00:03:25.519> not<00:03:25.579> quite<00:03:25.760> as<00:03:26.030> amazing<00:03:26.329> as

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
way so it's not quite as amazing as

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.870 
way so it's not quite as amazing as
something<00:03:27.260> that's<00:03:27.380> more<00:03:27.590> specific<00:03:28.160> like<00:03:28.340> the
