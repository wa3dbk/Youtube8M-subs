build some more bindis and go for
another<00:01:13.080> bombing<00:01:13.470> run<00:01:13.650> because<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.610> what

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
another bombing run because that is what

the<00:01:17.369> power<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.640> resources<00:01:18.119> he's<00:01:18.299> built<00:01:18.540> this

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
the power of resources he's built this

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.260 
the power of resources he's built this
up<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.200> matter<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.470> no<00:01:19.710> time<00:01:19.970> he's<00:01:20.970> built

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
up in a matter of no time he's built

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.370 
up in a matter of no time he's built
this<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:21.570> right<00:01:21.869> up<00:01:22.430> so<00:01:23.430> um<00:01:24.119> he's<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:25.020> means

he's going to go for another push on on
this<00:01:31.439> here<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.979> mean<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.090> like<00:01:33.119> a

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
this here I mean this is like a

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.319 
this here I mean this is like a
impenetrable<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.860> mean<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.700> Teslas<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.240> to

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
impenetrable I mean to Teslas and to

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.569 
impenetrable I mean to Teslas and to
flax<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.840> then<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> bunch<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.470> again<00:01:38.460> I'm

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
flax and then a bunch of again I'm

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.940 
flax and then a bunch of again I'm
guessing<00:01:38.970> he's<00:01:39.119> building<00:01:39.479> subs<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.170> that's

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
guessing he's building subs and that's

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.770 
guessing he's building subs and that's
what<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.189> thought<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:42.210> dreadknots<00:01:42.600> gonna

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780

nice move by mighty see this is what can
make<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.659> whole<00:02:54.810> difference<00:02:55.459> he's<00:02:56.459> moving

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
make the whole difference he's moving

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.460 
make the whole difference he's moving
his<00:02:56.909> forces<00:02:57.359> up<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.900> this<00:02:58.799> Lex<00:02:59.129> has<00:02:59.310> seen<00:02:59.549> this

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
his forces up and this Lex has seen this

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.440 
his forces up and this Lex has seen this
and<00:03:01.470> he's<00:03:01.620> bombing<00:03:01.919> the<00:03:02.609> apocalypse<00:03:03.120> which<00:03:03.299> is

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
and he's bombing the apocalypse which is

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.179 
and he's bombing the apocalypse which is
really<00:03:03.750> good<00:03:03.930> play<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.470> he<00:03:04.560> hasn't<00:03:04.769> lost<00:03:04.919> any

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
really good play and he hasn't lost any

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.390 
really good play and he hasn't lost any
indicators<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:06.659> now<00:03:06.989> this<00:03:07.889> is<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.069> slight

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
indicators so now this is a slight

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.659 
indicators so now this is a slight
disadvantage<00:03:08.669> for<00:03:10.189> selects<00:03:11.189> his<00:03:11.280> units<00:03:11.579> are

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:11.669 
disadvantage for selects his units are

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.339 
disadvantage for selects his units are
more<00:03:11.790> mobile<00:03:11.970> but<00:03:12.450> it's<00:03:12.629> pain<00:03:12.989> in<00:03:13.109> the<00:03:13.169> ass<00:03:13.319> for

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
more mobile but it's pain in the ass for

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.710 
more mobile but it's pain in the ass for
him<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.709> move<00:03:13.859> back<00:03:14.189> and<00:03:14.519> front<00:03:14.909> back<00:03:15.419> and
