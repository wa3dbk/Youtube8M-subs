address<00:01:54.970> of<00:01:55.360> Joe<00:01:55.960> Bloggs<00:01:56.260> now<00:01:57.250> it<00:01:57.369> won't<00:01:57.490> be

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
address of Joe Bloggs now it won't be

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.250 
address of Joe Bloggs now it won't be
Joe<00:01:58.060> blocks<00:01:58.360> because<00:01:58.659> it's<00:01:58.810> probably<00:01:58.930> a

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
Joe blocks because it's probably a

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.820 
Joe blocks because it's probably a
number<00:02:00.100> of<00:02:00.280> Joe<00:02:00.460> blocks<00:02:00.729> that<00:02:00.909> use<00:02:01.150> AOL<00:02:01.840> you

number of Joe blocks that use AOL you

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.350 
number of Joe blocks that use AOL you
will<00:02:02.950> probably<00:02:03.130> get<00:02:03.369> Joe<00:02:03.640> blocks<00:02:03.939> and<00:02:04.180> a

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
will probably get Joe blocks and a

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.140 
will probably get Joe blocks and a
number<00:02:04.950> for<00:02:05.950> this<00:02:06.070> demonstration<00:02:06.280> we've<00:02:06.909> used

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
number for this demonstration we've used

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.050 
number for this demonstration we've used
Joe<00:02:07.479> Bloggs<00:02:07.689> 1<00:02:08.049> so<00:02:08.920> your<00:02:09.099> email<00:02:09.459> address<00:02:09.879> will

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
Joe Bloggs 1 so your email address will

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.360 
Joe Bloggs 1 so your email address will
be<00:02:10.090> Joe<00:02:10.420> blocks<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:11.019> then<00:02:11.860> we<00:02:12.040> have<00:02:12.220> this

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
be Joe blocks and then we have this

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.750 
be Joe blocks and then we have this
