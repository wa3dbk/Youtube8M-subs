00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.740
 today we have on fitting datsun on-do 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.199
 a real two-faced anus on one side 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.960
 the first car of the revived Japanese 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.240
 brands are another we all know lada 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.090
 granta for me personally is the name of this 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.489
 car sounds unusual for 30 years what 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.920
 not used by them datsun I managed it 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.140
 forget partially yes and he words to that in 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.860
 translated from Japanese means a way or 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.770
 motion 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.070
 Wonder sounds to our power ear 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.530
 body structure like a frets roof grants 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.780
 the doors are like grants 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.070
 but in general over the look of designers 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.300
 worked hard 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.859
 datsun have a more prominent hood own 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.379
 hexagonal grille and 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.570
 a completely different cut of headlights rear racks 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.880
 without triangular grants windows 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.640
 markedly increased in size taillights 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.909
 in general, I will not say that I ranked datsun 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.860
 on-do to breaststroke high art but 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.080
 Japanese engineers did the main thing they 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.229
 successful disguised overweight karma 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.450
 because ando length and grants by almost 8 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.939
 centimeters and all this increase came 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.220
 on the loin section open the trunk 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.439
 Grant uncomfortable to either press 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.030
 the cabin button or turn the key in 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.030
 lock or press a button on the key 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.960
 my nose is impressive to me 530 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.299
 liters to the rear seat backs more 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.680
 meters with my not the most modest growth I 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.450
 barely reach underground 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.689
 full reserve but upholstery 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.420
 flimsy and on the trunk lid is not 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.549
 Generally for that there is one plastic handle 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.250
 thanks and on this back seat 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.399
 decomposed extremely uncomfortable at first 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.130
 need to delay the pillow then omit 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.229
 back and find that the head restraints 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.550
 prevents backs from decomposing to the end of them 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.550
 need to remove and attach somewhere 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:18.450
 And still not a widower to me closely 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.829
 if i fall down myself over that place 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.599
 for feet there is a minimum of joy 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.519
 Life in the rear seats 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.459
 and found only pockets behind 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:32.400
 the backs of the front seats are not armrest 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.579
 illumination no pockets in the doors here 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.750
 No diet in the cabin before he 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:39.000
 the owner of the lada granta feel 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.609
 yourself at home even with your eyes closed all 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.829
 buttons levers switches on their 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.220
 places nothing has changed about those 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.349
 same 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.780
 and finishing materials everywhere hard 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:54.209
 plastic on the front panel 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:56.819
 trim console soft door panels 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.549
 details of the interior for the sake of stock seat on 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.379
 wheel by the way the chair is quite comfortable 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.540
 they do not fail in the names that 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.150
 you sit down a good profile back 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.530
 feel lumbar support and even 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.720
 there are hints on the side 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.879
 but it is convenient to sit down anyway 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.819
 it turns out I want to lower the seat 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:18.000
 lower but it is firmly fixed and the steering wheel 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.260
 height adjustable and comfortable 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.199
 sitting on the pedals 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.599
 he comes back effort on the arms 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:25.909
 air conditioning very pleasant 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.139
 but 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:33.030
 fan at maximum speed 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:33.720
 works quite noisy instrument reads 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.720
 not bad 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.870
 they have a little different finish and color 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.510
 changed greenish to white looks 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:56.060
 it is better 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:59.540
 Our car has engine 1 and 6 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.849
 87 horsepower his character 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.950
 I like I will not say that he especially 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.230
 emotional but pulls almost with 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.450
 idle and sour until 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.170
 cut-off acceleration to 100 kilometers per hour 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.569
 takes a little more than 12 seconds and such 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.430
 speakers quite enough and fussy 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.400
 city â€‹â€‹traffic and when overtaking on 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.310
 highway and at the same time the motor is quite 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.560
 economical to keep up with fuel consumption not 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.960
 1 7 liters per 100 kilometers is quite 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.669
 really but most of all in dota is not me 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.370
 I liked the work of the suspension 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.949
 Well, not yet logan of course but with the same 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.860
 omnivorous as grants and datsun rides 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:39.199
 a little nobler 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.240
 Japanese engineers have chosen a little more 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.090
 stiffer springs and a little softer 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.600
 shock absorbers and as a result on unevenness 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.330
 move 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.520
 slightly smoother roads are not comfortable 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.400
 small things are less broadcast in the salon and 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.960
 what is the most interesting 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.470
 the character before the action did not become 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:00.289
 soft-bodied car following well 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.880
 driving and standing in corners surely 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.520
 electric power steering Japanese 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.960
 reconfigured strange if u grants 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.930
 he was too sluggish and lightweight then 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.300
 datsun but on the contrary too artificially 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.030
 go ahead when away from the gearbox and 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.669
 the Japanese reconfigured became shorter moves and 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.410
 in the longitudinal and transverse direction but 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.349
 I can not say that the box from this 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.900
 it became better to switch when choosing 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:28.210
 speed the lever rests a little and this 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.889
 unpleasant it is especially noticeable when 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.919
 reverse gear 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.569
 and yet the box is familiar howls this ailment 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:38.620
 proved unable to win and 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:41.349
 japanese engineers datsun on-do by 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.190
 many parameters a bit better than 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:44.770
 lada granta 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.470
 I would even call it peculiar 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.870
 Japanese work on Russian thieves 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:53.139
 errors if it makes sense to pay extra for 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.419
 datsun on-do the order of 40 thousand rubles 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:58.210
 compared to frets grants with skin 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:01.539
 picking if I were the owner 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:04.120
 Taxi nova park is not sure but 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:07.259
 if choosing a car for themselves what 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.259
 would prefer datsun
