analyze the piece you may analyze a
piece<00:00:53.760> by<00:00:54.090> observing<00:00:54.750> any<00:00:55.199> repeating

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
piece by observing any repeating

couple examples take a look at this this
piece<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.130> standard<00:01:10.040> intermediate<00:01:11.040> rabbit

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
piece is a standard intermediate rabbit

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.300 
piece is a standard intermediate rabbit
or<00:01:11.580> Erebus<00:01:12.500> now<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.560> notice<00:01:14.070> how<00:01:14.280> I

or Erebus now you notice how I
highlighted<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.390> couple<00:01:15.420> segments<00:01:16.259> here

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
highlighted a couple segments here

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.100 
highlighted a couple segments here
notice<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.909> ABC<00:01:18.869> VA<00:01:19.850> ABCDE<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.960> is

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
notice this is ABC VA ABCDE and this is

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.780 
notice this is ABC VA ABCDE and this is
exactly<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.770> same<00:01:22.920> thing<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:23.759> I

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
exactly the same thing this is what I

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.020 
exactly the same thing this is what I
call<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.390> section<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.369> once<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.520> practice<00:01:26.790> a

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
call the section a once you practice a

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.090 
call the section a once you practice a
section<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.720> also<00:01:27.750> count<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> section

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
section you also count with a section

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.300 
section you also count with a section
and<00:01:29.909> then<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.299> also<00:01:30.540> have<00:01:31.049> highlighted<00:01:31.530> section

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
and then I also have highlighted section

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.850 
and then I also have highlighted section
B<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> different<00:01:33.630> section<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.680> when

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
B this is a different section so when

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.800 
B this is a different section so when
you<00:01:34.950> practice<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.700> may<00:01:35.880> want<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.270> consider

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
you practice you may want to consider

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.100 
you practice you may want to consider
breaking<00:01:37.710> down<00:01:38.250> your<00:01:38.579> day<00:01:39.329> into<00:01:39.810> different

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
breaking down your day into different

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.800 
breaking down your day into different
days<00:01:40.350> let's<00:01:40.950> say<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.130> practice<00:01:41.640> section<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.479> on

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
days let's say you practice section a on

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.280 
days let's say you practice section a on
day<00:01:43.020> one<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.560> then<00:01:43.710> section<00:01:44.670> B<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:45.090> day<00:01:45.329> two

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.800 

here's<00:01:49.290> another<00:01:49.590> example<00:01:50.369> as<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.329> can<00:01:51.570> see<00:01:51.780> I

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
here's another example as you can see I

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.170 
here's another example as you can see I
have<00:01:52.140> highlighted<00:01:52.500> these<00:01:53.130> two<00:01:53.340> portions<00:01:53.729> here

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
have highlighted these two portions here

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.940 
have highlighted these two portions here
these<00:01:55.020> two<00:01:55.259> are<00:01:55.470> exactly<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:56.340> same<00:01:56.810> measures

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
these two are exactly the same measures

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.560 
these two are exactly the same measures
they<00:01:58.950> look<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.340> same<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.880> I<00:01:59.909> call<00:02:00.240> them<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
they look the same so I call them the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.740 
they look the same so I call them the
music<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.439> section<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.250> once<00:02:02.969> your<00:02:03.119> practices

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750

f-sharp G G f-sharp and you will also

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.560 
f-sharp G G f-sharp and you will also
cover<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.789> part

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.420 

the<00:02:12.570> next<00:02:12.900> strategy<00:02:13.140> is<00:02:13.590> what<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:13.950> call<00:02:14.250> the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
the next strategy is what I call the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.750 
the next strategy is what I call the
court<00:02:14.760> or<00:02:14.940> cadence<00:02:15.690> analysis<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:17.190> same<00:02:17.400> court

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
court or cadence analysis the same court

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.090 
court or cadence analysis the same court
may<00:02:17.910> appear<00:02:18.270> for<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.510> few<00:02:18.570> measures<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.500> this

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
may appear for a few measures and this

and<00:04:24.840> my<00:04:24.990> next<00:04:25.290> suggestion<00:04:25.590> is<00:04:25.920> to<00:04:26.310> practice

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
and my next suggestion is to practice

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.060 
and my next suggestion is to practice
each<00:04:27.000> hand<00:04:27.540> separately<00:04:28.020> okay

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
each hand separately okay

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.280 
each hand separately okay
