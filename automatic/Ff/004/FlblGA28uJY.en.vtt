separates so keep the print and color up

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.859 
separates so keep the print and color up
top<00:01:03.409> where<00:01:03.830> it'll<00:01:04.070> bring<00:01:04.369> the<00:01:04.549> eye<00:01:04.580> up<00:01:05.299> top<00:01:05.659> and

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
keep the bottom as a solid so then that

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.300 
keep the bottom as a solid so then that
serves<00:01:08.030> to<00:01:08.180> visually<00:01:09.140> minimize<00:01:09.650> the<00:01:10.040> pear

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
serves to visually minimize the pear

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.399

shape<00:01:10.670> of<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.450> body<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:11.960> you're<00:01:12.080> always

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
shape of the body so you're always

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.060 
shape of the body so you're always
trying<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.650> seek<00:01:12.860> balance<00:01:13.100> I<00:01:14.710> love<00:01:15.710> this<00:01:15.860> week

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
trying to seek balance I love this week

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.469 
trying to seek balance I love this week
from<00:01:16.220> old<00:01:16.369> navy<00:01:16.430> and<00:01:16.700> it<00:01:16.759> really<00:01:16.970> complements

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
from old navy and it really complements

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.330 
from old navy and it really complements
an<00:01:17.540> apple<00:01:17.900> shape<00:01:18.110> apple<00:01:18.680> shapes<00:01:18.890> typically

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
an apple shape apple shapes typically

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.920 
an apple shape apple shapes typically
carry<00:01:19.549> their<00:01:19.729> weight<00:01:19.880> in<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.299> waist<00:01:20.540> the

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
carry their weight in the waist the

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.660 
carry their weight in the waist the
benefit<00:01:21.380> though<00:01:21.560> is<00:01:21.799> that<00:01:21.830> you<00:01:22.130> usually<00:01:22.369> have

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
benefit though is that you usually have

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.640 
benefit though is that you usually have
fantastic<00:01:23.210> legs<00:01:23.750> so<00:01:23.990> you<00:01:24.020> want<00:01:24.259> to<00:01:24.320> show<00:01:24.470> them

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
fantastic legs so you want to show them

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.710 
fantastic legs so you want to show them
off<00:01:24.830> while<00:01:25.280> creating<00:01:25.939> the<00:01:26.180> illusion<00:01:26.270> of<00:01:26.630> a

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
off while creating the illusion of a

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.469 
off while creating the illusion of a
defined<00:01:27.110> waist<00:01:27.470> and<00:01:27.770> so<00:01:28.220> this<00:01:28.340> ruching<00:01:28.609> really

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
defined waist and so this ruching really

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.090 
defined waist and so this ruching really
helps<00:01:29.719> because<00:01:29.810> it<00:01:30.200> creates<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:30.829> sort<00:01:31.039> of

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
helps because it creates the sort of

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.520 
helps because it creates the sort of
camouflage<00:01:31.460> that's<00:01:32.060> exactly<00:01:32.539> it<00:01:32.630> I<00:01:32.929> love<00:01:33.320> the

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
camouflage that's exactly it I love the
