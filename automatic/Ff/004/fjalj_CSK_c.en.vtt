guys how to get a cheap gaming laptop or
uh<00:00:07.859> just<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.670> good<00:00:08.849> quality<00:00:09.179> gaming<00:00:09.599> laptop<00:00:10.139> you

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
uh just a good quality gaming laptop you

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.709 
uh just a good quality gaming laptop you
want<00:00:10.889> one<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.790> uh<00:00:11.960> the<00:00:12.960> three<00:00:14.480> qualities<00:00:15.480> I

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
want one and uh the three qualities I

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.790 
want one and uh the three qualities I
guess<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.260> good<00:00:17.130> gaming<00:00:17.490> laptops<00:00:18.000> would<00:00:18.300> be

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
guess to a good gaming laptops would be

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.529 
guess to a good gaming laptops would be
the<00:00:19.800> processor<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.609> course<00:00:21.260> the<00:00:22.260> RAM<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:23.539> the

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
the processor of course the RAM and the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.740 
the processor of course the RAM and the
video<00:00:24.810> card<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.880> so<00:00:26.880> what<00:00:27.060> we're<00:00:27.150> gonna<00:00:27.240> do<00:00:27.510> is

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
video card and so what we're gonna do is

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.290 
video card and so what we're gonna do is
on<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:29.010> egg<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:30.029> want<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.300> go<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.570> laptops

laptop you want a dedicated video card
because<00:01:04.559> those<00:01:05.070> are<00:01:05.339> much<00:01:05.939> better<00:01:06.119> quality

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
because those are much better quality

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.520 
because those are much better quality
than<00:01:06.810> integrated<00:01:07.500> ones<00:01:07.710> there's<00:01:08.040> work<00:01:09.000> better

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
than integrated ones there's work better

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.620

and just search for those and then once

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.320 
and just search for those and then once
you're<00:01:12.780> here<00:01:13.130> you<00:01:14.130> want<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.340> sort<00:01:14.580> by<00:01:14.670> lowest

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
you're here you want to sort by lowest

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.850 
you're here you want to sort by lowest
price<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.900> finally<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.229> cheapest<00:01:16.619> one<00:01:16.830> I

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
price to finally the cheapest one I

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.310 
price to finally the cheapest one I
guess<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:18.170> normally<00:01:19.170> you're<00:01:19.290> gonna<00:01:19.439> want<00:01:19.740> a

memory and you want like for me I would

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.069 
memory and you want like for me I would
choose<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.310> Intel<00:01:32.729> processor<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.570> think<00:01:33.960> those

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
choose the Intel processor I think those

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.890 
choose the Intel processor I think those
are<00:01:34.229> better<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.880> don't<00:01:35.880> know<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.150> can<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.780> can

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
are better I don't know you can you can

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.219 
are better I don't know you can you can
try<00:01:37.110> these<00:01:37.229> AMD<00:01:38.070> but<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:39.090> I've<00:01:39.840> had<00:01:40.049> bad

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
try these AMD but I just I've had bad

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.170 
try these AMD but I just I've had bad
experiences<00:01:40.829> with<00:01:40.890> them<00:01:41.220> they're<00:01:41.460> they<00:01:42.119> to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
experiences with them they're they to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.340 
experiences with them they're they to
heat<00:01:42.570> up<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.869> lot<00:01:43.049> but<00:01:43.700> you<00:01:44.700> try<00:01:45.020> those<00:01:46.020> if<00:01:46.229> you

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
heat up a lot but you try those if you

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.499 
heat up a lot but you try those if you
want<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.829> don't<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.369> look<00:01:47.850> those<00:01:48.000> up<00:01:48.060> on

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
want I don't you can look those up on

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.120 
want I don't you can look those up on
the<00:01:48.570> internet<00:01:48.990> see<00:01:49.259> how<00:01:49.350> good<00:01:49.530> they<00:01:49.710> are

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
the internet see how good they are

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.240 
the internet see how good they are
opt<00:01:50.340> for<00:01:50.579> Intel<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.409> would<00:01:52.409> choose<00:01:52.680> probably

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
opt for Intel I would choose probably

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.819 
opt for Intel I would choose probably
either<00:01:53.399> i5<00:01:54.000> or<00:01:54.030> i7<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:56.000> core<00:01:57.000> processor<00:01:57.829> until

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
either i5 or i7 a core processor until

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.080 
either i5 or i7 a core processor until
and<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:01.350> need<00:02:01.530> at<00:02:01.619> least<00:02:01.649> four<00:02:02.009> gigs<00:02:02.250> but

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
and you need at least four gigs but

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.639 
and you need at least four gigs but
memory<00:02:03.689> for<00:02:04.469> RAM<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.950> be<00:02:05.070> honest<00:02:06.409> like<00:02:07.409> this

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
memory for RAM to be honest like this

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.020 
memory for RAM to be honest like this
one<00:02:07.859> this<00:02:08.039> one<00:02:08.220> looks<00:02:08.369> pretty<00:02:08.489> good<00:02:08.640> it's

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
one this one looks pretty good it's

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.449 
one this one looks pretty good it's
Intel<00:02:09.869> i5<00:02:10.760> 4<00:02:11.760> gig<00:02:11.940> memory<00:02:12.500> 500<00:02:13.500> gigabytes<00:02:14.190> of

Intel i5 4 gig memory 500 gigabytes of
hard<00:02:15.890> drive<00:02:16.890> space<00:02:17.540> then<00:02:18.540> looks<00:02:19.200> like<00:02:19.379> we<00:02:19.500> got

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
hard drive space then looks like we got

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.009 
hard drive space then looks like we got
a<00:02:20.360> gig<00:02:21.360> of<00:02:21.569> memory

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
a gig of memory

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:33.930 
a gig of memory
yep<00:02:22.170> gig<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:26.900> video<00:02:27.900> memory

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.150

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
so this one this one want to be too bad

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.110 
so this one this one want to be too bad

gaming laptop be honest it's only $600

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.090 
gaming laptop be honest it's only $600
which<00:02:40.120> it's<00:02:40.720> gonna<00:02:40.840> be<00:02:41.530> hard<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:41.920> find

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
which it's gonna be hard to find

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.030 
which it's gonna be hard to find
anything<00:02:42.400> cheaper<00:02:42.850> than<00:02:43.000> that<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.360> be<00:02:43.450> honest
