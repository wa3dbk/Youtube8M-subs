00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.390
 Speak guys b.leza jpg bmp in the area 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.670
 bringing another commented video to 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.400
 You and I'll bring you one more today. 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.590
 episode d series how to hit the 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.150
 pilot of the helicopter that can be a 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.490
 difficult to hit the pilot at the 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.110
 Sometimes, but there are some points there. 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.370
 Bringing it there to show you. 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.080
 People, I know there's going to be a lot of people. 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.710
 saying that it is wrong for him to be 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.170
 repeat 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.790
 But that's exactly what I did for you. 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.410
 that video we talk from time to time to 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.059
 People also talk about this subject again. 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.699
 so then why did I do it again? 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.260
 that video was I made to leave 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:48.879
 him to continue this series 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.129
 I said everything I had to say 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.600
 in that video the guys then I do not 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.250
 I need neither comment that if you have not seen 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.989
 the video click on that mark that I 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.019
 left side was the first of 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.269
 and there is no error 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.500
 You're the vehicle account if you think 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:04.330
 it's wrong take a look at that video 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.710
 You will understand my opinion and will not 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.750
 I need more talk about this subject. 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.000
 Beauty, people, let's stop rolling. 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.979
 now and go away for the video 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.290
 good first I'll show 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.909
 How do you get to the first point here? 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.530
 is a stone that is in the Chinese base 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.450
 ladies and in the Chinese base normally 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.759
 You will go this way for 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.710
 where I'm following and this stone that 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.060
 are you watching the guys on this rock you? 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.429
 have a very good government if you 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.469
 hiding behind her is kinda hard to 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.990
 snipers get it right and you get a 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:34.450
 great view of the enemy base of the 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.759
 enemy base base and the helicopters 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.259
 of vehicles tanks etc. 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.280
 the basis of them as you can see there 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:44.200
 You can see everything but about the book. 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.109
 band people have a big problem 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.109
 you can hit the pilot if he 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:52.210
 get into the book band and already start flying 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:54.159
 Let's go down and fly in. He has 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.810
 that stay at least a second stopped 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.700
 on the floor you can hit him 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.710
 that's because the guys book him 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.719
 Raises faster then rock then 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.729
 How are you going to see now, I'll give it a shot. 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.619
 and gives car time to lift the shot not 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.600
 Correct, I'll put another one. 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.310
 demonstration you see then there 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.600
 for you to hit the pilot read the bad guy 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.860
 You have to get a little bit of waiting 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.080
 floor to lift later if you do not 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.530
 hit and get up very fast do not give 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.940
 time you hit it already uses 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.350
 attack helicopters and delay a 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.180
 a little more to climb than read the 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.490
 so bad guy has to hit you guys 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.360
 You can see there you can get it right. 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.860
 easily 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.610
 remembering that these parameters are for 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.000
 sr 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.770
 r 61 with the aim 40 x galera 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.390
 You're going to put the sights right on the 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.730
 same place I'm putting 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.690
 adjust your blog to 1,000 meters 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.360
 guys 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.730
 this way and can not go wrong and 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.590
 for you get very cold one pilot 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.540
 kilometer a little distance and gives 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.310
 to do enough that the galley 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.290
 and for those who do not know why all the time 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.670
 keep typing heskey opened it in chat 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.410
 thinking or chat 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.420
 take a look at this other video make the 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.970
 registration and another link in the description 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.470
 that I do not even explain why 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.630
 basically this is for you to be able to 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.930
 keep the sights on the spot only and always stay 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.270
 taking without moving sight but to be able to 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.310
 understand how to do this why to do 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.810
 This takes a look at this video where I 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.730
 I explain everything there 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.959
 and once again people I repeat here 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.520
 I'm really sorry for talking. 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.610
 every now and then, but I have to talk 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.130
 enough to emphasize this 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.250
 Do not do this on servers 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.050
 that does not let be hip you want 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.940
 train this type of headshot long 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.500
 accept pilot and copy a good way 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.980
 of you train long shot you 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.390
 starting with a fixed target is very good 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.489
 Beauty you have every right to 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.140
 train there but do not do the servers 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.480
 that do not allow you to do this 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.790
 because this is a compound so it 's a 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.610
 lack of respect you say respect 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.650
 the players who do not like it 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.850
 so I was once again the message that 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.260
 I 'm always passing 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.390
 do not do the servers that do not 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.340
 as I said at the beginning of the 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.780
 video the law that still does not have many 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.360
 points to catch the pilot of the 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.299
 helicopter and when they apply evolution 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.220
 on this map it is more difficult to reach 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.080
 to the helicopter the sights and etc. 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.970
 But after a while you get used to it. 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.010
 and you can easily turn around 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.100
 then this is the first 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.130
 position is just go there now and train now 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.989
 the second position is in the legend dam 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.459
 I think you how to get there so much. 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.799
 of Russian and Chinese is not much 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.110
 hard to just get a helicopter car ever 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.800
 that goes and goes up that dam and 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.030
 guys 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.260
 remembering that they may sometimes have 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.820
 with that one stays in an area out of combat 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.550
 for a few seconds but then I left 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.020
 very quiet and from up guys 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.530
 Do you have both helicopter vision 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.360
 Chinese how much of the Russian helicopter arrives 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.099
 up here, take a look at the base of 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.690
 a search you will find may 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.409
 be some trees in the front but it is 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.459
 just be 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:44.709
 Can you stay in a room? 

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:47.139
 position without a tree or anything 

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:48.699
 I'm here now, I used the equipment. 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.319
 agitated for a thousand meters 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.789
 you will put in the crosshairs right there 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:53.319
 where I'm putting a little bit into the 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.300
 left side of the cabin 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:56.679
 It's not very difficult and if you train 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.539
 you handle easy easy 

00:04:56.679 --> 00:04:59.800
 the only weak point for me this dam 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.199
 Here is how you get a little bit 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.939
 Exposed but outside this is a great place 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.399
 they have other helicopter vision 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:07.599
 flags and many other places to leave 

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:08.379
 from the same place as this 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.610
 dam 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:12.159
 You also have helicopter vision. 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.839
 Russian and it 's not hard to get it right. 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:16.659
 easy as you can see there you 

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:18.099
 adjustments will go to 500 meters taking a 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:20.709
 little nothing his sights 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:25.419
 again remembering guys this all 

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:27.369
 with the aim 40 x and with sr 61 only 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.289
 problem here is to hit the gamer 

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:31.509
 I tried a few times and it is not 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.879
 easy to hit the ghana I could not 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:35.679
 but the pilot is very simple as you 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:37.689
 You can see there you can until you see the 

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:38.589
 his head so it becomes very easy to 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:41.860
 to adjust look 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:43.569
 this is the third position and now the guys 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.389
 let's make up composition and in my opinion 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:48.969
 the most difficult of all the people who are 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:50.769
 Russian base for Chinese base 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:52.809
 you first arrive and it is very easy to 

00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:55.599
 our Russian base and under these little things 

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:57.039
 leaving behind there is no easy mistake 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:58.179
 well I think it's very difficult was 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.610
 first because you stay 

00:05:58.179 --> 00:06:02.349
 fully exposed guys have nothing 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.229
 to protect you you have to stay in 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:07.269
 up the mountain second because 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.800
 it's too far so when I shoot it 's 

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:10.959
 arriving at the helicopter is almost 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.369
 lifting the parameters are also not 

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:13.869
 easy to hit 

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:16.389
 then this is what requires more training 

00:06:13.869 --> 00:06:18.399
 so much so that I asked my friend there 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:20.079
 the building is a friend of mine, the clan helps me 

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:21.249
 to make it worse because I was not 

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:23.139
 managing to catch the 

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:24.459
 It was not very easy and it was 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:25.539
 very difficult to get the 

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:27.610
 Okay, so if I'm going to train a lot 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:29.499
 to perfect me and how can you 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.819
 see if it's strip and now I'm worth more 

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:33.249
 he was already raising antónio pitra 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:34.959
 give a wrong raise after this 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:38.339
 here certainly requires more training 

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:40.569
 than all the others of it 

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:41.889
 Good guys, this is it. I hope they are. 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:43.659
 enjoying this video he has been 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:45.789
 information for you and that you 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:46.989
 helped you in some way if you 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:48.819
 Do you like to know what to do? 

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:50.999
 that force of the one that that favorite 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:53.139
 What do you want to do to make that 

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:54.880
 force will be helping a lot 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:55.990
 so has no concept 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.210
 take a look at the playlist 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.910
 this series of a law that has two more
