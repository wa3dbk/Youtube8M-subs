00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.550
 hello all welcome to another type of weapons 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.819
 this time it's a human tutorial 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:31.739
 they are the little tips 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.739
 for beginners in flash that do not have 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.770
 are not some works the cookies know very little about this tutorial so 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.640
 Québec comments that he already knew 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.510
 you know, do not even comment that I said no good tutorial good 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.870
 explanation proves they did not know why 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.340
 well nothing saying this is for people who do not have any 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.199
 knowledge 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.770
 thanks for believing 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.159
 ree good let's start let's go and our the region 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.590
 and that is to avoid delays 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.060
 we must active and take that they are two worlds that comes 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.440
 I do not know very well when I'm an accomplice but I draw them for 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.180
 be able to put an end to those examples and that he 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.230
 this doll is an old one as many would draw so run 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.300
 and this is another one that we are separated small earthquakes 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.460
 I want to explain the difference 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.070
 fifteen 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.250
 This is because of that good question then 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.650
 how can you make a character that are in your program one 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.230
 lasted a certain period of time the animation and then also the 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.190
 program account 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.320
 adopted other things 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.860
 but do not have to redraw 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.660
 I think that this is very focused, which is how they draw with a brush and 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.660
 problem is this already runs the movie that I have and that he 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.240
 can see here he explained that his team is moving on principles 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.300
 football in the tipnis the start 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.950
 two characters like time here does not move 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.880
 in this lies this character of quico 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.509
 It is a symbol they do not have to meet 1 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.699
 percent between cycling 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.169
 Tiki tiki 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.629
 the resources 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.890
 and that cycle that have everything and was repeated during this month 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:19.309
 and so on 

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:21.199
 this character here is a 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:23.039
 iquique chile change it 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:25.729
 but this last undefeated and burgos 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:29.659
 but together we can with 500 thousand that I think throughout the year has been 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.839
 exceptional 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:34.569
 the same goes for my feet 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.929
 the problem with this one here 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:40.059
 and is that if you have a frame 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:43.159
 85 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.759
 sutton keyframes 

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:50.429
 move it I can not select everything and even if I will just select what 

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:53.429
 justify 7 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:03:00.179
 - Syria very complicated and potentially mosquera explained 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.299
 it would not look good 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.299
 this is what many resort to punitive percent 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:09.489
 we had a witness 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.749
 I'm drawing in each frame three weeks but if you do not want to say 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:16.469
 stupid that these titles 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:18.059
 to its turn 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:20.289
 it's like a dream come true 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:23.079
 every party the musician 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.079
 jiménez who has explained to be present in the city 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.669
 kadafi 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.620
 be a symbol separately 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.069
 burke because this is very simple 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.069
 those who voted that conclusion 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:41.519
 without being so a keyframe for no movement 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.149
 they will not allow it to continue tinting 

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:48.729
 is canceled because they want to accumulate spirit titles that they love 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:50.909
 a collective that 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:52.459
 they put you in a place 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:53.789
 connectu 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:55.779
 and can move 

00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:57.639
 Asimally if your choice 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.639
 the move the games without any complication 

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:06.809
 let's go for themselves and 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:12.499
 fictional 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:15.129
 hadzic I was wrong 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:17.559
 the unne 

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:20.559
 luis figo li 

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:23.520
 a team that wins time that 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.520
 do not 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.419
 kikuchi a lot to the movie 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.289
 it is necessary here we alerted 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:41.789
 but it is moving 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.659
 every 35 frames 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:45.779
 insisted in that sense 

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:49.900
 everyone can see there that they do not need andorra to draw - the pivot 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.229
 I already have more elaborate characters like xp 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.490
 soto also separated percent symbols so that they arrive 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.080
 what and why 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:02.990
 Simón together 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.129
 miku the peak 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:09.129
 I'm a very different guy 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:12.779
 Kelly Bush acted in the movie 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.870
 rapporteur we are seeing 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.870
 dominic pivot is moving final months and berlin 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:22.729
 and of course so that they have an animation and a certain time 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:26.330
 a floor in all cases to minty 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.590
 in this one there's going to be nothing cris equipment costed them a few months together 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.569

 He said it like what my movie does 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.789
 now these something very simple peace we go in to explain how 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:35.449
 how to maintain your character for a certain time and disposition in a movement
