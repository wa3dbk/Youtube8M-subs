00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
I do it is I have my loom still with the

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.410 
I do it is I have my loom still with the
arrow<00:01:58.439> at<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> bottom<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.909> start<00:02:00.210> at<00:02:00.329> the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
arrow at the bottom and I start at the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.260 
arrow at the bottom and I start at the
top<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.469> just<00:02:01.619> use<00:02:01.860> whatever<00:02:02.159> colors<00:02:02.880> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
top and I just use whatever colors the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.270 
top and I just use whatever colors the
majority<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:04.049> it's<00:02:04.170> covering<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:05.189> I

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
majority is that it's covering and I

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.220 
majority is that it's covering and I
start<00:02:05.579> putting<00:02:05.850> my<00:02:05.969> bands<00:02:06.390> on

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
start putting my bands on

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.210 
start putting my bands on
as<00:02:07.320> upside<00:02:07.770> down<00:02:07.920> triangles<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:10.070> I'm<00:02:11.070> just

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
as upside down triangles so I'm just

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.300 
as upside down triangles so I'm just
going<00:02:11.490> to<00:02:11.640> hook<00:02:11.880> them<00:02:12.030> like<00:02:12.240> that<00:02:12.770> and<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:14.220> go

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
going to hook them like that and you go

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.780 
going to hook them like that and you go
all<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:15.000> way<00:02:15.030> down<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.740> here<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.430> skip

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
all the way down to here and you skip

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.640 
all the way down to here and you skip
the<00:02:17.910> bottom<00:02:18.210> row<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.930> last<00:02:19.110> three<00:02:19.410> pins

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
the bottom row so the last three pins

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.220 
the bottom row so the last three pins
won't<00:02:19.950> have<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.310> triangles<00:02:20.760> on<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.120> then<00:02:22.110> when

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
won't have the triangles on it then when

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.360 
won't have the triangles on it then when
you<00:02:22.290> have<00:02:22.440> your<00:02:22.560> triangles<00:02:23.040> done<00:02:23.190> you're

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
you have your triangles done you're

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.920 
you have your triangles done you're
going<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.550> turn<00:02:23.700> your<00:02:23.760> loom<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.780> your

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
going to turn your loom so that your

going to turn your loom so that your
arrows<00:02:25.230> at<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.470> top<00:02:25.560> air<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:27.390> it's<00:02:27.930> Pete

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
arrows at the top air and it's Pete

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.260 
arrows at the top air and it's Pete
pointing<00:02:28.920> towards<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.610> you're<00:02:30.000> just

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
pointing towards you and you're just

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.240 
pointing towards you and you're just
going<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.840> hook<00:02:31.020> like<00:02:31.320> you<00:02:31.470> would<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.710> triple

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
going to hook like you would a triple

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.930 
going to hook like you would a triple
single<00:02:32.370> up<00:02:33.140> each<00:02:34.140> rep<00:02:34.470> go<00:02:35.340> inside<00:02:35.760> your

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
single up each rep go inside your

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.720 
single up each rep go inside your
triangle<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.630> go<00:02:36.750> in<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.290> row<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.740> hook<00:02:38.610> it

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
triangle and go in the row and hook it

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.980 
triangle and go in the row and hook it
all<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.000> way<00:02:39.120> up<00:02:39.620> then<00:02:40.620> when<00:02:40.770> it's<00:02:40.890> done<00:02:41.990> you

all the way up then when it's done you

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.560 
all the way up then when it's done you
do<00:02:43.440> your<00:02:43.620> extension<00:02:44.340> make<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.180> normally

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
do your extension make you normally

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
to do triangles and going to be hooked

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.920 
to do triangles and going to be hooked
but<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.760> pull<00:02:54.000> all<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.450> band's<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.810> the
