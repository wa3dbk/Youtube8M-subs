00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
hello doing a quick review on this

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.809 
hello doing a quick review on this
pirate<00:00:03.480> on<00:00:03.600> mr<00:00:04.440> which<00:00:04.799> I<00:00:04.950> will<00:00:05.130> quickly<00:00:05.670> show

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
pirate on mr which I will quickly show

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.490 
pirate on mr which I will quickly show
you<00:00:05.970> here<00:00:06.180> there<00:00:06.960> they<00:00:07.109> are

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
you here there they are

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.220 
you here there they are
I'm<00:00:08.250> not<00:00:08.370> sure<00:00:08.460> if<00:00:08.519> you<00:00:08.580> can<00:00:08.670> tell<00:00:08.880> what<00:00:09.000> I'm<00:00:09.090> on

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:09.230 
I'm not sure if you can tell what I'm on

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.839 
I'm not sure if you can tell what I'm on
quite<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.260> steep<00:00:10.500> slope<00:00:10.769> here<00:00:10.980> these<00:00:11.639> things

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
quite a steep slope here these things

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.940 
quite a steep slope here these things
never<00:00:12.059> really<00:00:12.330> show<00:00:12.509> up<00:00:12.690> so<00:00:13.440> if<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.590> put<00:00:13.830> my

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
never really show up so if I put my

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.499 
never really show up so if I put my
camera<00:00:14.280> facing<00:00:14.580> straight<00:00:14.880> ahead<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.240> can<00:00:15.360> see

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
camera facing straight ahead you can see

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.950 
camera facing straight ahead you can see
the<00:00:15.929> trees<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.440> point<00:00:17.250> down<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.640> slope<00:00:17.960> that's

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
the trees I point down the slope that's

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.950 
the trees I point down the slope that's
the<00:00:19.109> kind<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.380> angle<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:19.740> we're<00:00:19.830> on<00:00:19.980> which<00:00:20.430> is

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
the kind of angle that we're on which is

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.870 
the kind of angle that we're on which is
probably<00:00:21.960> about<00:00:22.080> 30<00:00:22.500> degrees<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.949> guess<00:00:23.130> and

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
probably about 30 degrees I guess and

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.160 
probably about 30 degrees I guess and
it's<00:00:24.000> just<00:00:24.150> really<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.420> look<00:00:24.570> at<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.750> traction

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
it's just really to look at the traction

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.420 
it's just really to look at the traction
in<00:00:25.260> these<00:00:25.350> shoes<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.650> mean<00:00:25.740> office<00:00:25.980> it's<00:00:26.099> dry<00:00:26.340> at

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
in these shoes I mean office it's dry at

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.310 
in these shoes I mean office it's dry at
the<00:00:26.519> minute<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:27.480> got<00:00:27.599> amazing<00:00:27.840> traction

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
the minute it got amazing traction

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.910 
the minute it got amazing traction
really<00:00:28.890> great<00:00:29.840> obviously<00:00:30.840> that's<00:00:31.769> what

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
really great obviously that's what

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.900 
really great obviously that's what
they're<00:00:32.040> designed<00:00:32.130> for<00:00:34.550> also<00:00:35.550> designed

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
they're designed for also designed

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.840 
they're designed for also designed
specifically<00:00:36.420> for<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.500> mud<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.520> see

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
specifically for the mud so you can see

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.819 
specifically for the mud so you can see
they're<00:00:39.030> whole<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.750> know<00:00:39.780> tractor<00:00:40.260> tire<00:00:40.440> kind

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
they're whole you know tractor tire kind

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.950 
they're whole you know tractor tire kind
of<00:00:40.890> sole<00:00:41.070> there<00:00:41.309> I've<00:00:42.270> used<00:00:42.480> these<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.809> mud

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
of sole there I've used these in the mud

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.020 
of sole there I've used these in the mud
just<00:00:43.379> previously<00:00:43.800> see<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.730> way<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
just previously see the way that the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.630 
just previously see the way that the
grips<00:00:45.270> go<00:00:45.750> alternating<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.309> they<00:00:47.460> give

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
grips go alternating so that they give

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.299 
grips go alternating so that they give
you<00:00:47.730> traction<00:00:47.940> both<00:00:48.710> downhill<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.010> uphill

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
you traction both downhill and uphill

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.439 
you traction both downhill and uphill
and<00:00:51.239> if<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.570> spot<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.989> there<00:00:53.360> but<00:00:54.360> these

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
and if you can spot that there but these

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.810 
and if you can spot that there but these
DMR's<00:00:54.899> because<00:00:55.199> one<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.829> things<00:00:56.039> with

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
DMR's because one of the things with

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.840 
DMR's because one of the things with
this<00:00:57.660> model<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.010> because<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.550> designed

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
this model is that because it's designed

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.369 
this model is that because it's designed
for<00:01:00.120> mud<00:01:01.079> running

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
for mud running

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.820 
for mud running
hence<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> mr<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.280> great<00:01:03.239> for<00:01:03.840> those<00:01:04.439> kinds<00:01:04.799> of

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
hence the mr is great for those kinds of

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.700 
hence the mr is great for those kinds of
races<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.549> fact<00:01:05.700> any<00:01:06.570> even<00:01:07.200> fight<00:01:07.380> finger

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
races and in fact any even fight finger

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.510 
races and in fact any even fight finger
is<00:01:07.890> pretty<00:01:08.130> good

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
is pretty good

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.520 
is pretty good
for<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> mud<00:01:08.850> race<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.659> original<00:01:09.990> ones<00:01:10.110> which

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
for a mud race the original ones which

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.469 
for a mud race the original ones which
were<00:01:10.680> like<00:01:10.799> slick<00:01:11.100> tightest<00:01:11.490> probably<00:01:12.360> not

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
were like slick tightest probably not

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.020 
were like slick tightest probably not
your<00:01:12.540> best<00:01:12.630> choice<00:01:12.979> but<00:01:13.979> my<00:01:14.189> experience<00:01:14.909> with

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
your best choice but my experience with

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.679 
your best choice but my experience with
them<00:01:15.180> was<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.020> really<00:01:16.140> interestingly<00:01:16.880> say<00:01:17.880> you

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
them was it really interestingly say you

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.609 
them was it really interestingly say you
can<00:01:18.840> be<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.990> judge<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.170> that

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
can be the judge of that

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.770 
can be the judge of that
is<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.810> first<00:01:22.340> first<00:01:23.340> run<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.880> went<00:01:24.270> out<00:01:24.509> on

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
is the first first run I went out on

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.780 
is the first first run I went out on
perhaps<00:01:25.640> October<00:01:26.640> November<00:01:27.650> 2006<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.610> pair

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
perhaps October November 2006 in a pair

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.880 
perhaps October November 2006 in a pair
of<00:01:29.820> classics<00:01:30.270> down<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> bridle<00:01:31.500> trail<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.799> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
of classics down a bridle trail in the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.020 
of classics down a bridle trail in the
middle<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.100> October<00:01:34.189> thick<00:01:35.189> mud<00:01:35.400> thick<00:01:35.759> mud<00:01:35.909> as

you<00:01:36.090> can<00:01:36.240> imagine<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:37.220> what<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.280> noticed<00:01:38.700> was

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
you can imagine and what I noticed was

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.130 
you can imagine and what I noticed was
that<00:01:41.329> by<00:01:42.329> about<00:01:42.540> 15<00:01:43.259> minutes<00:01:43.530> into<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.890> my<00:01:45.140> my

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
that by about 15 minutes into it my my

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.780 
that by about 15 minutes into it my my
wife's<00:01:46.350> old<00:01:46.710> my<00:01:46.920> feet<00:01:47.100> was<00:01:47.189> starting<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.490> cramp

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
wife's old my feet was starting to cramp

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.880 
wife's old my feet was starting to cramp
oh<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.140> bit<00:01:49.259> weird<00:01:49.290> I've<00:01:49.590> not<00:01:49.710> had<00:01:49.770> this

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
oh this is a bit weird I've not had this

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.859 
oh this is a bit weird I've not had this
before<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.490> realized<00:01:51.299> was<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.479> was<00:01:51.600> using<00:01:51.720> my

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
before I realized was I was using my

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.620 
before I realized was I was using my
toes<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.829> dig<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.399> give<00:01:53.520> me<00:01:53.610> traction<00:01:53.820> it

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
toes to dig in and give me traction it

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.990 
toes to dig in and give me traction it
was<00:01:54.750> one<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.899> those<00:01:55.020> aha<00:01:55.320> moments<00:01:55.530> where<00:01:56.159> you

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
was one of those aha moments where you

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.240 
was one of those aha moments where you
suddenly<00:01:57.149> realized<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:58.009> that's<00:01:59.009> why<00:01:59.159> I've

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
suddenly realized that that's why I've

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.130 
suddenly realized that that's why I've
got<00:01:59.369> toes<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.820> end<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.060> my<00:02:00.149> feet<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:01.020> they

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
got toes on the end of my feet so they

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.569 
got toes on the end of my feet so they
can<00:02:01.259> dig<00:02:01.469> into<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.799> ground<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.250> pull<00:02:02.460> me

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
can dig into the ground and pull me

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.280 
can dig into the ground and pull me
along<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:03.210> like<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.390> dog's<00:02:03.659> claws<00:02:03.990> digging

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
along just like a dog's claws digging

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.940 
along just like a dog's claws digging
into<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.680> ground<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.520> suddenly<00:02:06.149> after

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
into the ground so suddenly after

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.940 
into the ground so suddenly after
whatever<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.099> was<00:02:08.300> 31<00:02:09.300> years<00:02:09.679> 32<00:02:10.679> years<00:02:10.890> of

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
whatever it was 31 years 32 years of

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.820 
whatever it was 31 years 32 years of
wearing<00:02:11.629> wearing<00:02:12.629> shoes<00:02:12.900> all<00:02:13.080> my<00:02:13.200> life

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
wearing wearing shoes all my life

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.500 
wearing wearing shoes all my life
and<00:02:14.010> relying<00:02:14.280> on<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.490> external<00:02:14.850> grip<00:02:15.240> on<00:02:15.420> the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
and relying on the external grip on the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.880 
and relying on the external grip on the
shoe<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:16.290> suddenly<00:02:16.590> realize<00:02:16.860> that

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
shoe you suddenly realize that

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.970 
shoe you suddenly realize that
intrinsically<00:02:17.640> you've<00:02:18.360> got<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.570> gripping

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
intrinsically you've got a gripping

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.580 
intrinsically you've got a gripping
mechanism<00:02:20.300> built<00:02:21.300> into<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.810> foot<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.200> that

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
mechanism built into the foot and that

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.930 
mechanism built into the foot and that
no<00:02:22.710> other<00:02:22.890> shoe<00:02:23.100> allows<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.670> actually<00:02:23.790> use

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
no other shoe allows you to actually use

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.120 
no other shoe allows you to actually use
that<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:25.050> that<00:02:25.170> even<00:02:25.290> five<00:02:25.560> fingers<00:02:25.860> have

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
that so that even five fingers have

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.100 
that so that even five fingers have
become<00:02:26.430> uber<00:02:27.150> popular<00:02:27.270> with<00:02:27.600> mud<00:02:27.750> runners<00:02:27.990> for

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
become uber popular with mud runners for

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.810 
become uber popular with mud runners for
that<00:02:28.230> very<00:02:28.410> reason<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:29.280> also<00:02:29.640> because

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
that very reason and also because

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.520 
that very reason and also because
they're<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.060> tight<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.570> foot<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:31.410> old

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
they're so tight to the foot the old

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.130 
they're so tight to the foot the old
classics<00:02:32.040> they<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:33.540> pair<00:02:33.750> actually<00:02:33.870> on<00:02:34.080> that

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
classics they that pair actually on that

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.750 
classics they that pair actually on that
same<00:02:34.380> run<00:02:34.560> it's<00:02:35.010> going<00:02:35.160> down<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.370> bridle<00:02:35.670> way

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
same run it's going down the bridle way

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.090 
same run it's going down the bridle way
and<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.360> suddenly<00:02:36.540> realized<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:37.110> lost<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.890> shoe

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
and I suddenly realized I lost the shoe

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.460 
and I suddenly realized I lost the shoe
about<00:02:38.970> six<00:02:39.570> or<00:02:39.690> seven<00:02:39.870> meters<00:02:40.050> back<00:02:40.200> up<00:02:40.350> the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
about six or seven meters back up the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.900 
about six or seven meters back up the
trail<00:02:40.880> but<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:42.030> felt<00:02:42.270> so<00:02:42.530> barefoot<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.910> the

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
trail but it felt so barefoot and the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.520 
trail but it felt so barefoot and the
shoes<00:02:45.090> were<00:02:45.120> full<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.480> mud<00:02:45.690> they're<00:02:46.050> classics

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
shoes were full of mud they're classics

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.440 
shoes were full of mud they're classics
so<00:02:47.130> they<00:02:47.280> didn't<00:02:47.760> have<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.910> strapping<00:02:48.330> over

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
so they didn't have the strapping over

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.330 
so they didn't have the strapping over
the<00:02:48.540> top<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:49.020> they<00:02:49.140> just<00:02:49.320> literally<00:02:49.710> got

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
the top so they just literally got

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.370 
the top so they just literally got
suctioned<00:02:51.030> off<00:02:51.150> my<00:02:51.270> foot<00:02:51.450> as<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.870> pick<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.260> foot

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
suctioned off my foot as I pick the foot

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.260 
suctioned off my foot as I pick the foot
up<00:02:52.440> out<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.190> mud<00:02:53.340> they<00:02:53.910> got<00:02:54.060> left<00:02:54.150> behind

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
up out of the mud they got left behind

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.450 
up out of the mud they got left behind
in<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.570> mud<00:02:54.690> now<00:02:55.350> with<00:02:55.500> these<00:02:55.620> spiraled<00:02:56.400> on

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
in the mud now with these spiraled on

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.840 
in the mud now with these spiraled on
them<00:02:56.580> arse

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
them arse

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.210 
them arse
they've<00:02:57.420> got<00:02:57.570> the<00:02:57.660> lacing<00:02:57.990> system<00:02:58.140> there<00:02:58.500> the

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
they've got the lacing system there the

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.400 
they've got the lacing system there the
quick-release<00:02:59.820> lacing<00:03:00.360> system<00:03:00.510> so<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.290> can

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
quick-release lacing system so you can

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.380 
quick-release lacing system so you can
pull<00:03:01.620> them<00:03:01.710> tight<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.730> can<00:03:02.880> tighten<00:03:03.330> that

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
pull them tight you can tighten that

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.990 
pull them tight you can tighten that
down<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.780> then<00:03:03.990> velcro<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:05.640> these<00:03:05.790> things

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
down and then velcro it and these things

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.900 
down and then velcro it and these things
just<00:03:06.330> don't<00:03:07.020> come<00:03:07.140> off<00:03:07.520> so<00:03:08.520> that's<00:03:08.610> another

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
just don't come off so that's another

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.340 
just don't come off so that's another
reason<00:03:09.120> why<00:03:09.540> people<00:03:09.720> like<00:03:09.930> them<00:03:10.050> for<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.230> mud

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
reason why people like them for the mud

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.620 
reason why people like them for the mud
races<00:03:10.680> on<00:03:11.430> top<00:03:11.580> of<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:11.790> they<00:03:12.180> don't<00:03:12.390> have<00:03:12.480> big

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
races on top of that they don't have big

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.970 
races on top of that they don't have big
bulky<00:03:14.840> sole<00:03:15.840> units<00:03:16.230> off<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.800> side

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
bulky sole units off the side

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.830 
bulky sole units off the side
essentially<00:03:17.370> their<00:03:17.940> foot<00:03:18.120> shape<00:03:18.330> sole<00:03:18.540> units

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
essentially their foot shape sole units

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.410 
essentially their foot shape sole units
so<00:03:19.530> they<00:03:19.620> don't<00:03:19.770> pick<00:03:20.010> up<00:03:20.160> additional<00:03:20.340> mud<00:03:20.940> so

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
so they don't pick up additional mud so

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.610 
so they don't pick up additional mud so
they<00:03:21.510> don't<00:03:21.660> really<00:03:21.750> get<00:03:21.900> any<00:03:22.050> heavier<00:03:22.230> when

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
they don't really get any heavier when

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.830 
they don't really get any heavier when
you're<00:03:22.740> running<00:03:22.920> in<00:03:22.980> mud<00:03:23.100> either<00:03:23.720> compared<00:03:24.720> to

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
you're running in mud either compared to

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.690 
you're running in mud either compared to
a<00:03:24.870> running<00:03:25.050> shoe<00:03:25.320> on<00:03:25.950> top<00:03:26.160> of<00:03:26.280> that<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.610> know

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
a running shoe on top of that you know

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.770 
a running shoe on top of that you know
how<00:03:26.790> many<00:03:26.910> materials<00:03:27.270> to<00:03:27.330> soak<00:03:27.510> up<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.750> water

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
how many materials to soak up the water

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.930 
how many materials to soak up the water
so<00:03:28.290> they<00:03:28.650> stay<00:03:28.890> nice<00:03:29.070> and<00:03:29.100> lightweight<00:03:29.340> they

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
so they stay nice and lightweight they

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.400 
so they stay nice and lightweight they
shed<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.330> mud<00:03:30.480> well<00:03:30.660> they<00:03:31.020> don't<00:03:31.140> come<00:03:31.350> off

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
shed the mud well they don't come off

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.949 
shed the mud well they don't come off
they<00:03:31.980> give<00:03:32.130> you<00:03:32.220> extra<00:03:32.490> grip<00:03:32.780> because<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:33.840> can

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
they give you extra grip because you can

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.240 
they give you extra grip because you can
actually<00:03:34.080> use<00:03:34.350> your<00:03:34.560> toes<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:34.980> way<00:03:35.070> they're

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
actually use your toes the way they're

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.850

designed<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.640> be<00:03:35.760> used<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.500> on<00:03:37.500> top<00:03:37.680> of<00:03:37.709> that

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
designed to be used and on top of that

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.980 
designed to be used and on top of that
at<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.580> end<00:03:38.700> of<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.850> lot<00:03:38.940> of<00:03:39.000> mud<00:03:39.150> races<00:03:39.450> don't

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
at the end of a lot of mud races don't

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.600 
at the end of a lot of mud races don't
even<00:03:40.290> if<00:03:40.709> you've<00:03:40.890> ever<00:03:41.010> been<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.310> one<00:03:41.459> but

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
even if you've ever been to one but

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.510 
even if you've ever been to one but
there's<00:03:41.940> often<00:03:42.270> a<00:03:42.420> big<00:03:42.840> pile<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.230> old<00:03:43.680> shoes

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
there's often a big pile of old shoes

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.890 
there's often a big pile of old shoes
that<00:03:44.850> people<00:03:45.120> essentially<00:03:45.510> just<00:03:45.690> throwing

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
that people essentially just throwing

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.740 
that people essentially just throwing
away<00:03:46.050> cuz<00:03:46.430> they're<00:03:47.430> just<00:03:47.610> dead<00:03:48.060> having<00:03:48.480> been

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
away cuz they're just dead having been

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.750 
away cuz they're just dead having been
exposed<00:03:49.110> to<00:03:49.260> that<00:03:49.320> much<00:03:49.530> mud<00:03:49.740> where<00:03:50.490> the<00:03:50.580> five

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
exposed to that much mud where the five

fingers of course the entire range is
machine<00:03:53.340> washable<00:03:53.459> I<00:03:54.140> would<00:03:55.140> just<00:03:55.290> hose<00:03:55.470> them

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
machine washable I would just hose them

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.190 
machine washable I would just hose them
down<00:03:55.709> in<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.910> back<00:03:57.060> garden<00:03:57.209> chuck<00:03:58.050> them<00:03:58.110> in

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
down in the back garden chuck them in

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.150 
down in the back garden chuck them in
the<00:03:58.290> washing<00:03:58.500> machine<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.890> they<00:03:58.950> come<00:03:59.130> out

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
the washing machine and they come out

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.210 
the washing machine and they come out
looking<00:03:59.520> good<00:04:00.060> as<00:04:00.209> new<00:04:00.450> so<00:04:00.810> anyway<00:04:01.709> as<00:04:01.950> a<00:04:01.980> brief

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
looking good as new so anyway as a brief

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.580 
looking good as new so anyway as a brief
rundown<00:04:02.430> of<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:03.060> grip<00:04:03.240> sight<00:04:03.480> on<00:04:04.110> top<00:04:04.380> of<00:04:04.500> that

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
rundown of the grip sight on top of that

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.670 
rundown of the grip sight on top of that
there's<00:04:04.980> also<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:06.200> cocoon<00:04:07.200> technology

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
there's also the cocoon technology

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.110 
there's also the cocoon technology
that's<00:04:07.860> within<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.130> sole<00:04:08.310> so<00:04:08.670> cocoon

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
that's within the sole so cocoon

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.120 
that's within the sole so cocoon
technology<00:04:09.540> is<00:04:09.720> through<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.620> window<00:04:10.920> there

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
technology is through the window there

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.830 
technology is through the window there
and<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:12.120> don't<00:04:12.180> know<00:04:12.300> if<00:04:12.390> you<00:04:12.450> can<00:04:12.510> make<00:04:12.690> that

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
and I don't know if you can make that

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.290 
and I don't know if you can make that
out<00:04:12.870> a<00:04:12.989> Hetal<00:04:13.640> maybe<00:04:14.640> just<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:15.000> little<00:04:15.030> bit

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
out a Hetal maybe just a little bit

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.479 
out a Hetal maybe just a little bit
through<00:04:15.540> there<00:04:15.690> struggling<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.500> focus<00:04:16.890> but

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
through there struggling to focus but

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.699 
through there struggling to focus but
that<00:04:17.669> cocoon<00:04:17.970> technology<00:04:18.570> is<00:04:19.169> designed<00:04:19.440> so

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
that cocoon technology is designed so

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.260 
that cocoon technology is designed so
that<00:04:19.739> if<00:04:19.950> you<00:04:20.070> hit<00:04:20.280> something<00:04:20.489> sharp<00:04:21.030> like<00:04:21.150> a

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
that if you hit something sharp like a

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.390 
that if you hit something sharp like a
stone<00:04:21.630> let's<00:04:22.590> put<00:04:22.740> that<00:04:22.830> in<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.040> middle<00:04:23.220> of<00:04:23.250> it

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
stone let's put that in the middle of it

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.450 
stone let's put that in the middle of it
of<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.120> trail<00:04:24.419> here<00:04:24.660> that's<00:04:25.410> up<00:04:25.590> you're

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
of the trail here that's up you're

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.080 
of the trail here that's up you're
running<00:04:26.669> along<00:04:26.760> and<00:04:27.180> you

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
running along and you

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.450 
running along and you
come<00:04:29.090> down<00:04:29.240> on<00:04:29.389> it<00:04:29.480> like<00:04:29.540> this<00:04:30.250> let's<00:04:31.250> get<00:04:31.340> the

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
come down on it like this let's get the

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.280 
come down on it like this let's get the
filming<00:04:31.760> right<00:04:31.880> come<00:04:32.810> down<00:04:32.960> on<00:04:33.050> it<00:04:33.139> like<00:04:33.260> that

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
filming right come down on it like that

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.350 
filming right come down on it like that
as<00:04:33.800> you're<00:04:34.430> running<00:04:34.780> well<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:36.800> cocoon

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
as you're running well the cocoon

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.840 
as you're running well the cocoon
essentially<00:04:38.360> imagine<00:04:39.229> the<00:04:39.320> stone<00:04:39.699> bashes<00:04:40.699> up

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
essentially imagine the stone bashes up

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.490 
essentially imagine the stone bashes up
into<00:04:41.150> the<00:04:41.240> cocoon<00:04:41.389> I<00:04:41.750> can't<00:04:42.139> show<00:04:42.290> you<00:04:42.350> while

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
into the cocoon I can't show you while

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.310 
into the cocoon I can't show you while
I'm<00:04:42.590> holding<00:04:42.740> this<00:04:43.550> it<00:04:44.540> bashes<00:04:44.930> up<00:04:45.080> into<00:04:45.260> the

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
I'm holding this it bashes up into the

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.420 
I'm holding this it bashes up into the
cocoon<00:04:45.590> and<00:04:45.740> it<00:04:45.860> spreads<00:04:46.190> the<00:04:46.310> force

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
cocoon and it spreads the force

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.670 
cocoon and it spreads the force
laterally<00:04:47.090> across<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.720> mesh<00:04:47.990> essentially

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
laterally across the mesh essentially

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.939 
laterally across the mesh essentially
and<00:04:49.449> what<00:04:50.449> that<00:04:50.600> means<00:04:50.840> is<00:04:51.050> that<00:04:51.080> you<00:04:51.770> don't

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
and what that means is that you don't

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:53.260 
and what that means is that you don't
get<00:04:52.010> so<00:04:52.160> much<00:04:52.310> force<00:04:52.490> going<00:04:52.639> up<00:04:52.790> into<00:04:52.970> the<00:04:53.060> foot

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
get so much force going up into the foot

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.930 
get so much force going up into the foot
but<00:04:54.040> the<00:04:55.040> force<00:04:55.220> goes<00:04:55.370> will<00:04:55.520> actually<00:04:55.760> across

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
but the force goes will actually across

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.510 
but the force goes will actually across
the<00:04:56.090> mesh<00:04:56.270> and<00:04:56.960> that<00:04:57.169> means<00:04:57.380> you<00:04:57.919> get<00:04:58.490> a

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
the mesh and that means you get a

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.670 
the mesh and that means you get a
smoother<00:04:58.880> ride<00:04:59.030> on<00:04:59.419> rough<00:04:59.630> terrain<00:04:59.960> like

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
smoother ride on rough terrain like

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.490 
smoother ride on rough terrain like
natural<00:05:01.160> terrain<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:01.669> and<00:05:02.540> you're<00:05:03.290> not<00:05:03.380> going

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
natural terrain and and you're not going

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.540 
natural terrain and and you're not going
to<00:05:03.560> get<00:05:03.650> so<00:05:03.919> much<00:05:05.229> sort<00:05:06.229> of<00:05:06.290> stone<00:05:06.830> bruising<00:05:07.310> or

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
to get so much sort of stone bruising or

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.100 
to get so much sort of stone bruising or
bruising<00:05:07.910> from<00:05:08.030> hitting<00:05:08.510> roots<00:05:08.840> in<00:05:09.050> the

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
bruising from hitting roots in the

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
bruising from hitting roots in the
forest<00:05:09.410> and<00:05:09.560> so<00:05:09.680> on<00:05:10.660> at<00:05:11.660> the<00:05:11.720> same<00:05:11.840> time<00:05:12.130> it's

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
forest and so on at the same time it's

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.440 
forest and so on at the same time it's
of<00:05:13.280> course<00:05:13.460> extremely<00:05:13.669> thin<00:05:13.970> this<00:05:14.120> mesh<00:05:14.300> is

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
of course extremely thin this mesh is

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.060 
of course extremely thin this mesh is
less<00:05:14.630> than<00:05:14.780> a<00:05:14.810> millimeter<00:05:15.169> thick<00:05:15.229> and<00:05:15.650> it's

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
less than a millimeter thick and it's

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.680 
less than a millimeter thick and it's
extremely<00:05:16.430> flexible<00:05:16.669> so<00:05:17.030> you<00:05:17.060> can<00:05:17.150> still<00:05:17.479> wrap

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
extremely flexible so you can still wrap

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.840 
extremely flexible so you can still wrap
your<00:05:17.900> foot<00:05:18.169> around<00:05:18.470> the<00:05:18.979> roots<00:05:19.520> and<00:05:19.760> the

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
your foot around the roots and the

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.060 
your foot around the roots and the
stones<00:05:20.090> without<00:05:20.780> compromising<00:05:21.650> the<00:05:21.710> function
