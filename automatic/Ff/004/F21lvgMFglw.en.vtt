a<00:00:02.939> brand<00:00:03.419> new<00:00:03.540> circuit<00:00:04.020> Friday<00:00:04.290> on<00:00:04.650> a<00:00:04.710> Saturday

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
a brand new circuit Friday on a Saturday

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.570 
a brand new circuit Friday on a Saturday
I'm<00:00:06.210> really<00:00:06.600> sorry<00:00:06.810> about<00:00:06.960> that<00:00:07.170> but<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:08.189> kind

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
I'm really sorry about that but I kind

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.360 
I'm really sorry about that but I kind
of<00:00:08.670> went<00:00:08.910> too<00:00:09.660> deep<00:00:09.840> into<00:00:10.139> one<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.650> wanted<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.219> do

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
of went too deep into one I wanted to do

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.919 
of went too deep into one I wanted to do
and<00:00:11.639> then<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:11.849> took<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.059> little<00:00:12.599> bit<00:00:12.719> longer

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
and then it took a little bit longer

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.650 
and then it took a little bit longer
than<00:00:13.080> anticipated<00:00:14.059> what<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.089> was<00:00:15.330> really

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
than anticipated what I was really

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.060 
than anticipated what I was really
shooting<00:00:15.990> for<00:00:16.049> was<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.440> double<00:00:16.830> sideband

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
shooting for was a double sideband

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.519 
shooting for was a double sideband
transmitter<00:00:18.060> which<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.539> really<00:00:19.050> very<00:00:19.439> easy

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
transmitter which is really very easy

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.340 
transmitter which is really very easy
and<00:00:20.160> simplistic<00:00:20.640> but<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.420> decided<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.140> break

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
and simplistic but I decided to break

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.019 
and simplistic but I decided to break
the<00:00:22.380> circuits<00:00:22.890> down<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.130> mean<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.490> got<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.789> ready

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
the circuits down I mean I got it ready

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.179 
the circuits down I mean I got it ready
here's<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.720> microphone<00:00:25.019> preamp<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.070> all

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
here's the microphone preamp and all

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.779 
here's the microphone preamp and all
that<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.580> here's<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.910> DSB<00:00:28.010> transmitter<00:00:29.010> but

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
that and here's the DSB transmitter but

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.460 
that and here's the DSB transmitter but
we're<00:00:30.269> not<00:00:30.390> going<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.599> worry<00:00:30.750> about<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.050> DSB

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
we're not going to worry about the DSB

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.709 
we're not going to worry about the DSB
transmitter<00:00:32.189> part<00:00:32.460> yet<00:00:32.910> we're<00:00:33.329> just<00:00:33.540> going<00:00:33.660> to

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
transmitter part yet we're just going to

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.420 
transmitter part yet we're just going to
look<00:00:33.840> at<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.050> microphone<00:00:34.530> preamp<00:00:34.950> which<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.399> a

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
look at the microphone preamp which is a

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.910 
look at the microphone preamp which is a
really<00:00:35.760> Universal<00:00:36.750> module<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.530> can<00:00:37.710> use

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
really Universal module that you can use

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.790 
really Universal module that you can use
for<00:00:38.250> all<00:00:39.120> kinds<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.600> stuff<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.840> require<00:00:40.350> a

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
for all kinds of stuff that require a

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.209 
for all kinds of stuff that require a
microphone<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.870> circuit<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.320> draw<00:00:43.829> behind

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
microphone so the circuit is draw behind

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.940 
microphone so the circuit is draw behind
me<00:00:44.430> here<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.719> did<00:00:46.170> everything<00:00:46.440> from<00:00:46.680> 9

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
me here and I did everything from 9

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.000 
me here and I did everything from 9
volts<00:00:47.430> but<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:47.969> circuit<00:00:48.420> works<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.110> pretty

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
volts but this circuit works in a pretty

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.760 
volts but this circuit works in a pretty
large<00:00:50.309> voltage<00:00:50.820> range<00:00:51.120> all<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.899> way<00:00:51.989> from<00:00:52.289> 5

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
large voltage range all the way from 5

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.790 
large voltage range all the way from 5
volts<00:00:53.250> at<00:00:53.370> least<00:00:53.699> up<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.420> 12<00:00:54.809> volts<00:00:55.140> no<00:00:55.320> problem

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
volts at least up to 12 volts no problem

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.770 
volts at least up to 12 volts no problem
so<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.670> first<00:00:56.879> thing<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.149> did<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.360> put<00:00:57.750> a

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
so the first thing I did I put a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.220 
so the first thing I did I put a
humongous<00:00:58.530> 220<00:00:59.399> micro<00:01:00.059> farad<00:01:00.449> capacitor<00:01:00.480> in

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
humongous 220 micro farad capacitor in

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.110 
humongous 220 micro farad capacitor in
here<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.129> stabilize<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.760> voltage<00:01:03.090> a

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
here just to stabilize the voltage a

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.850 
here just to stabilize the voltage a
little<00:01:03.420> bit<00:01:03.600> especially<00:01:04.290> if<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:04.619> a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
little bit especially if you have a

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.219 
little bit especially if you have a
9-volt<00:01:05.339> batteries<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.060> these<00:01:06.180> cheap<00:01:06.780> leads

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
9-volt batteries and these cheap leads

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.429 
9-volt batteries and these cheap leads
you<00:01:08.010> know<00:01:08.130> they<00:01:08.340> they<00:01:09.020> really<00:01:10.020> have<00:01:10.170> quite<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
you know they they really have quite a

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.109 
you know they they really have quite a
bit<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.740> resistance<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.430> inductance<00:01:11.610> of

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
bit of resistance and inductance of

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.740 
bit of resistance and inductance of
course<00:01:12.390> if<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:13.020> any<00:01:14.390> any<00:01:15.390> kind<00:01:15.659> of

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
course if you have any any kind of

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.620 
course if you have any any kind of
variation<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.860> voltage<00:01:17.250> draw<00:01:17.549> like<00:01:18.330> here

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
variation and the voltage draw like here

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.940 
variation and the voltage draw like here
in<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.810> amplifier<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.590> notice<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
in this amplifier you notice the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.710 
in this amplifier you notice the
amplitude<00:01:20.040> goes<00:01:20.610> up<00:01:20.820> your<00:01:21.030> current<00:01:21.270> draw<00:01:21.509> goes

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
amplitude goes up your current draw goes

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.690 
amplitude goes up your current draw goes
up<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.290> on<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:23.130> really<00:01:23.369> want<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.580> make

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
up and so on you really want to make

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.880 
up and so on you really want to make
sure<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.909> get<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> stable<00:01:24.509> voltage<00:01:24.630> supply<00:01:25.200> so

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
sure you get a stable voltage supply so

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.070 
sure you get a stable voltage supply so
next<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.450> an<00:01:27.540> electrolytic

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
next on this is an electrolytic

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.679 
next on this is an electrolytic
microphone<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.890> I'm<00:01:28.979> using<00:01:29.189> here<00:01:29.610> or<00:01:30.420> guess

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
microphone that I'm using here or guess

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.800 
microphone that I'm using here or guess
Americans<00:01:31.170> call<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.380> condenser<00:01:31.950> mic<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.810> this

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
Americans call it condenser mic and this

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.080 
Americans call it condenser mic and this
10k<00:01:34.259> resistor<00:01:34.829> right<00:01:35.040> here<00:01:35.369> provides<00:01:35.909> a

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
10k resistor right here provides a

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.969 
10k resistor right here provides a
little<00:01:36.240> bit<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.450> electricity<00:01:37.110> for<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.710> cause

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
little bit of electricity for it cause

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.800 
little bit of electricity for it cause
the<00:01:38.280> way<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.579> works<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.119> does<00:01:39.390> need<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:40.189> supply

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
the way this works it does need a supply

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.690 
the way this works it does need a supply
if<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.049> use<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> dynamic<00:01:43.590> microphone<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.520> can

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
if you use a dynamic microphone you can

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.460 
if you use a dynamic microphone you can
still<00:01:44.909> use<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.360> preamp<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.290> want<00:01:46.439> to

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
still use this preamp but you want to

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.789 
still use this preamp but you want to
leave<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:47.009> 10k<00:01:47.610> resistor<00:01:48.420> out<00:01:48.649> then<00:01:49.649> we're

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
leave this 10k resistor out then we're

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.580 
leave this 10k resistor out then we're
coupling<00:01:50.220> where<00:01:50.729> AC<00:01:50.970> coupling<00:01:51.540> our<00:01:51.780> audio

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
coupling where AC coupling our audio

a<00:02:01.320> little<00:02:01.439> bit<00:02:01.590> larger<00:02:02.130> but<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.369> really<00:02:02.670> was

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
a little bit larger but I really was

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.120 
a little bit larger but I really was
just<00:02:02.880> interested<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:03.630> voice<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.350> since<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:04.979> was

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
just interested in voice and since I was

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.310 
just interested in voice and since I was
going<00:02:05.340> into<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.729> double<00:02:06.360> sideband<00:02:06.570> transmitter

going into a double sideband transmitter

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.249 
going into a double sideband transmitter
afterwards<00:02:07.860> anyway<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.940> really<00:02:09.720> didn't<00:02:10.050> worry

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
afterwards anyway I really didn't worry

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.680 
afterwards anyway I really didn't worry
all<00:02:10.440> too<00:02:10.649> much<00:02:10.830> about<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:12.000> frequency

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
all too much about the the frequency

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.640 
all too much about the the frequency
response<00:02:12.840> causes

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
response causes

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
response causes
and<00:02:13.709> I<00:02:13.799> sound<00:02:14.069> funny<00:02:14.730> anyway<00:02:15.659> so<00:02:16.340> here<00:02:17.340> we<00:02:17.519> have

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
and I sound funny anyway so here we have

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.750 
and I sound funny anyway so here we have

because<00:02:32.670> pretty<00:02:33.090> much<00:02:33.299> any<00:02:33.599> type<00:02:33.930> works

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
because pretty much any type works

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.940 
because pretty much any type works
I<00:02:34.950> used<00:02:35.609> ABC<00:02:36.450> 548<00:02:37.609> but<00:02:38.609> any<00:02:38.819> like<00:02:39.150> 2<00:02:39.420> &amp;<00:02:39.599> 3<00:02:39.750> 904<00:02:40.500> or

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
I used ABC 548 but any like 2 &amp; 3 904 or

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.830

transistor<00:02:46.409> works<00:02:46.560> for<00:02:46.799> this<00:02:46.889> just<00:02:47.159> fine<00:02:47.690> so

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
transistor works for this just fine so

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.899 
transistor works for this just fine so
that's<00:02:49.019> really<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.799> we're<00:02:50.280> coupling<00:02:50.730> out

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
that's really it and we're coupling out

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.940 
that's really it and we're coupling out
our<00:02:51.209> amplified<00:02:52.079> signal<00:02:52.349> here<00:02:52.650> from<00:02:52.859> the

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
can see as I'm talking the waves start

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.780 
can see as I'm talking the waves start
moving<00:04:45.780> and<00:04:46.050> if<00:04:46.290> I<00:04:46.470> move<00:04:46.860> my<00:04:47.070> finger<00:04:47.430> over<00:04:47.580> the

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
moving and if I move my finger over the

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.190 
moving and if I move my finger over the
microphone<00:04:48.300> you<00:04:48.540> will<00:04:48.570> see<00:04:48.810> even<00:04:49.020> bigger

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
microphone you will see even bigger

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.130 
microphone you will see even bigger
spikes<00:04:49.650> as<00:04:50.490> far<00:04:50.940> as<00:04:51.090> the<00:04:51.240> voltage<00:04:51.480> level<00:04:51.990> that

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
spikes as far as the voltage level that

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.620 
spikes as far as the voltage level that
we<00:04:52.260> have<00:04:52.440> out<00:04:52.770> is<00:04:53.070> concerned<00:04:53.580> we<00:04:53.910> have<00:04:53.940> 200

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
we have out is concerned we have 200

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.690 
we have out is concerned we have 200
millivolts<00:04:55.140> per<00:04:55.350> division<00:04:55.530> you<00:04:56.160> can<00:04:56.190> see<00:04:56.580> it's

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
millivolts per division you can see it's

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.510 
millivolts per division you can see it's
at<00:04:56.850> least<00:04:57.240> in<00:04:57.510> a<00:04:57.690> 400<00:04:58.410> millivolt<00:04:58.860> range<00:04:58.950> and

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
at least in a 400 millivolt range and

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.909 
at least in a 400 millivolt range and
I'm<00:04:59.610> talking<00:05:00.030> from<00:05:00.120> quite<00:05:00.419> a<00:05:00.450> distance<00:05:00.930> as<00:05:01.590> is

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
I'm talking from quite a distance as is

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.100 
I'm talking from quite a distance as is
probably<00:05:02.190> a<00:05:02.430> good<00:05:02.669> meter<00:05:02.970> or<00:05:03.270> about<00:05:03.780> three

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
probably a good meter or about three

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.800 
probably a good meter or about three
feet<00:05:04.350> away<00:05:04.560> from<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:05.040> microphone<00:05:05.480> if<00:05:06.480> I<00:05:06.660> get

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
feet away from the microphone if I get

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.170 
feet away from the microphone if I get
closer<00:05:07.169> as<00:05:07.620> you<00:05:08.160> can<00:05:08.310> see<00:05:08.520> it<00:05:08.640> gets<00:05:08.910> a<00:05:09.030> whole

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
closer as you can see it gets a whole

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.620 
closer as you can see it gets a whole
lot<00:05:09.210> bigger<00:05:09.540> real<00:05:09.900> fast<00:05:10.550> mmm<00:05:11.640> but<00:05:11.850> anyway

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
lot bigger real fast mmm but anyway

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.659 
lot bigger real fast mmm but anyway
that's<00:05:12.900> this<00:05:13.320> little<00:05:13.620> microphone<00:05:13.950> amplifier

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669

circuit<00:05:15.210> and<00:05:15.450> like<00:05:16.020> I<00:05:16.110> said<00:05:16.290> this<00:05:16.410> is<00:05:16.560> just

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
circuit and like I said this is just

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.240 
circuit and like I said this is just
going<00:05:16.950> to<00:05:17.040> be<00:05:17.250> the<00:05:18.350> the<00:05:19.350> first<00:05:19.590> circuit<00:05:20.100> that's

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
going to be the the first circuit that's

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.280 
going to be the the first circuit that's
going<00:05:20.400> to<00:05:20.460> be<00:05:20.550> part<00:05:20.850> of<00:05:21.000> our<00:05:21.180> DSP<00:05:21.750> transmitter

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.130 
transceiver and one interesting thing
about<00:05:52.410> this<00:05:52.770> is<00:05:52.830> that<00:05:53.070> these<00:05:53.700> these<00:05:54.570> LEDs

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
about this is that these these LEDs

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.940 
about this is that these these LEDs
right<00:05:55.410> here<00:05:55.650> are<00:05:55.860> actually<00:05:56.190> used<00:05:56.550> as<00:05:57.950> voltage

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
right here are actually used as voltage

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.150 
right here are actually used as voltage
dependent<00:05:59.720> capacitors<00:06:00.720> and<00:06:01.110> instead<00:06:02.100> of

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
dependent capacitors and instead of

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.480 
dependent capacitors and instead of
using<00:06:02.610> actual<00:06:03.560> capacitance<00:06:04.560> diodes<00:06:04.979> for<00:06:05.250> that

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
using actual capacitance diodes for that

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.000 
using actual capacitance diodes for that
and<00:06:05.960> it<00:06:06.960> works<00:06:07.169> very<00:06:07.320> well<00:06:07.440> but<00:06:07.770> we're<00:06:07.919> going

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
and it works very well but we're going

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.030 
and it works very well but we're going
to<00:06:08.070> talk<00:06:08.310> about<00:06:08.640> that<00:06:08.910> in<00:06:09.240> another<00:06:09.660> video

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.040 
to talk about that in another video

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.140 
to talk about that in another video
anyway<00:06:11.040> so<00:06:11.100> if<00:06:11.340> you<00:06:11.460> need<00:06:11.610> a<00:06:11.640> microphone

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
anyway so if you need a microphone

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.750 
anyway so if you need a microphone
preamplifier<00:06:12.630> here's<00:06:13.380> a<00:06:13.470> easy<00:06:13.620> circuit<00:06:14.550> that

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
preamplifier here's a easy circuit that

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.570 
preamplifier here's a easy circuit that
fits<00:06:15.030> in<00:06:15.180> the<00:06:15.270> category<00:06:15.780> of<00:06:15.960> easy<00:06:16.680> circuits<00:06:17.370> to

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
fits in the category of easy circuits to

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.490 
fits in the category of easy circuits to
build<00:06:17.820> it<00:06:17.970> an<00:06:18.060> hour<00:06:18.240> or<00:06:18.479> less<00:06:18.630> for<00:06:18.990> our<00:06:19.080> circuit

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
build it an hour or less for our circuit

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.860 
build it an hour or less for our circuit
Friday<00:06:19.850> sorry<00:06:20.850> it's<00:06:21.060> on<00:06:21.150> a<00:06:21.180> Saturday<00:06:21.390> today

but<00:06:22.410> things<00:06:23.340> happen<00:06:23.820> so<00:06:24.270> anyway<00:06:24.840> if<00:06:25.020> you<00:06:25.140> liked

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
but things happen so anyway if you liked

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.320 
but things happen so anyway if you liked
it<00:06:25.530> give<00:06:25.650> it<00:06:25.770> a<00:06:25.830> big<00:06:25.979> thumbs<00:06:26.250> up<00:06:26.490> and<00:06:26.729> make<00:06:27.150> sure

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
it give it a big thumbs up and make sure

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.630 
it give it a big thumbs up and make sure
you<00:06:27.419> share<00:06:27.690> it<00:06:27.750> and<00:06:28.110> if<00:06:28.830> you<00:06:28.979> would<00:06:29.130> like<00:06:29.340> the

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:29.640 
you share it and if you would like the

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.659 
you share it and if you would like the
schematics<00:06:30.510> for<00:06:31.020> this<00:06:31.290> circuit<00:06:31.770> I<00:06:32.130> hope<00:06:32.490> it's

enough<00:06:32.820> to<00:06:33.030> put<00:06:33.330> them<00:06:33.450> in<00:06:33.570> the<00:06:33.660> video<00:06:33.810> but<00:06:34.260> if

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
enough to put them in the video but if

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.779 
enough to put them in the video but if
you<00:06:34.410> want<00:06:34.680> me<00:06:34.770> to<00:06:34.800> draw<00:06:35.099> them<00:06:35.310> out<00:06:35.460> just

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:35.789 
you want me to draw them out just
