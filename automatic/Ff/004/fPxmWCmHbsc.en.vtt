00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.530 

so<00:00:01.740> a<00:00:01.770> while<00:00:02.040> back<00:00:02.070> I<00:00:02.310> wanted<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.060> make<00:00:03.210> up<00:00:03.240> some

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
so a while back I wanted to make up some

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.720 
so a while back I wanted to make up some
engine<00:00:03.899> mounts<00:00:04.200> for<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.560> sand<00:00:04.950> rail<00:00:05.190> project

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
engine mounts for the sand rail project

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.150 
engine mounts for the sand rail project
that<00:00:06.359> kind<00:00:06.569> of<00:00:06.720> looked<00:00:06.870> like<00:00:07.020> this<00:00:07.230> this<00:00:07.950> one<00:00:08.130> I

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
that kind of looked like this this one I

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.070 
that kind of looked like this this one I
actually<00:00:08.400> cut<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.790> bit<00:00:09.090> short<00:00:09.389> so<00:00:09.450> I<00:00:09.690> have<00:00:09.929> it

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
actually cut a bit short so I have it

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.280 
actually cut a bit short so I have it
here<00:00:10.260> for<00:00:10.530> your<00:00:10.679> viewing<00:00:11.340> pleasure<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:12.290> I'll

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
here for your viewing pleasure and I'll

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.450 
here for your viewing pleasure and I'll
show<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.740> finished<00:00:13.860> ones<00:00:14.219> on<00:00:14.370> the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
show you the finished ones on the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.150 
show you the finished ones on the
machine<00:00:14.759> later<00:00:14.940> but<00:00:15.780> I've<00:00:16.470> got<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> tubing

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
machine later but I've got a tubing

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.960 
machine later but I've got a tubing
notcher<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.720> wanted<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.109> cut<00:00:19.439> angle<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.609> I'm

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
notcher and I wanted to cut angle so I'm

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.700 
notcher and I wanted to cut angle so I'm
thinking<00:00:21.420> well<00:00:21.570> that's<00:00:21.960> what<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.260> got<00:00:22.500> that's

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
thinking well that's what I got that's

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.250 
thinking well that's what I got that's
what<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:22.949> was<00:00:23.130> going<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.310> try<00:00:23.779> so<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.109> what

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
what I was going to try so this is what

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.320 
what I was going to try so this is what
I<00:00:25.289> ended<00:00:25.410> up<00:00:25.650> doing<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:26.099> managed<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.730> get<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.240> in

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
I ended up doing I managed to get it in

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.230 
I ended up doing I managed to get it in
there<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:28.260> as<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:28.890> guys<00:00:29.130> can<00:00:29.369> see<00:00:29.429> it's<00:00:29.760> made

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
there and as you guys can see it's made

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.110 
there and as you guys can see it's made
for<00:00:30.449> cutting<00:00:30.630> round<00:00:31.529> tube<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.489> know<00:00:32.610> not<00:00:32.850> this

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
for cutting round tube you know not this

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.639 
for cutting round tube you know not this
angle<00:00:33.719> because<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.200> know<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.380> can't

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
angle because you know you can't

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.040 
angle because you know you can't
properly<00:00:34.920> retain<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.000> in<00:00:36.180> there<00:00:36.360> but<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.899> gave

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
properly retain this in there but I gave

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.220 
properly retain this in there but I gave
it<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.230> try<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.739> managed<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.660> hobble<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.020> there

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
it a try I managed to hobble it in there

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.889 
it a try I managed to hobble it in there
enough<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.800> clamp<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.190> tight<00:00:41.370> enough<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:42.329> I

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
enough and clamp it tight enough that I

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.979 
enough and clamp it tight enough that I
was<00:00:43.710> able<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.340> cut<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.789> notch<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.719> I'll<00:00:45.840> show

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
was able to cut that notch so I'll show

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.510 
was able to cut that notch so I'll show
you<00:00:46.050> what<00:00:46.260> they<00:00:46.379> look<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.160> machine

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
you what they look like in the machine

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.660 
you what they look like in the machine
and<00:00:48.500> you<00:00:49.500> can<00:00:49.649> see<00:00:49.829> how<00:00:49.950> they<00:00:50.100> fit<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> frame

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
and you can see how they fit the frame

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.420 
and you can see how they fit the frame
rail<00:00:50.940> there<00:00:51.530> it<00:00:52.530> took<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> bit<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:52.949> work<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.160> get

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
rail there it took a bit of work to get

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.369 
rail there it took a bit of work to get
that<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.760> fit<00:00:53.969> nice<00:00:54.800> but<00:00:56.960> kind<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.020> worked<00:00:58.199> out

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
that to fit nice but kind of worked out

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.500 
that to fit nice but kind of worked out
so<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.430> engine<00:00:59.730> mount<00:00:59.910> that's

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
so this is the engine mount that's

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.660 
so this is the engine mount that's
removed<00:01:00.899> here<00:01:01.140> from<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.440> side<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:02.340> can<00:01:02.489> see

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
removed here from this side you can see

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.329 
removed here from this side you can see
how<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:02.850> fits<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.390> there<00:01:03.979> so<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.010> made<00:01:05.189> those

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
how that fits in there so I made those

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.240 
how that fits in there so I made those
engine<00:01:05.729> mounts<00:01:06.030> removable<00:01:06.659> because<00:01:07.250> they're

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
engine mounts removable because they're

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.590 
engine mounts removable because they're
kind<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> way<00:01:09.000> for<00:01:09.299> getting<00:01:09.390> that

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
kind of in the way for getting that

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.289 
kind of in the way for getting that
engine<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.830> out<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.070> machine<00:01:11.299> so

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
engine in and out of the machine so

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.960 
engine in and out of the machine so
here's<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.659> box<00:01:12.869> I'd<00:01:13.490> get<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> look<00:01:14.760> at<00:01:14.850> how

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
here's the box I'd get a look at how

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.780 
here's the box I'd get a look at how
that<00:01:15.180> fits<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:16.439> looking<00:01:16.890> at<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.159> engine<00:01:17.610> from

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
that fits so looking at the engine from

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.510 
that fits so looking at the engine from
the<00:01:17.820> bottom<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.720> factory<00:01:19.259> header

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
the bottom this is that factory header

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.550 
the bottom this is that factory header
so<00:01:20.520> quite<00:01:21.180> some<00:01:21.479> time<00:01:21.689> ago<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.990> actually<00:01:22.229> cut

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
so quite some time ago I actually cut

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.039 
so quite some time ago I actually cut
this<00:01:22.740> thing<00:01:22.920> off<00:01:23.070> short<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.810> now<00:01:24.810> I'm<00:01:24.900> getting

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
this thing off short and now I'm getting

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.320 
this thing off short and now I'm getting
around<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.610> getting<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.790> sorted<00:01:27.180> back

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
around to getting it sorted back

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.840 
around to getting it sorted back
together<00:01:27.619> so<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.650> welded<00:01:28.920> some<00:01:29.189> flanges<00:01:29.670> up

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
together so I welded some flanges up

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.940 
together so I welded some flanges up
there<00:01:30.060> now<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.229> other<00:01:31.350> video<00:01:31.740> they're

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
there now so in the other video they're

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.219 
there now so in the other video they're
called<00:01:32.280> laser<00:01:32.640> parts<00:01:33.150> template<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.840> showed<00:01:34.079> you

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
called laser parts template I showed you

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.249 
called laser parts template I showed you
guys<00:01:34.259> how<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.619> designed<00:01:35.100> those<00:01:35.280> flanges<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.259> so

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
guys how I designed those flanges and so

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.840 
guys how I designed those flanges and so
I<00:01:37.320> want<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.560> get<00:01:37.650> going<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.189> exhaust<00:01:38.490> here

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
I want to get going on the exhaust here

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.050 
I want to get going on the exhaust here
in<00:01:39.170> a<00:01:40.170> few<00:01:40.710> videos<00:01:40.829> down<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.340> road<00:01:41.520> here<00:01:41.729> or<00:01:41.850> so

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
in a few videos down the road here or so

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.690 
in a few videos down the road here or so
and<00:01:42.329> also<00:01:43.320> been<00:01:43.590> working<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:44.360> engine<00:01:45.360> mounts

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
and also been working on engine mounts

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.370 
and also been working on engine mounts
so<00:01:47.700> right<00:01:47.939> in<00:01:48.090> here<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.390> can<00:01:48.689> see<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.049> engine

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
so right in here you can see the engine

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.030 
so right in here you can see the engine
mount<00:01:49.590> for<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.040> right<00:01:50.310> side<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.909> cylinder

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
mount for the right side of the cylinder

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.539 
mount for the right side of the cylinder
so<00:01:53.040> they<00:01:53.520> are<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:54.290> aluminum<00:01:55.290> spacers<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.490> do

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
so they are on aluminum spacers and I do

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.910 
so they are on aluminum spacers and I do
that<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.299> when<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.479> disassemble<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
that so that when I disassemble it the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.270 
that so that when I disassemble it the
engine<00:01:59.340> has<00:01:59.520> room

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
engine has room

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:16.130 
engine has room
maneuver<00:02:00.820> its<00:02:00.940> way<00:02:01.120> out<00:02:01.300> of<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.480> engine<00:02:01.780> bay<00:02:01.930> a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.510 

while<00:02:17.140> back<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:17.620> was<00:02:17.709> showing<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.040> guys<00:02:18.250> on

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
while back I was showing you guys on

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.930 
while back I was showing you guys on
this<00:02:18.670> gearbox<00:02:19.240> that<00:02:19.570> if<00:02:20.320> I<00:02:20.500> use<00:02:20.770> that<00:02:21.070> 15<00:02:21.610> tooth

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
this gearbox that if I use that 15 tooth

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.390 
this gearbox that if I use that 15 tooth
sprocket<00:02:22.870> on<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.530> right<00:02:23.709> side<00:02:23.980> here<00:02:24.310> it

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
sprocket on the right side here it

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.680 
sprocket on the right side here it
wouldn't<00:02:24.610> have<00:02:24.760> enough<00:02:24.970> room<00:02:25.150> for<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.420> chain

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
wouldn't have enough room for the chain

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.340 
wouldn't have enough room for the chain
so<00:02:26.560> this<00:02:26.980> is<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.310> 16<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:30.959> thinking<00:02:31.959> it's<00:02:32.140> got

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
so this is the 16 to thinking it's got

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.250 
so this is the 16 to thinking it's got
at<00:02:32.590> least<00:02:32.950> probably<00:02:33.940> better<00:02:34.270> than<00:02:34.450> 1/16<00:02:35.020> of<00:02:35.140> an

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
at least probably better than 1/16 of an

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.410 
at least probably better than 1/16 of an
inch<00:02:35.380> for<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.489> chain<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:36.760> bottom<00:02:37.270> out<00:02:37.390> on

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
inch for that chain to bottom out on

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.330 
inch for that chain to bottom out on
that<00:02:37.660> collar<00:02:37.959> there<00:02:38.290> so<00:02:38.950> I'm<00:02:39.010> going<00:02:39.130> to<00:02:39.190> try

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
that collar there so I'm going to try

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.170 
that collar there so I'm going to try
that<00:02:39.400> one<00:02:41.040> here<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.190> can<00:02:42.250> kind<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.640> see<00:02:42.880> about

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
that one here you can kind of see about

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.910 
that one here you can kind of see about
how<00:02:43.360> that<00:02:43.420> transmission<00:02:44.290> would<00:02:44.380> sit<00:02:44.650> in<00:02:44.800> the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
how that transmission would sit in the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.180 
how that transmission would sit in the
frame<00:02:45.360> sitting<00:02:46.360> on<00:02:46.480> blocks<00:02:46.750> there<00:02:47.110> so<00:02:48.010> it<00:02:48.130> was

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
frame sitting on blocks there so it was

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.800 
frame sitting on blocks there so it was
kind<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.550> project<00:02:49.030> I<00:02:49.120> had<00:02:49.239> planned<00:02:49.540> for<00:02:49.690> this

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
kind of a project I had planned for this

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.020 
kind of a project I had planned for this
weekend<00:02:50.260> see<00:02:51.040> if<00:02:51.130> I<00:02:51.220> can<00:02:51.400> get<00:02:51.550> somewhere<00:02:51.910> on

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
weekend see if I can get somewhere on

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.960 
weekend see if I can get somewhere on
those<00:02:52.209> transmission<00:02:53.020> mounts<00:02:53.350> and<00:02:53.760> I'm<00:02:54.760> going

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
those transmission mounts and I'm going

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.880 
those transmission mounts and I'm going
to<00:02:55.000> have<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.300> get<00:02:55.450> this<00:02:55.630> thing<00:02:55.840> lined<00:02:56.410> up<00:02:56.620> real

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
to have to get this thing lined up real

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.740 
to have to get this thing lined up real
nice<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:57.370> pretty<00:02:57.580> with<00:02:57.820> that<00:02:57.850> sprocket<00:02:58.600> from

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
nice and pretty with that sprocket from

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.560 
nice and pretty with that sprocket from
the<00:02:58.870> engine<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.910> get<00:03:00.910> that<00:03:01.090> transmission

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
the engine and get that transmission

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.780 
the engine and get that transmission
secured<00:03:02.080> nicely<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:02.680> then<00:03:02.830> I<00:03:03.070> want<00:03:03.610> to<00:03:03.700> get
