00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
dart we're going to need our pins I'm

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.860 
dart we're going to need our pins I'm
going<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.410> use<00:00:13.650> an<00:00:13.860> error<00:00:14.160> raisable<00:00:14.639> pan<00:00:15.030> you

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
going to use an error raisable pan you

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.910 
going to use an error raisable pan you
could<00:00:16.049> also<00:00:16.199> use<00:00:16.470> tailors<00:00:16.890> chalk<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:18.300> ruler

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
could also use tailors chalk and a ruler

so I've marked already the dark through
the<00:00:22.230> fabric<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.460> I've<00:00:23.789> got<00:00:23.970> my<00:00:24.119> notches<00:00:24.570> at<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
the fabric so I've got my notches at the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.589 
the fabric so I've got my notches at the
edge<00:00:25.400> marking<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.519> edge<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> dart<00:00:27.180> and

the<00:00:28.080> point<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.619> dart<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:29.220> marked<00:00:29.550> with<00:00:29.760> a

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
the point of the dart I marked with a

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.170 
the point of the dart I marked with a
pen<00:00:30.090> through<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.080> pattern<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.710> then<00:00:32.700> used<00:00:33.059> a

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
pen through the pattern and then used a

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.549 
pen through the pattern and then used a
pin<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.660> get<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.020> through<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.469> other

I've got a good stitch guideline and
it's<00:01:11.700> important<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.240> pull<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> pins<00:01:12.900> out<00:01:13.080> if

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
it's important to pull the pins out if

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.420 
it's important to pull the pins out if
they're<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> way<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.040> can<00:01:14.159> get<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
they're in the way so you can get the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.210 
they're in the way so you can get the
ruler<00:01:14.700> nice<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.150> flat<00:01:15.330> when<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.170> lift<00:01:17.009> off

moving<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> fabric<00:01:19.350> at<00:01:19.470> all<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.890> you'll<00:01:20.340> need

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
moving the fabric at all and you'll need

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.789 
moving the fabric at all and you'll need
to<00:01:20.580> pop<00:01:20.790> some<00:01:21.030> more<00:01:21.180> pins<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.750> there<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.590> to

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
to pop some more pins in there just to

hold your dart in place okay we're going
to<00:01:25.920> start<00:01:26.340> sewing<00:01:26.759> from<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.390> top<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.840> dart

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
to start sewing from the top of the dart

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.249 
to start sewing from the top of the dart
from<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.530> edge<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.270> fabric<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.540> we'll<00:01:31.079> do

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
from the edge of the fabric and we'll do

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.620 
from the edge of the fabric and we'll do
our<00:01:31.409> normal<00:01:31.590> reverse<00:01:32.159> stitch<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:33.390> we're<00:01:33.540> going

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
our normal reverse stitch so we're going

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.319 
our normal reverse stitch so we're going
to<00:01:33.689> go<00:01:33.840> forwards<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:35.009> backwards<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.850> then

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.740 
through there as you get to them take
the<00:01:48.600> pins<00:01:48.840> out<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:50.030> then<00:01:51.030> when<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.390> get<00:01:51.540> to

we<00:02:07.469> don't<00:02:07.740> reverse<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.849> reason<00:02:09.179> why<00:02:09.269> we

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
we don't reverse and the reason why we

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.029 
we don't reverse and the reason why we
don't<00:02:09.539> reverse<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.110> because<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.560> can<00:02:10.679> make<00:02:10.860> it

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
don't reverse is because it can make it

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.040 
don't reverse is because it can make it
bulky<00:02:11.489> at<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.730> point<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.720> want<00:02:12.900> that

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.930 
bulky at that point and you want that
point<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.440> be<00:02:13.560> really<00:02:14.099> fine<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.760> just

point to be really fine so it just

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.750
