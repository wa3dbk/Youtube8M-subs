 In recent years, flat roof tiles have become dominant in the market, which have become popular and fashionable tiles. 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.000
 If we can talk about a certain roof architecture, on which flat roof tiles work.

 These rectangular roof tiles are often designed for modern roofs, 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 for simple forms, for gable roofs with a small number of dormer types. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:02.400

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.000
 There is no dependence in the carp rod. 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.000

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 Across Poland, carpels are also found with dark colors, very unusual, shiny, imported to a special order.

 This is a flat tile. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Flat concrete roof tiles are also Tegalit, which is slightly larger than Teviva, but also Reviva, or a tile roof tile. 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 On one roof tile we have two tears. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 Among ceramic tiles, flat roof tiles are primarily Tourmaline, which is similar in form. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000

 The classic flat ceramic tile is a carp rod that is constantly popular. 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 A flat tile that returns in a huge style opens many possibilities both for the existing and existing architecture. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 The creators of the BRAAS brand with varied forms and varied colors of flat tiles 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 they provide many reasons to look much wider to the roof cover than before. 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 A simple geometric tile on a modernist building or a minimalist tile on an older house, 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 ... or maybe a traditional carp rod combined with modern architecture. 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 The combinations are many and the effect is different and unique each time. 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.300
 Among the flat roof tiles, there are both those referring to the tradition and the classical roofing style 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 ... as well as those with a very modern, ascetic character. 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 What connects all models of flat tiles is a harmonious, calm form that gives the building elegance. 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 Each model of a flat tile, whether in combination with modern or older architecture, will give the building a new, individual character. 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Modern technology goes hand in hand with contemporary design.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 which reflect up to 300% more infrared radiation than ordinary concrete and ceramic roof tiles. 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 Thanks to this, the temperature on the underside of tiles is even 10 degrees lower. 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 This has a significant effect on reducing the heating of the entire roof.
