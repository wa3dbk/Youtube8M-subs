 hello everyone in this tutorial les 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.390
 I will teach to install the simple native 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:23.029
 trainer 6.4 for gta 4 and gta 4 episodes 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.490
 from liberty city had already made 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.140
 this tutorial earlier but what 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.480
 I do again because some do not 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.330
 it works surely because of the lack of a 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.390
 file that he does not have 6.4 trainer 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.280
 has once downloaded go to access 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.230
 direct gta 4 right click 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.140
 properties and click open 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.360
 location already having the folder open 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.280
 where they have installed their game looking 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.399
 where they downloaded the simple native 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.910
 6.4 trainer decompress it and open the 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.220
 binder 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.730
 will see on my left the folder of 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.710
 6.4 trainer surely you will see 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.900
 that I have a file that you do not 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.950
 they will get the file called the zone 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.950
 point of l l 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.370
 remember that this trainer serves for the 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.260
 most versions of gta 4 and 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.260
 also for episodes from liberty city 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.120
 this file I had to remove it from 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.670
 6.3 trainer to place it in 6.4 and 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.830
 so I can make it work in gta 4 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.440
 in the case that you already have it in 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.570
 the folder where your gta 4 is installed 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.930
 it is not necessary to get this 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.930
 archive 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.570
 Y 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.180
 to install it, just copy all 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.369
 the files in the trainer folder 6.4 to 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.369
 the folder where your gta is installed 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.920

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.920
 try the trainer 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.330
 once in the game activate the trainer 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.330

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.349

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.349

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.590
