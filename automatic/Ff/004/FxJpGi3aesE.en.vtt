00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.730
 I can not leave my fringe sitting 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:14.070
 when I had one more coming out of the oven 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.080
 and on today's show I'll tell you everything 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.060
 whats in my bag 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.490
 whenever I travel I prefer to carry a bag 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.900
 well great that it fell in most 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.850
 things I'm going to take of course it takes 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.680
 also a handbag and I'll do it 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.660
 a video for you too about what I 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.699
 I carry my handbag but in my 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.260
 bag leaves all things that are more 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.480
 essential and that I need them 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.520
 more at hand all the time then 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.520
 I'll tell you what's inside today. 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.739
 of your bag that is very chubby is almost 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.210
 the size of my head is not good 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.340
 her bag and it reminds me a lot until 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.289
 necessary lines as soon as the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.800
 people took when they were younger 16 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.300
 remembered 2007 and era were bigger so 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.550
 everything but I like it reminds me a lot 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.230
 so she looks like a caixotinho so I 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.030
 I really like it because it's enough stuff. 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.829
 inside her now before talking about 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.410
 bag I talk about what's inside. 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.409
 it's two compartments in the first 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.850
 compartment I have a miniseries is 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.619
 clear that it also takes a necessary 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.409
 even more so when the trip has 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.330
 more hours for his 12-hour grandfather 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.040
 example is a slightly larger one needed 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.080
 in my handbag but that's for 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.630
 another video that are needed here 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.549
 basic and what you use 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.070
 always at all times when you 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.869
 You need to be close to you. 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.390
 So inside that girl is sincere I 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.670
 I have a very important dental floss one 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.100
 brush it from here to the plane 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.479
 then any toothbrush is not 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.250
 Toothbrush I'm Gonna Take To 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.079
 to use on a daily basis, it's just that I'm going to take 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.150
 to use 9 or stay closed 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.470
 everything but how do you know if you will 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.420
 plane travel things need 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.220
 why things can not have 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.340
 more than 100 ml to enter the airplane 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.579
 so this is a micro toothpaste 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.750
 two balls to wipe your hand if 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.329
 refresh which face something 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.939
 which has then soiled two units of 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.040
 wipes the handkerchief if you have that 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.420
 olim family with something there 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.640
 on top and I even got drica 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.740
 Thank you, sir. 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.140
 Israel has already used one or two of the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.300
 It hurts a lot of the sun but even so he 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.009

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.420
 hand path this one is a creminho 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.430
 in 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.470
 for dry skins of l'occitane mine 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.390
 skin is not dry but paulo loves this 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.489
 So let's buy this one from here. 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.170
 because I saw he has agony in his hand and everything 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.940
 but then we use this one time 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.590
 whole and this weather is great super 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.390
 yummy to the super hands valley 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.650
 asks this path that even the 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.600
 worry the big one here is 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.640
 My little button every now and then 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.280
 chic of the clinique that's here 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.440
 terminal or that I use most of the 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.450
 here he is very light a little 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.450
 used it looks super cute in the mouth and 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.580
 olÃ­mpi good is that of the clinic too 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.739
 I use several different and everything else then 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.110
 my mouth is not so dry use 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.670
 and if she has very much dried up I 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.110
 I use the one I told you about. 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.549
 of the month of March you can 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.170
 Click here to have a look there 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.330
 in that video that there is also worth 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.980
 too bad you 're around so 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.350
 those were the things that are in my 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.480
 mira needed now playing volume 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.310
 has in the rest of the bag the cell phone 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.380
 I do not think there's anything more important than 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.049
 that your journey then does not 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.819
 forgot at home a hair brush 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.709
 after all i can not leave 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.230
 my little fringe sit tight all over 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.630
 Is she closing a new heir? 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.209
 and if that says here super stream page 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.920
 so cute it opens so I like it 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.359
 enough of it that gets enough currency 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.070
 even more when you travel outside 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.230
 you end up accumulating many 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.180
 coins that everyone draws much more 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.519
 out there then I'm playing here and 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.079
 I always try to use it before leaving the country. 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.609
 because then at least I do not get to 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.650
 that heap of weight later into the 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.720
 my mouth the mobile phone charger one 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.040
 earphone I know that the 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.570
 airplane has that big one but me too 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.310
 I like to take my case I want to hear 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.230
 music on your cell phone or 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.570
 Street will finally arrive in the place so he 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.820
 here's a mint stick this 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.590
 It's over because my trip, too. 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.600
 It's over then I think it's going now 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.489
 although it is always good to have a supposed 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.140
 lines with you cards even more 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.700
 When I go on a business trip, it's 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.440
 good to have a card you want your 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.420
 phone and mail then people can 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.900
 then you have a business card with 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.000
 you 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.769
 two pens a normal black and one 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.329
 mark text I think it's still very important 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.160
 more when I'm reading a magazine that 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.889
 was to mark some important part then 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.170
 has brand made here was in that first 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:16.970
 part of the pocket and now the 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.220
 second part on the other side of the bag 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.080
 this bag to a divider then 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.480
 everything preparadinho you can separate in 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.850
 Sessions I really like 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.350
 on this a good virginiano yahoo 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.960
 I think it's good to have everything ready. 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.840
 then in the second part a pair of 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.150
 sun and if it is a sunglasses and if it is 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.790
 from thierry the wing and I love this glasses 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.880
 I have two of them one black and one half 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.440
 purple so pitched with the drawings such 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.410
 my wallet with my documents 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.940
 money and everything else an agenda yes to 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.340
 my very big I'm still a 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.680
 old-fashioned person who likes them 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.810
 enough to write scratch you know 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.280
 and that finally the passports if I 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.080
 for an international flight is 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.680
 important for them to be with me and now 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.930
 this bag you will use them enough 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.760
 angeles, she's great because I can 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.950
 to put so much into something that neither 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.260
 You saw me here when I'm traveling and then 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.030
 draw and summarize it from here when walking 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.710
 in the city and everything else she can stay 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.020
 but the important thing is that it is 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.360
 great and second, the coolest is that 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.640
 is a color that can be used with several 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.230
 looks my then this fall that turns 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.540
 I really liked this bag It's a 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.460
 That's nice, and it's really cool that 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.740
 you can use it only by holding 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.080
 hand or you can use with that handle 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.340
 bigger and there hangs money donated but there 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.110
 I advise you not to use 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.430
 hanging from the side if I have too much 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.100
 because the disease will stay at 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.840
 half- fallen so it's not so cool and the 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.000
 What I liked the most about this bag is that 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.590
 first compartment she has two 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.570
 compartments but the first 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.390
 compartment she has two pockets 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:49.000
 where I can put mobile pen 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.830
 small things on the other side of the 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.960
 second compartment it has a 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.390
 closed in compartments in a minor 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.400
 closed where I can put document 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.380
 more importantly as a passport 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.510
 example or small things I want 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.310
 save and leave closed then that was it 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.260
 that I had in my travel bag in this 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.730
 I went to her last month and I hope 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.590
 that you have enjoyed if you

 travel bag and what can I have 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.890
 forgotten to put in mine that at 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.960
 Sometimes it's pretty cool also we know that 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:24.700
 something more careful may be that the 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.620
 rest are there in my little 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.000
 hand or not you rest here side will 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.610
