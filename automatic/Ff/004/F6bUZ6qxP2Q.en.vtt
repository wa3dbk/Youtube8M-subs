the<00:04:50.229> droid<00:04:50.530> inside<00:04:51.039> I<00:04:51.340> put<00:04:51.669> it<00:04:52.000> in<00:04:52.199> a<00:04:54.389> trapper

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
the droid inside I put it in a trapper

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.939 
the droid inside I put it in a trapper
the<00:04:57.340> only<00:04:57.699> bad<00:04:57.940> part<00:04:58.000> about<00:04:58.660> this<00:04:59.020> you<00:04:59.320> can't

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
the only bad part about this you can't

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.249 
the only bad part about this you can't
open<00:05:00.310> the<00:05:00.580> cockpit<00:05:00.789> back<00:05:01.360> because<00:05:01.810> of<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.050> gun

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:02.259 
open the cockpit back because of the gun

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:04.439 
open the cockpit back because of the gun
because<00:05:02.949> when<00:05:03.130> we<00:05:03.250> try<00:05:03.460> to<00:05:03.490> open<00:05:03.699> up<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.060> comp

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
because when we try to open up the comp

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.390 
because when we try to open up the comp
pin<00:05:04.720> it<00:05:04.900> hits<00:05:05.080> a<00:05:05.289> gun<00:05:05.470> so<00:05:05.740> you<00:05:05.800> can<00:05:06.099> move<00:05:06.250> it

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
pin it hits a gun so you can move it

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.230 
pin it hits a gun so you can move it
inside

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
inside

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.540 
inside
she<00:05:07.840> put<00:05:08.050> aside<00:05:08.289> to<00:05:08.349> do<00:05:08.800> this<00:05:08.949> side<00:05:09.190> I<00:05:09.220> can't

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
she put aside to do this side I can't

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.320 
she put aside to do this side I can't
get<00:05:09.729> out<00:05:09.880> of<00:05:09.909> there<00:05:10.360> ah<00:05:10.570> ah<00:05:11.530> this<00:05:12.520> could<00:05:12.849> still

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
get out of there ah ah this could still

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.680 
get out of there ah ah this could still
go<00:05:13.659> to<00:05:14.229> 360<00:05:14.979> but<00:05:15.190> yet<00:05:15.490> that<00:05:15.669> raised<00:05:16.030> it<00:05:16.330> over

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
go to 360 but yet that raised it over

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.149 
go to 360 but yet that raised it over
are<00:05:16.960> for<00:05:17.229> those<00:05:17.470> heads

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:18.159 
are for those heads

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:20.210 
are for those heads
now<00:05:18.639> let's<00:05:18.849> take<00:05:19.030> a<00:05:19.060> look<00:05:19.300> at<00:05:19.419> the<00:05:19.539> bottom<00:05:19.750> here

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
now let's take a look at the bottom here

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.499 
now let's take a look at the bottom here
around<00:05:21.220> the<00:05:21.310> bottom<00:05:21.580> then<00:05:21.759> already<00:05:22.090> the<00:05:22.300> air

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:22.509 
around the bottom then already the air

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:25.589 
around the bottom then already the air
put<00:05:22.810> so<00:05:23.349> it<00:05:23.830> can<00:05:24.009> stand<00:05:24.280> up<00:05:24.580> and<00:05:24.820> on<00:05:25.270> the<00:05:25.330> back

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
put so it can stand up and on the back

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:29.010 
put so it can stand up and on the back
there's<00:05:25.900> a<00:05:25.960> storage<00:05:26.320> compartment<00:05:27.070> here<00:05:28.020> we

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
there's a storage compartment here we

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.120 
there's a storage compartment here we
have<00:05:29.199> the<00:05:29.320> holocron<00:05:29.949> crystal<00:05:31.680> if<00:05:32.680> the<00:05:32.889> sour

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
have the holocron crystal if the sour

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.909 
have the holocron crystal if the sour
drugs<00:05:33.610> are<00:05:33.820> the<00:05:33.909> two<00:05:34.150> crystals<00:05:34.750> let's<00:05:35.710> put

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
drugs are the two crystals let's put

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.129 
drugs are the two crystals let's put
this<00:05:36.039> back<00:05:36.250> in<00:05:36.400> their<00:05:36.520> trunk<00:05:36.759> and<00:05:37.030> the<00:05:37.780> engine

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
this back in their trunk and the engine

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.680 
this back in their trunk and the engine
flaps<00:05:38.469> can<00:05:38.740> also<00:05:38.919> open<00:05:39.400> up<00:05:39.520> the<00:05:39.580> tips<00:05:40.360> of<00:05:40.539> the

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
flaps can also open up the tips of the

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.350 
flaps can also open up the tips of the
wings<00:05:40.719> can<00:05:41.139> also<00:05:41.320> move<00:05:41.710> there's<00:05:42.400> a<00:05:42.520> do<00:05:42.759> 60<00:05:43.300> of

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
wings can also move there's a do 60 of

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.360 
wings can also move there's a do 60 of
it

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.910

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:07.779 
up like Sabre crystals and he put them

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:09.779 
up like Sabre crystals and he put them
in<00:06:08.139> to<00:06:08.319> give<00:06:08.469> the<00:06:08.650> lighter<00:06:08.830> with<00:06:09.129> the<00:06:09.249> Java<00:06:09.610> but
