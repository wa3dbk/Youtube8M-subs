00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
for any size of water so we're basically

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:35.330 
for any size of water so we're basically
just<00:01:33.720> feeling<00:01:34.259> around<00:01:34.289> on<00:01:34.709> the<00:01:34.830> back<00:01:35.039> side<00:01:35.310> of

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
just feeling around on the back side of

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.580 
just feeling around on the back side of
the<00:01:35.550> pump<00:01:35.789> a<00:01:36.030> common<00:01:36.509> place<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.020> most

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the pump a common place for most

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.680 
the pump a common place for most
whirlpool<00:01:38.310> direct<00:01:38.700> drive<00:01:38.849> washers<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.509> leak

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
whirlpool direct drive washers to leak

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.990 
whirlpool direct drive washers to leak
is<00:01:40.410> right<00:01:40.770> on<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.039> back<00:01:41.190> side<00:01:41.489> of<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.759> pump

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
is right on the back side of the pump

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.139 
is right on the back side of the pump
the<00:01:42.509> impeller<00:01:42.840> will<00:01:43.110> kind<00:01:43.319> of<00:01:43.410> wear<00:01:43.619> through

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
the impeller will kind of wear through

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.719 
the impeller will kind of wear through
this<00:01:45.149> one<00:01:45.509> usually<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.590> ones<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.860> leak<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
this one usually the ones that leak the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.580 
this one usually the ones that leak the
back<00:01:47.940> up<00:01:48.209> the<00:01:48.479> back<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.869> pump<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.289> really

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
back up the back of the pump is really

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.279 
back up the back of the pump is really
smooth<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:51.000> kind<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.660> little<00:01:51.810> more

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
smooth this kind of is a little more

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.219 
smooth this kind of is a little more
reinforced<00:01:53.190> it's<00:01:53.459> a<00:01:53.550> newer<00:01:53.789> pump<00:01:54.209> so<00:01:55.050> this

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
reinforced it's a newer pump so this

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.010 
reinforced it's a newer pump so this
one's<00:01:55.440> not<00:01:55.590> leaking<00:01:55.920> from<00:01:56.280> there<00:01:56.489> or<00:01:56.789> on<00:01:57.360> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
one's not leaking from there or on the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.570 
one's not leaking from there or on the
center<00:01:58.349> of<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.530> shaft<00:01:58.770> where<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.369> motor

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.359 
center of the shaft where the motor
comes<00:01:59.970> up<00:02:00.179> through<00:02:00.619> sometimes<00:02:01.619> they<00:02:01.979> can<00:02:02.160> leak

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
comes up through sometimes they can leak

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.850 
comes up through sometimes they can leak
they're<00:02:02.989> just<00:02:03.989> kind<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.229> feeling<00:02:04.440> on<00:02:04.679> our

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
they're just kind of feeling on our

the dust the dirt sometimes can give you
an<00:02:27.629> indication<00:02:28.230> on<00:02:28.500> where<00:02:28.709> water<00:02:28.980> might<00:02:29.220> be

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
an indication on where water might be

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.760 
an indication on where water might be
come

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
come

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.480 
come
from<00:02:30.810> but<00:02:31.810> I<00:02:31.840> am<00:02:32.170> not<00:02:32.380> seeing<00:02:32.620> any<00:02:32.890> signs<00:02:33.070> of

from but I am not seeing any signs of

from but I am not seeing any signs of
water<00:02:33.700> whatsoever<00:02:34.270> coming<00:02:34.870> from<00:02:34.990> this<00:02:35.140> unit

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
water whatsoever coming from this unit

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.600 
water whatsoever coming from this unit
so<00:02:36.420> thinking<00:02:37.420> maybe<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:38.740> customer<00:02:39.220> just<00:02:39.400> has

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
so thinking maybe the customer just has

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.920 
so thinking maybe the customer just has
some<00:02:39.790> water<00:02:40.000> that's<00:02:40.210> leaching<00:02:40.660> into<00:02:40.810> the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
some water that's leaching into the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.520 
some water that's leaching into the
basement<00:02:41.530> from<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.280> foundation<00:02:43.000> or<00:02:43.660> they've

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
basement from the foundation or they've

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.440 
basement from the foundation or they've
got<00:02:44.800> maybe<00:02:45.040> an<00:02:45.280> issue<00:02:45.400> with<00:02:45.730> their<00:02:45.910> stand<00:02:46.180> pipe

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
got maybe an issue with their stand pipe

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.230 
got maybe an issue with their stand pipe
overflowing<00:02:47.260> so<00:02:47.860> we<00:02:47.980> get<00:02:48.130> our<00:02:48.250> drain<00:02:48.940> pump

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
overflowing so we get our drain pump

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.980 
overflowing so we get our drain pump
right<00:02:49.870> here<00:02:49.930> mounted<00:02:50.680> onto<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.040> motor<00:02:51.220> and

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
right here mounted onto the motor and

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.430 
right here mounted onto the motor and
this<00:02:52.990> is<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.320> drain<00:02:53.560> hose<00:02:54.300> right<00:02:55.300> here<00:02:55.440> that's

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
this is the drain hose right here that's

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.190 
this is the drain hose right here that's
that<00:02:57.030> really<00:02:58.030> about<00:02:58.210> the<00:02:58.450> only<00:02:58.690> two<00:02:58.930> places

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
that really about the only two places

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.960 
that really about the only two places
that<00:02:59.410> these<00:02:59.800> will<00:03:00.010> typically<00:03:00.400> leak<00:03:00.670> from

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
that these will typically leak from

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.690 
that these will typically leak from
other<00:03:01.360> than<00:03:01.660> you<00:03:02.500> know<00:03:02.620> possible<00:03:03.100> inlet<00:03:03.490> hose

there drainage system might just need to

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.660 
there drainage system might just need to
be<00:03:43.180> snaked<00:03:43.480> out<00:03:43.690> but<00:03:44.190> not<00:03:45.190> something<00:03:45.430> that<00:03:45.550> can

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
be snaked out but not something that can

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.100 
be snaked out but not something that can

you're<00:03:51.850> thinking<00:03:52.600> that<00:03:52.750> a<00:03:52.780> stand<00:03:53.110> pipe<00:03:53.320> might

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
you're thinking that a stand pipe might

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.960 
you're thinking that a stand pipe might
be<00:03:53.590> backing<00:03:54.100> up<00:03:54.190> or<00:03:54.370> they<00:03:54.459> have<00:03:54.610> a<00:03:54.640> drainage

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
be backing up or they have a drainage

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.260 
be backing up or they have a drainage
issue<00:03:55.290> let's<00:03:56.290> find<00:03:56.530> a<00:03:56.680> drain<00:03:57.040> and<00:03:57.430> then<00:03:57.940> if<00:03:58.150> you

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
issue let's find a drain and then if you

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.900 
issue let's find a drain and then if you
look<00:03:58.420> on<00:03:58.630> this<00:03:58.840> you<00:03:59.050> can<00:03:59.230> see<00:03:59.470> kind<00:04:00.400> of<00:04:00.520> debris

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
look on this you can see kind of debris

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.750 
look on this you can see kind of debris
laying<00:04:01.240> up<00:04:01.450> around<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:02.020> outside<00:04:02.500> of<00:04:02.530> it<00:04:02.830> a<00:04:03.040> lot

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.310 
laying up around the outside of it a lot
of<00:04:03.910> times<00:04:04.090> that's<00:04:04.300> an<00:04:04.480> indication<00:04:04.959> that<00:04:05.140> the

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
of times that's an indication that the

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.190 
of times that's an indication that the
drain<00:04:05.709> line<00:04:05.980> or<00:04:06.250> this<00:04:06.420> system<00:04:07.420> is<00:04:07.570> backing<00:04:07.990> up
