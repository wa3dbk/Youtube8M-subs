00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.820
 very good I'm nico and in this video 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.700
 let's see how to create a custom 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:16.930
 firmware with roots nou on an iphone 4 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:19.270
 with the shs h certificates extracted from 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.880
 Tain umbrella can also be applied to 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.580
 an iphone 3gs I have tried to make 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.230
 before through the usual way that 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.530
 we are doing so far that was 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.930
 iphone leaving feu mode and 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:37.220
 restoring by pressing the key 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.200
 if in windows or the alt key in mac and not 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.210
 has left me has given me an error so 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.850
 we are going to perform this process that is more 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.470
 cash we will leave the links 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.840
 needed to download the program 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:52.879
 that in this case it will be redsnow the 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:56.059
 version 09 14 b 2 we download it what 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.910
 we extract in a folder and execute it 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:05.270
 as an administrator we have to go into 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:09.440
 extras shs h blog steaks and in the part 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:11.930
 top where it puts ipsw we have to 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.360
 select the firmware on the computer 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.420
 for our device in this case it goes 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:22.190
 to be 5.1.1 with the 208 version 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.740
 remember that on the iphone 4 in this case 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.680
 there are two versions the 6 and the 8 has to 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.090
 match the certificates with the 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.759
 firmware 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.350
 once selected we enter inside the 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:40.310
 local in the blog section and here 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.549
 we have to select the s hs h in 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.450
 this case the b version that corresponds to 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:49.259
 the 8 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.590
 and the process of creating the custom begins 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.259
 firmware let's wait for it to finish 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.289
 in this case I'm going to cut the video and 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.329
 when it finishes we continue and it has 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.960
 created custom firmware has left me 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.819
 in the same directory where I had the 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.250
 Original firmware that you select 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.500
 we accept the message now what 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.970
 we have to do is go back and 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.010
 select pw net de feu and we will 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.620
 say that we leave the iphone in mode 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.980
 recovery if we already know a mode of 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.760
 us and if we do not know then we turn off the 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.760
 device 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.380
 and we are already enabled this button that 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.040
 we see here 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.500
 click on it and we will press 10 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.190
 seconds the two buttons and power 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.190
 home at the same time 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.340
 10 seconds release the power the 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:50.280
 but we keep the hong down 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.780
 used until it beeps 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.870
 computer we can release 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.290
 and we wait for him to leave us the 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:04.190
 device prepared to install the 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:07.459
 taste we can go out when with etÃ³n 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.510
 although we are going to leave it pending because 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.709
 then we will have to use it 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.300
 then we open and tunisia appears to us that 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.580
 an iphone was detected in mode 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.220
 recovery and now we have to 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.880
 restore keeping shift are used 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.580
 the windows or alt if we use mac 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.050
 we select the custom firmware that 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:33.390
 we have created before and we select open 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.390
 and the process begins 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.480
 i 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.349
 and we wait for it to come true 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.349
 a while 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.349
 to 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.409
 or not 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:44.039
 and as we see we get an error -1 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.380
 this is normal in this process then 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:51.830
 what we have to do is accept this 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.830
