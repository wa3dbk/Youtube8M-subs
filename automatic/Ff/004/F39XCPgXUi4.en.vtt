what we've seen from Coach before when
players<00:03:52.870> announce<00:03:53.319> and<00:03:53.620> I<00:03:54.370> personally

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
players announce and I personally

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.750 
players announce and I personally
believe<00:03:55.030> that<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:56.650> personality<00:03:57.579> match

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
believe that the personality match

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.179 
believe that the personality match
between<00:03:58.239> coach<00:03:58.750> Carroll<00:03:59.229> and<00:03:59.379> Mark<00:03:59.709> Sanchez

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:00.189 
between coach Carroll and Mark Sanchez

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.599 
between coach Carroll and Mark Sanchez
is<00:04:00.459> it's<00:04:01.359> more<00:04:01.629> congruent<00:04:02.290> meaning<00:04:03.040> that<00:04:03.189> mark

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
is it's more congruent meaning that mark

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.969 
is it's more congruent meaning that mark
has<00:04:04.419> more<00:04:04.750> of<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:04.930> same<00:04:05.169> qualities<00:04:05.709> that<00:04:05.739> I

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:05.979 
has more of the same qualities that I

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:08.580 
has more of the same qualities that I
just<00:04:06.220> listed<00:04:06.489> in<00:04:06.879> a<00:04:07.449> way<00:04:07.569> that's<00:04:07.780> similar<00:04:08.349> and

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
just listed in a way that's similar and

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.979 
just listed in a way that's similar and
parallel<00:04:09.099> to<00:04:09.280> coach<00:04:09.549> Carroll<00:04:10.180> than<00:04:10.569> any<00:04:10.810> of

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
parallel to coach Carroll than any of

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.539 
parallel to coach Carroll than any of
the<00:04:11.109> previous<00:04:11.500> quarterbacks<00:04:12.010> we've<00:04:12.250> seen

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
the previous quarterbacks we've seen

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.460 
the previous quarterbacks we've seen
coming<00:04:12.909> out<00:04:13.000> of<00:04:13.060> USC<00:04:13.449> under<00:04:13.810> his<00:04:13.930> tutelage<00:04:14.079> and

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
coming out of USC under his tutelage and

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.339 
coming out of USC under his tutelage and
in<00:04:15.250> that<00:04:15.549> way<00:04:15.759> I<00:04:15.790> think<00:04:15.970> this<00:04:16.780> is<00:04:16.959> a<00:04:16.989> hard<00:04:17.289> thing

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.349 
in that way I think this is a hard thing

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.249 
in that way I think this is a hard thing
for<00:04:17.769> Coach<00:04:18.130> does<00:04:18.970> he<00:04:19.120> happen<00:04:19.299> because<00:04:19.989> he's

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:20.259 
for Coach does he happen because he's

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:22.170 
for Coach does he happen because he's
going<00:04:20.409> to<00:04:20.500> miss<00:04:20.650> mark<00:04:20.949> in<00:04:21.099> a<00:04:21.159> unique<00:04:21.489> and<00:04:21.699> a

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
going to miss mark in a unique and a

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.510 
going to miss mark in a unique and a
different<00:04:22.539> way<00:04:22.680> so<00:04:23.680> you<00:04:23.979> know<00:04:24.070> I<00:04:24.099> just<00:04:24.220> want

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
different way so you know I just want

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.010 
different way so you know I just want
you<00:04:24.580> to<00:04:24.759> sort<00:04:24.940> of<00:04:25.090> back<00:04:25.240> off<00:04:25.419> I<00:04:25.570> think<00:04:25.599> all<00:04:25.990> of

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
you to sort of back off I think all of

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.450 
you to sort of back off I think all of
the<00:04:26.229> other<00:04:26.380> comments<00:04:26.860> that<00:04:26.949> I've<00:04:27.070> seen<00:04:27.280> from

the media that coaches behavior at the
press<00:04:30.430> conference<00:04:30.729> is<00:04:31.270> going<00:04:31.509> to<00:04:31.750> decrease

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650

marks ability to make a strong entrance
into<00:04:35.409> the<00:04:35.560> draft<00:04:35.770> is<00:04:35.889> just<00:04:36.190> nonsense<00:04:36.659> because
