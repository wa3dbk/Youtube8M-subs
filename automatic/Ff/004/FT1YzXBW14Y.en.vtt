00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:04.130
 good 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.130
 last week 

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:11.719
 - about 60 euros 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:13.919
 new as it is 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:16.919
 also in san sebastián 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.300
 apparently the minor 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.579
 daniels and stress is the latest in the west 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.339
 the seal responsible for funds or workers ccoo the second part of enarsa 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:29.739
 Uncle Pavlik among others 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.380
 if the adventures of this study are known for something, it is for letting the 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:35.100
 player choose his path 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.350
 and esteban yan shi tzu is a good example of that 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.190
 take a look at this analysis because what comes next could be 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.890
 of interest to you peking china 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.790
 franchise meeting 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.850
 the three parts 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.130
 the history of damage and stress returns players to the kingdom of God 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.220
 and puts them in the shoes of one of the four possible protagonists all 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.360
 they with intentions to reinforce an almost loose version 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.390
 the adventure will have a slightly different development depending on the 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.870
 chosen character 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.060
 some side missions will vary 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.060
 and of course the game mechanics will not be the same 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.360
 bulnes 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.120
 3 5 times the initial amount 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.320
 in the middle of a difficult ride a show 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.990
 goes in the same direction after months of hard at that time when it is not like that 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.350
 between the characters and the stage a woman who dominates the game a magician and a 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.450
 holster 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.600
 some scam melee and others to keep the distances 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.750
 as advance and be the history of food completing missions 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.810
 secondary character and the one that accompanies you will gain experience and will go up 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.870
 of level 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.630
 those level ups will give you points that you can hunt to improve combat and 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.540
 defending 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.540
 and in new attacks or magic is that enrich showed combat 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.640
 there are also shops 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.160
 in them you can buy objects of interest for the characters that you are 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.230
 controlling 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.680
 as well as sell them that I found was shown way and have no relationship with 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.680
 your son character are worse than those who already have them 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.689
 the objects are obtained from the corpses that I defend your step 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:13.689
 and in chests armories that you find in the dungeons 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:20.559
 such an important point in the development of the story are conversations 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.099
 although it does not have the weight that the others can have to carry out an example if they allow 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.409
 that we choose the attitude of our character in each response and in 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.260
 function of it we can secure ohno the link created with certain 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.880
 characters what can be translated into help from time to time however is 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.399
 what goes crazy 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:41.729
 they say these facts by 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:43.959
 seven men 2-1 m 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.909
 control of the existing central character makes everything fit for 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.429
 complete the rpg action tag 

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:53.539
 seen so far defined the role play part 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:56.389
 now we go into what it has of action game 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.909
 the four characters have two alternating combat positions 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.299
 with one of the top buttons on the remote 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.689
 these positions so we understand each other 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:08.840
 they are something like the fast attack with defense points or the strong attack that 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:11.149
 sells the character completely 

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:15.749
 once the desired position has been chosen, a button will be used to strike non-stop 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:18.529
 and another will make use of the force bar 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:20.999
 in the case of lucas the scenario 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:25.019
 a position allows you to hit fast and unconscious enemies 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:25.959
 a time 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.499
 and the other allows to hit with a slow combo that takes a lot of life and rammed into 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:33.499
 the enemies using the force bar 

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:39.959
 It is also important not to sit still at any time because the 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.959
 reaction of the characters to the attacks this strategy game 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.489
 they receive blows without flinching until they fall to the ground without life 

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:50.939
 and so that does not happen we will have to use a trigger that allows us to steal 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:55.279
 if we fall and there is a close companion we can be reanimated 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:59.199
 and in the same way if our companion falls to the ground we will have to return 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:02.199
 life 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:05.619
 it's a very simple control but 

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:08.930
 rich enough to make it worthwhile to convert this kind of 

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:13.199
 adventure in an action game for the moment to be dictated five times 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:17.329
 17 million 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.780
 also if you do not abandon the graphic aspect that has defined the 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.769
 franchise 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.190
 the isometric perspective is something that is being lost due to the 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.509
 possibilities of today's machines 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:32.259
 but it continues to function as it did in 2002 and 2005 years when it comes out 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.059
 sale the first two installments 

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:37.759
 however it will retain a retro point of view does not make the game lose 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:38.800
 attractive 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.940
 textures and lighting effects make forests and 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.979
 dungeons of this game keep the guy in a precision three an x ​​box 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.559
 presents 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:51.389
 is missing good video sequences that are indispensable today 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:52.300
 in day 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.120
 and perhaps a camera a tad more dynamic in conversations with 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.099
 rates 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:00.629
 its premiere 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:03.639
 It is very interesting that you do not miss the roots of any kind 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:07.620
 and damage and stress does a great job at that point 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.990
 the 12 hours of campaign offered can be multiplied by four if the rest 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.629
 forces like to discover the changes of history 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:17.370
 and step up all the characters at level 20 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.669
 in search of achievements or trophies 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.449
 If what you have seen in this analysis, call your attention 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.319
 you can pose to play this game but without hurry 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:30.929
 the visual appeal of tanya 6 3 is timeless has no expiration date 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.050
 3 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.860
 precisely in this last month
