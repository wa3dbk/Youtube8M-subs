00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.570
 side of the English players between 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.809
 Here poles 3 0 once wadding 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.370
 it is a just sanction of the work towards 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.860
 from outside countries with someone 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:46.410
 landaise in zoos that gave it 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:51.930
 it is well done yes to the tones 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.230
 this rising average rise and a balloon 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.230
 EQ 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.210
 on the perpignan side he had been cut 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.620
 at the arcade and wears a helmet to get 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.810
 protect it by puricelli 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:14.060
 penalty to mister tisonne 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.829
 and a principality doubt 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.110
 yes because here for the purpose and English 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:21.040
 this is what is done and what helps me roy 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.250
 side of the left net of the rowing we go 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.590
 here and there it is taken against it is 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.920
 perfectly arbitrated we do not like to 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.920
 of the 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:45.610
 and in bayonne we are here the effort 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:48.000
 of the sea ​​and oif dali effect made for 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.000
 the wasps 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.940
 these are the syndic or protected bandas 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.320
 enter three additional points 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.640
 but watts that takes up the advantage that 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:07.260
 pay the hernandez le rokocoko o kossoko 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:11.010
 who has guard on the backs get chopped 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.520
 and wilson the foot pressure ok and valleys 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:17.820
 course to the English the crossed evista and 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.560
 wolf and we can be done at this 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.590
 that she was while the action of god 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.330
 because she was following the series is the 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.550
 country that offers the test to this gives 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.680
 what west action she is trying 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.160
 such action of haskell height at 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.330
 departure yes it's especially bad because 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.660
 that we are on an initiative in a 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.610
 first Bayonne time and we know that 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.840
 his players wasps when they 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.240
 get to pick up balloons are 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.640
 extremely dangerous also soil a little 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.770
 little on the side of joe rokocoko o 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.150
 recovery the lansbury double curtain 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.160
 and there by cons it also needs very 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.910
 quickly become mounts so it's not 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.890
 simple because one is inferior 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.500
 but we sail a lot and the first 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.880
 missed veneers just are going to be 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.620
 irreversible for rowing bayonnais 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.480
 plays in defense these players of the 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.489
 white haskell perfectly fixed a 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.080
 of the last defenders langer perry va 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.239
 go back there too to slow down 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.980
 the return of bustos moyano and then 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.590
 behind he's going to hurt I'm here 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.420
 Jerome because before half-time we have 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:18.890
 Given consumer will pay t we stick to 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.480
 14 to 6 for is extremely accurate on 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.990
 the only action finally to use 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.150
 with 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.420
 how to develop the melee with 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:31.260
 the introduction for mathieu bélie 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.940
 treatment of stable introduction is well 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.740
 to mix is ​​very stable to velez de 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.810
 rowing had what to be able to do 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.340
 a second push is that resists 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.290
 well and cotton a deposit will be wet 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.540
 wet bath with 15 years went down to 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.380
 croisy rokoçoko arrived as a drum 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.710
 or that summed up the English cheek go on 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.760
 insists we insist with 6 hours it will be 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.750
 like it seems to me good defense 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.430
 arrived flat video what poissy 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.980
 but it seems to me that there has been a good 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.980
 defense of and hours during his 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.730
 so if he video referees does not see the 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.730
 ball 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:24.130
 that we left on the track there is 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:27.070
 exactly ten years ago unveiled it do it 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.900
 seems he played the dff did not 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.690
 unfortunately he has touch is taking place 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:37.020
 more tom tom balls palmer is going 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.020
 to prevail that she had no salt 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:43.770
 simpson who puts his players back 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.770
 it's better the rich 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.360
 so try there is no try and 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.129
 give up the video communication 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.620
 apparently from the judiciary and morat 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:55.620
 under the different legs also in 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.129
 before enters between calais masses and 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.129
 the registrant 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.840
 in europa league the balloon and flattens 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.910
 after 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.050
 it's rather before but it's the 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.050
 expert liaison in the world 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.239
 it happens to me but happy I do not know 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.729
 if you go there he has the right to stumble 

00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:22.639
 because if a disgust of this country and on 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:26.050
 the web if at the level of the outputs then 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.050
 we were on the video 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:34.980
 and by simpsons at night and 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.750
 simpson saw himself the legs he gave 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.910
 previously not seller 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.560
 it is that the test 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.130
 these pages he went ahead the 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.720
 last phase every case it's very 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.000
 well played on the part of simpson it's 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.000
 really very well played because he 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.340
 saw which side to turn the ball on and he 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.410
 knew that this copy was favorable the 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:59.330
 third line Bayonne was going to be 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:02.250
 automatically late and it is played 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.080
 from the third row but is Cades 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.910
 behind who makes this long pass 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.150
 so to actually review is in 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.480
 advance because with the line of 22 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.700
 meters 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:17.100
 that's what gives us an indication 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:19.130
 but the game choice was perfect from the 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.130
 share 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:28.090
 but it does not pass santa with a game 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:32.349
 not so much expected where a trio of 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:34.389
 property in difficulty in top 14 bayonne ne 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:38.499
 will not contest the final stages of the 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:40.150
 European challenge 2013-2014 sent 

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:43.409
 review the scoresheet with three 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.409
 tests for birds
