00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello tomorrow we meet again today 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.750
 for a new video that this time 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.460
 is on the theme of pencils while 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.800
 laurie in pencil is nice even if 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.480
 it's a little long anyway it allows 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.250
 a more successful result that the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.450
 felt or you can make gradients 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.130
 shadows etc 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.560
 so I advise you to have 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.609
 always a pocket on hand then 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.869
 as I explained to you I 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.910
 started coloring a little bit by 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.010
 chance thanks to this book that I found 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.779
 in bookstores and saw that it was in 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.250
 library well at the level of the pencils I 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.869
 did not have much choice 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.570
 so I had to beat on a cover 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.010
 of 12 goals left of evolution that took me 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.600
 cost about 5 euros 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.460
 so what you need to know is that 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.890
 like all the pencils of the necklaces and 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.629
 keats of beats have a very dry mine 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.579
 so it does not hang well 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.800
 the paper behind the colors are 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.090
 very pale and I quickly left 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.250
 to fall because I did not like it 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.399
 absolutely not so I will show you 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.110
 the result obtained 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.090
 this is a result obtained with 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.030
 the big kids so you see that it's 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.620
 very very very pastel gold I tried 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.559
 vaguely very degraded but the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.780
 colors do not mix so that's it 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.070
 frankly not terrible I can 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.520
 maybe we showed a second 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.369
 here it is then end of the gradients of the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.990
 green color good white is having in 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.310
 common then tried to mix the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.770
 colors between and that's downright 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.930
 impossible mission 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.790
 so that's the same big site does sometimes 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.650
 good things like for example the 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.380
 perch and 24 hours of which I will 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.420
 was talking about your day who is she pretty 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.009
 well in any case at the pencil level it 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.990
 must be avoided 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.280
 I also had the pocket of 18 I think 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.110
 that I also have a metal box that 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.060
 hang around somewhere and that's all the 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.020
 same observation so the tip is too 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.880
 dry it does not catch the paper that 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.170
 said I know there are pencils to 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.060
 low prices that are better than the 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.740
 beats kids i'm thinking about maps 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.630
 is peppy colors that give 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.100
 apparently good result in many 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.729
 of people you can always 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.900
 take a look 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.330
 he feels on amazon 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.250
 this happy from the box of 36 what is 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.770
 sure it can not be worse so 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.420
 really tried personally I 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.710
 I do not have it because I was doing a 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.420
 city ​​tour I did not find them 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.369
 here in belgium we are not very good 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.170
 lotis at the level of the creative hobbies 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.810
 so here I did not have them 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.250
 orders is just to put them back 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.690
 in a corner after since you're going 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.970
 see that I still have a lot of mud 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.130
 pencil next to that in any case if you 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.450
 want to get a nice full result 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.460
 of colors me, I advise you 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.680
 to invest directly in a box of 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.680
 pencil type faber-castell caran d'ache 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.570
 or take my color then you 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.400
 go see that the difference is 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.120
 really blatant 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.650
 on my side I opted for the 40 h I 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.480
 am a follower for several years 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.530
 so I started with the box 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.360
 18.40 pm pablo who are very very good I 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.410
 finds them very beautiful the colors are 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.780
 really very bright 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.470
 so I love that I 'm going to show you the 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.300
 difference so if you remember the 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.580
 drawing i showed you with the beats 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.670
 who say that here I am going 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.880
 compare that with a drawing done at 40 h 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:07.140
 that's the color difference so you 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.750
 see it has nothing to do I can you in 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.640
 show a second car honda sh 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.880
 so that's very very very pretty and 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.640
 I find that the colors are really 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.860
 really really very beautiful so I 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.230
 show you my kits so I have 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.739
 two I initiated with the yellow ones the 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.709
 reds and purples are everything 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.350
 which you want more practical fossat and 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.830
 the second one here with the blues 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.950
 and the greens 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.239
 so obviously the May 18 box there 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.110
 did not have a lot of pencil in it so 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.269
 that's why I show you the 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.880
 kits I attended the remains of the 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.709
 pencil piece chick was the epr 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.540
 about to euros 90 8 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.690
 so here I complete the collection at 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.850
 as it is at caran 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.709
 of ache where I am faber-castell you 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.890
 also have metallic colors 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.690
 so here they are gold and silver and bronze and 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.290
 that I made them small dots here 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.799
 I do not know if you 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.959
 and see the reflections well it does not break 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.420
 nothing now that can be nice for 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.219
 to make small effects and so on but 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.280
 this is clearly not the pencils 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:12.209
 more indispensable 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.920
 I recently bought some 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.420
 faber-castell polychrome me what 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.949
 here I like them a lot 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.660
 so when you see one I took 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.400
 really basic colors story 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.680
 to be able to compare them with the 40 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.990
 age I find them very very pretty 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.060
 also this then compared to the 40 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.830
 age is almost the same price 1 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.669
 hundred of difference to make you a 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.620
 idea so 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.900
 so here we stay exactly in the 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.849
 same range of pencil they are also 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.500
 nice to use I really do not 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:40.530
 no complaints to them at this level 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.030
 there then by cons I find that the 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.190
 colors of clear age are 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.500
 maybe a little more vibrant a little 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.349
 more lively than that of polytrauma 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.900
 and show you a whole comparison 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:54.270
 so here you are then here are the big ones 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.509
 kids agree that you see very pale 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:00.000
 castel favors and the 40 ash that 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:01.349
 are there so good I find that 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.080
 the age difference are faster by 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:06.060
 example for green for oranje 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.380
 here red is not the same because 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.840
 I could not find at Faber 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.880
 castell red bath a pure red game 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.889
 like this one, the blue appears 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.940
 difficult to compare but I find that 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.760
 the colors late years of age are 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.940
 maybe more engaging than the one 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.430
 faber castell apart from his marks there 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.560
 in the pencil category good quality 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.810
 you can also find the sockets 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.130
 macau their first I do not have them 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.630
 tested but apparently it gives good 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.340
 results so I have not tested them 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.949
 why because in my store we 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.380
 do not sell and because amazon decided 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:39.720
 not to deliver them in belgium so 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.340
 here is the good surprise it is 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.889
 prismacolor is that they make little 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.330
 boxes including portrait sets 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.280
 which allows you to have all the 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.380
 necessary pencils make a beautiful 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.400
 flesh color in one box 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.860
 it's really top 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.690
 so here I am it's a shame because 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.419
 amazon does not want to deliver them to 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.919
 me then of course with beautiful pencil 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.509
 like those here so I'm not talking to you about 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.180
 bricks that says of course but I you 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:04.970
 speak of caran d'ache fabregas 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.560
 it or even prismacolor it is 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.110
 possible to make very nice gradient 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.600
 as you saw in the 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.699
 first book at the beginning of the video but 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.530
 also shadows and will help so that's 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:18.889
 really nice I show you everything from 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:21.800
 I started like the one where I 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:24.860
 not finished a bird in the book 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.060
 bestiary da at hatchet weight there 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.460
 totally at 40 h 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.289
 so I do not have a drawing yet 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.720
 faber-castell to show you by that 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:34.669
 I just had them so I did not have 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.889
 the opportunity to use them a lot 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:39.349
 on the other hand if we are still here 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:40.910
 it's pencil over the felt 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:43.220
 so you see that here I started to 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.259
 to make small shadows is a matter of 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.680
 degrade an it so it's all 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:52.460
 pencil over the felt stabilo all 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.080
 simply I'll make you soon 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.970
 little tutorial to explain 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.740
 how does the basic gradients 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.789
 that apparently it's not so obvious that 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.520
 that for everyone 

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:03.229
 so do not hesitate to subscribe to my 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.340
 youtube channel to stay informed of 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:06.530

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.440
 all but coloring on facebook or on 

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.050

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.740
 new video
