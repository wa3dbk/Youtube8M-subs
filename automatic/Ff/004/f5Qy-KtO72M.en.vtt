00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
frozen peas as his weapon so he actually

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.920 
frozen peas as his weapon so he actually
can<00:00:41.280> slow<00:00:41.640> down<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:42.059> three<00:00:42.329> zombies<00:00:42.540> when<00:00:42.870> he

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
can slow down in three zombies when he

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.750 
can slow down in three zombies when he
hits<00:00:43.110> them<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.559> then<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.950> cactus<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> fire

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
hits them and then the cactus is a fire

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.040 
hits them and then the cactus is a fire
cactus<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.420> actually<00:00:45.690> does<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> little

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
cactus and that actually does a little

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.840 
cactus and that actually does a little
bit<00:00:46.140> more<00:00:46.230> damage<00:00:46.620> than<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.920> regular<00:00:47.370> cactus

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
bit more damage than the regular cactus

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.040 
bit more damage than the regular cactus
because<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.090> does<00:00:48.239> fire<00:00:48.480> damage<00:00:48.840> over<00:00:49.020> time

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
because it does fire damage over time

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.990 
because it does fire damage over time
whenever<00:00:49.829> he<00:00:50.070> hits<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.370> zombie<00:00:50.670> what<00:00:50.850> other

whenever he hits a zombie what other

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.130 
whenever he hits a zombie what other

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
in this mode so there's gonna be a lot

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.520 
in this mode so there's gonna be a lot
of<00:00:53.730> different<00:00:53.850> boss<00:00:54.420> type<00:00:54.780> zombies<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.350> show

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
of different boss type zombies that show

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.470 
of different boss type zombies that show
up<00:00:55.559> later<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.280> later<00:00:56.489> waves<00:00:56.820> we<00:00:57.270> have<00:00:57.360> this

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
up later in later waves we have this

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.389 
up later in later waves we have this
feature<00:00:57.690> called<00:00:57.989> zomboss<00:00:58.739> sloth<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.309> is

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
feature called zomboss sloth this is

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.010 
feature called zomboss sloth this is
actually<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> slot<00:00:59.940> machine<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.449> spins<00:01:00.809> it

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
actually a slot machine that spins it

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.869 
actually a slot machine that spins it
actually<00:01:01.289> chooses<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.070> boss<00:01:02.280> characters<00:01:02.760> are

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
actually chooses the boss characters are

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.310 
actually chooses the boss characters are
going<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.059> appear<00:01:03.359> every<00:01:03.570> say<00:01:03.750> four<00:01:04.049> or<00:01:04.080> five

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
going to appear every say four or five

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.870 
going to appear every say four or five
waves<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:04.979> that's<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.220> tombstone<00:01:05.670> that's

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
waves so that's a tombstone that's

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.940 
waves so that's a tombstone that's
actually<00:01:06.210> it's<00:01:06.750> like<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.869> spawner<00:01:07.290> for<00:01:07.650> zombie

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
actually it's like a spawner for zombie

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.260 
actually it's like a spawner for zombie
so<00:01:08.100> that'll<00:01:08.340> appear<00:01:08.640> somewhere<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.090> map

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
so that'll appear somewhere in the map

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.000 
so that'll appear somewhere in the map
and<00:01:09.510> they'll<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.780> take<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.020> out<00:01:10.200> middle

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
and they'll have to take that out middle

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.039 
and they'll have to take that out middle
ones<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.369> new<00:01:11.760> type<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.000> gargantuar<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.960> we've

ones a new type of gargantuar that we've

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.330

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
but it actually shoots electrical pulses

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.550 
but it actually shoots electrical pulses
and<00:01:30.299> it's<00:01:30.450> really<00:01:30.840> powerful<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.439> dangerous

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
and it's really powerful and dangerous

and so forth but we have something

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.260 
and so forth but we have something
called<00:01:43.920> boss<00:01:44.250> mode<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.670> actually<00:01:45.030> helps

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
called boss mode that actually helps

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.880 
called boss mode that actually helps
sort<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.479> offset<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.439> lack<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.649> a

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
sort of offset the the lack of a

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
sunflower boss mode works on both on

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.170 
sunflower boss mode works on both on
SmartGlass<00:01:49.380> as<00:01:49.590> well<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.130> on<00:01:50.460> connect<00:01:50.970> using

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
motion controls so you can use your

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.010

and drop abilities using using Kinect go

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.859 
and drop abilities using using Kinect go
but<00:01:59.310> we<00:01:59.790> really<00:02:00.030> like<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.299> use<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.540> as<00:02:00.630> smart

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
but we really like to use it as smart

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.450 
but we really like to use it as smart
glass<00:02:01.020> because<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.290> allows<00:02:01.469> somebody<00:02:01.740> sitting

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460

playing is crazy Dave helping the plants

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.020 
playing is crazy Dave helping the plants
down<00:02:12.390> below

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
down below

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.430 
down below
and<00:02:13.180> so<00:02:13.420> by<00:02:13.630> doing<00:02:13.690> so<00:02:14.080> you're<00:02:14.290> actually

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
mode we also have heal station so this

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.150 
mode we also have heal station so this
helps<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.080> keep<00:02:32.230> your<00:02:32.410> teammate<00:02:32.770> kind<00:02:33.069> of

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
helps to keep your teammate kind of

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.680 
helps to keep your teammate kind of
healthy<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:33.910> alive<00:02:34.180> while<00:02:34.390> they're<00:02:34.510> fighting

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
healthy and alive while they're fighting

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.780 
healthy and alive while they're fighting
so<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.620> can<00:02:35.800> drop<00:02:36.010> these<00:02:36.160> right<00:02:36.430> down<00:02:36.580> by<00:02:36.730> the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
so you can drop these right down by the

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.610 
so you can drop these right down by the
base<00:02:37.030> or<00:02:37.180> wherever<00:02:37.420> your<00:02:37.540> teammates<00:02:37.930> are<00:02:38.140> the

base or wherever your teammates are the
one<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.069> my<00:02:39.310> favorite<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:39.819> is<00:02:39.940> actually<00:02:40.270> to

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
one that my favorite is is actually to

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.030 
one that my favorite is is actually to
call<00:02:40.540> in<00:02:40.690> airstrikes<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.440> so<00:02:41.709> it's<00:02:41.830> a<00:02:41.890> big

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
call in airstrikes and so it's a big

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.559 
call in airstrikes and so it's a big
cherry<00:02:42.310> bomb<00:02:42.550> strike<00:02:42.880> you<00:02:43.000> can<00:02:43.150> drag<00:02:43.360> and<00:02:43.510> drop

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
cherry bomb strike you can drag and drop

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.150 
cherry bomb strike you can drag and drop
that<00:02:43.720> out<00:02:44.020> into<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.290> battlefield<00:02:44.800> and<00:02:45.010> if<00:02:45.070> you

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
that out into the battlefield and if you

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
20 seconds to get to them and get them

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.759 
20 seconds to get to them and get them
back<00:02:58.300> up<00:02:58.510> but<00:02:59.080> if<00:02:59.140> you<00:02:59.230> have<00:02:59.319> a<00:02:59.350> teammate<00:02:59.650> they

can't<00:02:59.950> get<00:03:00.100> to<00:03:00.220> them<00:03:00.310> if<00:03:00.459> you<00:03:00.550> have<00:03:00.640> boss<00:03:00.850> mode

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.340 
can't get to them if you have boss mode
the<00:03:01.269> boss<00:03:01.450> can<00:03:01.690> actually<00:03:01.989> drop<00:03:02.170> a

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
the boss can actually drop a

the boss can actually drop a
resurrection<00:03:02.950> station<00:03:03.340> right<00:03:03.489> next<00:03:03.640> to<00:03:03.819> them

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
resurrection station right next to them

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.460 
resurrection station right next to them
and<00:03:04.330> get<00:03:04.480> them<00:03:04.630> right<00:03:04.780> back<00:03:04.900> up<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:05.260> fighting

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
and get them right back up and fighting

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.080 
and get them right back up and fighting
so<00:03:05.920> this<00:03:06.069> might<00:03:06.250> ends<00:03:06.430> when<00:03:06.640> both<00:03:06.819> players

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
so this might ends when both players

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.570 
so this might ends when both players
fight<00:03:07.750> a<00:03:07.780> bullet<00:03:08.050> yep<00:03:08.590> so<00:03:08.830> if<00:03:08.950> both<00:03:09.130> players<00:03:09.280> go

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
fight a bullet yep so if both players go

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.949 
fight a bullet yep so if both players go
down<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.030> neither<00:03:10.150> of<00:03:10.360> them<00:03:10.450> can<00:03:10.600> be<00:03:10.720> derived

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
down and neither of them can be derived

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.590 
down and neither of them can be derived
either<00:03:11.440> by<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.709> boss<00:03:11.950> or<00:03:12.190> anyone<00:03:12.310> else<00:03:12.700> the

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
either by the boss or anyone else the

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.479 
either by the boss or anyone else the
timer<00:03:13.810> runs<00:03:13.900> out<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:14.470> he<00:03:14.890> actually<00:03:15.040> lose<00:03:15.340> the

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
timer runs out and he actually lose the

timer runs out and he actually lose the
mode<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.790> other<00:03:15.910> way<00:03:16.030> you<00:03:16.120> can<00:03:16.209> lose<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.450> mode

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
mode the other way you can lose the mode

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.850 
mode the other way you can lose the mode
is<00:03:16.690> if<00:03:16.810> your<00:03:16.900> garden<00:03:17.170> is<00:03:17.200> destroyed<00:03:17.620> so
