00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 yo everyone likes it's crazy we 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.779
 found for a new video on gta 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.069
 it was a long time ago but I 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.460
 make one last video on the heater 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.049
 clan but the quality was bad so 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.330
 how to excuse and I have a small 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.230
 problem also the application with 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.710
 which I filmed my phone 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.220
 walk and finally does not work anymore 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:31.800
 I had the sg to uninstall it and that 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.210
 no longer running brief come we come but 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.910
 of video so as you could see 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:41.790
 on the title how well worked out on 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.800
 finally how pitched if he is sure I was 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.110
 Teen I already made a video a title 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.090
 humorous that was called how 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.579
 kabor on gta and I was doing kind 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.770
 to be the best in the world I would 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.690
 like that and I fell directly for 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.420
 do and this priest to make believe to 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.960
 people I'm a big shit and a 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.979
 little nail and people did not take that 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.710
 to the fun and his are obliged to 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:10.560
 how to say to put comments 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.670
 audio is a shit and all but suddenly 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.520
 I sent to everyone 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.680
 it's a docu humorous title but 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.090
 good so how well pitched so that's 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.350
 I do not accelerate and I put the first 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.390
 phase i but how beautiful you are there 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.869
 is actually we pitch as if you're going 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.150
 kabored normally but give you some 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.920
 small handbrakes yes yes 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.799
 this is the end of the little strokes of 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.340
 brakes fired herin like you 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.670
 can surely hear it from my joystick 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:45.149
 to be able to pitch up like that so that 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.030
 is called henry so optimum and like 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.549
 on this game we can not touch the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.130
 wand that is so not just waiting 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.439
 on the patio that is what you 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.159
 see all behind so that's it 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.799
 makes us fall on gta 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.630
 it's a shame but it's enough 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:08.019
 friendly for kaborÃ© make style and 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.670
 after that there is after you for 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.530
 the intriguer but hey it's enough 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.470
 difficult after we do not take it 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.900
 first shot but after that we have the 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.540
 it's not enough to be strong at 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.549
 anything once we did it 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.560
 and concerns dragging after ten 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:26.769
 minutes later we start managing it a 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.569
 like me there I thought not believe 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.209
 not that you will succeed directly 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.290
 like there I do it's crazy take the 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.819
 course done can not be a 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.730
 professional or against what I do not 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.379
 I'm not at all but you have to take the 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.129
 hand and get used to a little 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.900
 everything in life runs short then this 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.480
 that you can do however could 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.489
 isolate themselves a bit wait not hosted by 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.609
 cars so for example you 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.099
 can pitch up give us shots of 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:56.890
 kidneys and make as if the key back 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.440
 in fact the ass touch them and turn 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.910
 a little to the left while framing and 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.579
 do that so it's pretty stylish 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.150
 to show your friends what 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.040
 you know how to do 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.139
 it's nice but that's even more 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.519
 difficult because even I do not arrive 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:12.060
 not all costs for example freud a 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.060
 luck 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.139
 finally have to put the joystick otherwise 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.709
 you fall back directly fogal up and 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:22.680
 the first time otherwise I hope that 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.560
 this video will have pleased you 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.690
 so for those who know and do not 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.889
 do not believe in marking comments yeah 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.599
 it's rotten everyone knows it 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.329
 since there is not everyone who 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.079
 know that's why otherwise I would not do 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.760
 not this video 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.230
 and for those who do not know it but
