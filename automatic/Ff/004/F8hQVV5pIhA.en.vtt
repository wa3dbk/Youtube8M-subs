 hi friends how are you i am laura and 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.690
 I welcome you to access in the 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.389
 today's video I bring you my purchases of 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.010
 beauty I went to the woods shop os 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.900
 I leave it down here in the little box 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.590
 information for if you want to take a 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.109
 look and I bought several little things about 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.970
 beauty because lately I had spent 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.529
 almost all of them are new 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.350
 but many of them that had 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.300
 used so I wanted to teach them this 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.779
 video 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.970
 the times that I bought was this these 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.940
 brush landmarks for the face of the base 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.030
 Makeup for lips for blusher 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.160
 and for road contour techniques I 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.750
 It seemed that they were coming very well in case 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.210
 I wanted to go on a trip and I bought myself some 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.100
 little things I bought one that already came 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:55.970
 using vale but that I have spent 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:57.050
 the first of mascara that is this one that 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.079
 is fix 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.050
 perfect is very cool because it leaves you the 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.240
 super soft face and I had already used it 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:09.370
 I had spent and I bought another 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.280
 I also bought some bases 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.190
 good makeup about 6 and cream that I 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.900
 I really like a perfect 23 of bullas me 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.479
 I really like it because it covers you 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:24.130
 very much it gives you like a very tan 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.990
 cool and together with that of mascara of the 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.020
 mascara bicrim and these are my 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.020
 favorites so I bought myself another boat 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.890
 another thing that I bought myself was a 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.640
 make -up remover from the make-up remover 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.130
 nivea 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.470
 the eye make -up remover especially 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.720
 because many times do I stripe 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.470
 eye and I have a hard time removing it I like 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.270
 because you move it 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.009
 and they stay with the group 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.649
 but good especially because it is very 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.530
 soft does not need to do much pressure 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.579
 and removes makeup with a lot 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.880
 ease 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.710
 and above all it hydrates me a lot and from 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.619
 all make-up removers I've used 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.580
 for eyes this is my favorite I'm sorry 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.129
 I love 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.300
 Then for when I put my eyebrows 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:18.260
 I bought the mascara kit 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:21.290
 that comes with the two brushstrokes well 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.730
 in the cream part and the part 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.980
 the part in cream that is this and the part 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.330
 of dust is worth and then comes with the 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.250
 brush and cough for the eyebrows 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.080
 and like me, you leave it very dark because 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.930
 my brown 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.390
 well now another thing that I bought myself for 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.740
 the nails are the color that I wear now 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.200
 same 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.200
 what is this mascara 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.990
 and I bought myself another color of mascara that is 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.990
 this new that I also like a lot 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.050
 that I thought was very cool are two colors 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.290
 what do I like for the summer to 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.170
 the spring are very very soft very 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.240
 light and I do not know I wanted to try these 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.600
 two 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.220
 and the last thing I bought came up very 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.040
 fast because being a young man I did not want 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:22.030
 that this extended very much 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:25.570
 the express rhythm of maybelline mails 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.840
 that is an authentic pass you put the 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.340
 finger and that's it and I'm off the project 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.160
 this to remove my nails that is that I 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.280
 it looks like a pain in the ass 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.050
 He's super cool and well I do not know 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.930
