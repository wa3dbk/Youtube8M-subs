00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
this plant kills and took great pride in

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.450 
this plant kills and took great pride in
shutting<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:15.030> down<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.830> now<00:00:16.830> suddenly<00:00:17.130> you're

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
shutting it down and now suddenly you're

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.820 
shutting it down and now suddenly you're
a<00:00:17.490> big<00:00:17.670> champion<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.150> coal<00:00:18.330> oil<00:00:18.600> production<00:00:19.560> is

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
a big champion of coal oil production is

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.790 
a big champion of coal oil production is
up<00:00:19.980> natural<00:00:20.730> gas<00:00:20.910> production<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.600> up<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.050> most

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
up natural gas production is up and most

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.170 
up natural gas production is up and most
importantly<00:00:23.310> we're<00:00:23.490> also<00:00:23.609> starting<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.090> build

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
importantly we're also starting to build

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.410 
importantly we're also starting to build
cars<00:00:24.590> that<00:00:25.590> are<00:00:25.710> more<00:00:25.830> efficient<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.460> that's

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
cars that are more efficient and that's

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.599 
cars that are more efficient and that's
creating<00:00:27.840> jobs<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.859> means<00:00:29.039> those<00:00:29.220> cars<00:00:29.429> can

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
creating jobs that means those cars can

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.950 
creating jobs that means those cars can
be<00:00:29.640> exported<00:00:30.179> because<00:00:30.269> that's<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.720> demand

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
be exported because that's the demand

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.500 
be exported because that's the demand
around<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.349> world<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.910> also<00:00:33.120> means<00:00:33.420> that

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
around the world and it also means that

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.970 
around the world and it also means that
it'll<00:00:33.840> save<00:00:34.020> money<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.350> your<00:00:34.440> pocketbook

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
it'll save money in your pocketbook

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.440 
it'll save money in your pocketbook
that's<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.670> strategy<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.120> need<00:00:36.270> an

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
that's the strategy you need an

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.819 
that's the strategy you need an
all-of-the-above<00:00:36.840> strategy<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.710> that's

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
all-of-the-above strategy and that's

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:38.959 
all-of-the-above strategy and that's
what<00:00:38.010> we're<00:00:38.129> going<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.280> do<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.640> next<00:00:38.730> four

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.200 
what we're going to do in the next four
years<00:00:40.190> but<00:00:41.190> that's<00:00:41.340> not<00:00:41.460> what<00:00:41.579> you've<00:00:41.790> done<00:00:41.910> in

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
the last four years that's the problem

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.330

when you want to drill when you want to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.789 
when you want to drill when you want to
produce<00:01:26.540> when<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:27.720> most<00:01:28.110> profitable<00:01:28.740> for

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
produce when it's most profitable for

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.640

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
want to drill on public lands you use it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.530 
want to drill on public lands you use it
or<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.890> lose<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.280> okay<00:01:35.700> now<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.119> what<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.390> did

in<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.580> moment<00:02:08.879> I'm<00:02:08.970> still<00:02:09.179> speaking<00:02:09.390> well<00:02:09.810> but

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
in a moment I'm still speaking well but

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.360 
in a moment I'm still speaking well but
and<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.349> answer<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.950> don't<00:02:10.979> believe<00:02:11.340> people

and the answer is I don't believe people

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
and the answer is I don't believe people
think<00:02:11.760> that's<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.030> case<00:02:12.209> because<00:02:12.420> I

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
think that's the case because I

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.180 
think that's the case because I
the<00:02:13.540> question<00:02:13.900> okay<00:02:14.140> that<00:02:14.380> was<00:02:14.500> a<00:02:14.530> statement<00:02:14.830> I

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
the question okay that was a statement I

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.530 
the question okay that was a statement I
don't<00:02:15.430> think<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.819> American<00:02:15.880> people<00:02:16.420> believe

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
don't think the American people believe

that I will fight for all coal and

I took office the price of gasoline was
181<00:02:55.180> 86<00:02:55.630> why<00:02:56.170> is<00:02:56.230> that<00:02:56.850> because<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:58.180> economy

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
181 86 why is that because the economy

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.280 
181 86 why is that because the economy
was<00:02:58.720> on<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.080> verge<00:02:59.200> of<00:02:59.350> collapse<00:03:01.110> because<00:03:02.110> we

was on the verge of collapse because we

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.900 
was on the verge of collapse because we
were<00:03:02.440> about<00:03:02.709> to<00:03:02.920> go<00:03:03.070> through<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.730> worst

were about to go through the worst
recession<00:03:04.540> since<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:05.019> Great<00:03:05.260> Depression

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
recession since the Great Depression

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.550 
recession since the Great Depression
as<00:03:06.580> a<00:03:06.640> consequence<00:03:07.239> of<00:03:07.480> some<00:03:08.080> of<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.410> same

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
as a consequence of some of the same

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.990 
as a consequence of some of the same
policies<00:03:08.830> that<00:03:09.160> Governor<00:03:09.550> Romney<00:03:09.580> is<00:03:09.880> now

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
policies that Governor Romney is now

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.780 
policies that Governor Romney is now
promoted<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:11.500> it's<00:03:12.160> conceivable<00:03:12.550> that

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
promoted so it's conceivable that

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.009 
promoted so it's conceivable that
Governor<00:03:13.090> Romney<00:03:13.120> could<00:03:13.480> bring<00:03:13.690> down<00:03:13.810> gas

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
Governor Romney could bring down gas

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.900 
Governor Romney could bring down gas
prices<00:03:14.530> because<00:03:14.769> with<00:03:15.100> his<00:03:15.250> policies<00:03:15.730> we

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
prices because with his policies we

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.259
