reason<00:00:26.840> I'm<00:00:26.930> doing<00:00:27.110> this<00:00:27.259> video<00:00:27.680> is<00:00:27.770> recently

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:28.489 
reason I'm doing this video is recently

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:30.490 
reason I'm doing this video is recently
I<00:00:28.550> had<00:00:28.759> a<00:00:28.790> few<00:00:29.029> really<00:00:29.210> bad<00:00:29.570> crashes<00:00:30.140> with<00:00:30.320> my

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
I had a few really bad crashes with my

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.069 
I had a few really bad crashes with my
tailless<00:00:31.009> DeltaWing<00:00:31.669> and<00:00:31.879> it<00:00:32.450> destroyed<00:00:32.809> two

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
tailless DeltaWing and it destroyed two

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.010 
tailless DeltaWing and it destroyed two
of<00:00:33.230> my<00:00:33.350> batteries<00:00:33.920> so<00:00:34.910> I<00:00:35.270> wanted<00:00:35.780> to<00:00:35.840> make<00:00:35.989> sure

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
of my batteries so I wanted to make sure

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.930 
of my batteries so I wanted to make sure
that<00:00:36.469> I<00:00:36.530> fixed<00:00:37.010> the<00:00:37.100> problem<00:00:37.129> so<00:00:37.820> that

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
that I fixed the problem so that

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.910 
that I fixed the problem so that
wouldn't<00:00:38.180> happen<00:00:38.329> again<00:00:38.780> this<00:00:39.410> is<00:00:39.559> the<00:00:39.680> first

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
wouldn't happen again this is the first

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.410 
wouldn't happen again this is the first
time<00:00:40.100> that<00:00:40.129> this<00:00:40.399> has<00:00:40.579> ever<00:00:40.730> happened<00:00:40.850> with<00:00:41.150> my

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
time that this has ever happened with my

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.900 
time that this has ever happened with my
spectrum<00:00:41.930> radio<00:00:42.170> and<00:00:42.650> I<00:00:43.160> wasn't<00:00:43.340> sure<00:00:43.640> whether

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
spectrum radio and I wasn't sure whether

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.540 
spectrum radio and I wasn't sure whether
it<00:00:44.090> was<00:00:44.120> a<00:00:44.270> low-voltage<00:00:44.930> lockout<00:00:45.890> or<00:00:46.070> whether

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
it was a low-voltage lockout or whether

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.640 
it was a low-voltage lockout or whether
I<00:00:46.640> was<00:00:46.850> just<00:00:47.030> out<00:00:47.180> of<00:00:47.210> range<00:00:47.600> so<00:00:48.380> I've<00:00:48.530> gone

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
I was just out of range so I've gone

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.500 
I was just out of range so I've gone
ahead<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:48.950> fixed<00:00:49.400> both<00:00:49.579> problems<00:00:50.210> on<00:00:50.390> the

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
ahead and fixed both problems on the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.569 
ahead and fixed both problems on the
plane<00:00:50.800> first<00:00:51.800> we're<00:00:52.010> going<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:52.160> go<00:00:52.280> ahead<00:00:52.460> and

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
plane first we're going to go ahead and

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.440 
plane first we're going to go ahead and
take<00:00:52.700> a<00:00:52.730> look<00:00:52.940> at<00:00:53.060> the<00:00:53.210> low<00:00:53.630> voltage<00:00:54.010> cutout

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
take a look at the low voltage cutout

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.550 
take a look at the low voltage cutout
it's<00:00:56.450> pretty<00:00:56.750> simple<00:00:57.170> fix

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:57.560 
it's pretty simple fix

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.350 
it's pretty simple fix
I<00:00:57.649> did<00:00:57.890> some<00:00:58.040> search<00:00:58.340> searching<00:00:59.120> on<00:00:59.239> the

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
I did some search searching on the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.319 
I did some search searching on the
internet<00:00:59.690> and<00:00:59.899> I<00:01:00.410> found<00:01:00.440> out<00:01:00.800> that<00:01:01.329> spectrum

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
internet and I found out that spectrum

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.380 
internet and I found out that spectrum
actually<00:01:02.840> has<00:01:03.110> a<00:01:03.470> low<00:01:03.800> voltage<00:01:04.390> cutout

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
actually has a low voltage cutout

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.389 
actually has a low voltage cutout
capacitor<00:01:06.229> that<00:01:06.409> plugs<00:01:06.740> right<00:01:06.979> into<00:01:07.219> the

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
capacitor that plugs right into the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:10.630 
capacitor that plugs right into the
receiver<00:01:08.320> basically<00:01:09.320> what<00:01:09.469> it<00:01:09.590> does<00:01:09.770> is<00:01:10.040> it

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
receiver basically what it does is it

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.520 
receiver basically what it does is it
plugs<00:01:10.969> into<00:01:11.149> one<00:01:11.360> of<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:11.540> open<00:01:11.869> slots<00:01:12.200> on<00:01:12.409> the

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
plugs into one of the open slots on the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.469 
plugs into one of the open slots on the
receiver<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:13.250> if<00:01:13.370> the<00:01:13.490> voltage<00:01:13.820> drops<00:01:14.180> down

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
receiver and if the voltage drops down

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.480 
receiver and if the voltage drops down
below<00:01:14.870> to<00:01:14.930> where<00:01:15.140> it<00:01:15.260> would<00:01:15.409> cut<00:01:15.650> off<00:01:15.799> the

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
below to where it would cut off the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.580 
below to where it would cut off the
capacitor<00:01:17.060> keeps<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.479> voltage<00:01:17.840> regulated<00:01:18.440> at

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
capacitor keeps the voltage regulated at

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.440 
capacitor keeps the voltage regulated at
the<00:01:18.620> right<00:01:18.890> amount<00:01:19.250> so<00:01:19.850> that<00:01:19.880> you<00:01:20.120> won't<00:01:20.270> get

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
the right amount so that you won't get

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.539 
the right amount so that you won't get
the<00:01:20.570> cut<00:01:20.780> out<00:01:20.960> it's<00:01:21.620> very<00:01:21.740> simple<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:22.460> very

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
the cut out it's very simple and very

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.490 
the cut out it's very simple and very
cheap<00:01:22.940> fix<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:24.350> part<00:01:24.590> number<00:01:24.890> is<00:01:25.040> SP<00:01:25.640> M<00:01:26.500> 1600

from horizon hobbies or even Hobby Lobby
carries<00:01:32.780> them<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.409> like<00:01:33.590> I<00:01:33.680> said<00:01:33.770> they're

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
carries them and like I said they're

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.710 
carries them and like I said they're
really<00:01:34.310> cheap<00:01:34.580> I<00:01:34.760> think<00:01:34.790> they're<00:01:35.030> around<00:01:35.270> six

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
really cheap I think they're around six

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.620 
really cheap I think they're around six
dollars<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.830> it's<00:01:37.040> definitely<00:01:37.369> worth<00:01:37.700> it

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
dollars and it's definitely worth it

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.140 
dollars and it's definitely worth it
the<00:01:38.960> second<00:01:39.380> problem<00:01:39.650> was<00:01:40.430> I<00:01:40.490> wasn't<00:01:41.030> sure

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
the second problem was I wasn't sure

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.550 
the second problem was I wasn't sure
about<00:01:41.270> was<00:01:41.540> whether<00:01:41.750> I<00:01:41.869> was<00:01:42.020> getting<00:01:42.229> out<00:01:42.380> of

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
about was whether I was getting out of

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.620 
about was whether I was getting out of
range<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.250> I<00:01:43.640> did<00:01:43.790> some<00:01:43.970> checking<00:01:44.240> on<00:01:44.479> the

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
range and I did some checking on the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.570 
range and I did some checking on the
forums<00:01:45.080> and<00:01:45.200> I<00:01:45.500> found<00:01:45.740> out<00:01:45.920> that<00:01:46.010> the<00:01:46.130> receiver

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
forums and I found out that the receiver

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.060 
forums and I found out that the receiver
that<00:01:46.850> I'm<00:01:46.970> using<00:01:47.299> is<00:01:47.570> a<00:01:47.600> park<00:01:48.110> flyer<00:01:48.470> receiver

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
that I'm using is a park flyer receiver

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.580 
that I'm using is a park flyer receiver
I<00:01:49.430> was<00:01:50.360> under<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:50.659> impression<00:01:50.720> that<00:01:51.110> a<00:01:51.260> park

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
I was under the impression that a park

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.880 
I was under the impression that a park
flyer<00:01:51.860> was<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:52.310> same<00:01:52.520> as<00:01:52.700> a<00:01:52.729> half<00:01:53.890> range

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
flyer was the same as a half range

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.499 
flyer was the same as a half range
receiver<00:01:55.520> which<00:01:55.820> would<00:01:55.939> be<00:01:56.060> about<00:01:56.150> a<00:01:56.299> half

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
receiver which would be about a half

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.929 
receiver which would be about a half
mile<00:01:56.930> but<00:01:57.680> after<00:01:58.009> doing<00:01:58.159> some<00:01:58.430> research<00:01:58.610> I

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
mile but after doing some research I

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.789 
mile but after doing some research I
found<00:01:59.150> out<00:01:59.390> that<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.810> park<00:02:00.049> flyer<00:02:00.290> setting<00:02:00.680> is

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
found out that the park flyer setting is

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.359 
found out that the park flyer setting is
actually<00:02:01.130> a<00:02:01.189> lot<00:02:01.460> less<00:02:01.790> than<00:02:02.090> that<00:02:03.369> spectrum

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
actually a lot less than that spectrum

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.310 
actually a lot less than that spectrum
actually<00:02:04.580> rates<00:02:04.970> it<00:02:05.180> out<00:02:05.329> about<00:02:05.570> a<00:02:05.630> thousand

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
actually rates it out about a thousand

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.919 
actually rates it out about a thousand
foot<00:02:06.560> range<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.490> I<00:02:08.000> read<00:02:08.179> on<00:02:08.299> the<00:02:08.420> forums<00:02:08.689> that

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
foot range and I read on the forums that

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.569 
foot range and I read on the forums that
people<00:02:08.959> were<00:02:09.349> having<00:02:09.530> problems<00:02:09.860> starting<00:02:10.489> at

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:10.579 
people were having problems starting at

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:13.990 
people were having problems starting at
about<00:02:10.789> 750<00:02:11.569> feet<00:02:11.989> out<00:02:12.310> so<00:02:13.310> it's<00:02:13.730> not

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
about 750 feet out so it's not

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.420 
about 750 feet out so it's not
recommended<00:02:14.689> to<00:02:14.750> use<00:02:14.840> any<00:02:15.290> of<00:02:15.409> their<00:02:15.680> park

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
recommended to use any of their park

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.640 
recommended to use any of their park
flyer<00:02:16.730> receivers<00:02:17.360> for<00:02:17.540> really<00:02:17.930> fast<00:02:18.230> planes

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
flyer receivers for really fast planes

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.240 
flyer receivers for really fast planes
or<00:02:18.920> planes<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:19.280> fly<00:02:19.340> really<00:02:19.910> high

or planes that fly really high

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.370 
or planes that fly really high
so<00:02:21.580> I've<00:02:21.730> gone<00:02:21.940> ahead<00:02:22.000> in<00:02:22.450> my<00:02:22.600> claims<00:02:22.990> and<00:02:23.290> I've

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
so I've gone ahead in my claims and I've

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.700 
so I've gone ahead in my claims and I've
switched<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:24.960> 6200<00:02:25.960> series<00:02:26.350> which<00:02:26.530> is<00:02:26.680> a

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
switched to the 6200 series which is a

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.430 
switched to the 6200 series which is a
full<00:02:27.070> range<00:02:27.370> spectrum<00:02:28.210> receiver<00:02:28.600> which<00:02:29.290> is

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
full range spectrum receiver which is

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.650 
full range spectrum receiver which is
good<00:02:29.680> for<00:02:29.890> almost<00:02:30.280> about<00:02:30.490> a<00:02:30.550> mile<00:02:30.910> range<00:02:31.300> so<00:02:31.630> I

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
good for almost about a mile range so I

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.960 
good for almost about a mile range so I
shouldn't<00:02:31.930> have<00:02:32.170> any<00:02:32.350> problems<00:02:32.920> anymore<00:02:33.160> with

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
shouldn't have any problems anymore with

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.170 
shouldn't have any problems anymore with
being<00:02:34.210> out<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.540> range<00:02:34.810> or<00:02:35.670> having<00:02:36.670> low<00:02:36.820> voltage

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
being out of range or having low voltage

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.000 
being out of range or having low voltage
cut<00:02:37.450> out<00:02:37.600> I'd<00:02:38.050> also<00:02:38.200> like<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.530> add<00:02:38.650> that<00:02:38.680> the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
cut out I'd also like to add that the

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.490 
cut out I'd also like to add that the
6200<00:02:39.730> series<00:02:39.880> receivers<00:02:40.570> give<00:02:41.080> a<00:02:41.110> little<00:02:41.350> bit

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
6200 series receivers give a little bit

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.770 
6200 series receivers give a little bit
more<00:02:41.560> protection<00:02:42.130> they<00:02:43.030> come<00:02:43.240> as<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.450> dual

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
more protection they come as a dual

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.810 
more protection they come as a dual
receiver<00:02:44.290> which<00:02:44.920> means<00:02:45.130> that<00:02:45.250> they<00:02:45.370> lock<00:02:45.580> in

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
receiver which means that they lock in

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.640 
receiver which means that they lock in
on<00:02:45.940> two<00:02:46.150> separate<00:02:46.600> channels<00:02:46.840> so<00:02:47.260> that<00:02:47.410> way<00:02:47.530> if

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
on two separate channels so that way if

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.890 
on two separate channels so that way if
one<00:02:47.920> fails<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:49.120> other<00:02:49.240> one<00:02:49.420> has<00:02:49.570> you<00:02:49.690> covered

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
one fails the other one has you covered

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.570 
one fails the other one has you covered
and<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.800> way<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:51.010> end<00:02:51.160> up<00:02:51.250> having<00:02:51.370> a

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
and that way you end up having a

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.390 
and that way you end up having a
bulletproof<00:02:52.440> connection<00:02:53.440> now<00:02:53.980> it's<00:02:54.160> time<00:02:54.370> to

bulletproof connection now it's time to

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.940 
bulletproof connection now it's time to
move<00:02:54.640> on<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:55.030> getting<00:02:55.660> rid<00:02:55.870> of<00:02:55.960> those<00:02:56.110> damaged

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
move on to getting rid of those damaged

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.850 
move on to getting rid of those damaged
in<00:02:57.160> bad<00:02:57.690> lipo<00:02:58.690> batteries<00:02:59.200> or<00:02:59.290> lithium<00:02:59.320> polymer
