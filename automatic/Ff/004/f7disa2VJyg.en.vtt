into the kitchen and I saw this junk on
the<00:01:39.180> floor<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.450> thought<00:01:39.600> what<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.930> world<00:01:40.049> is

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
hour so anyway just look at this again I

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.109 
hour so anyway just look at this again I
think<00:01:45.869> he<00:01:46.049> used<00:01:46.229> words<00:01:46.470> flying<00:01:46.740> saucer<00:01:47.280> in

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119

connection with the debris so I started

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.039

here<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.600> didn't<00:01:54.869> try<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.079> bend<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.009> or<00:01:56.159> tear

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
here and I didn't try to bend it or tear

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.160 
here and I didn't try to bend it or tear
it<00:01:56.520> or<00:01:56.840> deform<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.049> my<00:01:58.950> dad<00:01:59.159> did<00:01:59.490> though<00:01:59.729> and

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
it or deform it my dad did though and

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.660 
it or deform it my dad did though and
and<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.740> when<00:02:01.890> he<00:02:01.950> got<00:02:02.070> back<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.430> base<00:02:02.640> and

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
and and when he got back to the base and

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.850 
and and when he got back to the base and
he<00:02:02.880> said<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.210> could<00:02:03.329> not<00:02:03.450> be<00:02:03.860> permanently

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
he said it could not be permanently

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.940 
he said it could not be permanently
dented<00:02:05.250> one<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.939> those<00:02:06.320> guys<00:02:07.320> worked<00:02:07.619> with<00:02:07.799> him

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
dented one of those guys worked with him

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.979 
dented one of those guys worked with him
took<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.489> sledgehammer<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.209> try<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.539> bend<00:02:09.869> it

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
took a sledgehammer and try to bend it

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.570 
took a sledgehammer and try to bend it
no<00:02:10.770> permanent<00:02:11.099> deformity<00:02:11.550> with<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.940> at<00:02:12.030> all

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
no permanent deformity with it at all

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.060 
no permanent deformity with it at all
so<00:02:12.820> this<00:02:13.030> is<00:02:13.180> very<00:02:13.450> strange<00:02:14.260> material<00:02:14.620> the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
so this is very strange material the

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.230 
so this is very strange material the
next<00:02:15.400> thing<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:15.640> looked<00:02:15.850> at<00:02:16.000> whether<00:02:16.150> they

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
next thing I looked at whether they

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.060 
next thing I looked at whether they
there's<00:02:16.540> some<00:02:16.870> little<00:02:17.110> beams<00:02:17.380> on<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:17.740> floor

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
there's some little beams on the floor

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.560 
there's some little beams on the floor
too<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.060> picked<00:02:19.300> one<00:02:19.360> look<00:02:19.870> like<00:02:19.900> metallic

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
too so I picked one look like metallic

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.630 
too so I picked one look like metallic
the<00:02:22.570> strangest<00:02:22.990> part<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.410> was<00:02:23.680> there<00:02:24.490> was

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
the strangest part of that was there was

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.110 
the strangest part of that was there was
some<00:02:24.960> writing<00:02:25.960> or<00:02:26.290> some<00:02:26.440> sort<00:02:26.620> of<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.830> of

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
some writing or some sort of a of

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.610 
some writing or some sort of a of
writing<00:02:28.120> along<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.390> inside<00:02:28.810> surface<00:02:29.260> of<00:02:29.410> this

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
writing along the inside surface of this

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.770 
writing along the inside surface of this
when<00:02:30.160> I<00:02:30.220> first<00:02:30.400> saw<00:02:30.640> I<00:02:30.670> thought<00:02:31.060> ah<00:02:31.210> this<00:02:31.420> looks

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
when I first saw I thought ah this looks

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.400 
when I first saw I thought ah this looks
like<00:02:31.900> Egyptian<00:02:32.830> hieroglyphics<00:02:33.520> but<00:02:34.410> closer

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
like Egyptian hieroglyphics but closer

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.710 
like Egyptian hieroglyphics but closer
inspection<00:02:35.800> it<00:02:36.190> was<00:02:36.340> not<00:02:36.630> hieroglyphics<00:02:37.630> is

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
inspection it was not hieroglyphics is

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.050 
inspection it was not hieroglyphics is
more<00:02:37.930> like<00:02:38.080> geometric<00:02:38.920> symbols<00:02:39.640> like<00:02:39.850> Oh

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
more like geometric symbols like Oh

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.270 
more like geometric symbols like Oh

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
that to the light over your shoulder

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.170 
that to the light over your shoulder
there'd<00:02:53.230> reflect<00:02:53.710> back<00:02:53.980> at<00:02:54.280> you<00:02:54.490> to<00:02:54.970> some

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
there'd reflect back at you to some

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.620 
there'd reflect back at you to some
degree<00:02:56.070> and<00:02:57.070> that<00:02:57.250> was<00:02:57.460> the<00:02:57.820> I<00:02:58.090> guess<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.420> most

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
degree and that was the I guess the most

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.840 
degree and that was the I guess the most
weird<00:02:59.170> part<00:02:59.800> of<00:02:59.860> the<00:02:59.920> whole<00:03:00.040> thing<00:03:00.280> there<00:03:00.550> this

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
weird part of the whole thing there this

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.730 
weird part of the whole thing there this
is<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.090> main<00:03:01.270> gate<00:03:01.480> whether<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:02.050> used<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:02.620> be<00:03:02.710> a

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
is the main gate whether it used to be a

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.360 
is the main gate whether it used to be a
concrete<00:03:04.320> station<00:03:05.320> here<00:03:05.470> for<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.740> gate<00:03:05.920> for

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
concrete station here for the gate for

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.560 
concrete station here for the gate for
the<00:03:06.430> guard<00:03:06.670> house<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:09.490> sign<00:03:09.730> for<00:03:09.970> RAF

the guard house and the sign for RAF
Roswell<00:03:11.110> Army<00:03:11.230> Airfield<00:03:11.410> was<00:03:11.710> right<00:03:11.860> there

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
Roswell Army Airfield was right there

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.490 
Roswell Army Airfield was right there
where<00:03:12.160> that<00:03:12.190> light<00:03:13.000> standard<00:03:13.450> is<00:03:13.630> so<00:03:14.290> they've

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
where that light standard is so they've

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.070 
where that light standard is so they've
taken<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:14.890> down<00:03:15.510> but<00:03:16.510> that's<00:03:16.780> where<00:03:16.959> the

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
taken that down but that's where the

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.960 
taken that down but that's where the
main<00:03:17.230> gate<00:03:17.470> was<00:03:17.709> that<00:03:17.950> that<00:03:18.430> she<00:03:18.520> had<00:03:18.640> passed

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
main gate was that that she had passed

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.210 
main gate was that that she had passed
through<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.360> get<00:03:19.480> on<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.110> base<00:03:20.230> yeah<00:03:20.980> that's

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
through to get on the base yeah that's

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.370 
through to get on the base yeah that's
where<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.459> control<00:03:21.820> tower<00:03:22.030> for<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.380> airbase

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
where the control tower for the airbase

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.160 
where the control tower for the airbase
wasn't<00:03:23.890> yeah<00:03:24.730> where<00:03:24.940> they<00:03:25.000> control<00:03:25.270> in<00:03:25.600> coming

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
wasn't yeah where they control in coming

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.330 
wasn't yeah where they control in coming
out<00:03:27.870> there<00:03:28.870> should<00:03:29.080> be<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.230> big<00:03:29.560> hangar<00:03:30.040> down

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
out there should be a big hangar down

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.460 
out there should be a big hangar down
this<00:03:30.610> way<00:03:30.820> where<00:03:31.330> they<00:03:31.420> brought<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.900> bodies

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
this way where they brought the bodies

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.220 
this way where they brought the bodies
in<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:33.340> brief<00:03:33.640> feel<00:03:33.880> first<00:03:34.120> because<00:03:35.080> there

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
in the brief feel first because there

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.520 
in the brief feel first because there
was<00:03:35.320> a<00:03:35.350> battery

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
was a battery

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.950 
was a battery
in<00:03:36.620> there<00:03:36.800> which<00:03:36.980> is<00:03:37.010> kind<00:03:37.310> of<00:03:37.960> sequestered

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
in there which is kind of sequestered

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.620 
in there which is kind of sequestered
and<00:03:39.260> that's<00:03:39.470> where<00:03:39.650> they<00:03:39.710> put<00:03:39.740> the<00:03:40.010> bodies

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
and that's where they put the bodies

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.300 
and that's where they put the bodies
my<00:03:41.780> dad<00:03:42.050> and<00:03:42.170> I<00:03:42.260> parently<00:03:42.620> under<00:03:43.130> the
