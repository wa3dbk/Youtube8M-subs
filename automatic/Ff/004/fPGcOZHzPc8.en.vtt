00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:09.910
 Hello is the well today, but there is no whether long-awaited us of you wait for the bell 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:14.260
 I would like to make a vinyl graphic 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:19.630
 Here's an image here and it 's just that my car already has such a vinyl graphic 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:22.170
 I'm painting on the side of the body, so here's a part of this video that I showed you in this previous video 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.280
 I'm sorry for Bobette 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:30.840
 I painted this liquid rubber spray and made a part of the bonnet matte black 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:34.559
 We want to win strong where I want you to was Well that has been bought in 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:39.330
 I want to change the design at each job, so I did not buy it so expensive 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.410
 Cutting sheet is a bit of experimental cutting sheet for the room 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.160
 I bought it 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.400
 Half of the cutting sheet for outdoor use 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:50.050
 Doing at the price of about wonder if this is was about 400 yen at one meter 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:52.930
 I wanted to put in a design that I could buy here but I got lost pattern with two types 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:59.949
 I mixed in thinking about the pattern or its design 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:01:00.940
 One is a camouflage pattern of the trend now or this world that will be the case, but this case will be the Office 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.150
 Cyber Chick 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.830
 Cyber destinations in such doubles 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.090
 Claire's the one or in the other simplistic for I mean to put the camouflage of fashion camo 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.810
 I was very lost but 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:16.340
 For the time being , I will make a burger at this time, so I feel like 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.400
 Koch is here that I would like to make this kind of design is Wow I bath in the rear side 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.610
 I will 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:25.610
 From a little various things to have crowded Ballmer labor imposing shop like if I have to pardon 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.920
 Many heavy weight 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:33.400
 This is 30 centimeters good luck once in a while I have not entered at all 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.000
 Actually I wonder if you say tracing paper from the house is there 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:44.500
 That's right, so I guess it's the current car 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:47.289
 I think that it is better to write to here after applying to the current car and changing to some extent 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:51.000
 But I am that 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.000
 I wonder if gone to gulp 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.600
 goo 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:06.259
 If a straight guy does Alba, go ahead and waste as much as possible if you want to go with the horns and win 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.259
 I can go without it 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:15.180
 It is enough, but proceed in total quite Asked we packed in 9 trout Gone are the draft in such a feeling 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.590
 Yes yes 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:26.730
 I will cut this putting mat and cut it 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:33.450
 If it is straight, you can use a cutter, but when cutting a curve, scissors are the best 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:35.340
 I think it seems that some people use a roller cutter personally 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.580
 If you have a solid paper 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:44.110
 In the front roller cutter It is difficult to hold the hair if you don't need to use it 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.160
 When I thought this way , they would fall into a school accident, or if there was such a god, there would be a roller 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:51.220
 I hope I won 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:57.520
 If I can hold it this way, I will hold the beetle slowly in the Aso phase, and the normal phase will be a beautiful circle . 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:59.600
 Bending force tee reduced to tomorrow by suppressing tee e 3 guitar After doing a roller not expired 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:05.150
 Tita Nakada adding power 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:07.130
 Here is it a force to sandwich in here when there awkward it amazing case it should not meet scissors 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:12.290
 It is this with the power to bend here 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:17.210
 If you bend it, you may not cut it round, or if you think of the direction of power, etc. Circle 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:20.800
 I think that I wonder if cutter would Nanchatte quite inefficient 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.800
 It is in the material from Namanda 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.550
 I completed the arrangement and cut it out like this 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.010
 Of course it would be better to be close 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.130
 About 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.780
 It's too close to underground water 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.780
 Here Kill Me place this 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.670
 Sweet and not do 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:51.730
 I 'm not angry that I 'm going to go here 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:57.090
 I or a little nagging I wonder a little more simple Oh because little nagging 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:04:00.360
 Well I wonder I wish whether here for good 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.450
 Let's be careful about people from here 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:08.940
 I think that I want to put it on the car by all means 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:12.930
 Let's see together from here in the secondary audio First of all get spray water containing detergent 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:17.070
 Please clean your body 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:21.989
 When it became clean to some extent, the detergent was blown again and the water was shaken 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:25.590
 Over and I also I will continue to it is stuck Dokogamizu, please safely the body pitch 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:29.970
 We will put a cutting sheet on which was Bichobicho 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:32.920
 Will move and went to do this pulse is not sunny at this time 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.920
 Now take advantage of this movement 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.880
 8th place strong 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:43.820
 Chanting you wonder if I'm 1 I mean throwing each army 1 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.820
 I will prepare it, I will continue to work together 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:52.550
 Hey Netto think of is first to align to the water clothes using masking tape I went 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:57.710
 There is also a way to say 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:05:02.510
 Well , I said that there wasn't a masking tape and I'm covered with heat like this 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:10.130
 I'm draining the water in squeegee 8, but I like felt cards with long ears I like felt hard cards 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:12.540
 It rolls around and floats water from the center to the outside with this This is completely from the inside 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:17.340
 Written by Plastics 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:18.240
 If I buy it, it will be full of cutting sheets or scratches of a beautiful summer guy 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.380
 Because 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:26.920
 Please refer to the attention 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:27.550
 And also moving mid-body of the pitch in mid-victory's also seal even in the same kind of feeling also genetic left and right 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.610
 Please give me 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.510
 Well it's better than swimming witchesa 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:37.600
 so 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:41.970
 In the same way, fine adjustment fine position alignment I hear it over and over again, so if you decide the best player 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.970
 It feels like you're draining water like this 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:49.200
 In the case of this left and right nalu how to say how to make it 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:52.260
 From the center of the wheel house It is from the center of goods 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:56.880
 There is a string and I use it to determine the radius 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:06:00.880
 Once you have determined the relationship with, transfer the length of the radius to the cutting sheet 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:04.540
 In I feel that say Kyu to your design mind 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:08.890
 How about it or not I think I became a hotel Hirotsuka 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:11.130
 If you think you are cool , please give it a high rating. 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.130
 Pile
