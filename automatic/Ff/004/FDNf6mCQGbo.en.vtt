different from the rest and the length

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.350 
different from the rest and the length
varies<00:02:05.830> a<00:02:05.860> bit<00:02:06.039> the<00:02:06.640> first<00:02:06.880> one<00:02:07.060> that<00:02:07.240> we're

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
varies a bit the first one that we're

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.749 
varies a bit the first one that we're
going<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:07.509> do<00:02:07.630> is<00:02:07.750> Rocky<00:02:08.110> Mountain<00:02:08.619> it's<00:02:09.429> the

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
with them now we have the free shot it

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.100 
with them now we have the free shot it
is<00:03:04.770> very<00:03:05.460> useful<00:03:05.670> for<00:03:06.180> stopping<00:03:06.570> opponents<00:03:07.020> in

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
is very useful for stopping opponents in

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.960 
is very useful for stopping opponents in
the<00:03:07.230> tracks<00:03:07.530> but<00:03:07.980> they<00:03:08.190> become<00:03:08.460> a<00:03:08.520> big<00:03:08.730> block

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
the tracks but they become a big block

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.460 
the tracks but they become a big block
of<00:03:09.000> ice<00:03:09.270> and<00:03:09.300> you<00:03:09.540> could<00:03:09.690> actually<00:03:09.780> run<00:03:10.170> into

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
of ice and you could actually run into

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.759 
of ice and you could actually run into
them<00:03:10.650> if<00:03:10.800> they're<00:03:10.950> still<00:03:11.160> frozen

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.140 

we've<00:03:14.769> just<00:03:14.950> been<00:03:15.129> hit<00:03:15.280> by<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.489> parachute

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
we've just been hit by the parachute

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.009 
we've just been hit by the parachute
which<00:03:16.330> we<00:03:16.540> will<00:03:16.720> see<00:03:17.260> ourselves<00:03:17.349> a<00:03:17.829> little<00:03:18.040> bit

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.589 

at<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.260> end<00:03:23.409> here<00:03:23.769> of<00:03:24.010> every<00:03:24.400> lap<00:03:24.579> I<00:03:24.970> have<00:03:25.450> to

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
at the end here of every lap I have to

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.690 
at the end here of every lap I have to
get<00:03:25.720> into<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.319> lift<00:03:26.500> station<00:03:27.099> and<00:03:27.250> as<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:27.549> can

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
get into the lift station and as you can

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.970 
get into the lift station and as you can
see<00:03:27.879> it<00:03:28.000> can<00:03:28.180> be<00:03:28.390> quite<00:03:28.629> a<00:03:29.019> chore<00:03:29.650> sometimes

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
see it can be quite a chore sometimes

the shots home and some don't the free

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
here we've got the fan which gives us a

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.410 
here we've got the fan which gives us a
speed<00:03:45.190> boost<00:03:45.430> for<00:03:45.610> a<00:03:45.670> bit<00:03:45.819> of<00:03:45.910> time<00:03:46.090> but<00:03:46.240> if<00:03:46.300> we

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
speed boost for a bit of time but if we

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.559 
speed boost for a bit of time but if we
get<00:03:46.540> hit<00:03:46.810> or<00:03:47.080> losing

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569

we<00:03:51.569> just<00:03:51.810> barely<00:03:52.080> hit<00:03:52.350> Tommy<00:03:52.590> with<00:03:52.860> their<00:03:52.980> snow

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250

with the bomb

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.020 
with the bomb
here's<00:04:55.170> the<00:04:55.320> last<00:04:55.530> of<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:56.010> five<00:04:56.340> shot<00:04:56.610> items

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
here's the last of the five shot items

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.650 
here's the last of the five shot items
the<00:04:57.180> slapstick<00:04:58.100> it's<00:04:59.100> much<00:05:00.000> easier<00:05:00.390> than<00:05:00.510> the

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
the slapstick it's much easier than the

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.390 
the slapstick it's much easier than the
bomb<00:05:00.870> who<00:05:01.290> you<00:05:01.410> want<00:05:01.590> are<00:05:01.710> yourself<00:05:02.130> with<00:05:02.280> a

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.950 

now<00:05:08.040> we've<00:05:08.250> got<00:05:08.430> a<00:05:08.460> pipe<00:05:08.700> on<00:05:08.910> herself<00:05:09.270> but<00:05:09.630> I'm

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
now we've got a pipe on herself but I'm

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.050 
now we've got a pipe on herself but I'm
waiting<00:05:10.410> to<00:05:10.680> use<00:05:10.830> it<00:05:11.010> again<00:05:11.340> because<00:05:11.670> pretty

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
waiting to use it again because pretty

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.300 
waiting to use it again because pretty
much<00:05:12.150> everyone<00:05:12.750> is<00:05:13.020> on<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.410> lift<00:05:13.620> and<00:05:13.920> so<00:05:14.190> it

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
much everyone is on the lift and so it

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.650 
much everyone is on the lift and so it
wouldn't<00:05:14.490> have<00:05:14.700> any<00:05:15.060> effect<00:05:15.090> that's<00:05:15.510> right

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
wouldn't have any effect that's right

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.380 
wouldn't have any effect that's right
now<00:05:15.870> oh<00:05:18.020> and<00:05:19.020> as<00:05:19.140> long<00:05:19.530> as<00:05:19.740> I<00:05:19.860> can<00:05:20.190> before<00:05:20.910> Tommy

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
get off but I've got to use it otherwise
