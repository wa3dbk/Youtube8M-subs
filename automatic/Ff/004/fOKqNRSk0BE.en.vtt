I'd like to show you how to use a couple
of<00:00:07.270> our<00:00:07.480> watercolor<00:00:08.080> mediums<00:00:08.740> those<00:00:09.490> being

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
of our watercolor mediums those being

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.280 
of our watercolor mediums those being
granulation<00:00:10.990> medium

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
granulation medium

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.720 
granulation medium
and<00:00:13.820> watercolor<00:00:14.820> medium<00:00:15.030> itself<00:00:16.550> so<00:00:17.550> I'd<00:00:17.610> like

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
and watercolor medium itself so I'd like

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.370 
and watercolor medium itself so I'd like
to<00:00:17.790> firstly<00:00:18.270> demonstrate<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.720> granulation

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380

certain colors within our range of

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.450 
certain colors within our range of
watercolors<00:00:24.300> can<00:00:24.570> be<00:00:24.720> classified<00:00:25.710> as<00:00:26.310> either

granular appearance already you can see

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.990 
granular appearance already you can see
it<00:00:42.930> looks<00:00:43.140> grainy<00:00:43.590> especially<00:00:44.370> when<00:00:44.520> watered

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
it looks grainy especially when watered

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
as if you can see individual particles

as if you can see individual particles
of<00:00:50.460> pigment<00:00:52.880> by<00:00:53.880> comparison<00:00:55.160> if<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.250> paint<00:00:56.610> out

winter blue red shade next to it you can
see<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.610> color<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.060> lot<00:01:09.270> smoother<00:01:09.780> it

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
see the color is a lot smoother it

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.950 
see the color is a lot smoother it
doesn't<00:01:10.290> have<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.470> grainy<00:01:11.100> appearance<00:01:11.960> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
doesn't have that grainy appearance the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.090 
doesn't have that grainy appearance the
cobalt<00:01:13.530> blue<00:01:13.619> does<00:01:15.920> now<00:01:18.289> if<00:01:19.289> I<00:01:19.500> want<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.830> make

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
cobalt blue does now if I want to make

cobalt blue does now if I want to make
the<00:01:20.869> Windsor<00:01:21.899> blue<00:01:22.289> red<00:01:22.590> shade<00:01:22.890> look<00:01:23.220> more

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the Windsor blue red shade look more

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.570 
the Windsor blue red shade look more
granular<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.619> also<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.770> cobalt<00:01:26.220> blue<00:01:26.250> look

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
granular and also the cobalt blue look

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.910 
granular and also the cobalt blue look
more<00:01:26.759> granular<00:01:27.270> what<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.140> need<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.439> do<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.740> add

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
more granular what I need to do is add

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.719 
more granular what I need to do is add
in<00:01:29.100> some<00:01:29.399> of<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.789> granulation<00:01:30.450> medium<00:01:31.729> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
in some of the granulation medium the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:43.910 
in some of the granulation medium the
trick<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.090> do<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.810> add<00:01:33.929> lots<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.409> it

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.650 

painting<00:01:44.920> out<00:01:45.100> underneath<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:48.600> cobalt<00:01:49.600> blue

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
painting out underneath the cobalt blue

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:59.180 
painting out underneath the cobalt blue
now<00:01:50.050> mix<00:01:50.320> neat<00:01:50.740> with<00:01:51.400> the<00:01:51.490> granulation<00:01:52.000> medium

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.590 

you<00:02:00.190> can<00:02:00.340> see<00:02:00.550> it<00:02:00.670> has<00:02:00.850> a<00:02:00.880> more<00:02:01.240> granular

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
you can see it has a more granular

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.020 
you can see it has a more granular
appearance<00:02:02.530> you<00:02:02.860> see<00:02:03.100> where<00:02:03.340> it's<00:02:03.550> tipples

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
appearance you see where it's tipples

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.060 
appearance you see where it's tipples
into<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:04.420> paper<00:02:04.690> here<00:02:05.080> it<00:02:05.200> looks<00:02:05.530> much<00:02:05.830> more

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
into the paper here it looks much more

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:14.720 
into the paper here it looks much more
granular<00:02:07.770> likewise<00:02:08.770> when<00:02:09.100> I<00:02:09.130> paint<00:02:09.520> out<00:02:09.820> the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.180 

Windsor<00:02:15.730> blue<00:02:15.940> red<00:02:16.180> shade<00:02:19.290> again<00:02:20.290> much<00:02:21.160> more

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
Windsor blue red shade again much more

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.350 
Windsor blue red shade again much more
granular<00:02:23.370> it's<00:02:24.370> worth<00:02:24.580> pointing<00:02:24.880> out<00:02:25.150> at<00:02:25.270> this

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
granular it's worth pointing out at this

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.390 
granular it's worth pointing out at this
point<00:02:25.570> it<00:02:25.930> does<00:02:26.170> actually<00:02:26.380> become<00:02:26.890> much<00:02:27.190> more

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
point it does actually become much more

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.520 
point it does actually become much more
evident<00:02:27.850> as<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.209> color<00:02:28.450> dries<00:02:28.840> as<00:02:29.110> well<00:02:29.290> that

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
evident as the color dries as well that

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.640 
evident as the color dries as well that
granulation<00:02:30.430> becomes<00:02:30.880> really<00:02:31.870> predominant

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
granulation becomes really predominant

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.680 
granulation becomes really predominant
as<00:02:32.770> the<00:02:33.160> color<00:02:33.400> drives<00:02:33.760> through

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.870 

the<00:02:38.290> trick<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.710> doing<00:02:38.740> this<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.430> make<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.730> work

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
the trick to doing this to make it work

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.240 
the trick to doing this to make it work
properly<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.570> to<00:02:40.720> add<00:02:40.840> lots<00:02:41.110> of<00:02:41.320> it<00:02:41.560> so<00:02:42.190> you

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
properly is to add lots of it so you

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.580 
properly is to add lots of it so you
will<00:02:42.490> sacrifice<00:02:42.970> some<00:02:43.480> opacity<00:02:44.080> that<00:02:44.320> is<00:02:44.440> to

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
will sacrifice some opacity that is to

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.840 
will sacrifice some opacity that is to
say<00:02:44.770> that<00:02:44.980> your<00:02:45.070> colors<00:02:45.430> are<00:02:45.580> going<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.760> be

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
say that your colors are going to be

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.660 
say that your colors are going to be
more<00:02:46.120> translucent<00:02:46.960> next<00:02:47.920> medium<00:02:48.250> I'd<00:02:48.370> like<00:02:48.520> to

now<00:03:03.550> what<00:03:03.700> this<00:03:03.850> medium<00:03:04.270> does<00:03:04.510> is<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:04.840> actually

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
now what this medium does is it actually

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.690 
now what this medium does is it actually
slows<00:03:05.440> down<00:03:05.740> the<00:03:05.890> drying<00:03:06.130> time<00:03:06.400> of<00:03:06.580> the

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
slows down the drying time of the

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.460 
slows down the drying time of the
watercolor<00:03:07.240> but<00:03:07.450> it<00:03:07.540> also<00:03:07.690> increases<00:03:08.140> the

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
watercolor but it also increases the

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.730 
watercolor but it also increases the
gloss<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.610> transparency<00:03:10.480> which<00:03:11.380> gives<00:03:11.590> you<00:03:11.710> a

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
gloss the transparency which gives you a

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.830 
gloss the transparency which gives you a
lot<00:03:11.950> more<00:03:12.100> depth<00:03:12.430> or<00:03:12.610> luminosity<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.690> the

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
lot more depth or luminosity to the

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.780 
lot more depth or luminosity to the
color<00:03:14.080> I've<00:03:14.560> mixed<00:03:14.770> some<00:03:14.920> watercolor<00:03:15.580> medium

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
color I've mixed some watercolor medium

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.940 
color I've mixed some watercolor medium
with<00:03:16.240> some<00:03:16.510> Windsor<00:03:16.900> red<00:03:17.080> deep<00:03:17.380> as<00:03:17.590> part<00:03:17.860> of

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
with some Windsor red deep as part of

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.550 
with some Windsor red deep as part of
this<00:03:18.160> wash<00:03:18.520> as<00:03:19.420> I've<00:03:19.630> put<00:03:19.840> it<00:03:19.930> over<00:03:20.050> the<00:03:20.260> page

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
this wash as I've put it over the page

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.880 
this wash as I've put it over the page
the<00:03:21.070> color<00:03:21.340> flows<00:03:21.640> really<00:03:22.000> nice<00:03:22.300> and<00:03:22.600> easy

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
the color flows really nice and easy

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.590 
the color flows really nice and easy
I've<00:03:23.890> also<00:03:24.100> put<00:03:24.460> it<00:03:24.580> into<00:03:24.820> my<00:03:24.940> pot<00:03:25.240> of<00:03:25.270> water

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
I've also put it into my pot of water

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.400 
I've also put it into my pot of water
you<00:03:26.470> can<00:03:26.650> see<00:03:26.830> that<00:03:27.040> it<00:03:27.160> wets<00:03:27.960> really<00:03:28.960> nice<00:03:29.140> and

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
you can see that it wets really nice and

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.220 
you can see that it wets really nice and
easily<00:03:29.770> and<00:03:29.890> flows<00:03:30.250> across<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.880> page<00:03:31.230> some

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
easily and flows across the page some

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.700 
easily and flows across the page some
nice<00:03:32.550> transparency<00:03:33.550> and<00:03:33.670> depth<00:03:34.000> there<00:03:34.710> and

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
nice transparency and depth there and

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:42.420 
nice transparency and depth there and
then<00:03:36.430> if<00:03:36.580> I<00:03:36.730> blend<00:03:37.060> in<00:03:37.360> some<00:03:39.150> winter<00:03:40.150> lemon<00:03:41.430> you

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
then if I blend in some winter lemon you

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.640 
then if I blend in some winter lemon you
can<00:03:42.490> see<00:03:42.820> that<00:03:43.030> they<00:03:43.150> both<00:03:43.360> flow<00:03:44.230> into<00:03:44.590> each

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
can see that they both flow into each

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.080 
can see that they both flow into each
other<00:03:44.950> nice<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.400> easy<00:03:45.520> and<00:03:45.730> this<00:03:45.820> is<00:03:45.970> all

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
other nice and easy and this is all

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.130 
other nice and easy and this is all
facilitated<00:03:46.930> by<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.200> watercolor<00:03:47.920> medium

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
facilitated by the watercolor medium

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:57.480 
facilitated by the watercolor medium
gives<00:03:50.140> you<00:03:50.260> this<00:03:50.380> extra<00:03:50.590> wetting<00:03:51.430> capability

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.160 

and<00:03:58.490> as<00:03:58.580> I<00:03:58.700> mentioned<00:03:59.090> earlier<00:03:59.180> you<00:03:59.630> will<00:03:59.960> get

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
and as I mentioned earlier you will get

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.620 
and as I mentioned earlier you will get
some<00:04:00.380> more<00:04:00.560> transparency<00:04:01.310> but<00:04:02.120> you<00:04:02.210> get<00:04:02.420> more

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
some more transparency but you get more

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.460 
some more transparency but you get more
depth<00:04:02.990> more<00:04:03.460> luminosity<00:04:04.900> this<00:04:05.900> winter<00:04:06.320> red

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
depth more luminosity this winter red

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.790 
depth more luminosity this winter red
deep<00:04:06.710> here<00:04:06.980> is<00:04:07.130> really<00:04:07.430> shining<00:04:07.880> now<00:04:08.800> it's

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
deep here is really shining now it's

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.320 
deep here is really shining now it's
worth<00:04:10.070> pointing<00:04:10.550> out<00:04:10.730> at<00:04:10.880> this<00:04:11.000> stage<00:04:11.180> that

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
worth pointing out at this stage that

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.690 
worth pointing out at this stage that
the<00:04:11.810> watercolor<00:04:12.440> medium<00:04:12.650> should<00:04:13.130> not<00:04:13.310> be<00:04:13.460> used

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
the watercolor medium should not be used

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.760 
the watercolor medium should not be used
neat<00:04:14.030> that<00:04:14.690> is<00:04:14.840> to<00:04:14.990> say<00:04:15.170> it<00:04:15.320> shouldn't<00:04:15.680> be

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
neat that is to say it shouldn't be

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.620 
neat that is to say it shouldn't be
mixed<00:04:16.070> directly<00:04:16.310> with<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:16.910> color<00:04:17.150> and<00:04:17.420> then

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
mixed directly with the color and then

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.289 
mixed directly with the color and then
applied<00:04:18.019> to<00:04:18.049> the<00:04:18.290> page<00:04:18.610> you<00:04:19.610> should<00:04:19.820> use<00:04:20.060> it<00:04:20.209> as

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
applied to the page you should use it as

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.660 
applied to the page you should use it as
part<00:04:20.600> of<00:04:20.630> a<00:04:20.720> watercolor<00:04:21.230> wash<00:04:21.620> or<00:04:22.190> indeed<00:04:22.520> you

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
part of a watercolor wash or indeed you

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.460 
part of a watercolor wash or indeed you
can<00:04:22.850> add<00:04:22.970> it<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.330> your<00:04:23.450> pot<00:04:23.780> of<00:04:23.990> water<00:04:24.230> that

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
can add it to your pot of water that

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.900 
can add it to your pot of water that
you're<00:04:24.620> using<00:04:24.890> during<00:04:25.310> your<00:04:25.460> painting

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
you're using during your painting

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.510 
you're using during your painting
session<00:04:26.290> knowing<00:04:27.290> then<00:04:27.530> that<00:04:27.830> every<00:04:27.950> time<00:04:28.340> you

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
session knowing then that every time you

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.340 
session knowing then that every time you
use<00:04:28.760> your<00:04:28.940> water<00:04:29.060> you're<00:04:29.660> getting<00:04:30.050> all<00:04:30.200> the

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
use your water you're getting all the

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.620 
use your water you're getting all the
benefits<00:04:30.830> of<00:04:30.980> the<00:04:31.070> watercolor<00:04:31.610> medium<00:04:31.850> with

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
benefits of the watercolor medium with

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.500 
benefits of the watercolor medium with
every<00:04:32.930> color<00:04:33.140> that<00:04:33.380> you<00:04:33.500> use<00:04:34.030> thick<00:04:35.030> films

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
every color that you use thick films

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.530 
every color that you use thick films
used<00:04:35.980> purely<00:04:36.980> with<00:04:37.130> watercolor<00:04:37.640> medium<00:04:37.850> can

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
used purely with watercolor medium can

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.990 
used purely with watercolor medium can

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
had a tendency to go brittle and indeed

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.470 
had a tendency to go brittle and indeed
crack<00:04:41.950> so<00:04:42.950> to<00:04:43.010> summarize<00:04:43.640> the<00:04:43.850> two<00:04:44.060> mediums

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
crack so to summarize the two mediums

the<00:04:45.470> trick<00:04:45.740> with<00:04:45.950> the<00:04:46.040> granulation<00:04:46.550> medium<00:04:47.120> is

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
the trick with the granulation medium is

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.030 
the trick with the granulation medium is
to<00:04:47.420> use<00:04:47.600> lots<00:04:47.870> of<00:04:48.050> it<00:04:48.260> and<00:04:48.380> it<00:04:48.680> makes<00:04:48.890> a

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
to use lots of it and it makes a

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.280 
to use lots of it and it makes a
granular<00:04:49.610> color<00:04:49.880> more<00:04:50.150> granular<00:04:50.720> and<00:04:50.900> a

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
granular color more granular and a

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.980 
granular color more granular and a
smooth<00:04:51.620> color<00:04:51.920> become<00:04:52.370> granular<00:04:53.030> and<00:04:53.240> with

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
smooth color become granular and with

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.350 
smooth color become granular and with
the<00:04:54.110> watercolor<00:04:54.710> medium<00:04:54.940> don't<00:04:55.940> use<00:04:56.120> it<00:04:56.270> on

the watercolor medium don't use it on

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.910 
the watercolor medium don't use it on
its<00:04:56.480> own<00:04:56.660> because<00:04:56.900> it<00:04:57.170> creates<00:04:57.470> a<00:04:57.590> brittle
