00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.590

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.869
 strawberry is a strawberry coated with 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.250
 white and covered with 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.820
 chocolate 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.090
 Guys, this is incredible, no secret. 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.190
 just prepare the brigadeiro and customize the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.250
 So your strawberry if you want to learn 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.250
 nor with me let's do it together 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.700
 to make our strawberry bonbons 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.399
 We'll need strawberries already. 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.770
 washed and without the way this recipe of the 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.560
 Brigadier covers about 15 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.890
 strawberries of these large one tablespoon of 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.799
 margarine 3 tablespoons milk powder 1 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.320
 can of condensed milk a can of 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.780
 chocolate milk cream from your 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.789
 preference to cover and here I am 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.299
 using white chocolate to 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:35.850
 decorate so let's start well it does not have 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.819
 Secrets just put in a pan the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.069
 margarine, condensed milk or 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:44.100
 milk and milk powder 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:46.200
 now we're going to turn it on low and 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.450
 cooking until the mixture 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.729
 personal pot 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.250
 Brigadier is like this, now we go. 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.709
 let it cool so we can roll 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.959
 Okay, I left about 40 minutes in the 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:00.420
 cooler and now it's just 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:05.310
 involve strawberries as brigadier we 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.890
 Let's join hands and get ready. 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.989
 I only did a few for you to see. 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.209
 but the revenue yields approximately 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.940
 fifteen of those giant strawberries to whom 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.670
 like the strawberries ready we go 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.769
 melt the chocolate I'll leave it 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.739
 approximately 30 seconds on the 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.750
 microwave and take pleasure as it is 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.739
 and then if you have not completely 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.560
 melted 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.810
 we put a little more like this 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.480
 we do not run the risk of burning the 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.640
 chocolate then melted it's just 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.230
 stir until well blended 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.260
 can always beware of chocolate 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.290
 because sometimes he seems to be still 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.080
 in solid form but only to touch it 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.760
 already disassembled so he deceives a lot 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.760
 and now just pick up strawberries 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.820

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:10.159
 strawberries now bathed in chocolate 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.750
 white already melted and a fork I go 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.750

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.510

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.400

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.530
