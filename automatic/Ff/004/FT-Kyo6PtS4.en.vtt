00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.769 

next<00:00:04.680> step<00:00:04.890> is<00:00:05.100> to<00:00:05.310> determine<00:00:05.550> what<00:00:06.510> kind<00:00:06.720> of

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
next step is to determine what kind of

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.340 
next step is to determine what kind of
shape<00:00:07.050> we<00:00:07.260> want<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.560> put<00:00:07.740> on<00:00:07.859> this<00:00:08.069> thing<00:00:08.370> and

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:09.350 
shape we want to put on this thing and

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.430 
shape we want to put on this thing and
1st<00:00:10.350> will<00:00:10.530> taper<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.520> bottom<00:00:11.880> side<00:00:12.090> down<00:00:12.450> to

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
1st will taper the bottom side down to

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.470 
1st will taper the bottom side down to
match<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:15.529> sizing<00:00:16.529> ring<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.270> then<00:00:18.270> we'll

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
match the sizing ring and then we'll

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.710 
match the sizing ring and then we'll
maybe<00:00:19.020> swing<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.560> up<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.980> curve<00:00:20.520> off<00:00:20.759> into<00:00:21.630> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
maybe swing it up and curve off into the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.979 
maybe swing it up and curve off into the
top<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.230> make<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.560> kind<00:00:22.860> of<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.070> round<00:00:24.029> Conan

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:24.989

top to make that kind of a round Conan
shape<00:00:25.230> out<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.560> it

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:54.120

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.050 

using<00:01:55.130> this<00:01:55.360> smaller<00:01:56.360> scraper<00:01:56.840> a<00:01:57.760> half<00:01:58.760> inch

using this smaller scraper a half inch
I'm<00:01:59.690> going<00:01:59.840> to<00:01:59.960> put<00:02:00.140> a<00:02:00.170> little<00:02:00.320> cove<00:02:01.100> right<00:02:01.460> in

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
I'm going to put a little cove right in

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:41.460 
I'm going to put a little cove right in
there

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470

the<00:02:42.470> battle<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.840> then<00:02:45.020> continue<00:02:45.590> rounding

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
the battle and then continue rounding

00:02:46.010 --> 00:03:11.949 
the battle and then continue rounding
off<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.370> top

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.289 

now<00:03:12.959> i'm<00:03:13.049> going<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.349> remove<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.920> tail<00:03:14.159> side

guide<00:03:24.780> around<00:03:25.019> just<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.680> little<00:03:25.709> bit<00:03:26.129> to<00:03:26.340> help

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
guide around just a little bit to help

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:42.110 
guide around just a little bit to help
me<00:03:26.730> maintain<00:03:27.329> that<00:03:27.989> curb<00:03:40.340> need<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.459> get<00:03:41.609> the

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
me maintain that curb need to get the

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.629 
me maintain that curb need to get the
closer<00:03:42.950> you<00:03:43.950> notice<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.519> change<00:03:44.819> in<00:03:45.000> sound

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
closer you notice the change in sound

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:49.430 
closer you notice the change in sound
that's<00:03:47.639> two<00:03:48.030> reasons<00:03:48.750> for<00:03:48.930> that<00:03:48.989> first

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
that's two reasons for that first

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.860 
that's two reasons for that first
removing<00:03:50.129> a<00:03:50.250> tail<00:03:50.519> stock<00:03:50.879> and<00:03:51.150> second<00:03:51.540> I<00:03:51.629> had

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
removing a tail stock and second I had

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.140 
removing a tail stock and second I had
it<00:03:52.019> a<00:03:52.109> little<00:03:52.290> too<00:03:52.530> far<00:03:52.829> away<00:03:52.980> from<00:03:53.159> the<00:03:53.430> tools

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
it a little too far away from the tools

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
it a little too far away from the tools
to<00:03:54.540> rest

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.390 

I'm<00:04:16.170> actually<00:04:16.350> increases<00:04:16.980> speed<00:04:17.160> a<00:04:17.220> little

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
I'm actually increases speed a little

00:04:17.400 --> 00:05:01.400 
I'm actually increases speed a little
bigger<00:04:17.670> now<00:04:17.790> to<00:04:20.630> 14

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.520 

and<00:05:02.410> then<00:05:02.590> I'll<00:05:02.740> slide<00:05:03.040> the<00:05:03.220> tool<00:05:03.430> stock<00:05:04.530> to

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
and then I'll slide the tool stock to

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.100 
and then I'll slide the tool stock to
arrest<00:05:05.860> I<00:05:06.040> me<00:05:06.100> around<00:05:06.580> a<00:05:06.730> little<00:05:06.760> further<00:05:07.270> I'm

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
arrest I me around a little further I'm

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.780 
arrest I me around a little further I'm
not<00:05:08.260> going<00:05:08.410> to<00:05:08.500> make<00:05:08.590> that<00:05:08.650> end<00:05:09.070> perfectly

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
not going to make that end perfectly

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.580 
not going to make that end perfectly
round<00:05:10.060> I'll<00:05:10.240> leave<00:05:10.450> a<00:05:10.480> little<00:05:10.780> flat<00:05:11.050> spot<00:05:11.380> on

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
round I'll leave a little flat spot on

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.300 
round I'll leave a little flat spot on
it<00:05:11.830> but<00:05:12.070> just<00:05:12.700> to<00:05:13.350> smooth<00:05:14.350> the<00:05:14.560> transition<00:05:14.710> in

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
it but just to smooth the transition in

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:37.590 
it but just to smooth the transition in
a<00:05:15.340> little<00:05:15.640> bit<00:05:34.080> that<00:05:35.080> looks<00:05:35.380> pretty<00:05:35.620> good<00:05:36.600> for

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
a little bit that looks pretty good for

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.830 
a little bit that looks pretty good for
a<00:05:37.660> basic<00:05:37.930> shape<00:05:41.220> so<00:05:42.220> as<00:05:42.250> you<00:05:42.430> can<00:05:42.520> see<00:05:42.790> using<00:05:43.570> a

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
a basic shape so as you can see using a

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.190 
a basic shape so as you can see using a
scraper<00:05:44.200> makes<00:05:45.160> pretty<00:05:45.430> quick<00:05:45.790> work<00:05:46.030> of<00:05:46.330> the

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
scraper makes pretty quick work of the

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.800 
scraper makes pretty quick work of the
basic<00:05:47.620> turning<00:05:48.100> and<00:05:48.460> it's<00:05:48.910> actually<00:05:49.060> I<00:05:49.540> know

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
basic turning and it's actually I know

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.510 
basic turning and it's actually I know
you<00:05:50.110> can't<00:05:50.350> see<00:05:50.530> it<00:05:50.620> in<00:05:50.740> the<00:05:50.860> video<00:05:50.980> but<00:05:51.370> it's

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
you can't see it in the video but it's

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.380 
you can't see it in the video but it's
actually<00:05:51.880> a<00:05:51.940> very<00:05:52.110> smooth<00:05:53.110> surface<00:05:53.710> because<00:05:54.100> I

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
actually a very smooth surface because I

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.410 
actually a very smooth surface because I
kept<00:05:55.390> this<00:05:55.780> paper<00:05:56.590> blades<00:05:56.980> a<00:05:57.250> sharp<00:05:57.580> sharpened

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:58.420 
kept this paper blades a sharp sharpened

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.300 
kept this paper blades a sharp sharpened
it<00:05:58.510> before<00:05:58.840> I<00:05:58.870> started<00:05:59.320> as<00:05:59.500> you<00:05:59.680> saw<00:05:59.920> and<00:06:00.220> i

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
it before I started as you saw and i

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.850 
it before I started as you saw and i
sharpened<00:06:00.880> once<00:06:01.090> in<00:06:01.300> between<00:06:01.750> and<00:06:02.490> the<00:06:04.860> next

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
sharpened once in between and the next

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.940 
sharpened once in between and the next
step<00:06:06.040> is<00:06:06.430> to<00:06:06.790> sand<00:06:07.450> it<00:06:07.750> and<00:06:07.930> put<00:06:08.440> a<00:06:08.470> finish<00:06:08.680> on

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950 
step is to sand it and put a finish on

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.510 
step is to sand it and put a finish on
it<00:06:09.010> and<00:06:09.340> we're<00:06:09.790> just<00:06:10.210> about<00:06:10.360> done
