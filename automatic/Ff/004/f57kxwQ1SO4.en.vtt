00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.250
 we are on the way in the idyllic 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.170
 Eifel and that with a soft buzzing 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.619
 electric drive more precisely with the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.539
 lexus gs300 hair with hybrid motor the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.430
 The top brand of the toyota group is 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.830
 already successful in the usa 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.789
 and wants with a new design and driving pleasure 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.470
 now also in europe points 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.219
 there is a small one for that 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.510
 development center near by 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.040
 Brussels in zaventem 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.320
 There are certain parts like 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.090
 chassis setup for example again 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.870
 completely on the needs and 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.399
 Demands of the countries voted this 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.770
 new body design is special 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.510
 at the front end on the bulky 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.160
 sweeping grille with big ones 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.469
 Air inlets forms the new 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.870
 Brand face of lexus with a 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.690
 car length of just under four meters 60 and 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.359
 a turning circle of eleven meters lets 20 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.879
 the japanese maneuver well small 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.489
 pillars on door pillars and 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.900
 are rear lights the better it 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.900
 give aerodynamics 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.800
 our test driver magistrate will denise 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.220
 300 ha with the following technical data 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.220
 driving a test 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.070
 in the f 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.810
 sport variant bring on 25 liters 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.750
 four-cylinder and the electric motor 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.130
 together a system performance of 164 kw 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.110
 to the rear wheels 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.020
 that's enough for an acceleration in 8 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.509
 3 seconds from zero to 100 km h the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.080
 top speed is at 200 km h 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.080
 reached 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.990
 so it's really athletic yes 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.330
 not in my eyes I have 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.159
 Although here so a nice reriker with it 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.430
 can i turn right on sport s or 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.409
 sport s plus but in just about everyone 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.960
 curve that drove a bit faster 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.549
 is attacking the esp so something 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.509
 it's not true either is the esp 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:12.910
 very sensitive or that forgets 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.790
 not a bit dug up 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.640
 the ergonomics are good you come to all 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.670
 important things immediately and also the 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.780
 Buttons are against the others 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.870
 custom at toyota and lexus models 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.739
 relatively petite and this with the 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.690
 Temperature control I think so synonymous 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.160
 very interesting something 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.069
 I need to get used to this 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.790
 joystick service for the entertainment 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.610
 system 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.799
 but if you have practiced a bit 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.239
 then that is not really so 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.630
 bad what i miss 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.430
 storage options for example for the 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.620
 key because the car is here 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.120
 equipped with keyless go and now 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.250
 I have the key here in the 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.560
 Cup holder done because I'm up here 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.160
 nowhere else have a place or 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.270
 is in good hands 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.000
 I really like that one 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.620
 Fabric reference to the column at the column 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.910
 and in the roof sky 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:16.540
 that makes a very good impression very much 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.190
 I really like the digital 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.570
 combination instrument that bring here with 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.190
 it is also equipped 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.470
 can move if I'm here on the 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.790
 button press phenomenal so that pleases 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.570
 Of course, I'm very good at playing games 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.980
 but funny game alone with the 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.410
 special features this well 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.750
 entertaining but also quite useful 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.030
 So he can score points 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.800
 the most interesting one asks at one 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.320
 hybrid car, however, is the consumption 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.570
 here shows the 300 ha for one 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.000
 sedan already quite sustainable 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.850
 an empty weight of over 1700 kilograms 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.190
 consumption of sports according to manufacturer 4 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.770
 7 liters per 100 kilometers makes it 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.020
 a co2 output of 109 grams per 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:01.060
 kilometer for a limousine with 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.060
 Petrol engine a respectable value 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:11.310
 Conclusion so what the design is concerned 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.360
 could me the lexus gs quite 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.850
 to convince 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.760
 but as far as the sportiness is concerned 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:21.200
 in the variant f sport has me so 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.200
 a little bit the last kick was missing
