00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.050
 total that have not arrived between them 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.920
 falcon that is super quoted that is 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.870
 very complicated to find right now 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.970
 but good if someone knows giving what 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.370

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.460
 open to the don fist of spiderman 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.770
 pretty cool character and see what 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.739
 such the powers that he has besides one that 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.800
 has the dolls of disney infinity 2.0 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.329
 is that they have levels they have skills 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.370
 that we can customize according to 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.070
 we level up the character as such to 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.540
 the letter is worth the letter for applications 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.729
 there we have iron fist we see here the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.440
 another part of the letter covered the code 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.440
 so you can use it filled me 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:20.429

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:25.100

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:28.670
 the finish that has to the truth 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.820
 is that it's pretty pretty good 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.810
 well there we have it 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.220
