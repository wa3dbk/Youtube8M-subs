00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:02.720
 Yes it is 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.930
 in the afternoon and well that the dehesa the farm states for their salaries from 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.209
 always to talk 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:12.019
 with all of you what is this this program 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.799
 dedicated to america today I come as happy as sure because simple and 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.820
 simply segob quite bad yesterday did not have to go around the 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.739
 yesterday things will not go well and we will talk and everyone will give their 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:27.890
 point of view but we have a very well interesting program here with fernando 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.539
 jesús towers here I'm glad to doubt it and we were going to talk 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:36.460
 dls party we will have directly the version of the 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.070
 situation of yambo seiu why this 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.890
 trying to fix at the last minute with the birmingham city that 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.000
 club from england that is putting at least the offer though if tomorrow at 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.300
 Three o'clock in the afternoon from England do not make the payment do not deposit the money 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.650
 because this negotiation will have fallen because there is a clause in the 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.550
 Yambo seal contract that had a good offer that would agree both 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.210
 parts would be given I'll be able to leave if this happens well already explained to us by the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.910
 American directive because also to america the term is closed tomorrow to 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.490
 twelve o'clock at night to register another player so in a bad moment of 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.960
 have a link neither with the American club directive because today it is only the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.130
 gold balls 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.440
 and that's why the beginning of the lolo ovi cimos with the nominees of the club america 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.100
 it does not give much pleasure 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.440
 that are the steering wheel of recovery the means to take off the offensive steering wheel that 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:37.270
 disburse 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.189
 and the rookie of the year they are squares you only know how is your tribal area 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.130
 that the people who 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.479
 accompany us this area and the bet that we are and how you comment 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.799
 the American played for nothing well this match against necaxa particularly in 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.830
 the first time in the second 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.280
 its part of what the Americanist team hobby wants overturned in front a 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.479
 offensive team that seeks equal function 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.969
 Whether or not it will be the result is football stuff but let's introduce ourselves 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:01.549
 team 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.100
 - or was left without speculative equipment that this 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.350
 waiting for what rival offer according to equipment that concerns the rival and 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.319
 america in the second half tried and if you get at least the draw 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.970
 which he reiterated is still bad for the aspirations of the Americanist cadre and 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.220
 We say it as such so that later we will not be accused of protecting the 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.800
 america the directive and that we are employees of I do not know how many people 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.249
 there we are but since we are with the manor of loíza in the lineup 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.789
 the vice president club america many days to take the call I know I'm 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:34.649
 taking out of the golden ball award that certainly will not allow 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:36.740
 nine o'clock in the evening on televisa sports network 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.290
 We are in the zone and in the America program to ask you Juan 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.640
 official situation 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.950
 villalobos and iu 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.559
 in those instants that the script 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:47.960
 the hormone late 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.869
 the promoter pair with you is a person and the 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:54.839
 come back to raul I can tell you that it was on Saturday the 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:03:00.129
 negotiations we received the offer of the limit to the deficit of portugal to the 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:01.129
 premier league 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.810
 percent and to hire 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.639
 the player of both clubs 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.999
 cd the first exposure of mixco america can always keep 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:12.369
 to your active all football 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:15.739
 keep the player at least from here to December that was what 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.679
 we look for in the negotiations with the same ticket 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:22.249
 unfortunately he entered the plans of the English club no no other exists 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:23.379
 possibility 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.269
 and the club had a commitment already agreed with the player 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:32.259
 percent based on quality conditions the English club met and the 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:35.519
 today we have signed a contract with the English club 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.519
 of definitive sale the player who added 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.269
 now luckily 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.620
 yes tomorrow surely according to the fifa regulation 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:49.549
 they have to deposit until before three in the afternoon pray england 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.750
 for this to be completely official and has done 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.559
 today the deposit arrived 

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:58.409
 all the deposit has not arrived the deposit they have until six o'clock 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:02.779
 the evening hour of england 6 is noon our diener moment that 

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:06.099
 this register the deposit the club america frees 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.979
 the transaction in the tms system of the fifa 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:12.889
 and with that automatically the Mexican federation leads the pass 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:16.189
 international lala federation of English to 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:19.839
 is obviously obviously we have to wait a few hours and there is a possibility 

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:24.460
 what percent the transaction comes to fruition 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.949
 all this is aware the player is aware of us 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.610
 and we are doing what is humanly possible so that you can but also 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.460
 we are clear in the possibility I know that it is not seen by the times and that the 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.080
 player rejoins the squad 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.509
 with this situation the america will stay with four foreigners 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.330
 although there is a technical possibility that you can register another 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.059
 player 

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:52.180
 until before midnight if I'm not wrong 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.860
 in Mexican soccer 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.770
 alfie now ficyt this possibility 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.110
 percent congruent with seeing the situation and with the times the 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.000
 probability is very low in the sense that negotiation should be done 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.430
 of a player 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.919
 hiring times negotiating with the club 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.069
 the work area if there is such 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.460
 i in the festival 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.479
 the international transfer certificate caused the next 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:19.979
 hours 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.589
 which is loose very complicated 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:25.979
 and practically impossible not to show if it would be at 11 o'clock in the 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.400
 morning of spain nothing 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.370
 brands like stella exhibitions cinema or I enjoy a lot of taste 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.880
 the question is whether she has been consistent in england with an emissary 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.880
 of and america to finalize all ordaz 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.070
 the colon profession 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.190
 until today early to you a few hours more to be successful and those on the side 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.969
 straight 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.309
 and he left alone 

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:50.729
 all negotiations with none of the board of the English club 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:52.610
 they were each in their offices 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.289
 us here in Mexico and they in being 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.539
 state slope is very clear effect from america 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:02.199
 it will be practically a fact with four foreigners I thank you 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.100

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.869
 yesterday the golden ball to see if out there 

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:07.990
