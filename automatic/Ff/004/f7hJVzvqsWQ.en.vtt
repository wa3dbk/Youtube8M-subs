frequently now with the action back to

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.010 
frequently now with the action back to
Ike<00:00:37.770> Haxton<00:00:38.250> he's<00:00:38.760> going<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.180> re-raise

Ike Haxton he's going to re-raise
which<00:00:40.649> leaves<00:00:40.890> Visser<00:00:41.399> with<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> decision

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
which leaves Visser with a decision

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.100 
which leaves Visser with a decision
should<00:00:43.230> he<00:00:43.379> fold<00:00:43.829> call<00:00:44.820> or<00:00:45.180> raise<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.960> this

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
should he fold call or raise in this

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.209 
should he fold call or raise in this
situation<00:00:47.930> he<00:00:48.930> should<00:00:49.140> call<00:00:49.410> facing<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
situation he should call facing the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.380 
situation he should call facing the
fourth<00:00:50.579> bet<00:00:50.940> he<00:00:51.899> wants<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.199> go<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.590> flop<00:00:52.920> and

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
fourth bet he wants to go to a flop and

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.850 
fourth bet he wants to go to a flop and
then<00:00:54.390> determine<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> strength<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.530> his<00:00:55.620> hand

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
then determine the strength of his hand

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.200 
then determine the strength of his hand
so<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.550> flop<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.440> 210<00:00:58.440> for<00:00:59.160> there<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.940> no

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
so on this flop of 210 for there is no

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.049 
so on this flop of 210 for there is no
Ace<00:01:00.480> or<00:01:00.690> King<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.440> therefore<00:01:02.280> vivir<00:01:02.699> can<00:01:02.940> be

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
Ace or King and therefore vivir can be

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.050 
Ace or King and therefore vivir can be
confident<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.870> strength<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.769> his<00:01:04.830> hand

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.039 

Paxton<00:01:09.060> will<00:01:09.659> follow<00:01:09.990> through<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.650> bet

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
Paxton will follow through with a bet

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.260 
Paxton will follow through with a bet
which<00:01:13.049> puts<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> decision<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.189> differ<00:01:14.460> now

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
which puts the decision to differ now

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.310 
which puts the decision to differ now
what<00:01:15.509> would<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.930> do<00:01:16.170> here<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.650> his<00:01:17.040> spot<00:01:17.340> call

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
what would you do here in his spot call

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.850 
what would you do here in his spot call
raise<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.640> 15,000<00:01:20.640> or<00:01:20.840> go<00:01:21.840> all-in<00:01:22.020> if<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.770> are

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
raise to 15,000 or go all-in if you are

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.480 
raise to 15,000 or go all-in if you are
on<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.159> big<00:01:23.340> stack<00:01:26.509> differ<00:01:27.509> should<00:01:27.720> raise<00:01:27.990> to

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
on the big stack differ should raise to

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.490 
on the big stack differ should raise to
15,000<00:01:29.490> you'll<00:01:29.670> notice<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.150> Haxton<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:31.470> a

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
15,000 you'll notice that Haxton is on a

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.749 
15,000 you'll notice that Haxton is on a
shorter<00:01:32.070> stack<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:32.970> by<00:01:33.630> raising<00:01:34.759> differ

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
shorter stack here and by raising differ

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.030 
shorter stack here and by raising differ
can<00:01:35.939> essentially<00:01:36.540> commit<00:01:37.290> himself<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.770> this

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
can essentially commit himself to this

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.060 
can essentially commit himself to this
hand<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.750> put<00:01:39.750> Haxton<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.470> decision<00:01:40.740> for

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
hand and put Haxton to a decision for

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.920 
hand and put Haxton to a decision for
his<00:01:41.189> stack<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.670> see<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.000> Haxton<00:01:42.630> does

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
his stack and you see that Haxton does

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.230 
his stack and you see that Haxton does
go<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:43.439> for<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> rest<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.729> his<00:01:44.820> remaining

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
go in for the rest of his remaining

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.710 
go in for the rest of his remaining
stack<00:01:45.829> 21,000<00:01:46.850> vivir<00:01:47.850> will<00:01:48.090> make<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.450> call

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
stack 21,000 vivir will make the call

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.260 
stack 21,000 vivir will make the call
well<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.860> front<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.880> players<00:01:51.149> have

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
well in front and the players have

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.330 
well in front and the players have
decided<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.990> run<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.320> twice<00:01:52.470> which<00:01:52.920> means<00:01:52.950> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
decided to run it twice which means the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.969 
decided to run it twice which means the
pot<00:01:53.579> will<00:01:54.030> essentially<00:01:54.600> be<00:01:55.049> divided<00:01:55.530> into<00:01:55.770> two

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
pot will essentially be divided into two

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.399 
pot will essentially be divided into two
and<00:01:56.280> they<00:01:56.850> will<00:01:57.000> deal<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.509> turn<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.110> River

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
and they will deal the turn and River

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.100 
and they will deal the turn and River
twice<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.310> there<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.759> first<00:02:00.060> deal<00:02:00.570> which

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
twice so there is the first deal which

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.889 
twice so there is the first deal which
runs<00:02:01.380> out<00:02:01.590> Jack<00:02:02.040> Jack<00:02:02.549> differs<00:02:03.450> gonna<00:02:03.630> win

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
runs out Jack Jack differs gonna win

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.340 
runs out Jack Jack differs gonna win
that<00:02:04.200> first<00:02:04.560> half<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.250> pot<00:02:05.509> on<00:02:06.509> our<00:02:06.780> second

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
that first half of the pot on our second

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.790 
that first half of the pot on our second
board<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.740> runs<00:02:07.950> out<00:02:08.149> 310<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.899> vivir<00:02:10.319> will<00:02:10.560> win

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800
