00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.950 
Michelle Dessler
I<00:00:17.869> think<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.170> storyline<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:20.250> video<00:00:20.520> game

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
I think the storyline of this video game

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.109 
I think the storyline of this video game
really<00:00:21.960> fills<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.710> lot<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.890> gaps<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
really fills in a lot of gaps that the

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.710 
really fills in a lot of gaps that the
audience<00:00:24.449> might<00:00:24.949> be<00:00:25.949> missing<00:00:26.430> from<00:00:26.820> season<00:00:27.599> 2

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
audience might be missing from season 2

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.460 
audience might be missing from season 2
to<00:00:27.840> 3<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.279> a<00:00:29.279> lot<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:29.880> fans<00:00:30.750> always<00:00:31.109> come<00:00:31.349> up

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
to 3 and a lot of fans always come up

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.090 
to 3 and a lot of fans always come up
and<00:00:31.650> ask<00:00:32.219> ok<00:00:33.290> how<00:00:34.290> did<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.500> happen<00:00:34.920> how<00:00:35.070> did

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
and ask ok how did this happen how did

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.810 
and ask ok how did this happen how did
you<00:00:35.309> get<00:00:35.430> together

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
you get together

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.209 
you get together
well<00:00:36.450> how<00:00:36.570> did<00:00:36.630> when<00:00:37.440> do<00:00:37.530> these<00:00:37.649> two<00:00:38.070> people

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
well how did when do these two people

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.069 
well how did when do these two people
first<00:00:38.610> meet<00:00:38.850> what<00:00:39.210> happened<00:00:39.540> why<00:00:39.629> did<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.870> fall

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
first meet what happened why did it fall

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.110 
first meet what happened why did it fall
apart<00:00:40.379> what<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.860> know<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.340> there's<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:41.760> much

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
apart what you know so there's so much

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.610 
apart what you know so there's so much
storyline<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.780> fill<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.050> there's<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.469> much

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
storyline to fill in there's so much

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.380 
storyline to fill in there's so much
action<00:00:43.920> that's<00:00:44.280> taking<00:00:44.640> place<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:45.000> other<00:00:45.180> days

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
action that's taking place on other days

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.650 
action that's taking place on other days
and<00:00:45.890> I<00:00:46.890> think<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.430> fills<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.120> lot<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.510> those

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
and I think this fills in a lot of those

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.770 
and I think this fills in a lot of those
unanswered<00:00:49.170> questions<00:00:53.090> you<00:00:54.090> know<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.239> hope

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
unanswered questions you know I hope

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.130 
unanswered questions you know I hope
that<00:00:55.110> I'm<00:00:55.320> as<00:00:55.530> loyal<00:00:55.739> as<00:00:56.420> Michelle<00:00:57.420> as<00:00:57.780> honest

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
that I'm as loyal as Michelle as honest

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.639 
that I'm as loyal as Michelle as honest
as<00:00:58.289> Michelle<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.789> don't<00:00:59.940> know<00:01:00.180> if<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.660> could

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
as Michelle and I don't know if I could

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.759 
as Michelle and I don't know if I could
be<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:01.980> create<00:01:02.430> her<00:01:02.730> Aegis<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:03.589> Michelle<00:01:04.589> or

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
be as create her Aegis as Michelle or

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.560 
be as create her Aegis as Michelle or
any<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.040> these<00:01:05.129> characters<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:06.090> think<00:01:06.150> it's

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
any of these characters I think it's

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.020 
any of these characters I think it's
something<00:01:07.100> you<00:01:08.100> don't<00:01:08.189> know<00:01:08.460> until<00:01:08.790> you're<00:01:08.970> in

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
something you don't know until you're in

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.270 
something you don't know until you're in
that<00:01:09.240> situation<00:01:09.470> there's<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.530> there's<00:01:10.979> there

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
that situation there's a there's there

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.160 
that situation there's a there's there
are<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.430> lot<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.549> things<00:01:11.909> about<00:01:12.150> being<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
are a lot of things about being in the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.100 
are a lot of things about being in the
office<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:14.010> it's<00:01:14.970> not<00:01:15.150> as<00:01:15.270> exciting<00:01:15.570> as<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
office and it's not as exciting as the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.899 
office and it's not as exciting as the
field<00:01:16.380> but<00:01:16.650> there<00:01:16.799> are<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.950> lot<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.100> challenges

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
field but there are a lot of challenges

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.190 
field but there are a lot of challenges
as<00:01:18.060> far<00:01:18.090> as<00:01:18.950> solving<00:01:19.950> puzzles<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:21.140> sort<00:01:22.140> of

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
as far as solving puzzles that sort of

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.719 
as far as solving puzzles that sort of
thing<00:01:22.380> when<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.799> was<00:01:22.890> doing<00:01:23.070> science<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.549> math

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
thing when I was doing science and math

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.609 
thing when I was doing science and math
I<00:01:24.060> think<00:01:24.360> that's<00:01:24.659> maybe<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.960> similarity<00:01:25.500> I

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
I think that's maybe a similarity I

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.590 
I think that's maybe a similarity I
really<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:26.070> I'm<00:01:26.580> not<00:01:26.759> as<00:01:26.909> technically<00:01:27.390> savvy

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
really I I'm not as technically savvy

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.679 
really I I'm not as technically savvy
but<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.229> did<00:01:28.890> study<00:01:29.130> science<00:01:29.549> my<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:29.970> feel<00:01:30.509> like

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
but I did study science my but feel like

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.410 
but I did study science my but feel like
there's<00:01:30.900> some<00:01:31.439> gratification<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.520> cracking

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
there's some gratification and cracking

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.560 
there's some gratification and cracking
a<00:01:33.689> puzzle<00:01:37.040> it<00:01:38.040> was<00:01:38.220> really<00:01:38.549> strange<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.150> see

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
a puzzle it was really strange to see

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.410 
a puzzle it was really strange to see
myself<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.409> everyone<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> video<00:01:41.880> game<00:01:42.150> I

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
myself and everyone in the video game I

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.890 
myself and everyone in the video game I
mean

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
mean

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.020 
mean
currently<00:01:43.620> just<00:01:43.860> because<00:01:44.190> videogames<00:01:44.910> have

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
currently just because videogames have

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.630 
currently just because videogames have
gotten<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.390> advanced<00:01:45.690> now<00:01:45.870> and<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:47.040> so

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
gotten so advanced now and it's so

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.010 
gotten so advanced now and it's so
accurate<00:01:48.080> but<00:01:49.080> I<00:01:49.290> was<00:01:49.440> really<00:01:49.740> impressed
