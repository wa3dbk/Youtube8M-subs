00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
bike a super flesh tell light and we

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.740 
bike a super flesh tell light and we
have<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.450> blaze<00:00:09.780> -<00:00:10.469> what<00:00:10.710> headlight

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.480 

headlight<00:00:15.750> has<00:00:15.990> three<00:00:16.289> modes<00:00:16.470> right<00:00:17.190> now<00:00:17.310> it's

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
headlight has three modes right now it's

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.700 
headlight has three modes right now it's
on<00:00:17.699> low<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.590> know<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.890> then<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.460> has<00:00:20.670> high<00:00:21.710> and

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
on low I know and then it has high and

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
on low I know and then it has high and
flashing<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:24.180> has<00:00:24.300> three<00:00:24.510> modes<00:00:25.369> and<00:00:26.369> press<00:00:26.609> it

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
flashing so has three modes and press it

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.589 
flashing so has three modes and press it
again<00:00:26.880> turns<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.240> off

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
again turns it off

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.810 
again turns it off
so<00:00:28.439> that's<00:00:28.920> low<00:00:30.410> now<00:00:31.410> until<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.769> super<00:00:32.610> flash

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
so that's low now until I super flash

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.440 
so that's low now until I super flash
right<00:00:33.809> now<00:00:33.960> it's<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:35.070> solid<00:00:35.430> beam<00:00:35.640> that's

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
right now it's on the solid beam that's

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.880 
right now it's on the solid beam that's
how<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.660> looks<00:00:36.809> like<00:00:38.750> and<00:00:39.750> then<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.469> comes<00:00:40.800> with

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
how it looks like and then it comes with

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:52.010 
how it looks like and then it comes with
flesh

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.350 

so<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.830> asked<00:00:53.040> two<00:00:53.220> modes<00:00:53.460> for<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> taillight

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
so I asked two modes for the taillight

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:02.630 
so I asked two modes for the taillight
super<00:00:54.780> flash<00:00:54.990> I<00:01:00.920> like<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.040> keep<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.310> on<00:01:02.400> a<00:01:02.460> solid

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
super flash I like to keep it on a solid

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.570 
super flash I like to keep it on a solid
until<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.480> brighter<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:07.530> that's<00:01:07.680> what<00:01:07.950> tail

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
until a brighter so that's what tail

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.950
