hey guys Sam here at Qwest musique today
we're<00:00:16.460> checking<00:00:16.580> out<00:00:16.760> the<00:00:16.880> angle<00:00:17.180> invader<00:00:17.510> 100

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
we're checking out the angle invader 100

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.620 
we're checking out the angle invader 100
watt<00:00:18.170> head<00:00:18.910> invader<00:00:19.910> is<00:00:19.970> a<00:00:20.030> 4-channel<00:00:20.300> amp

watt head invader is a 4-channel amp

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.359 
watt head invader is a 4-channel amp
each<00:00:20.930> has<00:00:21.140> an<00:00:21.260> individual<00:00:21.710> volume<00:00:22.010> control

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
each has an individual volume control

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:23.920 
each has an individual volume control
and<00:00:22.550> two<00:00:22.910> different<00:00:23.180> gain<00:00:23.300> stages<00:00:23.720> for<00:00:23.869> each

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
and two different gain stages for each

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.359 
and two different gain stages for each
channel<00:00:24.290> there<00:00:24.410> are<00:00:24.470> two<00:00:24.590> master<00:00:24.830> volumes<00:00:25.250> on

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
channel there are two master volumes on

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.100 
channel there are two master volumes on
the<00:00:25.400> amp<00:00:25.610> has<00:00:25.730> a<00:00:26.150> noise<00:00:26.390> gate<00:00:26.420> on<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:26.810> back<00:00:26.960> of

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
the amp has a noise gate on the back of

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.210 
the amp has a noise gate on the back of
the<00:00:27.170> amp<00:00:27.320> which<00:00:27.470> is<00:00:27.619> switchable<00:00:27.950> and<00:00:28.160> it

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
the amp which is switchable and it

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.680 
the amp which is switchable and it
actually<00:00:28.340> has<00:00:28.550> two<00:00:28.790> switchable<00:00:29.420> effects

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:29.690 
actually has two switchable effects

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.749 
actually has two switchable effects
loops<00:00:29.930> so<00:00:30.560> this<00:00:30.650> is<00:00:30.740> an<00:00:30.860> example<00:00:31.099> VM<00:00:31.430> to<00:00:31.580> clean

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
loops so this is an example VM to clean

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:42.610 
loops so this is an example VM to clean
channel

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:01:05.119 

you

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.690 

mmm

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.890 

this<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.910> main<00:01:12.060> crunch<00:01:12.330> channel<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
this is the main crunch channel on the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:52.020 
this is the main crunch channel on the
app

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:01.090 

and

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.050 

so<00:02:02.100> we're<00:02:02.189> going<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.340> go<00:02:02.460> on<00:02:02.549> channel<00:02:02.880> three

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
so we're going to go on channel three

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.370 
so we're going to go on channel three
which<00:02:03.179> is<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.420> first<00:02:03.630> heavy<00:02:03.869> channel<00:02:04.229> on<00:02:04.289> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
which is the first heavy channel on the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:36.440 
which is the first heavy channel on the
end

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.680 

you

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.490 

finally<00:02:43.690> we're<00:02:43.780> going<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:43.930> go<00:02:44.050> on<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.230> fourth

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
finally we're going to go on the fourth

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.080 
finally we're going to go on the fourth
channel<00:02:44.770> which<00:02:45.130> is<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.370> second<00:02:45.700> gain<00:02:45.820> stage

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
channel which is the second gain stage

00:02:46.090 --> 00:03:54.380 
channel which is the second gain stage
on<00:02:46.240> the<00:02:46.330> end

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.300 

this<00:03:55.200> is<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:55.410> second<00:03:55.740> heavy<00:03:55.860> channel<00:03:56.190> in<00:03:56.250> the

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
this is the second heavy channel in the

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:18.499 
this is the second heavy channel in the
amp<00:03:56.430> with<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:56.640> noise<00:03:56.850> gate<00:03:57.060> turned<00:03:57.390> off

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:18.509 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.759 

this<00:04:19.509> is<00:04:19.630> an<00:04:19.720> example<00:04:20.019> of<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:20.289> second<00:04:20.620> heavy

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
this is an example of the second heavy

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:42.390 
this is an example of the second heavy
channel<00:04:21.039> with<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:21.220> noise<00:04:21.340> gate<00:04:21.549> turned<00:04:21.789> on
