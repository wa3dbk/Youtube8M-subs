00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:12.040
 Today is the protoleaf channel 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:20.680
 Let's introduce the attack of the planting of silk pods and snap pea 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:21.490
 It is necessary to need a large pillar in the end as it grows bigger and bigger with a lull plant 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.000
 but 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:32.060
 Since the first cold between not vertical growth for the time being in such a person is 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.240
 When planting in the nursery, to some extent 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:40.750
 This brazier is great 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:46.280
 Put a light inner bottom stone in advance and while rice 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:49.970
 Flower vegetables are lightly put in by-where 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:54.200
 Plant it here and say good luck 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.370
 This time it is a 30 cm flowerpot so 2 pots 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:03.930
 Planting 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:05.800
 So as not to leguminous plants tampered with it floating in the reluctant to be cut roots when to leave 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.870
 Completely 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:13.060
 I will plant a hole in the hole so here 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.390
 Such a situation 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.380
 So one more place 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.380
 Put flowers 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.399
 Originally I would like to take here but I do not take it, as it is fine as it is 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.910
 I will plant it like this and 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.910
 As the nail does not fall 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.750
 Say 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.920
 Will change it once more, but stand up the needle 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.730
 here 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.240
 W 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.900
 Not to break 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.900
 Easily 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.310
 For 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.310
 To go 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:07.840
 Leguminous plants 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:16.240
 Special because a key called rhizobia will pull out of their own in the soil 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:21.040
 I will grow up without fatigue I want to continue to grow this spring until spring 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.290
 I wonder how many harvests can we do now? 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.099
 Tano 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.099
 It is semi
