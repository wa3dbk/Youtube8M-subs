00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:07.629
 I want to tell you how to check the sensor 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.879
 temperature on the classic model of VAZ 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:16.530
 2105 line motor so I changed 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:18.240
 radiator and put an electric motor with 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:22.300
 blowing 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.570
 electro forcibly means we him 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.660
 check here was a curious case 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.720
 that at the temperature did not work exactly 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.410
 fan fan motor to 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:38.920
 check everything is done is not elementary 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:49.300
 do not remove the sensor now nothing 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:01:00.879
 I'll show you on the other side so I here if 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:01:04.299
 visible on guard not visible there he is a sensor 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:09.780
 that's why you soldered it here 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:12.369
 water radiator and to check 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.549
 performance sensor 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:22.450
 coolant almost everything you need 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:25.109
 check fixed fuse 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:31.359
 sensor fuse 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:34.420
 it was a fan that was right there 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:38.399
 Now he's set if it is installed 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.399
 it must be whole to check 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:48.500
 Is whether the relay is working sensor works here 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:54.980
 she is a relay here is a relay which is responsible for 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:58.700
 fan of the engine and now I am you 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.370
 I will show you how it's not rented check 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.780
 nothing does the cooling sensor work 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:11.510
 liquids 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:15.290
 or it is not working now look 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:20.000
 the ignition is on and now we use 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.880
 narrowly for kontachit with kontachit these terminals 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.350
 and the fan should work here 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:32.819
 see all roles works well there clazzi 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:37.450
 and the fan is running 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:42.370
 that is about fan order with 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:45.269
 sensor that is responsible for turning on 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.620
 for the temperature of the conclusion of this 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.140
 fan 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.349
 that's all that's small little 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:57.510
 tricks that can be done 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.510
 nothing taking everything bye bye
