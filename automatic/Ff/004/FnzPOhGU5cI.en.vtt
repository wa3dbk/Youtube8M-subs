00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
you hear Matt got it he did so he did

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.339

try<00:05:04.789> to<00:05:04.820> cut<00:05:05.090> mark<00:05:05.330> some<00:05:05.570> slack<00:05:05.840> but<00:05:06.080> it<00:05:06.139> just

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:06.349 
try to cut mark some slack but it just

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:08.080 
try to cut mark some slack but it just
wasn't<00:05:06.740> enough<00:05:06.770> and<00:05:07.280> one<00:05:07.460> thing<00:05:07.639> that<00:05:07.669> happens

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
wasn't enough and one thing that happens

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.520 
wasn't enough and one thing that happens
when<00:05:08.419> you're<00:05:08.539> in<00:05:08.570> marks<00:05:08.930> position<00:05:09.349> I'm<00:05:09.440> gonna

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
when you're in marks position I'm gonna

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.320 
when you're in marks position I'm gonna
say<00:05:09.740> this<00:05:09.919> and<00:05:10.130> you<00:05:10.669> know<00:05:10.789> this<00:05:10.910> wall<00:05:11.090> when

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
say this and you know this wall when

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.089 
say this and you know this wall when
you're<00:05:11.510> on<00:05:11.599> that<00:05:11.660> inside<00:05:12.260> and<00:05:12.650> you've<00:05:12.979> got

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
you're on that inside and you've got

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:15.040 
you're on that inside and you've got
that<00:05:13.220> wheel<00:05:13.460> cut<00:05:13.880> and<00:05:14.150> you<00:05:14.450> start<00:05:14.810> up<00:05:14.900> the

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
that wheel cut and you start up the

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.620 
that wheel cut and you start up the
racetrack<00:05:15.229> if<00:05:15.979> you<00:05:16.430> sometimes<00:05:17.060> the<00:05:17.330> car<00:05:17.479> will

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
racetrack if you sometimes the car will

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.089 
racetrack if you sometimes the car will
begin<00:05:17.870> to<00:05:17.960> take<00:05:18.139> off<00:05:18.289> and<00:05:18.500> if<00:05:18.590> you<00:05:18.710> let<00:05:18.919> off

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
begin to take off and if you let off

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:21.879 
begin to take off and if you let off
that<00:05:19.340> gas<00:05:19.520> the<00:05:19.940> car<00:05:20.120> takes<00:05:20.330> off<00:05:20.500> right<00:05:21.500> it<00:05:21.710> just

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
that gas the car takes off right it just

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:23.469 
that gas the car takes off right it just
takes<00:05:22.070> off<00:05:22.190> twice<00:05:22.400> as<00:05:22.610> bad<00:05:22.760> and<00:05:22.940> loses<00:05:23.360> the

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
takes off twice as bad and loses the

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.180 
takes off twice as bad and loses the
nose<00:05:23.660> and<00:05:23.930> it<00:05:24.020> flies<00:05:24.199> the<00:05:24.380> nose<00:05:24.530> and<00:05:24.889> I<00:05:24.979> think

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
nose and it flies the nose and I think

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.529 
nose and it flies the nose and I think
Matt<00:05:25.370> let<00:05:25.580> off<00:05:25.699> mark<00:05:25.970> probably<00:05:26.180> let<00:05:26.360> off<00:05:26.479> a

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
Matt let off mark probably let off a

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.089 
Matt let off mark probably let off a
little<00:05:26.660> bit<00:05:26.780> but<00:05:27.139> if<00:05:27.320> you<00:05:27.440> notice<00:05:27.650> that<00:05:27.889> white

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.099 
little bit but if you notice that white

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:30.310 
little bit but if you notice that white
line<00:05:28.340> and<00:05:28.550> that<00:05:28.669> replay<00:05:28.970> there's<00:05:29.810> not<00:05:29.990> a<00:05:30.020> car

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
line and that replay there's not a car

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.200 
line and that replay there's not a car
length<00:05:30.560> above<00:05:30.919> that<00:05:31.099> white<00:05:31.340> line<00:05:31.550> Matt<00:05:31.849> was<00:05:32.060> as

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
length above that white line Matt was as

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.360 
length above that white line Matt was as
high<00:05:32.389> as<00:05:32.449> he<00:05:32.690> could<00:05:32.870> go<00:05:33.050> mark<00:05:33.650> came<00:05:33.919> up<00:05:34.130> and

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
high as he could go mark came up and

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.379 
high as he could go mark came up and
they<00:05:34.490> just<00:05:34.699> were<00:05:34.849> fighting<00:05:35.120> for<00:05:35.150> the<00:05:35.330> same

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
they just were fighting for the same

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:36.909 
they just were fighting for the same
place<00:05:35.720> on<00:05:35.900> the<00:05:35.990> racetrack<00:05:36.139> that's<00:05:36.500> one<00:05:36.770> of<00:05:36.830> the

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
place on the racetrack that's one of the

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:38.740 
place on the racetrack that's one of the
weird<00:05:37.099> things<00:05:37.190> it's<00:05:37.880> so<00:05:38.030> much<00:05:38.180> different<00:05:38.599> here

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
weird things it's so much different here

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.890 
weird things it's so much different here
at<00:05:39.440> Daytona<00:05:39.889> and<00:05:40.010> Talladega<00:05:40.780> exactly<00:05:41.780> what

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
at Daytona and Talladega exactly what

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.020 
at Daytona and Talladega exactly what
Kyle<00:05:42.080> said<00:05:42.110> it's<00:05:42.919> almost<00:05:43.250> like<00:05:43.520> you've<00:05:43.699> got<00:05:43.910> to

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
Kyle said it's almost like you've got to

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.460 
Kyle said it's almost like you've got to
keep<00:05:44.150> the<00:05:44.300> thing<00:05:44.510> matted<00:05:44.960> to<00:05:45.110> keep<00:05:45.320> the

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
keep the thing matted to keep the

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.350 
keep the thing matted to keep the
downforce<00:05:45.979> on<00:05:46.250> the<00:05:46.400> front<00:05:46.610> of<00:05:46.669> the<00:05:46.760> car<00:05:46.940> if<00:05:47.300> you

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
downforce on the front of the car if you

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.120 
downforce on the front of the car if you
get<00:05:47.660> off<00:05:47.840> the<00:05:48.020> throttle<00:05:48.260> you<00:05:48.590> lose<00:05:48.830> a<00:05:48.860> little

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
get off the throttle you lose a little

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.909 
get off the throttle you lose a little
bit<00:05:49.250> of<00:05:49.370> that<00:05:49.550> downforce<00:05:50.090> on<00:05:50.330> the<00:05:50.419> front<00:05:50.660> and

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
bit of that downforce on the front and

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.920 
bit of that downforce on the front and
especially<00:05:51.919> in<00:05:52.220> turn<00:05:52.460> two<00:05:52.789> these<00:05:53.300> cars<00:05:53.660> will

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
especially in turn two these cars will

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.600 
especially in turn two these cars will
take<00:05:54.169> off<00:05:54.410> on<00:05:54.650> you
