I'm gonna cover that all with these six
buckets<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:48.000> biochar<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.420> I'm<00:00:48.690> gonna<00:00:48.809> cover

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
buckets of biochar and I'm gonna cover

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.740 
buckets of biochar and I'm gonna cover
it<00:00:49.200> with<00:00:49.320> warm<00:00:49.620> castings<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.270> stuff<00:00:51.660> is

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
it with warm castings so this stuff is

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.090 
it with warm castings so this stuff is
pretty<00:00:51.960> powdery<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.469> I'm<00:00:52.530> gonna<00:00:52.620> water<00:00:52.860> down

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
pretty powdery so I'm gonna water down

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.740 
pretty powdery so I'm gonna water down
first<00:00:53.370> I'm<00:00:53.579> gonna<00:00:53.699> load<00:00:53.879> into<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.210> bed<00:00:54.360> and

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
first I'm gonna load into the bed and

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.500 
first I'm gonna load into the bed and
then<00:00:54.899> I'll<00:00:55.320> get<00:00:55.440> back<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.620> equal<00:00:55.860> myth<00:00:56.510> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
then I'll get back to equal myth the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.389 
then I'll get back to equal myth the
trick<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:58.079> making<00:00:58.620> sure<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.980> dust<00:00:59.160> doesn't

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
trick to making sure the dust doesn't

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.439 
trick to making sure the dust doesn't
get<00:00:59.489> everywhere<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.879> what<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.030> do<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.300> I

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
get everywhere is what I do is I

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.540 
get everywhere is what I do is I
literally<00:01:00.750> just<00:01:00.989> put<00:01:01.289> up<00:01:01.739> water<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.399> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
literally just put up water in the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.329 
literally just put up water in the
bucket<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.239> keeps<00:01:03.600> going<00:01:03.840> up<00:01:04.049> until<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
bucket and it keeps going up until the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.250 
bucket and it keeps going up until the
water<00:01:05.549> actually<00:01:05.820> starts<00:01:06.689> overflow<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
water actually starts overflow the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.740 
water actually starts overflow the
bucket<00:01:07.590> like<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.430> now<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:08.850> 73<00:01:09.360> times

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
bucket like it now and it's 73 times

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.380 
bucket like it now and it's 73 times
that<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.140> do<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.760> you'd<00:01:11.760> be<00:01:11.880> surprised<00:01:12.270> at

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
that to do this you'd be surprised at

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.480 
that to do this you'd be surprised at
how<00:01:12.450> much<00:01:12.570> room<00:01:12.869> there<00:01:12.930> actually<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.530> as<00:01:14.340> you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
how much room there actually is as you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.800 
how much room there actually is as you
can<00:01:14.610> see<00:01:14.729> now<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.939> biochar<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.509> actually

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
can see now the biochar is actually

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.050 
can see now the biochar is actually
starting<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.140> float<00:01:16.290> above<00:01:16.530> now<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.580> actually

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
starting to float above now we actually

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.030 
starting to float above now we actually
officially<00:01:18.330> have<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> bucket<00:01:18.780> full<00:01:18.930> but<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.350> do

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
officially have a bucket full but I do

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.870 
officially have a bucket full but I do
this<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:21.330> about<00:01:21.479> two<00:01:21.659> minutes<00:01:21.780> there's

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
this like for about two minutes there's

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.280 
this like for about two minutes there's
probably<00:01:23.880> three<00:01:24.240> gallons<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.659> water<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:25.080> here

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
probably three gallons of water in here

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.580 
probably three gallons of water in here
that's<00:01:26.159> how<00:01:26.369> much<00:01:26.610> space<00:01:26.909> there<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.659> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
that's how much space there is in the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.160 
that's how much space there is in the
pores<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.250> biochar<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.659> look<00:01:30.869> at<00:01:30.960> this

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
pores of the biochar and look at this

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.140 
pores of the biochar and look at this
look<00:01:32.920> how<00:01:33.040> much<00:01:33.190> water<00:01:33.340> retention<00:01:33.640> rate<00:01:33.940> on

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
look how much water retention rate on

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:42.060 
look how much water retention rate on
this<00:01:36.060> pure<00:01:37.890> pure<00:01:38.890> biochar<00:01:40.440> look<00:01:41.440> at<00:01:41.530> that<00:01:41.650> that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
this pure pure biochar look at that that

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.190 
this pure pure biochar look at that that
is<00:01:42.310> some<00:01:42.640> amazing<00:01:42.850> and<00:01:43.150> water<00:01:43.270> retention<00:01:46.200> okay

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
is some amazing and water retention okay

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
is a bucket of a biochar so you know in

you'll<00:02:34.480> see<00:02:34.690> if<00:02:34.810> they're<00:02:35.020> bubbling<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:36.570> little

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
you'll see if they're bubbling a little

air pocket to the biochar there should

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.650 
air pocket to the biochar there should
be<00:02:45.070> some<00:02:45.280> amazing<00:02:45.700> water<00:02:45.970> tension<00:02:46.240> abilities

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
be some amazing water tension abilities

remaining half of one cubic yard a foot
from<00:03:21.190> another<00:03:21.580> bag<00:03:21.790> I<00:03:22.120> then<00:03:22.780> topped<00:03:23.050> it<00:03:23.200> with

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
from another bag I then topped it with

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.770 
from another bag I then topped it with
three<00:03:23.590> more<00:03:23.800> bags<00:03:23.980> of<00:03:24.670> one<00:03:24.910> castings<00:03:25.420> and

another two gallons of coffee grounds

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.040 
another two gallons of coffee grounds
and<00:03:28.990> then<00:03:29.110> I<00:03:29.140> watered<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:29.590> in<00:03:29.970> so<00:03:30.970> I'm<00:03:31.870> not

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
and then I watered it in so I'm not

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.750 
and then I watered it in so I'm not
gonna<00:03:32.170> mix<00:03:32.380> it<00:03:32.590> tonight<00:03:32.740> I<00:03:33.100> may<00:03:33.610> eventually

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
gonna mix it tonight I may eventually

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.420 
gonna mix it tonight I may eventually
mix<00:03:34.240> it<00:03:34.390> but<00:03:35.200> I<00:03:35.230> think<00:03:35.560> just<00:03:35.830> a<00:03:35.920> sheer<00:03:36.220> volume

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
mix it but I think just a sheer volume

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.910 
mix it but I think just a sheer volume
of<00:03:37.080> microbial<00:03:38.080> action<00:03:38.260> that's<00:03:38.500> going<00:03:38.740> on<00:03:38.800> in

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
of microbial action that's going on in

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.020 
of microbial action that's going on in
these<00:03:39.040> worm<00:03:39.220> castings<00:03:39.610> since<00:03:39.760> these<00:03:39.880> worm

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
these worm castings since these worm

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.870 
these worm castings since these worm
castings<00:03:40.420> are<00:03:40.570> almost<00:03:41.560> four<00:03:41.740> years<00:03:41.800> old<00:03:42.100> it

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
castings are almost four years old it

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.120 
castings are almost four years old it
should<00:03:43.210> really<00:03:43.600> really<00:03:43.840> charge<00:03:44.170> this<00:03:44.380> I<00:03:44.620> will
