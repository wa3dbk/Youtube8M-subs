it's<00:00:36.149> quite<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.420> unique<00:00:36.510> circuit<00:00:37.079> because<00:00:37.260> it's

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
it's quite a unique circuit because it's

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.810 
it's quite a unique circuit because it's
sort<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.559> half<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.950> street<00:00:38.160> circuit<00:00:38.309> half<00:00:38.730> a

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
sort of half a street circuit half a

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.130 
sort of half a street circuit half a
sort<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.149> permanent<00:00:39.390> track<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.110> a

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
sort of a permanent track so it is a

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.450 
sort of a permanent track so it is a
little<00:00:40.379> bit<00:00:40.530> different<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.160> quite<00:00:41.430> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
little bit different it is quite a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.970 
little bit different it is quite a
smooth<00:00:41.910> circuit<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.450> what<00:00:42.629> we're<00:00:42.780> used<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.170> but

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
smooth circuit to what we're used to but

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.799 
smooth circuit to what we're used to but
it<00:00:44.100> look<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> challenging<00:00:45.239> track<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.660> get

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
it look it is a challenging track to get

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:46.850 
it look it is a challenging track to get
right<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.289> course<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.559> know<00:00:46.620> we've<00:00:46.739> had

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
right and of course you know we've had

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.590

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
infrastructure forming one brings to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.700 
infrastructure forming one brings to
Australia<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.930> course<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.229> way<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.500> cars

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
I no doubt that he's had a couple of

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.350 
I no doubt that he's had a couple of
years<00:01:55.890> now<00:01:55.950> under<00:01:56.310> his<00:01:56.430> belt<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.210> the

of<00:02:09.570> years<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.930> mature<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.380> understand<00:02:10.800> that

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
of years to mature and understand that

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.200 
of years to mature and understand that
the<00:02:11.070> business<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.460> what<00:02:11.580> Formula<00:02:11.940> One's<00:02:12.090> all
