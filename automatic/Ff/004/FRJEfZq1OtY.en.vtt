00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.759
 today to perspire and how to perspire 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.620
 today to discuss 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.519
 maybe I can not do something so 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.460
 elaborated like this I'm wrong even though 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:20.119
 I feel like dancing but we can 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:25.949
 try some yes I climb it 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:29.730
 it's good 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.289
 the recipe closes binders on climber 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.820
 So 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:39.800
 so let's go to the recipe a pound 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.930
 cocaine I've cried and there's our southern cup 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.260
 300 grams of law-abiding I prefer 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.200
 more wood in 3 tablespoons of vinegar 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.600
 white or lemon I prefer lemon that is 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.680
 the easiest to find is already here 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:03.590
 duly coadune day and 3 tablespoons of 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.590
 base in the world would be here 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:45.259
 I do not know if you noticed it but it's also 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:49.520
 Strange but I have a modification 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:55.750
 For this the most beautiful thing is that it gives a donkey 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:58.909
 It is what makes the race will color the 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.570
 my consistency what does it go 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:09.050
 surround the batter then the lemon is a 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:12.380
 preservative and lastly the adrenaline 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:16.510
 which is what causes the dough does not stick 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:22.060
 in your hand then when you say it is already 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:23.769
 good all ingredients properly 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.280
 structured 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:34.370
 We speak now put a microwave 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:43.540
 in a minute until she is ready to 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:46.640
 consistency that we usually 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.760
 get it in three minutes 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:55.780
 today won 4 that's why I say 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.780
 last minute text at the time 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:16.690
 now until our son's whole language 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.120
 i 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:01.470
 Ours is what we let rest 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:13.500
 in the refrigerator keeps and now people 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:16.819
 famous for being so much here I am 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.819

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:33.720
 other will to work continuously 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:38.010
 that at first it appears Portuguese in the 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.060
 As you downloaded but below 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:44.100
 chocolate milk 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:55.760
 He will live the most, come to the 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:55.760
 distance away from it to its dirty 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:03.810
 that's it and I hope I have shown it is 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.850
