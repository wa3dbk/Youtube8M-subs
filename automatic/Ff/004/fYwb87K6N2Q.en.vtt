00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.140 

okay<00:00:07.720> what<00:00:08.230> the<00:00:08.470> heck<00:00:08.830> is<00:00:09.430> that<00:00:09.490> little

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
okay what the heck is that little

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.060 
okay what the heck is that little
circuit<00:00:10.720> board<00:00:13.470> okay<00:00:14.470> you<00:00:14.530> can<00:00:14.680> see<00:00:14.890> now

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 
circuit board okay you can see now

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.339 
circuit board okay you can see now
that's<00:00:15.250> an<00:00:15.460> electric<00:00:15.730> furnace<00:00:16.240> that's<00:00:17.050> a

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:17.349 
that's an electric furnace that's a

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:18.929 
that's an electric furnace that's a
little<00:00:17.590> circuit<00:00:18.010> board<00:00:18.040> over<00:00:18.550> there<00:00:18.700> in<00:00:18.820> the

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
little circuit board over there in the

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.520 
little circuit board over there in the
left<00:00:19.290> what<00:00:20.290> does<00:00:20.410> it<00:00:20.590> do

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:22.530 
left what does it do

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.160 
left what does it do
well<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:24.820> looks<00:00:25.060> a<00:00:25.150> little<00:00:25.240> more<00:00:25.480> complex<00:00:25.990> than

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
well it looks a little more complex than

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.029 
well it looks a little more complex than
it<00:00:26.350> is<00:00:26.500> and<00:00:26.860> let<00:00:27.010> me<00:00:27.070> get<00:00:27.220> close<00:00:27.460> to<00:00:27.730> it<00:00:27.820> again

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
it is and let me get close to it again

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.519 
it is and let me get close to it again
okay<00:00:30.039> we<00:00:30.220> have<00:00:30.520> a<00:00:30.550> black<00:00:31.060> relay<00:00:31.840> here<00:00:32.199> that's

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
okay we have a black relay here that's

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.090 
okay we have a black relay here that's
that<00:00:32.770> right<00:00:33.040> there<00:00:33.489> and<00:00:35.760> that's<00:00:36.760> a<00:00:36.910> fan<00:00:37.210> relay

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
that right there and that's a fan relay

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.430 
that right there and that's a fan relay
single-pole<00:00:39.100> double-throw<00:00:39.160> fan<00:00:39.970> relay<00:00:40.440> so

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
single-pole double-throw fan relay so

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.020 
single-pole double-throw fan relay so
that<00:00:41.649> when<00:00:41.860> it's<00:00:42.040> using<00:00:42.520> the<00:00:42.640> electric

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
that when it's using the electric

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.780 
that when it's using the electric
furnace<00:00:43.239> it<00:00:43.570> runs<00:00:43.809> in<00:00:44.079> low<00:00:44.410> speed<00:00:44.920> and<00:00:45.340> when

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
furnace it runs in low speed and when

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.810 
furnace it runs in low speed and when
you<00:00:45.940> energize<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:47.440> G<00:00:47.739> circuit<00:00:48.309> that's<00:00:48.520> the

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
you energize the G circuit that's the

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.330 
you energize the G circuit that's the
fan<00:00:49.059> circuit<00:00:49.630> then<00:00:50.230> it<00:00:50.350> goes<00:00:50.500> to<00:00:50.530> high<00:00:50.890> speed

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
fan circuit then it goes to high speed

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.080 
fan circuit then it goes to high speed
uh<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.800> why<00:00:54.040> do<00:00:54.100> we<00:00:54.280> need<00:00:54.430> that<00:00:54.489> why<00:00:54.850> don't<00:00:55.000> we

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
uh so why do we need that why don't we

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.029 
uh so why do we need that why don't we
just<00:00:55.239> put<00:00:55.420> a<00:00:55.450> relay<00:00:55.930> there<00:00:56.230> why<00:00:56.590> did<00:00:56.739> we<00:00:56.860> put

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
just put a relay there why did we put

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.920 
just put a relay there why did we put
the<00:00:57.190> board<00:00:57.489> there<00:00:58.260> well<00:00:59.260> let's<00:00:59.620> go<00:00:59.800> into<00:00:59.980> walk

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
the board there well let's go into walk

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.869 
the board there well let's go into walk
okay<00:01:01.930> now<00:01:02.440> I've<00:01:02.710> got<00:01:02.739> a<00:01:02.920> jumper<00:01:03.430> about<00:01:03.610> ready

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
okay now I've got a jumper about ready

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.010 
okay now I've got a jumper about ready
to<00:01:03.940> hook<00:01:04.089> it<00:01:04.300> up<00:01:04.509> here<00:01:04.960> I've<00:01:05.800> got<00:01:06.130> our<00:01:06.369> and<00:01:07.030> I've

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
to hook it up here I've got our and I've

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.160 
to hook it up here I've got our and I've
got<00:01:08.259> G<00:01:08.590> Don<00:01:08.860> G's<00:01:09.100> gonna<00:01:09.280> energize<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.970> fan<00:01:10.240> now

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
got G Don G's gonna energize the fan now

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.040 
got G Don G's gonna energize the fan now
normally<00:01:11.679> if<00:01:11.740> it's<00:01:11.890> just<00:01:12.100> a<00:01:12.190> fan<00:01:12.520> relay<00:01:13.060> then

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
normally if it's just a fan relay then

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.249 
normally if it's just a fan relay then
when<00:01:14.350> I<00:01:14.380> energized<00:01:15.310> G<00:01:16.060> the<00:01:16.330> fan<00:01:16.539> would<00:01:16.780> come<00:01:16.990> on

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
when I energized G the fan would come on

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.180 
when I energized G the fan would come on
and<00:01:18.119> then<00:01:19.119> when<00:01:19.330> I<00:01:19.360> pull<00:01:19.690> the<00:01:19.810> wire<00:01:20.020> off<00:01:20.289> the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
and then when I pull the wire off the

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.749 
and then when I pull the wire off the
fan<00:01:21.429> would<00:01:21.580> go<00:01:21.729> off<00:01:22.890> well<00:01:23.890> there's<00:01:24.399> a<00:01:24.490> little

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
fan would go off well there's a little

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.160 
fan would go off well there's a little
bit<00:01:24.970> of<00:01:25.090> difference<00:01:25.509> here<00:01:27.119> if<00:01:28.119> I<00:01:28.390> do<00:01:28.450> that<00:01:28.840> this

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
bit of difference here if I do that this

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:41.429 
bit of difference here if I do that this
way<00:01:32.220> okay<00:01:33.250> my<00:01:34.119> fan<00:01:34.390> just<00:01:34.660> came<00:01:34.959> on

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:47.500 

okay<00:01:42.009> it<00:01:42.189> should<00:01:42.219> have<00:01:42.520> shut<00:01:42.700> off<00:01:42.999> shouldn't

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.970 

okay<00:01:48.510> it<00:01:48.630> didn't<00:01:48.900> shut<00:01:49.050> off<00:01:49.170> right<00:01:49.410> away<00:01:49.620> it's

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
okay it didn't shut off right away it's

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.040 
okay it didn't shut off right away it's
just<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.250> time<00:01:50.490> delay<00:01:50.790> that's<00:01:51.360> all<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.720> is

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
just a time delay that's all it is

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.150 
just a time delay that's all it is
it's<00:01:52.650> a<00:01:52.830> minimum<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.850> time<00:01:54.660> delay<00:01:55.440> meaning

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
it's a minimum on time delay meaning

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.850 
it's a minimum on time delay meaning
that<00:01:56.280> if<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.790> fan<00:01:57.120> is<00:01:57.420> energized<00:01:58.260> through<00:01:58.710> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
that if the fan is energized through the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.090 
that if the fan is energized through the
G<00:01:59.100> circuit<00:02:01.580> then<00:02:02.580> it<00:02:02.820> will<00:02:03.000> stay<00:02:03.330> on<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:04.170> think

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
G circuit then it will stay on I think

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.450 
G circuit then it will stay on I think
this<00:02:05.250> one<00:02:05.430> stays<00:02:05.700> on<00:02:05.940> for<00:02:06.000> like<00:02:06.330> a<00:02:06.360> minute

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
this one stays on for like a minute

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.780 
this one stays on for like a minute
after<00:02:08.460> the<00:02:08.700> connection<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:10.170> disconnected<00:02:11.070> so

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
after the connection is disconnected so

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.940 
after the connection is disconnected so
it's<00:02:12.000> just<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.360> an<00:02:12.900> off<00:02:13.140> delay

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.790 

if<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.370> energize<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.420> fan<00:02:18.720> through<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.410> W

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
if you energize the fan through the W

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.490 
if you energize the fan through the W
one<00:02:20.010> circuit<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:20.970> put<00:02:21.209> our<00:02:21.510> two<00:02:21.959> W

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
one circuit that is you put our two W

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.740 
one circuit that is you put our two W
one<00:02:22.800> that's<00:02:23.459> going<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.700> turn<00:02:23.970> on<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.270> electric

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
one that's going to turn on the electric

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.620 
one that's going to turn on the electric
furnace<00:02:25.370> which<00:02:26.370> then<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:28.020> sequencer<00:02:28.830> here

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
furnace which then the sequencer here

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.230 
furnace which then the sequencer here
turns<00:02:30.630> on<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.110> fan<00:02:31.380> well<00:02:32.250> it's<00:02:32.490> a<00:02:32.580> time<00:02:32.880> delay

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
turns on the fan well it's a time delay

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.490 
turns on the fan well it's a time delay
too<00:02:33.690> but<00:02:34.440> it's<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.680> little<00:02:34.920> different<00:02:35.250> it

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
too but it's a little different it

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.280 
too but it's a little different it
there's<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.650> time<00:02:38.010> delay<00:02:38.220> when<00:02:39.209> W<00:02:39.780> one<00:02:40.080> is

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
there's a time delay when W one is

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.760 
there's a time delay when W one is
energized<00:02:41.090> there's<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.209> delay<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.500> fan

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
energized there's a delay and the fan

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.490

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.770 
and first element come on in this case
also<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:47.070> second<00:02:47.670> element<00:02:47.820> comes<00:02:48.270> on<00:02:48.540> that's

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
also the second element comes on that's

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.800 
also the second element comes on that's
right<00:02:48.990> there<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.670> another<00:02:50.670> delay<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.540> can't

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
right there and another delay you can't

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.680 
right there and another delay you can't

one<00:03:02.190> here<00:03:02.610> then<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:06.170> delays<00:03:07.170> off<00:03:07.700> but<00:03:08.700> all<00:03:09.090> that

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
one here then it delays off but all that

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.870 
one here then it delays off but all that
is<00:03:09.720> for<00:03:10.019> its<00:03:10.230> it's<00:03:10.680> for<00:03:10.980> air<00:03:11.160> conditioning

the air conditioner goes off that's

the air conditioner goes off that's
really<00:03:20.010> all<00:03:20.160> it<00:03:20.190> is<00:03:20.459> there's<00:03:20.730> nothing<00:03:20.850> much<00:03:21.209> -

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
really all it is there's nothing much -

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.120 
really all it is there's nothing much -
it's<00:03:21.660> very<00:03:21.900> simple<00:03:23.600> if<00:03:24.739> you<00:03:25.739> know<00:03:25.800> this<00:03:25.980> is<00:03:26.070> a

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
it's very simple if you know this is a

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.990 
it's very simple if you know this is a
little<00:03:26.220> snyder<00:03:26.550> general<00:03:27.120> furnace<00:03:27.920> i<00:03:29.000> think

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
little snyder general furnace i think

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.310 
little snyder general furnace i think
our<00:03:30.299> coal<00:03:30.690> was<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:32.489> same<00:03:32.790> brand<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.690> know<00:03:33.810> so

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
our coal was the same brand you know so

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.370 
our coal was the same brand you know so
anyway<00:03:35.190> it's<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.610> it's<00:03:36.180> an<00:03:36.390> older<00:03:36.720> furnace<00:03:37.170> but

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
anyway it's a it's an older furnace but

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.900 
anyway it's a it's an older furnace but
it's<00:03:37.560> not<00:03:37.739> that<00:03:38.010> old<00:03:38.250> it's<00:03:38.489> probably<00:03:38.519> about

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
it's not that old it's probably about

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.800 
it's not that old it's probably about
twenty<00:03:39.330> years<00:03:39.540> old<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:40.459> a<00:03:41.459> lot<00:03:42.299> of<00:03:42.330> these<00:03:42.510> had

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
twenty years old and a lot of these had

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.360 
twenty years old and a lot of these had
these<00:03:43.080> time<00:03:43.410> delay<00:03:43.940> fan<00:03:44.940> circuits<00:03:45.840> on<00:03:46.019> there

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
these time delay fan circuits on there

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.289 
these time delay fan circuits on there
if<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.549> fan<00:03:47.790> delay<00:03:48.209> did<00:03:48.570> fail<00:03:49.130> i<00:03:50.150> don't<00:03:51.150> know

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
if the fan delay did fail i don't know

that you're stuck with actually trying

that you're stuck with actually trying
to<00:03:54.180> find<00:03:54.450> that<00:03:54.630> thing<00:03:54.900> i'm<00:03:55.079> not<00:03:55.109> sure<00:03:55.500> you<00:03:55.620> can

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
to find that thing i'm not sure you can

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.039 
to find that thing i'm not sure you can
find<00:03:56.130> another<00:03:56.430> one<00:03:56.730> you<00:03:57.329> might<00:03:57.570> be<00:03:57.750> able<00:03:57.900> to

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
find another one you might be able to

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.420 
find another one you might be able to
but

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
but

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.069 
but
if<00:03:59.790> you<00:03:59.939> couldn't<00:04:00.209> find<00:04:00.450> one<00:04:00.599> you<00:04:00.780> could<00:04:00.900> just

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
if you couldn't find one you could just

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.369 
if you couldn't find one you could just
put<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.319> regular<00:04:01.560> single-pole<00:04:02.280> double-throw

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
put a regular single-pole double-throw

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.589 
put a regular single-pole double-throw
24<00:04:04.379> volt<00:04:04.709> coil<00:04:05.129> relay<00:04:05.700> in<00:04:05.909> there<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.329> that

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
24 volt coil relay in there and that

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.690 
24 volt coil relay in there and that
would<00:04:06.780> replace<00:04:07.049> it<00:04:07.349> anyway<00:04:07.980> that's<00:04:08.519> a

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
would replace it anyway that's a

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.200 
would replace it anyway that's a
