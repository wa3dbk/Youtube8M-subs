going<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.260> use<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:14.340> x-axis<00:01:14.939> as<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> ground

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
going to use the x-axis as the ground

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.300 
going to use the x-axis as the ground
plane<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.259> I'm<00:01:16.350> going<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.500> use<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.860> blue<00:01:17.070> arrow

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.980 
plane so I'm going to use the blue arrow
to<00:01:17.790> move<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.930> up<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.500> I'm<00:01:20.189> going<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.430> turn

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
to move the can up and I'm going to turn

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.999 
to move the can up and I'm going to turn
textured<00:01:21.990> shading<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.659> go<00:01:24.659> back<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
textured shading on and go back to the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.469 
textured shading on and go back to the
game<00:01:26.220> logic<00:01:26.400> view<00:01:29.000> I'm<00:01:30.000> going<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.240> turn<00:01:30.299> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
game logic view I'm going to turn the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.140 
game logic view I'm going to turn the
shader<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:31.259> textured<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.549> I'm<00:01:32.700> going<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.909> start

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
shader to textured so I'm going to start

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.520 
shader to textured so I'm going to start
the<00:01:33.299> game<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:34.770> movie<00:01:35.100> Android<00:01:35.490> forward<00:01:36.090> and

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
the game on a movie Android forward and

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.230 
the game on a movie Android forward and
when<00:01:37.530> he<00:01:37.619> hits<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.009> can<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:39.060> doesn't

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
when he hits the can the can doesn't

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.850 
when he hits the can the can doesn't
disappear<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.320> score<00:01:40.590> isn't

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
disappear and the score isn't

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.789 
disappear and the score isn't
incremented<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:42.240> we<00:01:42.420> need<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.689> set<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.110> up

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.550 

we<00:01:47.340> need<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.609> add<00:01:47.759> logic<00:01:47.939> bricks<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.259> coke

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
we need to add logic bricks to the coke

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.209 
we need to add logic bricks to the coke
can<00:01:49.829> make<00:01:50.250> sure<00:01:50.460> only<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.939> coke<00:01:51.149> can<00:01:51.450> is

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
can make sure only the coke can is

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.859 
can make sure only the coke can is

score<00:03:11.090> we<00:03:12.090> need<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.420> add<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:12.989> property<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.769> an

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
score we need to add a property to an

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.870 
score we need to add a property to an
object<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.850> store<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.569> score<00:03:16.489> we<00:03:17.489> could<00:03:17.730> use

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
object to store the score we could use

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.640 
object to store the score we could use
an<00:03:18.030> existing<00:03:18.269> object<00:03:18.660> but<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.290> normal

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
an existing object but the normal

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.120 
an existing object but the normal
practice<00:03:19.889> is<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:20.940> add<00:03:21.209> an<00:03:21.569> empty<00:03:22.230> object<00:03:22.940> and

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130

practice is to add an empty object and
now<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.190> can<00:03:26.790> add<00:03:27.389> a<00:03:28.290> property<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:30.230> I'll<00:03:31.230> call
