00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hi what about if you follow them on the day of 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.430
 today I can talk about my authors 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.930
 more bought or the authors who 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.940
 They have the most books in 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.500
 bookseller what happens with this list is 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.790
 that not all authors read 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.670
 this list are from my favorite authors 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.070
 there are actually some who are in my 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.840
 blacklist so it 's a list 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.430
 quite interesting to see about the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.080
 authors that come out in this list have the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.939
 same amount of books so what 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.189
 I did to unpack the was that what 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.619
 sort in order of favorite so 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.660
 say with nothing more to say we're going to 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.149
 start at number 10 is with 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.160
 in hong kong 4 books that are the four 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.129
 first books of saga driver saga 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.340
 tigers games tigers then savers testing 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.750
 and traders voyage voyage is supposed to 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.550
 they are going to get a fifth book in this 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.829
 series but I'm waiting for this fifth 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.710
 book for like three years so 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.870
 I really do not know how much is true 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.789
 they're going to get that out this is a saga that 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.100
 mix fantasy with mythology 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.449
 Hindu then quite funny the law 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.660
 it's a long time so I can not give it 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.129
 as a pretty concrete opinion about 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.989
 because they actually already forgot me 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.390
 enough of what happens but yes 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.100
 Yes I remember quite liked 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.350
 in the number then everything also with 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.900
 four books is wrong and without losing 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.880
 I have to see and linger that are both 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.920
 first books of the cows the wolves 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.409
 de merci fouz there is a third book that 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.720
 I never bought because I really doubt that 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.520
 I'm going to read it so you can say that 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.320
 speaking in these cows I also have 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.390
 the big boys that is the first book of 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.860
 the saga of the sweet king as I have already read 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.869
 the first three books of this saga 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.369
 but I only have the first one because 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.630
 they could not be the following but 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.880
 continue I was that I love and for 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.979

 fantasy autoconclusive book in the 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.780
 that there are horse races but here 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.940
 we heard contrary but it is very very 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.220
 good can same favorites of 14 in

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.110
 trilogy of the sport me saga is a 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.119
 adult epic fantasy trilogy that 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.729
 I also read in 2014 and I also 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.950
 loved it so it is very highly recommended 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.320
 and finally I have my matisse which is 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.330
 the first book of a fantasy saga 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.729
 juvenile and it's really a little bit more 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.040
 young that juvenile but I do not know 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.569
 bruce wayne in Spanish was also a book 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.340
 that I really loved all soft 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.170
 they are dishonest recommended from me 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.150
 for you so they are going to read it in the 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.700
 seventh place are clicking going with 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.610
 five books I have daily who left 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.920
 see they said twin idea ranking this would be 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.069
 the whole room of devil to the fei that is 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.349
 a fairy saga and finally I have 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.959
 delayed light which is the first book of a 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.900
 vampire trilogy called where they spin 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.209

 eclipse dawn and the second life of 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.989
 tristan what would be the five books 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.400
 that complete the saga 'twilight' not 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.349
 I think you need to explain what 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.599
 it's about pay is because I'm sure that 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.650
 and you all know her so just 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.959
 I 'm going to tell you that it's a sword that 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.690
 studied by many and loved by me and 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.370
 finally I have the guest that would be a 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.829
 auto-concluding science fiction book 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.329
 technically this is the first 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.220
 book of the saga that is supposed to 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.769
 We were going to make a sequel for this 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.810
 book but there is no news of those 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.500
 sequels you arrive in several years so 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.630
 I have 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.400
 lost causes and I will consider this 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.800
 book as a self-contained book in the 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.290
 fifth place is if noble esteem 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.540
 also with six books I have the demon 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.790
 king and excite queen the great world 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.950
 round and the crimson ground these four 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.720
 books do the sagas accrued or in 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.570
 Spanish seven kingdoms of a saga of 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.790
 epic fantasy youth that I love 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.410
 He is very attached to my heart because that 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.050
 is the first one was in epic fantasy 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.550
 youthful that reading my life then yes 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.370
 I have things of love and also 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.560
 I also have the water and be dragons 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.600
 ever that would be the first and third book 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.520
 of the chronic erc saga maybe it 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.320
 they will ask why you lack this fund 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.690
 I looked to see when I went to buy the 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.250
 books I bought the first and the third 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.440
 thinking that it was the first one that I am 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.970
 a lot then I have not come to buy 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.739
 still the second why I have not 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.140
 continued with this saga in the next 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.640
 are physical and cost homes with 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.650
 seven books I will not take out the books 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.110
 of them because they are well into a 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.660
 book that I have on the side then 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.070
 I'm too lazy to get all the 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.360
 signatures that are on top of them I have 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.669
 the first seven books of the saga 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.780
 house of night or in spanish house of the 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.269
 night a saga that 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.370
 and in stages after twilight and it 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.080
 You could say that I regret 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.910
 have spent so much money on these 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.700
 books with this I already tell you everything in the 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.160
 third place is wild thousand with eight 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.520
 books I have carmine word frostbite 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.780
 yaruquÃ­es blood brothers spirit bread and 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.280
 take them out country 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.290
 this is the complete stay of fun 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.790
 program and a saga of vampires that in 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.040
 true is everyone's favorite 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.450
 times so it's have not read has 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.880
 that I read it I know that the first two 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.160
 books are not the best in the world but 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.950
 from the third book improvement 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.750
 very much and I also have the lines and of 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.060
 govern and these are the first two 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.580
 books of the saga the lines that would be 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.470
 something like laser and spin-off of 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.390
 check my only read in the 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.550
 first books and it's likely that 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.260
 I left is there because in reality this 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.169
 I do not like it sounds much like fans 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:13.010
 by academy so in second place 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:15.590
 I have cassandra clare with nine books 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:18.200
 I have city of bone city ââof ashes 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.790
 Syrian glass city falling out of 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.980
 sees it 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.230
 and Syrian and fire these three books 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.030
 complete the saga of moron instruments or 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.430
 in Spanish hunters of shadows and 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.070
 I also have cloud work and what works 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.410
 in the clockwork princess this latin already 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.820
 full of infernal devices or in 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.710
 Spanish hunters of shadows 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.660
 origins this trilogy I like a lot 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.330
 more than the shadow hunter saga 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.130
 the main series simply because 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.080
 the characters are much better and 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.490
 because the plot is what most original 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.290
 maybe I 'm watching some moments 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.700
 bittersweet with cassandra clare but in 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.950
 I really liked their 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.470
 books and although I sometimes stay what 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.120
 that she plans to do with her series what 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.460
 most likely, keep reading your 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.100
 books so it seems to lie to you in the 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:04.490
 position number 1 this covered me goran with 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.650
 10 books to God I have percy jackson and 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.040
 the lightning thief in novel format 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.960
 graphic of silence cars 2 monsters and 2 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.700
 male of the garment these would be the 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.800
 four first books in the sagas of 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.840
 percy jackson could you say that no 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.730
 I'm a big fan of percy jackson ie 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.620
 law the first three books and I'm not 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.560
 as enchanted traces as the 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.450
 most state 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.650
 so that's why they have not had as much 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.590
 motivation of the following books 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:31.200
 I also have two heros are not the 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.910
 connection of marc office and the house of 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.410
 here is these are the first four 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.150
 books in the saga of hirsch of olympus 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.950
 of which I have here I still lack 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.470
 read the fourth book and the fifth book 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.030
 I still do not have it but I think that 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.350
 I plan to buy it 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.910
 maybe everything depends on how much I 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.250
 like the fourth and finally I have 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.840
 retirement month and two fire shifts that would be 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.270
 the first and second book of the trilogy 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.580
 the king chronic are Spanish 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.560
 beliefs of came could be said that 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.690
 this is a saga that I have abandoned and 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.430
 I free myself because it 's bigger I still liked it 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.770
 so much then I do not know what I did I do not know what 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:05.940
 I was thinking when I bought the second 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:07.200
 book but I do not know I do not think I'll finish it 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.880
 and they are really going to stay there 

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.100
 stagnating me they managed to consider this 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.320
 quite ironic situation because I 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.210
 I care now is not even close to being of 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.650
 my favorite authors and is the author that 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.260
 have more books in my 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.910
 bookseller and with this the video has finished 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.760
 today I hope you enjoyed it if 

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:25.290
 they want to leave me who is their author more 

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.160
 bought from your book would be delighted 

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.290
 know it well 

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.430
 that's it for today's video I'm 

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.430
