00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.869
 Hello to all lovers of embroidery 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:20.290
 welcome to my channel and in this 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.450
 I will show the video on my finished work 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.470
 embroidered I'm such a beacon of 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:30.800
 Dimension Design by Dimension 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.599
 This was my first original set from 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.079
 Dima 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:38.030
 madly I liked and rage 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:42.469
 starting from the scheme ending with the strings 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:47.359
 liked everything here now in front of you, you 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:50.960
 see the scheme that I have left from 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:53.559
 recruitment of course immediately I had to 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.890
 make a photocopy but I'll think what 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:00.739
 design is big above it fast 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.899
 but due to the fact that this set 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.830
 I became marching, that is, I embroidered 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:09.200
 when it went somewhere it took it with 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.579
 myself either at work when I had 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:18.130
 free time and naturally that's it 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:18.130
 affected the pattern appeared scuffs 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.979
 but in principle to the end of the shivaya scheme 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.140
 could see 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.119
 the only thing in one place was rubbed and 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:35.210
 backstish it was not visible and here 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:37.549
 here even have a hole in the scheme of the whole 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.170
 I really liked the quality of the scheme 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:45.290
 starting from paper then not like 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.750
 characters that were here to change 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.020
 I merged with others all very 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.450
 clear everything is very accessible and of course 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.899
 backsticks and french knots french 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.360
 nodules and everything is very comfortable and very good 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:03.350
 it is evident that there is no merging with 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:08.539
 icons in general and the scheme I am pretty 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:11.270
 now as for the threads and in the winter I 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.120
 worried that I did not have enough with 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.690
 that I was embroidering and no parking 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.060
 and colors and here's how much wrong with me 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.040
 left now see i kept them 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.519
 such a twisted form it was me 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.060
 convenient as I repeat again 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.620
 took him with this set 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.900
 embroider the car that is got 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.319
 spun pulled the right thread and 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:40.180
 twisted back removed bag 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.230
 if I had a thread with color 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.629
 which in the near future 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.319
 used too somewhere was after 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:50.989
 mid-work I just need them 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.239
 from above stuck it in the same place from where 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.940
 I took it out I had left 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.700
 thread hang on organizer thousand and 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.370
 see 1 see sticky stick 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.670
 is it inserted back will you see 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.010
 reel on the organizer itself but then 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.769
 the case is almost at the end of work so 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.569
 as it is not very convenient huge 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.739
 the quantity is not that simple I have left 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:20.930
 some even 2 ambassadors of course 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:25.849
 our whole set is not enough but my 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:28.160
 the collection is not so replenished i am 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.220
 I hope that my not the last set I 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.700
 rewind all these strings to bobbins so 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.129
 How do you know the threads demoness not 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:41.419
 differ from all others to volume 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:44.150
 seat gamma and so on so leave 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:44.900
 these threads on mobiles is not enough 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.769
 will come in handy 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:54.049
 Well, now the finished work is like this 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:57.829
 Looks like my beacon I already washed it 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:01.190
 and a little bit of ironing remained 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:04.639
 from staring him to invest but it's in 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:08.329
 principle on the edges of the work and does not have 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:10.280
 values ​​of the work I will give a baguette here 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.709
 I have such a great job 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.130
 it turned out to be here as 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.340
 cross like a cross 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:21.610
 and all this in different addition of threads 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.460
 two or three in one was not that embroidered 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.940
 very quickly there is a half cross main 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.120
 love thread 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:33.160
 lighthouse higher with great pleasure 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.410
 the house is all yours with a huge 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.170
 pleasure and the track from this bushes 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.720
 and flowers of course when you embroider 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.520
 at first it is not at all clear that this is you 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.480
 now see french knots not 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.490
 did last 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.440
 french knots and poke there i'm not 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.670
 I know where I can but it's flowers 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:57.070
 they grow where they want and a are executed 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:00.970
 French in 2 strings to me also 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:05.250
 I liked them to do now you 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:08.230
 see vases with flowers house and 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:11.020
 the house moans are chic and proper 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:14.080
 the lighthouse is of course the most cool and what 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:17.020
 There is a backstitch in this design and in general 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.090
 just transformed him I will try you 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.130
 put a photo before backstitch and after 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.500
 I laid out in instagram for those who 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.980
 there is no registered insert now 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.100
 you see how the work has changed 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:33.220
 backsticks 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.560
 what else did you want to say about this 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.760
 design 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.370
 I liked working Zimin chance 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.490
 Threads I also liked good tags 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:45.430
 dense not curled in the beginning were at 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.630
 I have a little shadow of a problem but then I 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:51.699
 friends with them so to speak 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:56.710
 good starchy canvas 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:06:00.520
 and the scheme is good all good so I 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:03.340
 I want to make out a set of it 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.970
 Of course, in the near future, but I don’t know how 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.320
 I will succeed 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.720
 I will certainly try faster and 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.639
 I am sure to show you this will 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:17.460
