00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.760
 just can not stand 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:57.200
 we operate with a concept like 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:00.530

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.110

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.450

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.700
 kids it's understandable but excuse me here 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.019
 so everyone dies he is written I 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.959

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.940

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.100

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.160
