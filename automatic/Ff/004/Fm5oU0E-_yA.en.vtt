00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
video and this seatbelt locked on me

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.969 
video and this seatbelt locked on me
when<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> flew<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.840> seat<00:02:07.020> down<00:02:07.170> really<00:02:07.380> fast<00:02:07.619> so

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
when I flew the seat down really fast so

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.499 
when I flew the seat down really fast so
just<00:02:08.190> that's<00:02:08.819> another<00:02:09.090> thing<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.390> pay

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
just that's another thing to pay

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.680 
just that's another thing to pay
attention<00:02:09.720> for<00:02:10.940> they<00:02:11.940> go<00:02:12.090> up<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.330> little<00:02:12.450> bit

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
attention for they go up a little bit

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.120 
attention for they go up a little bit
hard<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.050> do<00:02:13.170> kind<00:02:13.349> of<00:02:13.380> have<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.590> slam<00:02:13.920> them

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
hard you do kind of have to slam them

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.130 
hard you do kind of have to slam them
shut<00:02:15.440> okay<00:02:16.440> now<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.620> guess<00:02:16.800> I'm<00:02:16.950> done
