00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
always say on what part of the design

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.640 
always say on what part of the design
you're<00:02:11.780> aiming<00:02:12.170> for<00:02:12.549> in<00:02:13.750> this<00:02:14.750> one<00:02:14.989> I<00:02:15.230> didn't

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
you're aiming for in this one I didn't

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.100 
you're aiming for in this one I didn't
really<00:02:15.890> have<00:02:16.070> enough<00:02:17.000> that<00:02:17.180> I<00:02:17.239> liked<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.959> dip

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
really have enough that I liked to dip

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.710 
really have enough that I liked to dip
three<00:02:18.470> fingers<00:02:18.829> at<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:19.010> time<00:02:19.280> or<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.150> probably

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
three fingers at a time or I probably

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.750 
three fingers at a time or I probably
would<00:02:20.959> have<00:02:21.079> gone<00:02:21.199> that<00:02:21.470> route<00:02:21.709> just<00:02:22.070> for<00:02:22.519> the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
would have gone that route just for the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.910 
would have gone that route just for the
sake<00:02:22.970> of<00:02:23.000> time<00:02:23.630> and

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
sake of time and

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.670 
sake of time and
convenience<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:25.480> once<00:02:25.959> you<00:02:26.080> have<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.319> surface

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
convenience so once you have the surface

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.830 
convenience so once you have the surface
all<00:02:26.830> clean<00:02:27.130> go<00:02:27.790> ahead<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.120> pull<00:02:28.390> your<00:02:28.510> finger
