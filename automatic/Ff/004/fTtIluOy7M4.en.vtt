gunmetal version just because of the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.410 
gunmetal version just because of the

of hidden so you have to actually know

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.330

for a while I've kind of gotten used to

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.249 
for a while I've kind of gotten used to
it<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.340> note<00:01:26.790> by<00:01:27.090> instinct<00:01:27.900> where<00:01:28.080> these

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
it and note by instinct where these

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.590 
it and note by instinct where these

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
buttons are so the volume buttons are

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.690 
buttons are so the volume buttons are

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.600 
right here and you can see how they're
flat<00:01:33.439> so<00:01:34.439> there's<00:01:34.619> not<00:01:34.740> really<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:35.040> bump<00:01:35.430> that

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
flat so there's not really a bump that

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.010 
flat so there's not really a bump that
you<00:01:35.700> can<00:01:35.850> tell<00:01:36.150> where<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> volume<00:01:36.750> buttons

pocket where I'd accidentally pressed

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.050 
pocket where I'd accidentally pressed
this<00:01:49.470> area<00:01:49.829> thinking<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.579> power<00:01:50.790> button

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
this area thinking that the power button

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.080 
this area thinking that the power button
was<00:01:51.210> here<00:01:51.630> whereas<00:01:52.290> it'd<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.680> over<00:01:52.860> here<00:01:53.310> it

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
was here whereas it'd be over here it

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.789 
was here whereas it'd be over here it
does<00:01:54.360> have<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> nice<00:01:54.780> look<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.560> the

does have a nice look to it you have the
spigen<00:01:56.219> logo<00:01:56.520> right<00:01:56.670> there<00:01:56.729> as<00:01:57.119> well<00:01:57.780> as<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
spigen logo right there as well as the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.490 
spigen logo right there as well as the
power<00:01:58.469> button<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:58.920> PWR<00:01:59.909> now<00:02:00.899> one<00:02:01.079> thing<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.320> did

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
power button and PWR now one thing I did

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.859 
power button and PWR now one thing I did
notice<00:02:01.710> was<00:02:02.070> speaking<00:02:03.000> has<00:02:03.240> what<00:02:03.509> it's<00:02:03.630> called

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
notice was speaking has what it's called

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.170 
notice was speaking has what it's called
an<00:02:04.049> air<00:02:04.320> cushion<00:02:04.740> technology<00:02:04.770> in<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.640> case<00:02:05.700> I

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
an air cushion technology in this case I

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.240 
an air cushion technology in this case I
think<00:02:06.600> that's<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.110> reason<00:02:07.290> why<00:02:07.619> when<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.920> shake

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
think that's the reason why when I shake

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.609 
think that's the reason why when I shake
the<00:02:08.399> case<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.789> can<00:02:09.060> feel<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.509> phone<00:02:09.840> shift<00:02:10.470> a

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
the case I can feel the phone shift a

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.650 
the case I can feel the phone shift a
little<00:02:10.890> inside<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.400> case<00:02:11.580> itself<00:02:11.970> it's<00:02:12.480> not

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
little inside the case itself it's not

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.740 
little inside the case itself it's not
too<00:02:12.900> bad<00:02:13.110> but<00:02:13.530> it

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
too bad but it

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.390 
too bad but it
something<00:02:13.990> you<00:02:14.080> can<00:02:14.230> notice<00:02:14.530> holding<00:02:15.250> it<00:02:15.340> in

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
something you can notice holding it in

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.790 
something you can notice holding it in
your<00:02:15.490> hands<00:02:15.850> is<00:02:15.940> really<00:02:15.970> nice<00:02:16.450> it<00:02:16.810> still<00:02:17.650> keeps

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
your hands is really nice it still keeps

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.920 
your hands is really nice it still keeps
us<00:02:18.010> really<00:02:18.340> nice<00:02:18.520> slim<00:02:18.850> features<00:02:19.270> it<00:02:19.660> doesn't

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
us really nice slim features it doesn't

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.810 
us really nice slim features it doesn't
add<00:02:20.050> much<00:02:20.080> bulk<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.740> I<00:02:20.800> do<00:02:20.860> find<00:02:21.340> that<00:02:21.520> it's

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
add much bulk and I do find that it's

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.460 
add much bulk and I do find that it's
easier<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.180> grip<00:02:22.480> on<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.810> sides<00:02:23.050> with<00:02:23.320> the

easier to grip on the sides with the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.860 
easier to grip on the sides with the
rubber<00:02:23.800> material<00:02:24.430> on<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.700> side<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.360> top<00:02:25.600> the

rubber material on the side the top the
cutouts<00:02:26.170> work<00:02:26.440> perfectly<00:02:26.890> fine

microphone the camera cut out itself is
perfectly<00:02:32.920> fine<00:02:33.190> it's<00:02:33.430> just<00:02:33.490> a<00:02:33.670> box<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.240> it

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
perfectly fine it's just a box and it

keeps the camera protected even when

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.220 
keeps the camera protected even when

nice clear plastic and I don't have the
matte<00:02:40.300> finish<00:02:40.330> screen<00:02:40.900> protector<00:02:41.320> but<00:02:41.860> if<00:02:41.950> you

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
matte finish screen protector but if you

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.350 
matte finish screen protector but if you
had<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.790> would<00:02:42.940> be<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.150> little<00:02:43.300> bit<00:02:43.540> blurry<00:02:45.360> now

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
had it would be a little bit blurry now

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.270 
had it would be a little bit blurry now
the<00:02:46.420> top<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:46.900> bottom<00:02:47.020> does<00:02:47.380> have<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:47.650> nice<00:02:47.950> lip

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
the top and bottom does have a nice lip

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.130 
the top and bottom does have a nice lip
to<00:02:48.489> it<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:49.150> prevents<00:02:49.600> it<00:02:49.720> from<00:02:49.840> touching

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
to it and that prevents it from touching

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.710 
to it and that prevents it from touching
the<00:02:50.260> screen<00:02:50.650> when<00:02:50.830> placing<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.370> face<00:02:51.610> down

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
the screen when placing it face down

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.390 
the screen when placing it face down
however<00:02:52.720> on<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.140> sides<00:02:53.410> of<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.650> edge<00:02:53.800> there's

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
however on the sides of the edge there's

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.699 
however on the sides of the edge there's
not<00:02:54.580> a<00:02:54.610> lot<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:54.880> protection<00:02:55.000> on<00:02:55.420> that<00:02:55.690> so<00:02:56.590> if

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
not a lot of protection on that so if

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.530 
not a lot of protection on that so if
you<00:02:56.830> have<00:02:56.860> something<00:02:57.250> like<00:02:57.280> this<00:02:57.610> if<00:02:57.820> you<00:02:58.360> lay

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
you have something like this if you lay

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.590 
you have something like this if you lay
it<00:02:58.630> on<00:02:58.720> top<00:02:58.959> your<00:02:59.350> screen<00:02:59.739> will<00:02:59.920> be<00:02:59.950> touching

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
it on top your screen will be touching

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.210 
it on top your screen will be touching
the<00:03:01.600> buttons<00:03:01.900> are<00:03:02.050> very<00:03:02.260> tactile<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:02.950> feel

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
the buttons are very tactile and feel

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.800 
the buttons are very tactile and feel
great<00:03:03.520> when<00:03:03.700> you're<00:03:03.850> pressing<00:03:04.120> them<00:03:04.390> now<00:03:04.630> when

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
great when you're pressing them now when

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.810 
great when you're pressing them now when
using<00:03:05.020> the<00:03:05.200> case<00:03:05.410> on<00:03:05.650> regular<00:03:06.070> usage<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.700> edge

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
using the case on regular usage the edge

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.270 
using the case on regular usage the edge
is<00:03:07.060> still<00:03:07.300> very<00:03:07.510> easy<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:07.959> use<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.770> case

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
is still very easy to use the case

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.310 
is still very easy to use the case
itself<00:03:09.730> doesn't<00:03:10.000> prevent<00:03:10.690> you<00:03:10.930> from<00:03:10.959> using

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
itself doesn't prevent you from using

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.160 
itself doesn't prevent you from using
the<00:03:11.470> edge<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:11.920> it's<00:03:12.459> not<00:03:13.300> obtrusive<00:03:13.660> when

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
the edge and it's not obtrusive when

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.960 
the edge and it's not obtrusive when
you're<00:03:14.320> using<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.739> phone<00:03:14.950> one<00:03:15.550> thing<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:15.790> did

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
you're using the phone one thing I did

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.699 
you're using the phone one thing I did
like<00:03:16.209> was<00:03:16.480> that<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.900> bottom<00:03:17.200> edge<00:03:17.320> is<00:03:17.350> high

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
like was that the bottom edge is high

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.259 
like was that the bottom edge is high
enough<00:03:17.920> that<00:03:17.980> when<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:18.370> use<00:03:18.580> my<00:03:18.610> fingerprint

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
enough that when I use my fingerprint

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.690 
enough that when I use my fingerprint
sensor<00:03:19.630> it<00:03:20.260> actually<00:03:20.890> lines<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.400> up<00:03:21.489> like<00:03:21.670> a

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
sensor it actually lines it up like a

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.420 
sensor it actually lines it up like a
guardrail<00:03:22.209> so<00:03:22.870> when<00:03:23.019> I<00:03:23.080> put<00:03:23.230> my<00:03:23.260> thumb<00:03:23.560> down<00:03:23.799> it

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
guardrail so when I put my thumb down it

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.009 
guardrail so when I put my thumb down it
automatically<00:03:25.000> aligns<00:03:25.450> with<00:03:25.600> a<00:03:25.660> button

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
automatically aligns with a button

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.500 
automatically aligns with a button
without<00:03:26.380> sliding<00:03:26.980> over<00:03:27.489> and<00:03:27.670> I<00:03:28.120> missed<00:03:28.180> a

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
without sliding over and I missed a

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.509 
without sliding over and I missed a
fingerprint<00:03:28.989> reader<00:03:29.200> now<00:03:29.799> in<00:03:29.950> terms<00:03:30.130> of<00:03:30.310> drop

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
fingerprint reader now in terms of drop

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.340 
fingerprint reader now in terms of drop
protection<00:03:31.030> I<00:03:31.150> believe<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.780> case<00:03:31.900> will<00:03:32.110> fare

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
protection I believe the case will fare

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.900 
protection I believe the case will fare
very<00:03:32.380> well<00:03:32.650> I<00:03:32.980> haven't<00:03:33.280> dropped<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.640> too<00:03:33.790> many

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
very well I haven't dropped it too many

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.120 
very well I haven't dropped it too many
times<00:03:34.239> but<00:03:34.750> when<00:03:34.870> you<00:03:35.019> do<00:03:35.230> it's<00:03:35.709> not<00:03:35.890> that

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
times but when you do it's not that

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.430 
times but when you do it's not that
difficult<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.880> understand<00:03:37.570> how<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:38.260> gets

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
difficult to understand how it gets

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.009 
difficult to understand how it gets
protected<00:03:39.100> but<00:03:40.090> you<00:03:40.180> also<00:03:40.330> have<00:03:40.540> to<00:03:40.570> keep<00:03:40.750> note

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
protected but you also have to keep note

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.470 
protected but you also have to keep note
that<00:03:41.470> with<00:03:41.620> these<00:03:41.739> clear<00:03:42.070> plastic<00:03:42.100> screens<00:03:42.850> it

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
that with these clear plastic screens it

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.630 
that with these clear plastic screens it
will<00:03:43.720> get<00:03:43.900> scratched<00:03:44.260> up<00:03:44.530> and<00:03:44.709> it<00:03:45.040> will<00:03:45.130> wear

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
will get scratched up and it will wear

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.300 
will get scratched up and it will wear
over<00:03:45.670> time<00:03:46.239> well<00:03:47.200> it's<00:03:47.470> a<00:03:47.620> very<00:03:47.739> simple<00:03:48.130> case

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
over time well it's a very simple case
