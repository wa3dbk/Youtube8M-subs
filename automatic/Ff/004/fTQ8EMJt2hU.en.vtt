00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.990 

the<00:00:32.990> first<00:00:33.230> exercise<00:00:33.620> I<00:00:33.860> show<00:00:34.310> here<00:00:34.520> is<00:00:34.700> for

the first exercise I show here is for

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.930 
the first exercise I show here is for
your<00:00:35.120> pedal<00:00:35.720> power<00:00:35.930> if<00:00:36.710> you<00:00:36.770> have<00:00:37.130> a<00:00:37.160> leg<00:00:37.460> close

your pedal power if you have a leg close

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.570 
your pedal power if you have a leg close
by<00:00:38.330> or<00:00:38.690> a<00:00:38.720> river<00:00:39.020> you<00:00:39.380> can<00:00:39.620> also<00:00:39.890> just<00:00:40.250> grab<00:00:40.520> a

by or a river you can also just grab a

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.880 
by or a river you can also just grab a
surfboard<00:00:40.940> and<00:00:41.480> go<00:00:41.690> there<00:00:41.960> and<00:00:41.989> having<00:00:42.650> real

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
surfboard and go there and having real

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.360 
surfboard and go there and having real
water<00:00:43.190> if<00:00:43.760> you<00:00:43.970> don't<00:00:44.270> then<00:00:45.230> you<00:00:45.830> might<00:00:46.070> want

water if you don't then you might want

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.180 
water if you don't then you might want
to<00:00:46.430> use<00:00:46.610> this<00:00:46.850> exercise<00:00:47.540> we<00:00:47.989> use<00:00:48.230> a<00:00:48.260> resistance

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
to use this exercise we use a resistance

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.189 
to use this exercise we use a resistance
stand<00:00:49.790> for<00:00:50.180> it<00:00:50.330> they're<00:00:50.600> different<00:00:50.780> colors

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
stand for it they're different colors

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.090 
stand for it they're different colors
for<00:00:51.770> different<00:00:52.220> resistance<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:53.890> with<00:00:54.890> the

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
for different resistance and with the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.189 
for different resistance and with the
two<00:00:55.280> moles<00:00:55.580> of<00:00:55.879> put<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.239> resistance<00:00:56.540> and

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
two moles of put the resistance and

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.770 
two moles of put the resistance and
around<00:00:58.420> around<00:00:59.420> this<00:00:59.690> pole<00:01:00.080> and<00:01:01.330> go<00:01:02.330> with<00:01:02.570> the

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
around around this pole and go with the

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.840 
around around this pole and go with the
belly<00:01:03.260> on<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:05.020> wall<00:01:06.020> light<00:01:06.560> will<00:01:07.520> be<00:01:07.700> my

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
belly on the wall light will be my

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:18.870 
belly on the wall light will be my
surfboard<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:08.860> then<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:16.640> it<00:01:16.790> depends<00:01:17.360> on<00:01:17.509> the

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
surfboard and then and it depends on the

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.469 
surfboard and then and it depends on the
resistance<00:01:19.880> Pankey<00:01:20.570> using<00:01:21.080> if<00:01:21.200> you<00:01:21.410> do<00:01:22.479> more

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
resistance Pankey using if you do more

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.620 
resistance Pankey using if you do more
perilous<00:01:24.080> for<00:01:24.380> a<00:01:24.410> long<00:01:24.560> time<00:01:24.979> or<00:01:25.220> just<00:01:25.630> harder

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
perilous for a long time or just harder

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.580 
perilous for a long time or just harder
and<00:01:27.080> a<00:01:27.259> short<00:01:27.530> period<00:01:28.039> up<00:01:28.789> to<00:01:28.850> you<00:01:29.270> just<00:01:30.200> do<00:01:30.410> as

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
and a short period up to you just do as
