00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.740 
um maybe you can see that maybe you
can't<00:02:16.640> they<00:02:17.640> have<00:02:17.790> changed<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.720> a

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
can't they have changed it to a

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.580 
can't they have changed it to a
proprietor<00:02:19.820> proprietary<00:02:21.410> proprietor<00:02:22.410> I

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
proprietor proprietary proprietor I

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.180 
proprietor proprietary proprietor I
don't<00:02:23.190> know<00:02:23.250> they<00:02:23.430> changed<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:25.070> so<00:02:26.070> yeah

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
don't know they changed it so yeah

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.550 
don't know they changed it so yeah
that's<00:02:26.490> with<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.820> exterior<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:28.050> buttons<00:02:28.380> I

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
that's with the exterior the buttons I

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.080 
that's with the exterior the buttons I
like<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:28.980> think<00:02:29.220> they're<00:02:29.370> centered<00:02:29.670> really

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
like I think they're centered really

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.500 
like I think they're centered really
well<00:02:30.410> I<00:02:31.410> think<00:02:32.280> they<00:02:32.640> did<00:02:32.790> nicely<00:02:33.180> with<00:02:33.330> that

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
well I think they did nicely with that

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.020 
well I think they did nicely with that
but<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.080> joystick<00:02:34.740> at<00:02:34.980> first<00:02:35.490> was<00:02:35.730> hard<00:02:35.940> to

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
but the joystick at first was hard to

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.990 
but the joystick at first was hard to
get<00:02:36.150> used<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.630> but<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.800> really<00:02:38.070> is<00:02:38.340> just<00:02:38.370> simple

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
get used to but it really is just simple

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.290 
get used to but it really is just simple
it's<00:02:39.360> really<00:02:39.540> easy<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.290> get<00:02:40.410> used<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.800> on<00:02:41.130> the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
it's really easy to get used to on the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.120 
it's really easy to get used to on the
front<00:02:42.300> screen<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:43.020> have<00:02:43.050> changed<00:02:43.770> it<00:02:43.920> my

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
front screen I have changed it my

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.890 
front screen I have changed it my
background<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.820> a<00:02:44.850> Patriots<00:02:45.300> background<00:02:45.750> I've

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
background to a Patriots background I've

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.440

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
changed a theme to a PlayStation Network

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.670 
changed a theme to a PlayStation Network
theme<00:02:48.750> because<00:02:49.020> I<00:02:49.140> thought<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.440> looked<00:02:49.530> a

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
theme because I thought it looked a

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.240 
theme because I thought it looked a
little<00:02:49.770> bit<00:02:49.890> brighter<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:53.040> have

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
little bit brighter and I have

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.250 
little bit brighter and I have

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
now we can dive right into that Sesame

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
really had a chance to play a

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.640 
really had a chance to play a
first-person<00:04:09.500> shooter<00:04:10.099> with<00:04:10.129> the<00:04:10.459> PSP<00:04:10.970> at<00:04:11.120> all

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
I hear that the controls can be a little

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.319 
I hear that the controls can be a little
bit<00:04:15.170> funky<00:04:15.500> but<00:04:16.630> yeah<00:04:18.639> for<00:04:19.639> the<00:04:19.790> record<00:04:20.120> I<00:04:20.299> am

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
bit funky but yeah for the record I am

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.320 
bit funky but yeah for the record I am

NOT the best player at all I mean by any
stretch<00:04:23.600> of<00:04:23.720> the<00:04:23.870> imagination<00:04:25.990> as<00:04:26.990> you<00:04:27.410> can

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.460 

yeah<00:04:32.210> the<00:04:32.419> spacing<00:04:32.840> with<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:33.020> joystick

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
yeah the spacing with the joystick

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.770 
yeah the spacing with the joystick
really<00:04:33.770> isn't<00:04:33.979> that<00:04:34.190> much<00:04:34.280> of<00:04:34.430> a<00:04:34.639> problem<00:04:34.790> it's

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
really isn't that much of a problem it's

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.900 
really isn't that much of a problem it's
just<00:04:35.930> that<00:04:36.290> I<00:04:36.320> really<00:04:36.800> am<00:04:36.979> that<00:04:37.310> bad<00:04:37.490> at<00:04:37.729> these
