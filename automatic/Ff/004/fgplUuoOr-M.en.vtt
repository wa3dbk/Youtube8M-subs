climate book for my weather climate and

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.029 
climate book for my weather climate and
atmosphere<00:00:26.670> class<00:00:27.359> it's<00:00:28.260> quite<00:00:28.680> interesting

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
atmosphere class it's quite interesting

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.890 
atmosphere class it's quite interesting
actually<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.970> only<00:00:30.119> thing<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.420> bugs<00:00:30.599> me<00:00:30.720> is

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
actually the only thing that bugs me is

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.080 
actually the only thing that bugs me is
that<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.199> teacher<00:00:31.460> leases<00:00:32.460> his<00:00:32.759> class

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
that the teacher leases his class

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.150 
that the teacher leases his class
exactly<00:00:33.660> after<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.110> book<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.649> PowerPoint

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
exactly after the book so the PowerPoint

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.370 
exactly after the book so the PowerPoint
uses<00:00:35.399> all<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.640> same<00:00:35.880> like<00:00:36.809> pictures<00:00:37.350> and

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
uses all the same like pictures and

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.650 
uses all the same like pictures and
graphs<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.250> charts<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:39.420> kind<00:00:39.629> of

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
graphs and charts and it's kind of

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.090 
graphs and charts and it's kind of
annoying<00:00:39.960> because<00:00:40.200> they<00:00:40.440> told<00:00:40.649> us<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.829> read

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
annoying because they told us to read

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.010 
annoying because they told us to read
the<00:00:41.250> chapter<00:00:41.579> before<00:00:41.850> class<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.540> normally

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
the chapter before class and normally

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.619 
the chapter before class and normally
I'm<00:00:43.170> not<00:00:43.200> big<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.559> reading<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.309> like<00:00:44.879> this

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629

idea I'm into the weather candy and so I

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.439

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
interesting it was just you know it was

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.410

a<00:00:55.110> pretty<00:00:55.949> good<00:00:56.160> book<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:56.850> boring<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
a pretty good book but it's boring the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.610 
a pretty good book but it's boring the
second<00:00:57.690> time<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.960> hear<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.170> when<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.320> says

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
second time you hear it when it says

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
should be interesting and learning about

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.100 
should be interesting and learning about
the<00:01:12.150> stratosphere<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.260> them<00:01:14.479> thermosphere<00:01:15.479> in

the troposphere and all those theories

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.499 
the troposphere and all those theories
which<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.070> actually<00:01:20.790> pretty<00:01:20.939> interesting<00:01:21.420> to

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
which is actually pretty interesting to

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.300

me which sounds really many but I'm not
ashamed<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.850> another<00:01:24.840> class<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.320> my

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
ashamed of that another class is my

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.679 
ashamed of that another class is my
Spanish<00:01:25.770> class<00:01:26.090> which<00:01:27.090> was<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.270> little<00:01:27.509> better

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
Spanish class which was a little better

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.359 
Spanish class which was a little better
today<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:28.110> talked<00:01:28.320> more<00:01:28.530> about<00:01:28.590> ourselves<00:01:28.890> and

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
today we talked more about ourselves and

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.940 
today we talked more about ourselves and
we<00:01:29.549> all<00:01:29.700> laughed<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.150> lot<00:01:30.270> because<00:01:30.829> sometimes<00:01:31.829> I

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
we all laughed a lot because sometimes I

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.109 
we all laughed a lot because sometimes I
can<00:01:31.979> think<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.369> right<00:01:32.490> words<00:01:32.700> and

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
can think of the right words and

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.030 
can think of the right words and
sometimes<00:01:33.780> things<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:34.650> don't<00:01:34.920> make<00:01:34.979> sense

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
sometimes things just don't make sense

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.999 
sometimes things just don't make sense
and<00:01:35.990> sometimes<00:01:36.990> we<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.259> share<00:01:37.409> just<00:01:37.530> silly

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
and sometimes we just share just silly

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.749 
and sometimes we just share just silly
stories<00:01:38.549> about<00:01:38.820> each<00:01:39.000> other<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:40.549> helps<00:01:41.549> us

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
stories about each other that helps us

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:42.859 
stories about each other that helps us
speak<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.030> Spanish<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.479> I'm<00:01:42.570> really<00:01:42.720> starting

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
speak in Spanish and I'm really starting

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.660 
speak in Spanish and I'm really starting
to<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.350> teacher<00:01:43.560> well<00:01:44.189> one<00:01:44.369> thing<00:01:44.610> I

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
to like that teacher well one thing I

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.980 
to like that teacher well one thing I
was<00:01:44.790> gonna<00:01:44.939> say<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.270> we're<00:01:45.420> reading<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.720> poem

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
was gonna say is we're reading this poem

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.219 
was gonna say is we're reading this poem
and<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.350> called<00:01:46.579> to<00:01:47.579> make<00:01:47.820> us<00:01:48.360> Blanca<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.049> you

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
and it's called to make us Blanca if you

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.899 
and it's called to make us Blanca if you
read<00:01:49.380> Spanish<00:01:49.530> or<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.460> probably<00:01:50.700> get<00:01:50.880> it

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
read Spanish or you can probably get it

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.580 
read Spanish or you can probably get it
translated<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.570> English<00:01:51.899> but<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.259> probably

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
translated to English but that probably

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.499 
translated to English but that probably
