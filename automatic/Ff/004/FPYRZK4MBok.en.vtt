00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
lighting just change that to two

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.990 
lighting just change that to two
balances<00:01:37.950> up<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.280> two<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:38.820> just

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
balances up to two you can just

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.929 
balances up to two you can just
experiment<00:01:39.390> with<00:01:39.630> these<00:01:40.070> fall<00:01:41.070> off<00:01:41.369> maybe

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
experiment with these fall off maybe

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.630 
experiment with these fall off maybe
like<00:01:42.180> three<00:01:43.110> four
