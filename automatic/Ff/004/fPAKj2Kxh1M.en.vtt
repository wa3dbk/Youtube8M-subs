seems to be very unique I'm not really
sure<00:01:29.730> exactly<00:01:30.000> what<00:01:30.480> they<00:01:30.630> do<00:01:30.690> but<00:01:31.620> it<00:01:31.710> looks

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
sure exactly what they do but it looks

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.650 
sure exactly what they do but it looks
like<00:01:31.950> one<00:01:32.310> if<00:01:32.580> I<00:01:32.700> had<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.970> guess<00:01:33.120> I'd<00:01:33.360> say<00:01:33.390> that

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
like one if I had to guess I'd say that

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.330 
like one if I had to guess I'd say that
one<00:01:33.870> of<00:01:33.900> them<00:01:34.080> gives<00:01:34.290> him<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.590> power<00:01:34.800> boost<00:01:35.070> or

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
one of them gives him a power boost or

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.010 
one of them gives him a power boost or
damage<00:01:35.670> upgrade<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.330> other<00:01:36.480> gives<00:01:36.720> him<00:01:36.840> some

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
damage upgrade the other gives him some

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.130 
damage upgrade the other gives him some
speed<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.710> maybe<00:01:38.460> perhaps<00:01:38.850> some<00:01:39.750> other<00:01:39.780> one

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
speed and maybe perhaps some other one

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.190 
speed and maybe perhaps some other one
gives<00:01:40.440> him<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:41.120> new<00:01:42.120> move<00:01:42.420> set<00:01:42.690> or<00:01:42.900> something

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
gives him a new move set or something

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.960 
gives him a new move set or something
like<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.590> can't<00:01:44.010> really<00:01:44.220> honestly<00:01:44.430> tell

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
like that I can't really honestly tell

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.030 
like that I can't really honestly tell
you<00:01:45.000> because<00:01:45.240> every<00:01:46.020> time<00:01:46.050> he<00:01:46.380> changes<00:01:46.830> he

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
you because every time he changes he

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.370 
you because every time he changes he
seems<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.460> die<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.030> as<00:01:48.360> far<00:01:48.540> as<00:01:48.750> i<00:01:48.870> know<00:01:48.930> i

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
seems to die and as far as i know i

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.560 
seems to die and as far as i know i
can't<00:01:49.800> really<00:01:50.130> determine<00:01:50.880> if<00:01:51.360> he<00:01:51.390> has<00:01:51.540> a

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
can't really determine if he has a

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.200 
can't really determine if he has a
unique<00:01:51.900> move<00:01:52.170> set<00:01:52.440> with<00:01:52.710> one<00:01:53.100> hands<00:01:53.760> I'm<00:01:54.000> gonna

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
unique move set with one hands I'm gonna

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.570 
unique move set with one hands I'm gonna
call<00:01:54.330> my<00:01:54.420> hands<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.870> guess<00:01:55.080> one<00:01:55.710> hands<00:01:56.370> or<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
call my hands I guess one hands or the

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.640 
call my hands I guess one hands or the
other<00:01:56.729> because<00:01:56.940> he<00:01:57.600> only<00:01:57.720> does<00:01:57.930> one<00:01:58.260> combo

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
other because he only does one combo

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.350 
other because he only does one combo
every<00:01:58.890> single<00:01:59.190> time<00:01:59.370> so<00:01:59.729> it's<00:01:59.880> kind<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.150> tough

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
every single time so it's kind of tough

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.180 
every single time so it's kind of tough
to<00:02:00.420> determine<00:02:00.690> which<00:02:01.170> ones<00:02:01.440> are<00:02:01.680> unique<00:02:02.040> in

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
to determine which ones are unique in

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.740 
to determine which ones are unique in
which<00:02:02.400> ones<00:02:02.640> are<00:02:02.820> exclusive<00:02:03.300> to<00:02:03.330> a<00:02:03.420> certain

which ones are exclusive to a certain

which is pretty intense it also looks

unique<00:02:37.070> looking<00:02:37.550> but<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.180> feel<00:02:38.390> like<00:02:38.480> that's

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
unique looking but I feel like that's

Virgil's only real zoning tool and I'm
not<00:02:41.600> sure<00:02:41.630> how<00:02:42.290> well<00:02:42.560> it'll<00:02:42.740> work<00:02:42.920> or<00:02:43.130> how<00:02:43.400> fast

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
not sure how well it'll work or how fast

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.400 
not sure how well it'll work or how fast
the<00:02:43.940> startup<00:02:44.270> will<00:02:44.390> be<00:02:44.540> but<00:02:44.840> it<00:02:44.930> seems<00:02:45.140> like<00:02:45.200> it

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
the startup will be but it seems like it

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.690 
the startup will be but it seems like it
does<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.560> pretty<00:02:45.770> decent<00:02:46.130> amount<00:02:46.310> of<00:02:46.370> damage

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
does a pretty decent amount of damage

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.340 
does a pretty decent amount of damage
I'm<00:02:46.850> not<00:02:46.970> sure<00:02:47.150> if<00:02:47.240> you<00:02:47.330> can<00:02:47.360> even<00:02:47.480> combo<00:02:48.170> into

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
I'm not sure if you can even combo into

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.560 
I'm not sure if you can even combo into
anything<00:02:48.680> off<00:02:49.130> of<00:02:49.160> that<00:02:49.520> but<00:02:49.940> it<00:02:50.090> does<00:02:50.270> seem

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
anything off of that but it does seem

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.420 
anything off of that but it does seem
like<00:02:50.960> it<00:02:51.290> gives<00:02:51.620> them<00:02:51.740> the<00:02:51.830> opportunity<00:02:51.860> to

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
like it gives them the opportunity to

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.180 
like it gives them the opportunity to
set<00:02:53.030> up<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.210> few<00:02:53.480> shape<00:02:54.050> damage<00:02:54.380> scenarios<00:02:54.920> in<00:02:55.130> a

people coming in if they get a little

something<00:03:00.530> like<00:03:00.620> that<00:03:00.680> but<00:03:01.070> one<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.310> the

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
something like that but one of the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.620 
something like that but one of the
coolest<00:03:01.580> things<00:03:01.850> about<00:03:01.940> Virgil<00:03:02.390> in<00:03:02.510> my

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
coolest things about Virgil in my

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.300 
coolest things about Virgil in my
opinion<00:03:02.960> is<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.410> way<00:03:03.530> that<00:03:03.650> his<00:03:03.770> combo<00:03:04.250> is

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
opinion is the way that his combo is

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.100 
opinion is the way that his combo is
just<00:03:04.610> flow<00:03:05.120> and<00:03:05.390> I<00:03:05.420> know<00:03:05.480> that<00:03:05.690> I've<00:03:05.780> said<00:03:05.990> that

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
just flow and I know that I've said that

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.140 
just flow and I know that I've said that
iron<00:03:06.350> fists<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.770> very<00:03:06.950> unique<00:03:07.190> flow<00:03:07.460> but<00:03:08.060> the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
iron fists a very unique flow but the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.970 
iron fists a very unique flow but the
way<00:03:08.270> Virgil's<00:03:08.780> combos<00:03:09.260> flow<00:03:09.470> seemed<00:03:09.770> to<00:03:09.860> be

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
way Virgil's combos flow seemed to be

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.070 
way Virgil's combos flow seemed to be
kind<00:03:10.250> of<00:03:10.340> an<00:03:10.460> up-down<00:03:10.880> left-right<00:03:10.990> sort<00:03:11.990> of

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
kind of an up-down left-right sort of

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.260 
kind of an up-down left-right sort of
thing<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.770> way<00:03:12.860> that<00:03:13.040> he<00:03:13.130> moves<00:03:13.580> just<00:03:14.000> seems

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
thing the way that he moves just seems

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.630 
thing the way that he moves just seems
very<00:03:14.540> unique<00:03:15.080> and<00:03:15.260> very<00:03:15.370> different<00:03:16.370> from<00:03:16.550> what

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
very unique and very different from what

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.090 
very unique and very different from what
Dante<00:03:17.180> has<00:03:17.330> been<00:03:17.540> doing<00:03:17.989> in<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.170> past<00:03:18.260> vanilla

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
Dante has been doing in the past vanilla

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.680 
Dante has been doing in the past vanilla
games<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:19.640> it's<00:03:19.880> really<00:03:20.090> exciting<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.480> see

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
games and it's really exciting to see

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.780 
games and it's really exciting to see
that<00:03:20.720> capcom<00:03:21.410> has<00:03:21.680> decided<00:03:22.400> to<00:03:22.520> take<00:03:22.730> a

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
that capcom has decided to take a

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.000 
that capcom has decided to take a
character<00:03:23.270> that<00:03:23.300> is<00:03:23.720> ultimately<00:03:24.320> very

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
character that is ultimately very

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.340 
character that is ultimately very
similar<00:03:25.489> in<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:26.390> lore<00:03:26.660> of<00:03:26.690> Devil<00:03:27.230> May<00:03:27.320> Cry

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
similar in the lore of Devil May Cry

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.930 
similar in the lore of Devil May Cry
games<00:03:27.830> I<00:03:27.950> mean<00:03:28.100> they're<00:03:28.310> twin<00:03:28.580> brothers

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
games I mean they're twin brothers

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.150 
games I mean they're twin brothers
basically<00:03:29.450> I<00:03:29.480> guess<00:03:29.780> Virgil<00:03:30.350> is<00:03:30.530> older<00:03:31.130> than

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
basically I guess Virgil is older than

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.550 
basically I guess Virgil is older than
Dante<00:03:31.640> but<00:03:32.330> he<00:03:32.420> definitely<00:03:32.750> plays<00:03:33.290> very

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
Dante but he definitely plays very

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.960 
Dante but he definitely plays very
differently<00:03:34.070> one<00:03:34.489> of<00:03:34.580> the<00:03:34.640> things<00:03:34.760> that's

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
differently one of the things that's

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.210 
differently one of the things that's
worth<00:03:35.209> noting<00:03:35.690> however<00:03:35.840> is<00:03:36.230> Virgil<00:03:36.920> doesn't

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
worth noting however is Virgil doesn't

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.890 
worth noting however is Virgil doesn't
seem<00:03:37.370> to<00:03:37.459> have<00:03:37.580> an<00:03:37.700> air<00:03:37.880> dash<00:03:38.090> he<00:03:38.420> doesn't<00:03:38.750> seem

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
seem to have an air dash he doesn't seem

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.020 
seem to have an air dash he doesn't seem
to<00:03:38.930> have<00:03:39.050> a<00:03:39.590> double<00:03:40.040> jump<00:03:40.250> on<00:03:40.519> the<00:03:40.730> other<00:03:40.850> hand

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
to have a double jump on the other hand

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.550 
to have a double jump on the other hand
however<00:03:41.239> it<00:03:41.510> looks<00:03:41.630> like<00:03:41.810> he<00:03:41.900> has<00:03:42.019> a<00:03:42.050> wall<00:03:42.260> jump

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
however it looks like he has a wall jump

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.500 
however it looks like he has a wall jump
and<00:03:42.769> if<00:03:43.280> you<00:03:43.370> activate<00:03:43.760> devil<00:03:44.090> trigger<00:03:44.239> it

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
and if you activate devil trigger it

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.330 
and if you activate devil trigger it
gives<00:03:44.660> him<00:03:44.750> access<00:03:44.930> to<00:03:45.200> air<00:03:45.410> dash<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:45.890> double

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
gives him access to air dash and double

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.190 
gives him access to air dash and double
jump<00:03:46.580> so<00:03:46.820> not<00:03:47.209> having<00:03:47.420> those<00:03:47.600> by<00:03:47.750> default

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
jump so not having those by default

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.750 
jump so not having those by default
might<00:03:48.470> actually<00:03:48.680> affect<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.340> way<00:03:49.459> that<00:03:49.489> his

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
might actually affect the way that his

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.030 
might actually affect the way that his
default<00:03:50.090> play<00:03:50.420> style<00:03:50.720> is<00:03:51.050> because<00:03:51.530> with<00:03:51.680> Dante

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
default play style is because with Dante

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.530 
default play style is because with Dante
you<00:03:52.160> have<00:03:52.280> a<00:03:52.310> lot<00:03:52.459> of<00:03:52.489> box<00:03:52.760> jumps<00:03:53.180> all<00:03:53.330> you<00:03:53.450> have

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
you have a lot of box jumps all you have

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.390 
you have a lot of box jumps all you have
a<00:03:53.570> lot<00:03:53.750> of<00:03:53.780> double<00:03:54.110> jump<00:03:54.290> combos<00:03:54.680> but<00:03:54.860> it<00:03:55.250> seems

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
a lot of double jump combos but it seems

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.220 
a lot of double jump combos but it seems
like<00:03:55.430> Virgil<00:03:55.850> is<00:03:55.940> a<00:03:56.000> lot<00:03:56.150> simpler<00:03:56.570> in<00:03:56.959> that

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
like Virgil is a lot simpler in that

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.990 
like Virgil is a lot simpler in that
regard<00:03:57.650> what<00:03:58.070> seems<00:03:58.310> to<00:03:58.400> be<00:03:58.430> really<00:03:58.760> really

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
regard what seems to be really really

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.400 
regard what seems to be really really
interesting<00:03:59.480> about<00:03:59.540> Virgil<00:03:59.930> though<00:04:00.050> is<00:04:00.260> the

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
interesting about Virgil though is the

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.070 
interesting about Virgil though is the
fact<00:04:00.440> that<00:04:00.739> he<00:04:00.830> has<00:04:01.250> an<00:04:01.730> Ouroboros<00:04:02.360> s<00:04:02.630> super

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
fact that he has an Ouroboros s super

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.479 
fact that he has an Ouroboros s super
and<00:04:03.470> that<00:04:03.830> allows<00:04:04.010> them<00:04:04.160> to<00:04:04.190> make<00:04:04.340> some

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
and that allows them to make some

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.970 
and that allows them to make some
forward<00:04:04.850> progress<00:04:05.090> safely<00:04:06.080> in<00:04:06.290> addition<00:04:06.800> to

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
forward progress safely in addition to

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.590 
forward progress safely in addition to
having<00:04:07.400> a<00:04:07.550> few<00:04:07.760> extra<00:04:07.910> move<00:04:08.239> sets<00:04:08.480> you<00:04:08.570> can

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
having a few extra move sets you can

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.750 
having a few extra move sets you can
throw<00:04:08.989> the<00:04:09.350> sores<00:04:09.769> at<00:04:10.070> you<00:04:10.250> or<00:04:10.459> you<00:04:10.580> can<00:04:10.670> just

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
throw the sores at you or you can just

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.699 
throw the sores at you or you can just
kind<00:04:11.000> of<00:04:11.060> extend<00:04:11.510> his<00:04:11.630> combos<00:04:12.050> wise<00:04:12.290> up<00:04:12.590> in

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
kind of extend his combos wise up in

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:13.960 
kind of extend his combos wise up in
your<00:04:12.830> face<00:04:13.010> beating<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.489> shit<00:04:13.519> out<00:04:13.790> of<00:04:13.820> you

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
your face beating the shit out of you

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.820 
your face beating the shit out of you
going<00:04:14.420> back<00:04:14.570> to<00:04:14.660> fail<00:04:14.840> aw<00:04:14.989> I<00:04:15.140> mean<00:04:15.350> iron<00:04:15.530> fist

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
going back to fail aw I mean iron fist

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.500 
going back to fail aw I mean iron fist
really<00:04:15.950> quickly<00:04:16.370> I<00:04:16.519> think<00:04:17.030> it's<00:04:17.150> really<00:04:17.269> cool

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
really quickly I think it's really cool

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.260 
really quickly I think it's really cool
to<00:04:17.570> see<00:04:17.690> how<00:04:18.049> his<00:04:18.590> moves<00:04:18.950> just<00:04:19.370> impact<00:04:20.030> the

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
to see how his moves just impact the

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:21.900 
to see how his moves just impact the
opponent<00:04:20.720> they<00:04:20.810> have<00:04:20.930> a<00:04:20.960> lot<00:04:21.140> of<00:04:21.169> punch<00:04:21.500> you

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
opponent they have a lot of punch you

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.510 
opponent they have a lot of punch you
say<00:04:22.210> excuse<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.080> pun<00:04:23.320> but<00:04:23.620> I<00:04:24.100> think<00:04:24.340> that

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
say excuse the pun but I think that

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.710 
say excuse the pun but I think that
what's<00:04:24.790> going<00:04:24.910> to<00:04:25.000> be<00:04:25.060> a<00:04:25.090> really<00:04:25.330> big<00:04:25.510> problem

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.390 
what's going to be a really big problem
for<00:04:26.110> iron<00:04:26.380> fist<00:04:26.590> is<00:04:26.770> he<00:04:26.860> doesn't<00:04:27.100> have<00:04:27.190> a<00:04:27.250> lot

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
for iron fist is he doesn't have a lot

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.160 
for iron fist is he doesn't have a lot
of<00:04:27.430> options<00:04:27.910> to<00:04:28.000> get<00:04:28.300> in<00:04:28.450> up<00:04:28.660> close<00:04:28.900> and

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
of options to get in up close and

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.870 
of options to get in up close and
personal<00:04:29.200> and<00:04:29.830> I<00:04:30.160> think<00:04:30.220> that<00:04:30.520> you're<00:04:30.640> really

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
personal and I think that you're really

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.950 
personal and I think that you're really
gonna<00:04:31.000> have<00:04:31.120> to<00:04:31.150> put<00:04:31.360> them<00:04:31.450> on<00:04:31.540> point<00:04:31.840> with

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
gonna have to put them on point with

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.900 
gonna have to put them on point with
some<00:04:32.080> solid<00:04:32.410> assists<00:04:32.830> like<00:04:32.980> maybe<00:04:33.190> drones<00:04:33.580> to

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
some solid assists like maybe drones to

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.010 
some solid assists like maybe drones to
get<00:04:34.060> up<00:04:34.210> close<00:04:34.360> and<00:04:34.450> deal<00:04:34.690> some<00:04:34.870> damage

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
get up close and deal some damage

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.900 
get up close and deal some damage
because<00:04:35.440> it<00:04:35.620> looks<00:04:35.830> like<00:04:35.980> he<00:04:36.130> does<00:04:36.370> quite<00:04:36.850> a

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
because it looks like he does quite a

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.090 
because it looks like he does quite a
bit<00:04:37.180> of<00:04:37.300> damage<00:04:37.330> or<00:04:37.810> Virgil<00:04:38.560> miss<00:04:38.680> has<00:04:38.830> very

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
bit of damage or Virgil miss has very

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.980 
bit of damage or Virgil miss has very
little<00:04:39.310> help<00:04:39.550> I<00:04:39.730> can't<00:04:40.000> really<00:04:40.150> tell<00:04:40.420> but<00:04:40.720> I

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
little help I can't really tell but I

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.570 
little help I can't really tell but I
think<00:04:41.320> that<00:04:41.380> iron<00:04:41.770> fist<00:04:42.070> is<00:04:42.190> going<00:04:42.310> to<00:04:42.370> be<00:04:42.430> one

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
think that iron fist is going to be one

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.830 
think that iron fist is going to be one
of<00:04:42.670> those<00:04:42.730> characters<00:04:43.210> that<00:04:43.420> when<00:04:43.600> used

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
of those characters that when used

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.500 
of those characters that when used
properly<00:04:43.900> will<00:04:44.680> be<00:04:44.860> very<00:04:45.340> very<00:04:45.460> dangerous<00:04:46.060> and

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
properly will be very very dangerous and

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.060 
properly will be very very dangerous and
I<00:04:46.630> think<00:04:46.900> that<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.170> some<00:04:47.500> things<00:04:47.740> like<00:04:47.920> his

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
I think that the some things like his

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.240 
I think that the some things like his
OTG<00:04:48.610> /<00:04:48.970> overhead<00:04:49.510> kick<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:50.020> a<00:04:50.800> few<00:04:51.010> of<00:04:51.130> his

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
OTG / overhead kick and a few of his

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.890 
OTG / overhead kick and a few of his
moves<00:04:51.820> seem<00:04:52.150> to<00:04:52.270> have<00:04:52.390> some<00:04:52.660> sort<00:04:52.840> of

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
moves seem to have some sort of

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.990 
moves seem to have some sort of
invincibility<00:04:53.380> on<00:04:53.710> it<00:04:53.830> like<00:04:53.950> his<00:04:54.070> super<00:04:54.460> but<00:04:54.970> I

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
invincibility on it like his super but I

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.460 
invincibility on it like his super but I
think<00:04:55.270> he's<00:04:55.360> going<00:04:55.480> to<00:04:55.540> be<00:04:55.660> pretty<00:04:55.810> deadly<00:04:56.140> and

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
think he's going to be pretty deadly and

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.780 
think he's going to be pretty deadly and
I<00:04:56.500> think<00:04:56.740> a<00:04:56.830> lot<00:04:56.980> of<00:04:57.010> people<00:04:57.130> are<00:04:57.400> going<00:04:57.580> to

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
I think a lot of people are going to

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.420 
I think a lot of people are going to
just<00:04:58.030> be<00:04:58.180> surprised<00:04:58.690> by<00:04:59.020> how<00:04:59.290> much<00:04:59.830> stuff<00:05:00.400> you

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
just be surprised by how much stuff you

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.040 
just be surprised by how much stuff you
can<00:05:00.700> do<00:05:00.850> with<00:05:00.880> him<00:05:01.150> anyway<00:05:01.540> guys<00:05:01.690> I<00:05:01.750> hope<00:05:01.870> you

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
can do with him anyway guys I hope you

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.270 
can do with him anyway guys I hope you
