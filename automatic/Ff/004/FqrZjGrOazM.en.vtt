the resolution here as you can see and
lets<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.970> resolution<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.659> 72<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.560> then<00:01:40.979> we

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
lets the resolution is 72 and then we

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.969 
lets the resolution is 72 and then we
can<00:01:41.579> we're<00:01:41.850> going<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.060> change<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.450> at<00:01:42.979> 300
