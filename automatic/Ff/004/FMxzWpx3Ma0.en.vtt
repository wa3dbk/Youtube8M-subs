00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
other day for a slanted nail art so you

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.590 
other day for a slanted nail art so you
can<00:03:24.780> see<00:03:24.900> that<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.790> brush<00:03:26.790> has<00:03:27.150> got<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.390> little

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
can see that the brush has got a little

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.259 
can see that the brush has got a little
bit<00:03:27.780> of<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.900> slant<00:03:28.200> on<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.470> then<00:03:28.890> you<00:03:29.010> have<00:03:29.269> this

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
bit of a slant on it then you have this

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.569 
bit of a slant on it then you have this
one<00:03:30.540> which<00:03:30.570> is<00:03:31.730> sort<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:32.850> round<00:03:33.299> but<00:03:33.750> it's

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
one which is sort of round but it's

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:40.670 
one which is sort of round but it's
tapered<00:03:35.579> 20<00:03:36.510> at<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.890> edges<00:03:38.329> so<00:03:39.329> i<00:03:39.720> think<00:03:40.230> it's

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
tapered 20 at the edges so i think it's

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.360 
tapered 20 at the edges so i think it's
worth<00:03:40.920> investing<00:03:41.670> in

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
worth investing in

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.410 
worth investing in

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
a pair of good brushes but I think that

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.210 
a pair of good brushes but I think that
