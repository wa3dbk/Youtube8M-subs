 Now he often gets back then 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.790
 cable once again seen 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.809
 I used to be in denver cases like this 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.809
 but here you know that deny it again 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:28.859
 great here with the beginning still 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:31.439
 I do not care about the title song 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.690
 a shelf let's get started otherwise 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.960
 you never get the finish to 12 knights 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.590
 not how does the title tune go again? 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.590
 from merck 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:16.380
 the topic was when I started something 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.110
 I have to finish it too 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.220
 bring 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.220
 We are here in an architecture office 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.270
 are you 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:48.070
 I would like to have a look or not 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.050
 that means no I would much rather 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.700
 grad with the loo now but look 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:59.880
 urgently or displaces his pub 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.880
 or so it is always
