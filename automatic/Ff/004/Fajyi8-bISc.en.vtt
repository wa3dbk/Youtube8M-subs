clean everything's sanded down real
nicely<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:15.560> unlike<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.740> say<00:00:16.949> Latino<00:00:17.279> over

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
nicely and unlike the say Latino over

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.359 
nicely and unlike the say Latino over
here<00:00:17.990> this<00:00:18.990> one<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.289> actually<00:00:19.410> glued<00:00:19.800> down<00:00:20.009> or

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
here this one is actually glued down or

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.769 
here this one is actually glued down or
it<00:00:20.519> appears<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.849> be<00:00:20.939> glued<00:00:21.089> down<00:00:21.240> all<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.689> way

it appears to be glued down all the way
around<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.759> don't<00:00:23.880> get<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.119> extra

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:24.509 
around and so you don't get that extra

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.370 
around and so you don't get that extra
slap<00:00:24.929> sound<00:00:25.199> out<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.589> corners<00:00:26.039> but<00:00:27.380> what

you do get is a super super tight and
punchy<00:00:30.749> sound<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.589> probably<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.160> driest

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.440 
snare system on the Schlag work really
quick<00:02:19.470> because<00:02:19.620> it's<00:02:20.160> it's<00:02:20.760> very<00:02:20.819> clever<00:02:21.270> and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
quick because it's it's very clever and

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.750 
quick because it's it's very clever and
it's<00:02:21.569> very<00:02:21.750> technical<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:23.489> offers<00:02:23.730> a

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
it's very technical and it offers a

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.059 
it's very technical and it offers a
whole<00:02:24.030> lot<00:02:24.209> of<00:02:24.239> versatility<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:25.890> can

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
whole lot of versatility you can

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.880 
whole lot of versatility you can
basically<00:02:26.430> just<00:02:26.880> reach<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.680> unscrew<00:02:28.680> a

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
basically just reach in and unscrew a

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.479 
basically just reach in and unscrew a
couple<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:30.319> these<00:02:31.319> little<00:02:31.739> thumb<00:02:32.040> screws<00:02:32.340> you

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
couple of these little thumb screws you

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:33.740 
couple of these little thumb screws you
don't<00:02:32.640> need<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.760> tool<00:02:33.030> or<00:02:33.060> anything<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.600> can

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
don't need a tool or anything you can

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.449 
don't need a tool or anything you can
just<00:02:33.930> reach<00:02:34.650> in<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:34.860> unscrew<00:02:35.220> with<00:02:35.340> your

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
just reach in and unscrew with your

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.790 
just reach in and unscrew with your
fingers<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:35.910> then<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.600> slide<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:37.020> out<00:02:37.110> very

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
fingers and then you slide it out very

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.820 
fingers and then you slide it out very
similar<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.430> this<00:02:38.640> Sayla<00:02:38.970> but<00:02:39.900> slightly<00:02:40.530> more

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
similar to this Sayla but slightly more

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.300 
similar to this Sayla but slightly more
technical<00:02:41.069> so<00:02:41.970> what<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.810> get<00:02:43.080> for<00:02:43.709> a<00:02:43.739> little

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
technical so what you get for a little

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.580 
technical so what you get for a little
bit<00:02:44.459> more<00:02:44.640> it's<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:45.060> little<00:02:45.239> more<00:02:45.360> complicated

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
bit more it's a little more complicated

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.370 
bit more it's a little more complicated
and<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:46.980> takes<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.310> second<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.670> unscrew<00:02:48.239> but<00:02:48.989> you

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
and it takes a second to unscrew but you

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.990 
and it takes a second to unscrew but you
get<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.590> lot<00:02:49.800> of<00:02:49.920> versatility<00:02:50.340> with<00:02:50.550> this<00:02:50.819> one

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
get a lot of versatility with this one

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.930 
get a lot of versatility with this one
so<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:52.350> screws<00:02:52.620> on<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.799> inside<00:02:52.860> allow<00:02:53.549> you<00:02:53.610> to

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
so the screws on the inside allow you to

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.100 
so the screws on the inside allow you to
press<00:02:54.239> it<00:02:54.390> against<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.690> head<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.930> little

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
press it against the head a little

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.020 
press it against the head a little
harder<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:56.840> then<00:02:57.840> there's<00:02:58.160> this<00:02:59.160> device<00:02:59.549> here

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
harder and then there's this device here

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.850 
harder and then there's this device here
which<00:03:00.150> allows<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:00.930> actually<00:03:01.380> these<00:03:01.680> are

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
which allows you to actually these are

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.650 
which allows you to actually these are
guitar<00:03:02.190> strings<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:02.790> they're<00:03:03.180> in<00:03:03.269> a<00:03:03.360> loop

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
guitar strings and they're in a loop

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.280 
guitar strings and they're in a loop
around<00:03:04.200> this<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.370> whole<00:03:05.549> piece<00:03:05.819> and<00:03:06.290> this

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
around this this whole piece and this

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.229 
around this this whole piece and this
this<00:03:07.830> adjustment<00:03:08.340> right<00:03:08.489> here<00:03:08.700> allows<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.150> to

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
this adjustment right here allows you to

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.759 
this adjustment right here allows you to
tighten<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.780> tension<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.470> actual

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
tighten the tension of the actual

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.100 
tighten the tension of the actual
individual<00:03:11.190> guitar<00:03:11.489> strings<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.000> then<00:03:12.600> in

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
individual guitar strings and then in

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.110 
individual guitar strings and then in
addition<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.769> that<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:14.430> can<00:03:14.459> slide<00:03:14.910> these

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
addition to that you can slide these

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.530 
addition to that you can slide these
pieces<00:03:15.420> back<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:15.989> forth<00:03:16.549> to<00:03:17.549> what<00:03:18.329> I<00:03:18.359> would

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
pieces back and forth to what I would

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.890 
pieces back and forth to what I would
presume<00:03:19.170> is<00:03:19.620> probably<00:03:20.250> dries<00:03:20.670> up<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.600> snare

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
presume is probably dries up the snare

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.340 
presume is probably dries up the snare
sound<00:03:22.170> as<00:03:22.410> you<00:03:22.920> start<00:03:23.190> as<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:24.870> start<00:03:25.079> to<00:03:25.170> push

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
sound as you start as you start to push

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.349 
sound as you start as you start to push
these<00:03:25.500> towards<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.859> middle<00:03:26.100> there's<00:03:26.850> there's

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
these towards the middle there's there's

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.750 
these towards the middle there's there's
less<00:03:27.540> room<00:03:27.810> for<00:03:27.840> these<00:03:28.220> for<00:03:29.220> these<00:03:29.340> strings<00:03:29.609> to

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
less room for these for these strings to

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.819 
less room for these for these strings to
vibrate<00:03:30.150> against<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.510> head<00:03:30.690> so<00:03:31.170> as<00:03:31.410> you<00:03:31.650> open

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
vibrate against the head so as you open

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.370 
vibrate against the head so as you open
them<00:03:31.920> up<00:03:31.980> towards<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.400> outside<00:03:33.140> there's<00:03:34.140> more

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
them up towards the outside there's more

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.300 
them up towards the outside there's more
room<00:03:34.590> for<00:03:34.739> these<00:03:34.829> things<00:03:35.070> that<00:03:35.190> actually

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
room for these things that actually

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.130 
room for these things that actually
resonate<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:36.359> can<00:03:36.480> even<00:03:36.630> get<00:03:36.780> like<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:36.959> little

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
resonate you can even get like a little

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.660 
resonate you can even get like a little
bit<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.380> pitch<00:03:37.560> out<00:03:37.739> of<00:03:37.859> them<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.100> as<00:03:38.579> you

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
bit of a pitch out of them and as you

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.120 
bit of a pitch out of them and as you
move<00:03:38.790> towards<00:03:39.120> inside<00:03:39.390> straight<00:03:40.290> dry<00:03:40.769> snare

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
move towards inside straight dry snare

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.580 
move towards inside straight dry snare
sound<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:41.880> a<00:03:42.120> lot<00:03:42.750> of<00:03:42.840> engineering<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.380> lot<00:03:43.410> of

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
sound so a lot of engineering a lot of

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.380 
sound so a lot of engineering a lot of
thought<00:03:43.799> went<00:03:43.950> into<00:03:44.070> this<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.549> it's<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.239> very

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
thought went into this and it's a very

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.360 
thought went into this and it's a very
interesting<00:03:45.450> design<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:46.350> I<00:03:46.920> think<00:03:47.160> it<00:03:47.250> gives

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
interesting design and I think it gives

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.520 
interesting design and I think it gives
you<00:03:47.579> some<00:03:48.030> great<00:03:48.150> versatility<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.019> then

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
you some great versatility and then

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.110 
you some great versatility and then
another<00:03:50.040> thing<00:03:50.250> about<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.670> is<00:03:50.880> that<00:03:50.910> that

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
another thing about that is that that

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.440 
another thing about that is that that
gives<00:03:51.510> you<00:03:52.220> just<00:03:53.220> like<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.549> Sayla<00:03:53.940> it<00:03:54.150> allows

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
gives you just like the Sayla it allows

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.390 
gives you just like the Sayla it allows
you<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:55.079> completely<00:03:55.620> remove<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.819> snares<00:03:57.150> and

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
you to completely remove the snares and

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.150 
you to completely remove the snares and
get<00:03:59.400> just<00:03:59.609> a<00:03:59.700> pure<00:04:00.090> peruvian<00:04:00.959> style<00:04:01.079> like<00:04:01.410> pure

that drum is resonating you're probably
going<00:04:39.690> to<00:04:39.750> hear<00:04:39.930> some<00:04:40.110> of<00:04:40.140> that<00:04:40.230> bleed<00:04:40.530> through

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830

from<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.400> other<00:04:41.430> snare<00:04:41.970> whereas<00:04:42.540> if<00:04:42.660> you<00:04:42.720> pull

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
from the other snare whereas if you pull

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.820 
from the other snare whereas if you pull
the<00:04:42.990> snare<00:04:43.170> out<00:04:43.260> completely

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
the snare out completely

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.160 
the snare out completely
it's<00:04:44.130> 100%<00:04:44.520> gone<00:04:44.820> and<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.780> instrument<00:04:46.140> really

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
it's 100% gone and the instrument really

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.370 
it's 100% gone and the instrument really
transforms<00:04:47.180> so<00:04:48.180> it's<00:04:48.720> actually<00:04:48.900> nice<00:04:49.170> to<00:04:49.200> be

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
transforms so it's actually nice to be

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.330 
transforms so it's actually nice to be
able<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.560> pull<00:04:50.100> that<00:04:50.220> out<00:04:50.280> gives<00:04:51.000> you<00:04:52.340> gives

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
able to pull that out gives you gives

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.670 
able to pull that out gives you gives
you<00:04:53.460> a<00:04:53.490> whole<00:04:53.610> new<00:04:53.760> sound<00:04:53.940> so<00:04:54.750> that's<00:04:55.470> the

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
you a whole new sound so that's the

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:04.959 
you a whole new sound so that's the
scenario<00:04:55.830> Mon<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.430> Schlag<00:04:56.670> work

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:04.969
