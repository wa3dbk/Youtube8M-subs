00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
for the halo PSP game that's going to be

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.189 
for the halo PSP game that's going to be
coming<00:00:13.080> out<00:00:13.380> soon<00:00:13.410> called<00:00:14.299> halo<00:00:15.299> solitude<00:00:16.020> and

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
coming out soon called halo solitude and

coming out soon called halo solitude and
this<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.279> an<00:00:17.369> ongoing<00:00:17.520> project<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.600> can

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
this is an ongoing project that you can

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.109 
this is an ongoing project that you can
check<00:00:19.109> out<00:00:19.260> all<00:00:19.400> the<00:00:20.400> information<00:00:20.970> on<00:00:21.060> that

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
check out all the information on that

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.140 
check out all the information on that
you'd<00:00:21.420> like<00:00:21.449> at<00:00:21.930> halo<00:00:22.560> portable<00:00:23.330> TK<00:00:24.560> and<00:00:26.150> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
you'd like at halo portable TK and the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.109 
you'd like at halo portable TK and the
name<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.660> map<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:27.900> raw<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:29.250> name<00:00:29.760> is

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
name of this map is raw the name is

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.020 
name of this map is raw the name is
actually<00:00:30.660> from<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.460> letters<00:00:32.759> are<00:00:32.969> a

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
actually from the the letters are a

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.440 
actually from the the letters are a
which<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.860> symbol<00:00:35.460> for<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.700> astronomical

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
which is the symbol for the astronomical

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.709 
which is the symbol for the astronomical
term<00:00:36.719> right<00:00:37.140> ascension<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.450> this<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.690> a

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
term right ascension and this is a

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.840 
term right ascension and this is a
remake<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.860> halo<00:00:41.040> 2<00:00:41.399> map<00:00:41.579> called

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
remake of the halo 2 map called

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.790 
remake of the halo 2 map called
ascension<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.870> that's<00:00:43.079> where<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.379> name<00:00:43.530> comes

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
ascension so that's where the name comes

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.979 
ascension so that's where the name comes
from<00:00:44.149> the<00:00:45.149> first<00:00:45.450> thing<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.780> you'll<00:00:45.930> notice

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
from the first thing that you'll notice

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.590 
from the first thing that you'll notice
in<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.370> has<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.820> common<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.450> map

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
in that it has in common with the map

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.450 
in that it has in common with the map
ascension<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.469> bowl<00:00:49.710> shape<00:00:50.010> here<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
ascension is this bowl shape here in the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.020 
ascension is this bowl shape here in the
middle<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:52.280> what<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.879> is

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
middle and what this is is this is

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.849 
middle and what this is is this is
actually<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.780> satellite<00:00:56.480> a<00:00:57.480> few<00:00:58.379> miles<00:00:58.559> outside

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
actually a satellite a few miles outside

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.450 
actually a satellite a few miles outside
of<00:00:59.100> the<00:01:00.260> new<00:01:01.260> Mombasa<00:01:01.680> based<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.309> earth<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
of the new Mombasa based on earth and

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.940 
of the new Mombasa based on earth and
it's<00:01:05.460> actually<00:01:05.700> positioned<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:07.200> high<00:01:07.920> a

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
it's actually positioned just high a

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.010 
it's actually positioned just high a
pretty<00:01:08.670> good<00:01:08.850> distance<00:01:08.939> off<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.360> ground<00:01:09.720> just

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
pretty good distance off the ground just

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.899 
pretty good distance off the ground just
conveniently<00:01:11.010> just<00:01:11.280> high<00:01:11.430> enough<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.700> if

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
conveniently just high enough that if

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.710 
conveniently just high enough that if
you<00:01:12.000> fell<00:01:12.180> off<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.479> side<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.869> would<00:01:12.990> die<00:01:13.260> but

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
you fell off the side you would die but

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.359 
you fell off the side you would die but
this<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.020> satellite<00:01:16.380> right<00:01:16.560> here<00:01:16.920> around

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
this is the satellite right here around

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.289 
this is the satellite right here around
the<00:01:17.520> outside<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.979> metal<00:01:19.979> great<00:01:20.310> for<00:01:21.150> people

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
the outside is a metal great for people

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.760 
the outside is a metal great for people
to<00:01:21.479> walk<00:01:21.630> around<00:01:21.810> on<00:01:22.229> if<00:01:22.380> they<00:01:22.470> needed<00:01:22.650> to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
to walk around on if they needed to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.310 
to walk around on if they needed to
access<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.310> satellite<00:01:23.729> there's<00:01:23.939> also<00:01:24.320> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
access the satellite there's also the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.749 
access the satellite there's also the
one<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.770> main<00:01:25.950> differences<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.610> you'll

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
one of the main differences that you'll

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.130 
one of the main differences that you'll
notice<00:01:26.909> right<00:01:27.090> away<00:01:27.210> from<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.960> map

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
notice right away from the the map

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.080 
notice right away from the the map
ascension<00:01:28.799> from<00:01:29.070> halo<00:01:29.340> 2<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.880> there's<00:01:30.030> a

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
ascension from halo 2 is that there's a

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.330 
ascension from halo 2 is that there's a
hole<00:01:30.329> here<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.439> middle<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:31.920> kind<00:01:32.250> of

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
hole here in the middle you can kind of

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.620 
hole here in the middle you can kind of
see<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.650> what<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.799> hole<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.790> it's

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
see it and what this hole is for is it's

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.690 
see it and what this hole is for is it's
a<00:01:38.509> it's<00:01:39.509> it's<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.290> serves<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.920> couple<00:01:41.040> purposes

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
a it's it's it serves a couple purposes

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.899 
a it's it's it serves a couple purposes
for<00:01:42.479> realism<00:01:43.380> sake<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.399> drain<00:01:44.670> for

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
for realism sake it's it's a drain for

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.550 
for realism sake it's it's a drain for
water<00:01:45.149> like<00:01:45.450> if<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.720> rains<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.170> water<00:01:46.200> will

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
water like if it rains the water will

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.469 
water like if it rains the water will
drain<00:01:46.740> through<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.100> hole<00:01:47.310> here<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.759> then

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
drain through this hole here and then

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.830 
drain through this hole here and then
also<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:49.200> an<00:01:49.590> access<00:01:50.159> way<00:01:50.420> into<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.600> motor

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
also it's an access way into the motor

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.980 
also it's an access way into the motor
room<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:53.060> underneath<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.119> satellite

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
room that is underneath the satellite

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.170 
room that is underneath the satellite
which<00:01:55.229> controls<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.549> tilts<00:01:57.000> and

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
which controls that the tilts and

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.179 
which controls that the tilts and
direction<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> satellite<00:01:59.630> the<00:02:00.860> those<00:02:01.860> can

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
direction of the satellite the those can

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.980 
direction of the satellite the those can
also<00:02:02.340> those<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.850> be<00:02:02.880> controlled<00:02:03.390> by<00:02:03.630> there's

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
also those can be controlled by there's

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.499 
also those can be controlled by there's
a<00:02:04.049> control<00:02:04.409> panel<00:02:04.530> up<00:02:04.860> here<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.729> you'll

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
a control panel up here this is you'll

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.139 
a control panel up here this is you'll
remember<00:02:06.780> also<00:02:07.469> from<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:08.250> halo<00:02:08.789> 2<00:02:08.970> map

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.470 
remember also from the halo 2 map
ascension<00:02:09.750> there's<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.020> platform

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
ascension there's a platform

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.710 
ascension there's a platform
and<00:02:11.599> a<00:02:12.250> ramp<00:02:13.250> that<00:02:13.730> leads<00:02:13.790> up<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.209> a<00:02:14.390> small

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
and a ramp that leads up to a small

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.559 
and a ramp that leads up to a small
little<00:02:14.870> sniping<00:02:15.379> point<00:02:15.620> up<00:02:15.830> here<00:02:16.099> and<00:02:16.360> this<00:02:17.360> is

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
little sniping point up here and this is

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.589 
little sniping point up here and this is
a<00:02:17.599> control<00:02:18.080> panel<00:02:18.319> that<00:02:18.709> shields<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:19.400> from

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
a control panel that shields you from

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.350 
a control panel that shields you from
incoming<00:02:20.599> fire<00:02:21.190> but<00:02:22.190> you<00:02:22.459> know<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.730> from<00:02:22.970> for

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
incoming fire but you know it from for

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.149 
incoming fire but you know it from for
realism<00:02:23.690> sake<00:02:24.049> it's<00:02:24.230> it's<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.590> control<00:02:24.980> panel

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
realism sake it's it's a control panel

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.259 
realism sake it's it's a control panel
to<00:02:25.489> operate<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.180> satellite<00:02:27.640> we've<00:02:28.640> also<00:02:28.849> got

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
to operate the satellite we've also got

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.390 
to operate the satellite we've also got
the<00:02:30.140> other<00:02:30.260> sniping<00:02:30.799> point<00:02:31.069> that<00:02:31.250> you'll

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
the other sniping point that you'll

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.440 
the other sniping point that you'll
remember<00:02:31.760> from<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.989> halo<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.410> ascension<00:02:33.920> map

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
remember from the halo to ascension map

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.250 
remember from the halo to ascension map
for<00:02:35.450> realism<00:02:35.810> sake<00:02:36.200> this<00:02:36.379> is<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:37.930> control<00:02:38.930> room

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.750 

that<00:02:42.260> would<00:02:42.620> house<00:02:42.799> like<00:02:43.099> the<00:02:43.220> computers<00:02:43.730> that

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
that would house like the computers that

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.059 
that would house like the computers that
they<00:02:44.030> would<00:02:44.180> use<00:02:44.480> to<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:45.560> see<00:02:45.739> what<00:02:45.950> the

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
they would use to to see what the

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.830 
they would use to to see what the
satellites<00:02:46.459> actually<00:02:46.849> looking<00:02:47.180> at<00:02:47.329> and<00:02:47.629> to

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
satellites actually looking at and to

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.380 
satellites actually looking at and to
give<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:48.620> run<00:02:49.220> programs<00:02:49.640> from<00:02:49.910> it<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.239> that

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
give it run programs from it and that

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.170 
give it run programs from it and that
kind<00:02:50.599> of<00:02:50.629> thing<00:02:50.829> the<00:02:51.829> great<00:02:52.099> leads<00:02:52.489> directly

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
kind of thing the great leads directly

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.890 
kind of thing the great leads directly
out<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:54.489> this<00:02:55.489> control<00:02:56.030> room<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.480> then<00:02:56.629> up

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
out to this control room and then up

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.780 
out to this control room and then up
here<00:02:56.959> there's<00:02:57.709> a<00:02:57.799> stairway<00:02:58.250> that<00:02:58.430> goes<00:02:58.609> up

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
here there's a stairway that goes up

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.150 
here there's a stairway that goes up
this<00:02:59.000> way<00:02:59.269> and<00:02:59.510> then<00:03:00.170> up<00:03:00.349> here<00:03:00.560> on<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.799> second

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
this way and then up here on the second

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.860 
this way and then up here on the second
floor<00:03:01.310> there's<00:03:01.670> a<00:03:01.730> balcony<00:03:01.970> that<00:03:02.269> makes<00:03:02.690> a

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
floor there's a balcony that makes a

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.589 
floor there's a balcony that makes a
really<00:03:03.260> good<00:03:03.349> sniping<00:03:03.920> point<00:03:04.390> there<00:03:05.390> would<00:03:05.569> be

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
really good sniping point there would be

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.110 
really good sniping point there would be
windows<00:03:05.989> here<00:03:06.200> but<00:03:06.319> they'd<00:03:06.470> be<00:03:06.819> for<00:03:07.819> viewing

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
windows here but they'd be for viewing

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.580 
windows here but they'd be for viewing
the<00:03:08.239> satellite<00:03:08.629> but<00:03:08.810> they'd<00:03:08.930> be<00:03:09.079> busted<00:03:09.470> out

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
the satellite but they'd be busted out

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.150 
the satellite but they'd be busted out
so<00:03:09.799> that<00:03:09.950> people<00:03:10.190> can<00:03:10.340> snipe<00:03:11.349> there<00:03:12.349> on<00:03:12.890> the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
so that people can snipe there on the

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.190 
so that people can snipe there on the
lower<00:03:13.370> level<00:03:13.700> there's<00:03:14.000> actually<00:03:14.390> another

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
lower level there's actually another

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.080 
lower level there's actually another
staircase<00:03:15.590> that<00:03:16.040> takes<00:03:16.250> you<00:03:16.370> down<00:03:16.579> one<00:03:16.880> level

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
staircase that takes you down one level

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.900 
staircase that takes you down one level
and<00:03:17.829> takes<00:03:18.829> you<00:03:18.950> to<00:03:19.040> this<00:03:19.190> great<00:03:19.430> right<00:03:19.639> here

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
and takes you to this great right here

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.809 
and takes you to this great right here
which<00:03:20.090> goes<00:03:20.329> under<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.840> satellite<00:03:21.819> it

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
which goes under the satellite it

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.370 
which goes under the satellite it
doesn't<00:03:23.269> go<00:03:23.389> this<00:03:23.630> way<00:03:23.840> it<00:03:23.989> just<00:03:24.200> goes

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
doesn't go this way it just goes

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.800 
doesn't go this way it just goes
straight<00:03:24.530> across<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:25.130> bottom<00:03:25.160> here<00:03:25.760> which<00:03:26.660> is

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
straight across the bottom here which is

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.080 
straight across the bottom here which is
another<00:03:27.049> way<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.290> get<00:03:27.500> up<00:03:27.650> this<00:03:28.069> ramp<00:03:28.340> here<00:03:28.880> up

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
another way to get up this ramp here up

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.879 
another way to get up this ramp here up
to<00:03:29.299> the<00:03:29.419> level<00:03:29.599> where<00:03:29.959> you<00:03:30.019> can<00:03:30.349> go<00:03:30.500> up<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.799> the

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
to the level where you can go up to the

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.640 
to the level where you can go up to the
control<00:03:31.250> panel<00:03:31.280> here<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:32.989> then<00:03:33.230> this<00:03:33.260> great

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
control panel here and then this great

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.280 
control panel here and then this great
back<00:03:34.310> here<00:03:34.760> is<00:03:34.910> also<00:03:35.090> on<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.690> bottom<00:03:35.989> level

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
back here is also on the bottom level

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.589 
back here is also on the bottom level
here<00:03:36.769> and<00:03:36.889> it<00:03:37.669> goes<00:03:37.880> underneath<00:03:38.450> the

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
here and it goes underneath the

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.449 
here and it goes underneath the
satellite<00:03:39.230> this<00:03:39.410> one<00:03:39.560> actually<00:03:39.680> does<00:03:40.130> come

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
satellite this one actually does come

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.699 
satellite this one actually does come
out<00:03:40.609> here<00:03:41.030> and<00:03:41.180> gives<00:03:41.930> you<00:03:42.019> access<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:42.470> the

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
out here and gives you access to the

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.729 
out here and gives you access to the
motor<00:03:42.919> room<00:03:43.630> then<00:03:44.630> from<00:03:44.930> there<00:03:45.169> you<00:03:45.200> can<00:03:45.440> also

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
motor room then from there you can also

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.550 
motor room then from there you can also
you<00:03:46.370> could<00:03:46.519> exit<00:03:47.120> up<00:03:47.329> here<00:03:47.630> through<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:48.349> top

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
you could exit up here through the top

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.530 
you could exit up here through the top
or<00:03:48.829> you<00:03:48.859> could<00:03:49.069> also<00:03:49.220> there's<00:03:49.849> another<00:03:49.910> exit

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
or you could also there's another exit

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.140 
or you could also there's another exit
from<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.870> motor<00:03:51.049> room<00:03:51.349> back<00:03:52.040> down<00:03:52.579> here<00:03:53.000> you

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
from the motor room back down here you

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.720 
from the motor room back down here you
can<00:03:53.299> see<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:53.599> great<00:03:53.810> down<00:03:54.049> here<00:03:54.079> and<00:03:54.730> this

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
can see the great down here and this

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.199 
can see the great down here and this
great<00:03:56.030> goes<00:03:56.269> into<00:03:56.480> this<00:03:56.599> building<00:03:56.989> over<00:03:57.290> here

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
great goes into this building over here

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.330 
great goes into this building over here
and<00:03:59.260> you<00:04:00.260> can<00:04:00.440> you<00:04:00.680> what<00:04:00.859> you<00:04:00.980> would<00:04:01.099> do<00:04:01.190> is<00:04:01.250> you

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
and you can you what you would do is you

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.099 
and you can you what you would do is you
would<00:04:01.400> walk<00:04:01.639> into<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.030> building<00:04:02.150> and<00:04:02.660> then<00:04:02.870> up

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
would walk into the building and then up

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.250 
would walk into the building and then up
a<00:04:03.349> set<00:04:03.650> of<00:04:03.680> stairs<00:04:04.629> and<00:04:05.629> then<00:04:05.930> out<00:04:06.049> the<00:04:06.230> door

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
a set of stairs and then out the door

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.619 
a set of stairs and then out the door
here<00:04:06.889> this<00:04:07.099> is<00:04:07.280> like<00:04:07.489> your<00:04:07.519> fire<00:04:07.940> escape<00:04:08.150> for

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
here this is like your fire escape for

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.900 
here this is like your fire escape for
the<00:04:08.660> roof<00:04:08.900> here<00:04:09.260> or<00:04:09.349> whatever<00:04:09.650> and<00:04:10.579> then<00:04:10.760> this

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
the roof here or whatever and then this

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.229 
the roof here or whatever and then this
is<00:04:11.060> a<00:04:11.090> helipad<00:04:11.569> in<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:12.680> halo<00:04:13.519> to<00:04:13.730> ascension

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
is a helipad in the halo to ascension

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.349 
is a helipad in the halo to ascension
map<00:04:14.419> there<00:04:14.720> was<00:04:14.930> a<00:04:15.639> platform<00:04:16.639> that<00:04:16.699> had<00:04:17.060> a

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
map there was a platform that had a

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.360 
map there was a platform that had a
banshee<00:04:18.139> if<00:04:18.530> we<00:04:18.680> decide<00:04:18.889> to<00:04:18.949> include<00:04:19.220> a

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
banshee if we decide to include a

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.740 
banshee if we decide to include a
banshee<00:04:19.549> on<00:04:19.729> the<00:04:19.820> level<00:04:20.120> that<00:04:20.239> will<00:04:20.390> most

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
banshee on the level that will most

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.290 
banshee on the level that will most
likely<00:04:20.989> sit<00:04:21.289> on<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.469> helipad<00:04:21.769> here

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
likely sit on the helipad here

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.200 
likely sit on the helipad here
and<00:04:23.509> then<00:04:23.659> this<00:04:24.310> leads<00:04:25.310> directly<00:04:25.490> out<00:04:26.180> onto

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
and then this leads directly out onto

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.610 
and then this leads directly out onto
the<00:04:26.599> great<00:04:26.840> here<00:04:27.319> so<00:04:27.470> you've<00:04:28.129> got<00:04:29.590> you've<00:04:30.590> got

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
the great here so you've got you've got

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.640 
the great here so you've got you've got
three<00:04:31.449> areas<00:04:32.449> that<00:04:32.690> you<00:04:32.840> can<00:04:33.020> access<00:04:33.440> the

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
three areas that you can access the

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.899 
three areas that you can access the
motor<00:04:33.860> room<00:04:34.099> from<00:04:34.310> you've<00:04:34.520> got<00:04:34.639> the<00:04:34.759> hole

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:34.909 
motor room from you've got the hole

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:37.600 
motor room from you've got the hole
right<00:04:35.120> here<00:04:35.889> that<00:04:36.889> you<00:04:37.009> can<00:04:37.069> come<00:04:37.280> down<00:04:37.310> in

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
right here that you can come down in

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.360 
right here that you can come down in
here<00:04:37.970> from<00:04:38.300> which<00:04:39.259> actually<00:04:39.470> makes<00:04:39.919> this<00:04:40.129> bull

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
here from which actually makes this bull

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.909 
here from which actually makes this bull
useful<00:04:40.970> because<00:04:41.150> in<00:04:41.360> the<00:04:41.750> normal<00:04:42.409> ascension

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
useful because in the normal ascension

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.430 
useful because in the normal ascension
map<00:04:43.069> it<00:04:43.250> was<00:04:43.370> just<00:04:43.580> kind<00:04:43.789> of<00:04:43.849> a<00:04:43.970> way<00:04:44.960> from<00:04:45.199> point

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
map it was just kind of a way from point

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.809 
map it was just kind of a way from point
A<00:04:45.530> to<00:04:45.560> point<00:04:45.680> B<00:04:45.889> and<00:04:46.099> no<00:04:46.220> one<00:04:46.340> wanted<00:04:46.550> to<00:04:46.639> be<00:04:46.729> in

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 
A to point B and no one wanted to be in

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.010 
A to point B and no one wanted to be in
the<00:04:46.849> bowl<00:04:47.090> because<00:04:47.240> if<00:04:47.419> you<00:04:47.539> were<00:04:47.659> in<00:04:47.780> the<00:04:47.870> bowl

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
the bowl because if you were in the bowl

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.960 
the bowl because if you were in the bowl
you<00:04:48.050> were<00:04:48.289> sitting<00:04:48.530> duck<00:04:48.860> but<00:04:49.550> in<00:04:49.639> this<00:04:49.759> case

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
you were sitting duck but in this case

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.249 
you were sitting duck but in this case
you'll<00:04:50.180> actually<00:04:50.330> want<00:04:50.509> to<00:04:50.720> go<00:04:50.900> through<00:04:51.139> the

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:51.259 
you'll actually want to go through the

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:52.689 
you'll actually want to go through the
bowl<00:04:51.440> so<00:04:51.620> you<00:04:51.710> can<00:04:51.860> go<00:04:51.979> down<00:04:52.129> into<00:04:52.310> the<00:04:52.520> motor

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
bowl so you can go down into the motor

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.969 
bowl so you can go down into the motor
room<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.509> motor<00:04:53.720> room<00:04:53.930> has<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.139> portal<00:04:54.620> inside

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
room the motor room has a portal inside

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:56.770 
room the motor room has a portal inside
of<00:04:55.129> it<00:04:55.250> that<00:04:55.370> teleports<00:04:55.909> you<00:04:56.000> over<00:04:56.330> here

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
of it that teleports you over here

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.869 
of it that teleports you over here
you'll<00:04:57.740> remember<00:04:58.099> from<00:04:58.310> the<00:04:58.460> halo<00:04:58.699> to

00:04:58.869 --> 00:04:58.879 
you'll remember from the halo to

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:01.180 
you'll remember from the halo to
ascension<00:04:59.360> map<00:04:59.719> there<00:05:00.020> was<00:05:00.199> a<00:05:00.229> random

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
ascension map there was a random

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.649 
ascension map there was a random
platform<00:05:01.699> out<00:05:01.849> there<00:05:01.879> that<00:05:02.180> had<00:05:02.300> a<00:05:02.330> rocket

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:02.659 
platform out there that had a rocket

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:04.480 
platform out there that had a rocket
launcher<00:05:02.990> on<00:05:03.020> at<00:05:03.289> a<00:05:03.379> launching<00:05:03.830> pad<00:05:04.069> well<00:05:04.310> this

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
launcher on at a launching pad well this

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.459 
launcher on at a launching pad well this
is<00:05:04.639> the<00:05:04.669> exit<00:05:05.150> for<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.330> portal<00:05:05.750> the<00:05:06.169> rocket

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:06.469 
is the exit for the portal the rocket

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:08.050 
is the exit for the portal the rocket
launcher<00:05:06.500> will<00:05:06.889> be<00:05:07.009> over<00:05:07.280> in<00:05:07.370> this<00:05:07.490> area<00:05:07.729> and

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
launcher will be over in this area and

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.059 
launcher will be over in this area and
then<00:05:08.659> the<00:05:08.750> launching<00:05:09.169> pad<00:05:09.319> will<00:05:09.560> launch<00:05:09.800> you

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:10.069 
then the launching pad will launch you

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:12.129 
then the launching pad will launch you
back<00:05:10.520> out<00:05:10.759> on<00:05:11.000> here<00:05:11.419> I<00:05:11.539> really<00:05:11.930> like<00:05:12.080> that

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
back out on here I really like that

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.680 
back out on here I really like that
feature<00:05:12.349> from<00:05:12.979> the<00:05:13.219> halo<00:05:13.879> to<00:05:14.030> ascension<00:05:14.509> map

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
feature from the halo to ascension map

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.080 
feature from the halo to ascension map
because<00:05:14.930> it<00:05:15.110> it<00:05:15.409> really<00:05:15.949> added<00:05:16.250> some<00:05:16.580> chaos<00:05:16.789> to

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
because it it really added some chaos to

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.450 
because it it really added some chaos to
the<00:05:17.120> formula<00:05:17.629> whenever<00:05:17.870> someone<00:05:18.229> came

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
the formula whenever someone came

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.100 
the formula whenever someone came
barreling<00:05:19.460> into<00:05:19.819> the<00:05:20.060> bowl<00:05:20.240> with<00:05:20.509> firing

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
barreling into the bowl with firing

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.740 
barreling into the bowl with firing
rockets<00:05:21.650> in<00:05:22.009> every<00:05:22.280> direction<00:05:24.400> but<00:05:25.400> so<00:05:26.090> so<00:05:26.479> the

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
rockets in every direction but so so the

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.269 
rockets in every direction but so so the
the<00:05:27.139> motor<00:05:27.319> room<00:05:27.500> has<00:05:27.680> its<00:05:27.710> three<00:05:28.039> entrances

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:28.279 
the motor room has its three entrances

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:30.279 
the motor room has its three entrances
so<00:05:28.669> that's<00:05:28.849> pretty<00:05:29.090> fair<00:05:29.300> pretty<00:05:30.020> fairly

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
so that's pretty fair pretty fairly

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.760 
so that's pretty fair pretty fairly
balanced<00:05:30.949> and<00:05:31.940> if<00:05:32.330> you're<00:05:32.539> being<00:05:32.719> sniped<00:05:33.110> from

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
balanced and if you're being sniped from

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.269 
balanced and if you're being sniped from
the<00:05:34.069> control<00:05:34.969> panel<00:05:35.000> our<00:05:35.630> control<00:05:36.199> tower<00:05:36.889> over

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:37.279 
the control panel our control tower over

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:39.760 
the control panel our control tower over
here<00:05:37.699> then<00:05:38.330> you<00:05:38.539> can<00:05:38.569> you<00:05:39.020> can<00:05:39.199> duck<00:05:39.380> into<00:05:39.590> the

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
here then you can you can duck into the

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.450 
here then you can you can duck into the

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
motor room here and exit this way maybe

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.980 
motor room here and exit this way maybe
get<00:05:43.729> yourself<00:05:44.120> your<00:05:44.240> own<00:05:44.300> little<00:05:44.539> sniping

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
get yourself your own little sniping

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.730 
get yourself your own little sniping
point<00:05:45.199> from<00:05:45.349> up<00:05:45.560> here<00:05:45.919> or<00:05:46.130> you<00:05:46.610> can<00:05:46.789> try

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
is another feature you might recognize

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.899 
is another feature you might recognize
from<00:05:53.300> the<00:05:54.139> original<00:05:54.770> halo<00:05:55.069> to<00:05:55.250> ascension<00:05:55.729> map

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:55.909 
from the original halo to ascension map

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:59.339 
from the original halo to ascension map
there<00:05:56.150> was<00:05:56.270> a<00:05:56.300> long<00:05:56.830> platform<00:05:57.830> that<00:05:58.069> had<00:05:58.310> a

00:05:59.339 --> 00:05:59.349 
there was a long platform that had a

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:02.260 
there was a long platform that had a
energy<00:06:00.349> shield<00:06:00.919> and<00:06:01.159> that<00:06:01.699> energy<00:06:02.060> shield

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
energy shield and that energy shield

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.499 
energy shield and that energy shield
would<00:06:02.449> be<00:06:02.569> about<00:06:02.779> somewhere<00:06:03.169> in<00:06:03.349> here<00:06:04.360> to<00:06:05.360> give

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:05.509 
would be about somewhere in here to give

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:07.629 
would be about somewhere in here to give
you<00:06:05.599> kind<00:06:05.779> of<00:06:05.870> an<00:06:06.020> incentive<00:06:06.680> to<00:06:06.710> use<00:06:07.430> this

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 
you kind of an incentive to use this

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:09.369 
you kind of an incentive to use this
platform<00:06:07.940> if<00:06:08.419> you<00:06:08.930> didn't<00:06:09.169> have<00:06:09.259> enough

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:09.379 
platform if you didn't have enough

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:11.019 
platform if you didn't have enough
already<00:06:09.650> to<00:06:09.889> get<00:06:10.099> from<00:06:10.250> sniping<00:06:10.639> point<00:06:10.909> A<00:06:11.000> to

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:11.029 
already to get from sniping point A to

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:14.019 
already to get from sniping point A to
point<00:06:11.180> B<00:06:12.099> because<00:06:13.099> this<00:06:13.279> one<00:06:13.460> like<00:06:13.639> I<00:06:13.759> said<00:06:13.940> it

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:14.029 
point B because this one like I said it

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:15.670 
point B because this one like I said it
doesn't<00:06:14.060> actually<00:06:14.360> go<00:06:14.840> to<00:06:14.900> the<00:06:15.110> motor<00:06:15.319> room<00:06:15.560> it

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
doesn't actually go to the motor room it

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.290 
doesn't actually go to the motor room it
just<00:06:16.099> takes<00:06:16.250> you<00:06:16.370> from<00:06:16.490> here<00:06:16.759> to<00:06:16.849> here<00:06:17.060> I<00:06:17.120> think

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
just takes you from here to here I think

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.089 
just takes you from here to here I think
that'd<00:06:17.629> be<00:06:18.169> a<00:06:18.199> little<00:06:18.409> bit<00:06:18.560> too<00:06:18.710> much<00:06:18.860> access

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099 
that'd be a little bit too much access

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:22.209 
that'd be a little bit too much access
to<00:06:19.460> the<00:06:19.580> motor<00:06:19.759> room<00:06:20.090> and<00:06:20.710> maybe<00:06:21.710> to<00:06:21.949> the<00:06:22.039> other

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:22.219 
to the motor room and maybe to the other

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:24.020 
to the motor room and maybe to the other
sniping<00:06:22.669> points<00:06:22.940> from<00:06:23.090> the<00:06:23.240> motor<00:06:23.419> room

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
sniping points from the motor room

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.610 
sniping points from the motor room
I<00:06:24.840> I<00:06:25.770> don't<00:06:26.370> have<00:06:26.580> a<00:06:26.990> perfect<00:06:27.990> idea<00:06:28.110> of<00:06:28.440> where

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
I I don't have a perfect idea of where

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.930 
I I don't have a perfect idea of where
all<00:06:28.770> the<00:06:28.890> weapons<00:06:29.160> will<00:06:29.280> be<00:06:29.370> located<00:06:29.550> on<00:06:29.850> the

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
all the weapons will be located on the

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.480 
all the weapons will be located on the
map<00:06:30.060> of<00:06:30.300> it<00:06:30.420> than<00:06:30.570> the<00:06:30.920> mean<00:06:31.920> the<00:06:32.070> rocket

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
map of it than the mean the rocket

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.530 
map of it than the mean the rocket
launcher<00:06:32.520> would<00:06:32.910> of<00:06:33.030> course<00:06:33.180> be<00:06:33.240> down<00:06:33.510> here

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:33.540 
launcher would of course be down here

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.440 
launcher would of course be down here
and<00:06:34.020> maybe<00:06:34.830> the<00:06:35.040> Banshee<00:06:35.400> would<00:06:35.550> be<00:06:35.670> up<00:06:35.820> here<00:06:36.240> I

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450 
and maybe the Banshee would be up here I

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.330 
and maybe the Banshee would be up here I
assume<00:06:37.050> there'd<00:06:37.290> be<00:06:37.410> a<00:06:37.440> sniper<00:06:37.740> rifle<00:06:37.890> around

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
assume there'd be a sniper rifle around

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.790 
assume there'd be a sniper rifle around
here<00:06:38.970> or<00:06:39.210> or<00:06:39.690> maybe<00:06:39.930> it<00:06:40.170> would<00:06:40.290> be<00:06:40.320> somewhere

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
here or or maybe it would be somewhere

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.350 
here or or maybe it would be somewhere
else<00:06:40.830> in<00:06:41.100> the<00:06:41.130> map<00:06:41.310> maybe<00:06:41.640> in<00:06:41.850> the<00:06:41.940> motor<00:06:42.120> room

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
else in the map maybe in the motor room

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.880 
else in the map maybe in the motor room
and<00:06:42.510> you'd<00:06:42.600> have<00:06:42.780> to<00:06:42.990> or<00:06:43.260> in<00:06:43.380> this<00:06:43.530> building

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:43.890 
and you'd have to or in this building

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.380 
and you'd have to or in this building
and<00:06:43.980> you'd<00:06:44.100> have<00:06:44.220> to<00:06:44.370> actually<00:06:44.460> take<00:06:44.910> it<00:06:45.120> to

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390 
and you'd have to actually take it to

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.230 
and you'd have to actually take it to
the<00:06:45.510> control<00:06:45.870> room<00:06:45.950> but<00:06:46.950> that's<00:06:47.670> all<00:06:47.910> yet<00:06:48.120> to

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
the control room but that's all yet to

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.710 
the control room but that's all yet to
be<00:06:48.360> decided<00:06:49.520> basically<00:06:50.520> I've<00:06:51.030> i<00:06:51.270> just<00:06:51.540> created

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
be decided basically I've i just created

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.990 
be decided basically I've i just created
this<00:06:52.110> concept<00:06:52.350> to<00:06:53.070> see<00:06:53.720> if<00:06:55.460> everyone<00:06:56.460> likes<00:06:56.730> it

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 
this concept to see if everyone likes it

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.550 
this concept to see if everyone likes it
because<00:06:57.210> i<00:06:57.480> didn't<00:06:57.810> want<00:06:57.840> to<00:06:57.990> waste<00:06:58.140> my<00:06:58.290> time

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 
because i didn't want to waste my time

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.350 
because i didn't want to waste my time
on<00:06:58.620> a<00:06:58.890> three-dimensional<00:06:59.790> rendering<00:07:00.240> if

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
on a three-dimensional rendering if

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.990 
on a three-dimensional rendering if
nobody<00:07:00.690> even<00:07:00.900> like<00:07:01.080> the<00:07:01.260> idea<00:07:01.620> so<00:07:02.340> if<00:07:02.730> if

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 
nobody even like the idea so if if

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.490 
nobody even like the idea so if if
people<00:07:03.450> like<00:07:03.600> it<00:07:03.660> then<00:07:03.930> i'll<00:07:04.050> create<00:07:04.380> a

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500 
people like it then i'll create a

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.280 
people like it then i'll create a
three-dimensional<00:07:04.830> mock-up<00:07:05.610> and<00:07:06.290> eventually

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:07.290 
three-dimensional mock-up and eventually

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.370 
three-dimensional mock-up and eventually
will<00:07:07.530> get<00:07:08.370> it<00:07:08.430> mapped<00:07:08.820> and<00:07:09.090> textured<00:07:10.020> and<00:07:10.170> you

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.380 
will get it mapped and textured and you

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.470 
will get it mapped and textured and you
might<00:07:10.530> even<00:07:10.560> see<00:07:10.830> it<00:07:10.890> in<00:07:10.980> the<00:07:11.040> final<00:07:11.220> game<00:07:11.480> if

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:12.480 
might even see it in the final game if

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.570 
might even see it in the final game if
you<00:07:12.780> like<00:07:13.470> what<00:07:13.620> you<00:07:13.800> see<00:07:13.980> here<00:07:14.250> and<00:07:14.310> you're

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:14.580 
you like what you see here and you're
