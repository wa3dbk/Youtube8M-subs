00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:26.279
 Hello to you honter clan red a 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.400
 price today I will show you a video of this 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.970
 great tank like kvass well or like 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.390
 correct this is apt-1s it's just imba on 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.520
 my level on my sixth level I 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.970
 I think many people know how he bends how 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.610
 He gets from the turntables to the soup and now I 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.090
 I'll show you what's true of me. 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.860
 by the way 86 percent crew is not one 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.490
 perco 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.900
 recharge 15 seconds to 14 half and 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.930
 now you will see how he is 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:01.890
 crews without full attention gets with 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.470
 the guard the tank cool for their level 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.180
 has just 175 breakdown 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.799
 And as much as 390 alpha that is, average damage 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:18.590
 more accurately see how I get now 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:25.200
 wars from 12 tons well reduced to almost reduced 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:27.930
 ready to tank just with the guard hits and this 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.240
 at a distance to a rather big distance 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.820
 look where I am almost full then the floor 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:38.490
 cards just on the go take preemption 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.670
 this tank just might well and get it 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:46.470
 for him is bullshit and everything is why because 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.680
 grandfathers fought well, so that's okay there to 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.960
 really cool for their level can 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.510
 give out a bunch of damage in this you of course 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.630
 this heap of damage will not be since I got 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.580
 into battle with the eighth levels and therefore 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.040
 it's enough just to shoot 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.730
 average damage will be 8 each 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:09.660
 levels and will 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:12.540
 A good amount of experience is my 10 fight 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.130
 on kvass you will not believe yes I'm in the hangar to us 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.940
 the video said that I just never 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:21.000
 there was no kvass this is my 10 fight I never 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.750
 I didn't play kvass before that 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.140
 rolling out 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.690
 I wanted to sprint with 3 but then it appears 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:32.250
 just enemy kvass breaking the fence 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:35.820
 I'm breaking just look at 412 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:39.690
 shot given 412 damage afterwards 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.520
 machine level six who is still on the sixth 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.180
 level so produces onions in two stages 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.350
 dreaming 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.890
 well, and the third course with a break 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.690
 175 punching is very hard even with 217 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.140
 it seems cold breakdown will also be 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.720
 not easy to punch IS-3 block but but if 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.150
 pick him up in the stern then all of 3 is just 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.750
 go to the hangar on the vanguard sense 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.030
 simply 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.250
 throw it can damage will be fine 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.280
 After all, we will have the same recharge 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.160
 well, and iza third can learn faster 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.220
 Here you saw I charge the gold and in the rink 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.250
 somewhere or do not know well, in the rough board 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.680
 saying let's say it was unclear at 403 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.060
 again the sixth level of the tank 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.930
 level eight how do you see it 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.439
 super pershing 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.439
 I didnâ€™t fully boil down so half 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:35.319
 brought so that the scope slightly started 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:38.170
 focus and shot out 346 of course 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:41.280
 houses failed but note I came down and 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.900
 could go anywhere in the tower in the screen 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.469
 here I intentionally shot the tower 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.739
 kvass 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:51.540
 because the towers are cardboard and 400 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:54.400
 damage we take kvass two fraga already 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.680
 two frags were shot and a half thousand 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:01.810
 pure snout damage 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.760
 see the lion pushed me ally i-3 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.150
 so I knew it would be it not 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:11.079
 the last still push in this fight 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:14.799
 but nonetheless at 336 Lion and I threw 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:19.359
 Now we leave again and so we get 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:21.160
 lion 290 its efficiency just what kind of tank else 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.050
 at the sixth level can it really 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.360
 issue and you notice i checked out and with 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.789
 the guard of the oncoming I understand the distance 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.909
 quite small but some 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:32.979
 American tank or German tank with 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:34.000
 I would miss good accuracy because 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.199
 floor century 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.190
 but only Soviet tanks fall see 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:46.599
 in arcade sight not fully reduced 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:49.479
 I hit the panther for 408 in an instant 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:51.849
 before being pushed by an enemy fuke 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.650
 enemy again allied is-3 well 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:57.970
 how much can you push me in this fight 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:00.190
 this is the second time i just saw him 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:05.620
 flying back iv fired as fast as possible 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:10.419
 and yet I hit no tank 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.830
 gets so except quasar well let's talk about 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:15.880
 sad little bit up 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:19.479
 tank ponerfyat as wrote who there Vader 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:23.110
 Yes, like in the same wrote that he 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:25.720
 will take these wonderful 122 millimeters 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.669
 for one thing i'm glad since i'm on 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.150
 the class has never played much 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:34.150
 did not have time to love him let's say 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:37.780
 see tiger 2 pushes me lion 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:41.620
 not completely reduced and ready and why 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:46.420
 yes because the heads of the righteous tank and the tiger 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:50.950
 2 fascist that's why so here will take away from 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:58.630
 Kvass is his wonderful tool 122 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:06:01.900
 I see a millimeter I shot 3219 damage 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:05.770
 even got a sniper you understand 10 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:08.140
 ten shots to the target with accuracy 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:11.380
 just to see the best 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:14.890
 046 if I am not mistaken, then we only 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.930
 this will not cook exactly I do not remember not 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.470
 little so not so little 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.750
 scatter 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.870
 also you can pay attention to 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:25.720
 crew left yes now 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:29.410
 86 percent see the difference in my experience 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:32.260
 allies and me just not small well 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:34.140
 home was a thousand more almost so 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:38.080
 that kvass is like a tank yet 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:40.780
 so bends so long as his ponerfili 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.030
 I advise everyone to deflate and then 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.550
 sell real tanks for fun yet 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:49.090
 I go now I want to play on it until 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:52.540
 the nerf is exactly what the fight liked 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:58.380
 like subscribe to the channel with you 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:58.380
 There was a Honter and Rita Price Country
