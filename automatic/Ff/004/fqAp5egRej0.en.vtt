00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.170
 So friends it's time again 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.220
 bundesliga time here at ad hoc est and 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.389
 the game vestel us here now 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:16.080
 Saturday evening 18 30 in 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.300
 the Munich allianz-arena ski arena in 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.470
 munich as I said the game bavaria 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.820
 munich against the hamburger sports club 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.680
 I know it's just a sports club 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:31.650
 sound but I actually have sports 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:33.660
 above all , definitely one 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.239
 traditional duel of these two teams 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.920
 yes I think they have always been 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.440
 a first league so far and the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.320
 Munich, I believe the very first song 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.629
 not and then always 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.610
 a duel with tradition hamburg he 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.980
 At the moment I think that I 'm lying 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.960
 eighth place 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.719
 last were by a something 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.489
 fell out weaker performance again 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.719
 from the europe league ranks in hamburg 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.289
 you're always there relatively fast 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.579
 If you say you want to go to Europe but 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.260
 by this 1 0 defeat against 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.960
 Augsburg is now a bit 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.430
 but you get stuck again 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.680
 still lies promising in the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.140
 run 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.580
 and there is also a lot 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.630
 crowding around this europe league and 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.250
 champions league quali places 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.900
 or the champions league 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.930
 quali square and the europe league courses 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.460
 the two yes bayern of course enthroned 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.110
 from the top of the table with 20 points 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.280
 Leap on dortmund could be due to these 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.990
 later become master of it 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.670
 Also do not forget if dortmund if 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.220
 dortmund loses and bavaria wins 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.119
 master 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.890
 that would of course already be one 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.759
 bang on the seventh day of the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.759
 retract championship 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.200
 if you wait and see if 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.850
 because then it comes so I think now he 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.399
 not maybe and it stands on 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.790
 his next matchday will be so far or 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.220
 Maybe not so you want them 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.430
 yes never how many games of the day 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.869
 distance at 860 until the thirtieth 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.469
 of course later on, of course, a pity 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:07.270
 each case the 20 points lead 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:12.179
 stay 68 21 7 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.179
 27 it's just 25 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:23.319
 Now there are 20 left of our nose 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.910
 still seven games fits you have that yes 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.370
 but are still six games then pay attention 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.650
 she 29 30 and nena that now 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.480
 seven not play then yes but 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.799
 next time you're the one 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.459
 distance so they stay at the next 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.069
 Gameday 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.989
 If you then win the examples 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.760
 do not win and champion and example 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:44.620
 from the general two more of the 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.239
 play last seven or what I'm going 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.819
 Actually, that's what I assume 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:53.620
 I do not assume that but stop the 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.209
 already master is because one yes 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.220
 alone then have to assume 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.769
 that dortmund still gets so many points 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.599
 I do not really like that either 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.730
 that's what you think is realistic 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:08.349
 see 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:13.739
 Definitely masters in any case 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.739
 you will also see that monument that way 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.019
 Of course, the studio is happy with Hamburg 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.000
 you were already that one or 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:29.769
 others have times this season 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.489
 roadmaps and songs the first and the 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.950
 lette and the korean 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.690
 and yes where at fc bavaria what do you want there 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.650
 still say in the personal rum of course 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.389
 always such a theme as there are 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.970
 again there is no storm and so on 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:48.160
 on and on 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.329
 and probably bavaria will too 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.099
 reappear with the first eleven 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.750
 I think I can be in Hamburg 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.359
 They are not that many people 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.470
 Too , because then he really the 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:01.540
 chances are that you will get the title then 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.040
 a title and front-thirds so meaningful 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.380
 most likely to be back in there 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.750
 mario mandzukic com is going to be seen 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.000
 but again from the bank is yes 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.120
 injured badstuber of course 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.260
 long-term injured on pages no it 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.069
 should not we between in between 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.350
 would vouch a bit api 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.729
 vehicles whenever he no he calls 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.169
 then this is missing or a goal 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.259
 Just because he is the second of the 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.259
 case 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.250
 yes ok can be infinitely in the 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.830
 Length pull but what is your tip 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:36.330
 for the game against hamburg almost can 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.960
 but somehow I would be everything 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.450
 irresponsible not too bavarian too 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.710
 I kind of hope so many times 22 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.140
 or so I think I now 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.420
 already said against leverkusen I have 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.270
 In any case, I said a draw 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.020
 but stay 22 times I think the bavaria 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.700
 will win 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.560
 I think they will be again 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:58.660
 now that I'm not catching now 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.080
 is actually 11 at most 2 2 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.880
 system city we play to zero and me 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.320
 Guess the cool 20 will go out 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.910
 No gossip we have the have 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.400
 yes already 51 times in hamburg used 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.810
 a year ago or half calls that 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.920
 will not exist but they will open 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.550
 win every case I think it 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.300
 so it will come as such already 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.300
 as often as the case was 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.710
 bayern maybe I guess that tor 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.970
 if you do the great thing 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.480
 it's usually already done 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.070
 layer in the bay means then it was 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.290
 so that was the game against wolfsburg 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.940
 davos by itself relatively early the gate 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.860
 caught and then nothing came back 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.990
 the animal yes not the complete 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:42.130
 They do not win the second round 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.450
 but so far everyone seems to win well 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.419
 But against hamburg at home had 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:50.040
 anyway, so how do you win this 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:52.810
 I thought that side but then 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.370
 as I said yes went in the end German 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.430
 will be master should plant 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.750
 so, after all, clean it first of all 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.190
 a hamburger place seven or eight 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.510
 or nine is so that is one 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.890
 natural claim part bavaria then 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:08.160
 if you want to be the musician then 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:08.160
 you have hamburg also pushed yourself 20
