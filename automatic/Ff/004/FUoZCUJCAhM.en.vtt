hi I'm Bill with Molly after-market Inc

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.150 
hi I'm Bill with Molly after-market Inc
I'm<00:00:06.600> here<00:00:06.899> today<00:00:07.200> to<00:00:07.259> talk<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.859> you<00:00:08.010> about

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
I'm here today to talk to you about

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.730 
I'm here today to talk to you about
bearings<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.090> this<00:00:09.900> is<00:00:10.080> actually<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.530> first

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
bearings and this is actually the first

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.440 
bearings and this is actually the first
of<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.070> three<00:00:11.309> part<00:00:11.340> series<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:12.150> we're<00:00:12.300> going

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
of a three part series that we're going

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.629 
of a three part series that we're going
to<00:00:12.540> do<00:00:12.690> on<00:00:12.840> bearings<00:00:13.230> today's<00:00:13.950> subject<00:00:14.280> is

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
to do on bearings today's subject is

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.210 
to do on bearings today's subject is
going<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.059> be<00:00:15.240> bearing<00:00:15.900> failures<00:00:16.379> what<00:00:17.070> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
going to be bearing failures what the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.310 
going to be bearing failures what the
common<00:00:17.580> failures<00:00:18.029> are<00:00:18.270> how<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.630> recognize

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
common failures are how to recognize

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.109 
common failures are how to recognize
failures<00:00:19.890> what<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.340> difference<00:00:20.730> between<00:00:20.820> a

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
failures what the difference between a

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.019 
failures what the difference between a
failure<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.900> distress<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:23.550> on<00:00:23.730> so

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
failure and distress is and so on so

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.060 
failure and distress is and so on so
let's<00:00:24.689> get<00:00:24.900> started<00:00:25.410> next<00:00:25.590> week<00:00:25.740> we're

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
let's get started next week we're

actually going to come back by the way
and<00:00:27.570> talk<00:00:27.779> about<00:00:28.080> oil<00:00:28.470> oil<00:00:29.250> film<00:00:29.490> thickness

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
and talk about oil oil film thickness

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.659 
and talk about oil oil film thickness
proper<00:00:30.750> lubrication<00:00:31.260> all<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.309> stuff<00:00:32.640> that

works together and in the final week
actually<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.850> forgot<00:00:36.059> what<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> final<00:00:36.660> week<00:00:36.930> is

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
actually I forgot what the final week is

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.200 
actually I forgot what the final week is
I<00:00:37.500> want<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.370> find<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.700> week<00:00:38.879> we're<00:00:39.059> going<00:00:39.149> to

remember<00:00:45.539> all<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.989> stuff<00:00:46.050> but<00:00:46.500> let's<00:00:47.280> talk

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
remember all this stuff but let's talk

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.270 
remember all this stuff but let's talk
about<00:00:47.640> bearing<00:00:48.149> failures<00:00:48.539> now<00:00:49.440> first<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.129> all

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
about bearing failures now first of all

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.340 
about bearing failures now first of all
we<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:50.940> two<00:00:51.149> terms<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.660> use<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.170> business

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
we have two terms we use in the business

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.560 
we have two terms we use in the business
one<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.890> bearing<00:00:53.280> failures<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.210> other<00:00:54.360> is

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
one is bearing failures the other is

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.290 
one is bearing failures the other is
bearing<00:00:54.930> distress<00:00:55.440> now<00:00:56.129> failure<00:00:56.730> means<00:00:57.030> your

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
bearing distress now failure means your

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.959 
bearing distress now failure means your
engine<00:00:57.780> blew<00:00:58.020> up<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.590> as<00:00:59.280> far<00:00:59.489> as<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.789> can

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
engine blew up and as far as you can

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.970 
engine blew up and as far as you can
tell<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.359> was<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.780> bearings<00:01:01.230> or<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> mangled

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
tell it was the bearings or the mangled

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.860 
tell it was the bearings or the mangled
remains<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.670> bearings<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.359> cost<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
remains of the bearings that cost the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.080 
remains of the bearings that cost the
problems<00:01:04.350> that's<00:01:04.860> what<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.250> refer<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.670> as<00:01:06.060> a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
problems that's what we refer to as a

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.390 
problems that's what we refer to as a
failure<00:01:06.500> bearing<00:01:07.500> distress<00:01:07.950> which<00:01:08.250> is

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
failure bearing distress which is

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.880 
failure bearing distress which is
actually<00:01:08.760> far<00:01:09.000> more<00:01:09.210> common<00:01:09.750> as<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.930> tear<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
actually far more common as you tear the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.590 
actually far more common as you tear the
engine<00:01:11.250> down<00:01:11.430> at<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> normal<00:01:12.090> service

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
engine down at the normal service

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.300 
engine down at the normal service
interval<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.260> case<00:01:13.470> here<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.830> was<00:01:13.950> three

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
interval in this case here it was three

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.830 
interval in this case here it was three
runs<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:14.970> see<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.270> actually<00:01:15.630> written

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
runs you can see it's actually written

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.899 
runs you can see it's actually written
on<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.080> back<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.350> here<00:01:16.619> by<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.830> customer<00:01:17.369> ran

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
on the back of here by the customer ran

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.999 
on the back of here by the customer ran
it<00:01:18.060> for<00:01:18.210> three<00:01:18.450> runs<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.409> tear<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.799> down<00:01:19.860> and

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
it for three runs you tear it down and

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.350 
it for three runs you tear it down and
you<00:01:20.250> looked<00:01:20.460> at<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.820> say<00:01:21.000> boy<00:01:21.180> that

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
you looked at and you say boy that

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.070 
you looked at and you say boy that
doesn't<00:01:21.689> look<00:01:21.780> good

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
doesn't look good

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.289 
doesn't look good
I<00:01:22.290> better<00:01:23.040> get<00:01:23.189> some<00:01:23.369> help<00:01:23.610> figure<00:01:24.000> out<00:01:24.060> what's

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
I better get some help figure out what's

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.080 
I better get some help figure out what's
going<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.750> here<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.170> failure<00:01:26.090> distress

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
going on here so failure distress

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.719 
going on here so failure distress
important<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.960> recognize<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.680> difference

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
important to recognize the difference

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.969 
important to recognize the difference
let's<00:01:29.729> get<00:01:29.909> rid<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.119> failures<00:01:30.650> first<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.829> all

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
let's get rid of failures first of all

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.399 
let's get rid of failures first of all
the<00:01:32.130> two<00:01:32.430> main<00:01:32.939> reasons<00:01:33.570> for<00:01:33.659> failures<00:01:34.229> and

the two main reasons for failures and

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.050 
the two main reasons for failures and
you<00:01:34.530> can<00:01:34.710> become<00:01:35.009> an<00:01:35.130> expert<00:01:35.250> real<00:01:35.759> quickly

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
you can become an expert real quickly

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.780 
you can become an expert real quickly
two<00:01:36.810> main<00:01:37.020> reasons<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:37.530> failures<00:01:38.100> are<00:01:38.310> dirt

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
two main reasons for failures are dirt

contamination if you will and lack of
lubrication<00:01:42.079> those<00:01:43.079> two<00:01:43.380> things<00:01:43.710> cause<00:01:44.100> 80%

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
lubrication those two things cause 80%

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.120 
lubrication those two things cause 80%
of<00:01:45.060> bearing<00:01:45.360> failures<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.740> look<00:01:46.950> at<00:01:47.070> a

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
of bearing failures so if you look at a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.830 
of bearing failures so if you look at a
bearing<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.759> looks<00:01:47.970> bad<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.600> say<00:01:48.810> I

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
bearing and it looks bad and you say I

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.810 
bearing and it looks bad and you say I
think<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.409> was<00:01:49.530> dirt<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.399> know<00:01:50.520> you've<00:01:50.670> got<00:01:50.790> a

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
think it was dirt you know you've got a

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.270 
think it was dirt you know you've got a
40%<00:01:51.630> chance<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:52.020> being<00:01:52.200> right<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.100> actually

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
40% chance of being right so I actually

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.179 
40% chance of being right so I actually
keep<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.000> mind<00:01:54.240> those<00:01:54.630> two<00:01:54.990> things<00:01:55.290> now

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
keep that in mind those two things now

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.770 
keep that in mind those two things now
we<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.549> even<00:01:56.850> narrow<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.299> down<00:01:57.329> make<00:01:57.750> it

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
we can even narrow it down make it

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.800 
we can even narrow it down make it
better<00:01:58.079> than<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.380> if<00:01:59.070> it's<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.759> backyard<00:02:00.180> kind

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
better than that if it's a backyard kind

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.569 
better than that if it's a backyard kind

me product that's failed and we talk

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.470 
me product that's failed and we talk
about<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.620> normally<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.520> eliminate<00:02:23.880> dirt

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
about it I normally can eliminate dirt

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.240 
about it I normally can eliminate dirt
because<00:02:24.750> they're<00:02:25.140> very<00:02:25.500> meticulous<00:02:26.130> about

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
because they're very meticulous about

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.280 
because they're very meticulous about
how<00:02:26.460> they<00:02:26.610> put<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.940> engines<00:02:27.300> together<00:02:27.510> so

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
how they put the engines together so

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.290 
how they put the engines together so
usually<00:02:28.770> my<00:02:28.950> first<00:02:29.220> guess<00:02:29.490> there<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:29.940> we<00:02:30.120> look

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
usually my first guess there is we look

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.690 
usually my first guess there is we look
for<00:02:30.510> lack<00:02:30.690> of<00:02:30.720> lubrication<00:02:31.320> issues<00:02:31.860> see<00:02:32.610> how

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
for lack of lubrication issues see how

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.060 
for lack of lubrication issues see how
simple<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.240> is<00:02:33.300> those<00:02:34.200> two<00:02:34.500> things<00:02:34.740> you've

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
simple that is those two things you've

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.490 
simple that is those two things you've
covered<00:02:35.340> for<00:02:35.820> TR<00:02:36.090> excuse<00:02:36.510> me<00:02:36.660> 80%<00:02:36.960> of<00:02:37.410> the

covered for TR excuse me 80% of the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.420

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.030

now<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.120> other<00:02:39.390> 20%<00:02:39.810> are<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.290> hodgepodge<00:02:40.680> of
