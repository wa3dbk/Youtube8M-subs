00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.599 

the<00:00:18.690> way<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.140> polygons<00:00:19.680> are<00:00:19.890> distributed

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
the way that polygons are distributed

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.269 
the way that polygons are distributed
over<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:21.000> model<00:00:21.449> surface<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.080> called<00:00:22.470> topology

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
over a model surface is called topology

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.550 
over a model surface is called topology
any<00:00:23.490> one<00:00:24.240> model<00:00:24.660> could<00:00:24.840> have<00:00:25.050> lots<00:00:25.350> of

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
any one model could have lots of

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.769 
any one model could have lots of
different<00:00:25.859> topologies<00:00:26.340> some<00:00:27.150> arrangements

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
different topologies some arrangements

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.599 
different topologies some arrangements
of<00:00:27.869> polygons<00:00:28.380> are<00:00:28.619> useful<00:00:29.160> for<00:00:29.189> some

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
of polygons are useful for some

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.269 
of polygons are useful for some
situations<00:00:30.240> but<00:00:30.449> not<00:00:30.630> others<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.740> far<00:00:31.980> we've

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
situations but not others so far we've

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.340 
situations but not others so far we've
used<00:00:32.550> two<00:00:32.850> types<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.360> topology<00:00:33.930> they're<00:00:34.110> good

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
used two types of topology they're good

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.350 
used two types of topology they're good
for<00:00:34.530> sculpting<00:00:34.860> first<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.790> used<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.149> box

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
for sculpting first we used a box

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.479 
for sculpting first we used a box
modeled<00:00:36.840> base<00:00:37.110> which<00:00:37.559> allowed<00:00:37.890> us<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.040> sculpt

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
modeled base which allowed us to sculpt

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.209 
modeled base which allowed us to sculpt
on<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> very<00:00:39.000> even<00:00:39.540> grid<00:00:39.930> pattern<00:00:40.379> then<00:00:40.890> we<00:00:41.070> use

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
on a very even grid pattern then we use

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.760 
on a very even grid pattern then we use
dynamic<00:00:41.550> topology<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.690> create<00:00:42.989> extra<00:00:43.410> detail

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
dynamic topology to create extra detail

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.830 
dynamic topology to create extra detail
right<00:00:44.160> where<00:00:44.370> we<00:00:44.489> wanted<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.850> sculpt<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
right where we wanted to sculpt it the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.540 
right where we wanted to sculpt it the
problem<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.770> neither<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.430> these

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
problem is that neither of these

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.700 
problem is that neither of these
typologies<00:00:47.820> work<00:00:48.510> well<00:00:48.780> for<00:00:48.989> animation<00:00:49.590> in

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
typologies work well for animation in

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.889 
typologies work well for animation in
this<00:00:50.309> chapter<00:00:50.610> i'll<00:00:50.910> show<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.480> how<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.809> create

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
this chapter i'll show you how to create

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.350 
this chapter i'll show you how to create
a<00:00:52.199> new<00:00:52.320> pattern<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:53.160> polygons<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:54.059> works

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
a new pattern of polygons that works

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.240 
a new pattern of polygons that works
well<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:54.780> animation<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.860> what<00:00:56.070> we're<00:00:56.219> looking

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
well for animation so what we're looking

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.520 
well for animation so what we're looking
at<00:00:56.550> right<00:00:56.610> now<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.750> multiresolution

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
at right now is the multiresolution

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.830 
at right now is the multiresolution
scope<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.489> we<00:00:59.609> made<00:00:59.820> from<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.120> box<00:01:00.359> modeled

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
scope that we made from a box modeled

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.900 
scope that we made from a box modeled
base<00:01:01.020> now<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.829> want<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.129> zoom<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> little<00:01:02.760> bit

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
base now I want to zoom in a little bit

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.490 
base now I want to zoom in a little bit
on<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> head<00:01:03.539> just<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.840> look<00:01:03.989> at<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.260> more

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
on the head just to look at this more

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.190 
on the head just to look at this more
clearly<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.979> actually<00:01:05.880> let's<00:01:06.420> go<00:01:06.600> down<00:01:06.869> in

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
clearly and actually let's go down in

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.080 
clearly and actually let's go down in
the<00:01:07.229> multiresolution<00:01:08.159> modifier<00:01:08.909> and

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
the multiresolution modifier and

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.359 
the multiresolution modifier and
decrease<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.840> preview<00:01:10.530> subdivision<00:01:11.130> level

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
decrease the preview subdivision level

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.580 
decrease the preview subdivision level
25<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.000> make<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.150> easier<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.689> see<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:12.960> so

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
25 just to make it easier to see this so

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.780 
25 just to make it easier to see this so
you<00:01:13.680> can<00:01:13.740> see<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.250> direction<00:01:14.610> that

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
you can see that the direction that

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.789 
you can see that the direction that
these<00:01:15.030> polygons<00:01:15.540> are<00:01:15.720> going<00:01:15.960> really<00:01:16.409> doesn't

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
these polygons are going really doesn't

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.010 
these polygons are going really doesn't
have<00:01:16.920> anything<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.580> do<00:01:17.759> with<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.270> anatomy<00:01:18.810> or

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
have anything to do with the anatomy or

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.109 
have anything to do with the anatomy or
the<00:01:19.290> way<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.560> would<00:01:19.740> deform<00:01:20.130> all<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.970> these

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
the way this would deform all of these

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.090 
the way this would deform all of these
edges<00:01:21.479> are<00:01:21.600> going<00:01:21.840> against<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.500> grain<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
edges are going against the grain of the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.219 
edges are going against the grain of the
models<00:01:23.610> structure<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.270> if<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.930> look<00:01:24.960> at<00:01:25.200> a

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
models structure and if you look at a

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.870 
models structure and if you look at a
mesh<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.619> was<00:01:25.740> sculpted<00:01:26.100> with<00:01:26.220> dine<00:01:26.460> topo

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
mesh that was sculpted with dine topo

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.999 
mesh that was sculpted with dine topo
well<00:01:27.240> it's<00:01:27.479> just<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.810> big<00:01:28.020> mess<00:01:28.259> it's<00:01:28.619> way<00:01:28.950> too

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
well it's just a big mess it's way too

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.980 
well it's just a big mess it's way too
dense<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.759> unstructured<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.630> animate

blenders reit apology tools are going to
allow<00:01:34.020> us<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.350> build<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.680> new<00:01:34.710> mesh<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.430> top<00:01:35.820> of

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
allow us to build a new mesh on top of

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.030 
allow us to build a new mesh on top of
the<00:01:36.150> sculpt<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.720> follows<00:01:37.229> these<00:01:37.439> anatomical

the sculpt that follows these anatomical

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.010 
the sculpt that follows these anatomical
structures<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.299> simple<00:01:39.659> enough<00:01:39.720> to

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
structures and is simple enough to

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.620 
structures and is simple enough to
animate<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.560> proper<00:01:41.369> topology<00:01:41.970> for<00:01:42.119> animation

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
animate a proper topology for animation

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.810 
animate a proper topology for animation
is<00:01:42.780> called<00:01:43.079> edge<00:01:43.290> flow<00:01:43.710> which<00:01:44.310> means<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.640> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
is called edge flow which means that the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.969 
is called edge flow which means that the
polygon<00:01:45.299> edges<00:01:45.570> flow<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> same<00:01:46.770> direction

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
polygon edges flow in the same direction

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.760 
polygon edges flow in the same direction
as<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.520> characters<00:01:48.210> deformation<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.500> for

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
as the characters deformation so for

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.289 
as the characters deformation so for
example<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.159> would<00:01:50.430> want<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.700> have<00:01:50.850> edges

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
example you would want to have edges

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.630 
example you would want to have edges
that<00:01:51.899> kind<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.140> flowed<00:01:52.439> along<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.220> eyelids

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
that kind of flowed along the eyelids

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.999 
that kind of flowed along the eyelids
and<00:01:53.899> along<00:01:54.899> with<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.259> different<00:01:55.590> creases

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
and along with the different creases

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.830 
and along with the different creases
with<00:01:56.700> something<00:01:57.000> kind<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.210> similar<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.570> this

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
with something kind of similar to this

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.889 
with something kind of similar to this
and<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.770> on<00:01:58.979> now<00:01:59.520> while<00:01:59.820> it<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.240> possible<00:02:00.840> to

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
and so on now while it is possible to

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.600 
and so on now while it is possible to
model<00:02:01.259> good<00:02:01.469> edge<00:02:01.680> flow<00:02:02.009> right<00:02:02.280> from<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
model good edge flow right from the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.060 
model good edge flow right from the
start<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.000> bypass<00:02:03.509> sculpting<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.140> like<00:02:04.860> this

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
start and bypass sculpting I like this

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.530 
start and bypass sculpting I like this
workflow<00:02:05.549> because<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.119> gives<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
workflow because it gives you the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.630 
workflow because it gives you the
greatest<00:02:06.810> flexibility<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.950> experiment<00:02:08.610> with

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
greatest flexibility to experiment with

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.850 
greatest flexibility to experiment with
sculpting<00:02:09.209> before<00:02:09.750> committing<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.319> edge<00:02:10.560> flow

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
sculpting before committing to edge flow

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.640 
sculpting before committing to edge flow
in<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.610> old<00:02:11.790> days<00:02:12.060> before<00:02:12.300> Rita<00:02:12.810> pology

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
in the old days before Rita pology

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.050 
in the old days before Rita pology
characters<00:02:13.860> took<00:02:14.069> a<00:02:14.189> lot<00:02:14.430> longer<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.879> make

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
characters took a lot longer to make

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.270 
characters took a lot longer to make
because<00:02:15.269> any<00:02:15.659> change<00:02:16.079> to<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.470> design<00:02:16.829> meant

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
because any change to the design meant

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.860 
because any change to the design meant
that<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.519> had<00:02:17.549> to<00:02:17.760> rework<00:02:18.269> a<00:02:18.480> lot<00:02:18.689> of<00:02:18.810> the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
that you had to rework a lot of the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.500 
that you had to rework a lot of the
polygons<00:02:19.379> by<00:02:19.590> hand<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:20.430> for<00:02:20.700> me<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:21.090> best<00:02:21.329> way

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
polygons by hand so for me the best way

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.300 
polygons by hand so for me the best way
to<00:02:21.569> work<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:21.989> to<00:02:22.260> get<00:02:22.379> all<00:02:22.409> the<00:02:22.769> artistic

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310

this<00:02:28.290> way<00:02:28.500> of<00:02:28.620> working<00:02:28.650> is<00:02:29.069> faster<00:02:29.489> and<00:02:29.610> less
