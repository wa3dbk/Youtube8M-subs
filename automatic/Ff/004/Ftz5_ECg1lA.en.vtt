00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
and we knew that there was something

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.360 
and we knew that there was something
more<00:00:46.540> that<00:00:46.600> could<00:00:46.870> be<00:00:46.930> done<00:00:47.050> to<00:00:47.980> make<00:00:48.190> it<00:00:48.220> a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
more that could be done to make it a

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.770 
more that could be done to make it a

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
useful but we just weren't sure how to

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.820 
useful but we just weren't sure how to
go<00:00:52.180> about<00:00:52.270> doing<00:00:52.600> it<00:00:52.690> we<00:00:53.050> wanted<00:00:53.320> to<00:00:53.379> stay<00:00:53.620> here

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
moving to a newer home because we're so

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
remodeling this house allowed us to use

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.580 
remodeling this house allowed us to use

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
favorite part of the project is probably

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.850 
favorite part of the project is probably
the<00:01:10.030> flow<00:01:10.360> of<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.750> house<00:01:10.899> and<00:01:11.290> how<00:01:11.440> much<00:01:11.619> the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
the flow of the house and how much the

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.340 
the flow of the house and how much the
