00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
really trying to use what the military

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.100 
really trying to use what the military
are<00:01:19.530> actually<00:01:20.060> developing<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.600> medical

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
are actually developing and medical

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.890 
are actually developing and medical
facilities<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.400> technology<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.030> Robocop<00:01:24.630> is

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
facilities the technology of Robocop is

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.410 
facilities the technology of Robocop is
already<00:01:25.140> there<00:01:25.439> where<00:01:26.070> vision<00:01:26.460> implants<00:01:27.060> so

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
already there where vision implants so

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.749 
already there where vision implants so
we<00:01:27.840> can<00:01:28.049> actually<00:01:28.229> give<00:01:28.560> some<00:01:28.799> basic<00:01:29.250> vision

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
we can actually give some basic vision

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.819 
we can actually give some basic vision
back<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.299> people<00:01:30.689> who<00:01:30.810> have<00:01:30.930> been<00:01:31.110> blind<00:01:31.409> with

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
out stock from light objects there's

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.340 
out stock from light objects there's
been<00:01:35.729> amazing<00:01:36.240> breakthroughs<00:01:36.750> over<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.110> past

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
been amazing breakthroughs over the past

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.480 
been amazing breakthroughs over the past
year<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.740> have<00:01:38.040> allowed<00:01:38.280> us<00:01:38.310> to

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
year that have allowed us to

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.080 
year that have allowed us to
successfully<00:01:39.119> link<00:01:39.900> our<00:01:40.259> minds<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.460> robotic

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
successfully link our minds to robotic

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.030 
successfully link our minds to robotic
prosthetics<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.049> most<00:01:43.200> recent<00:01:43.409> example

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
prosthetics that the most recent example

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.510 
prosthetics that the most recent example
was<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
was the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.800 
was the
literally<00:01:44.880> were<00:01:44.969> able<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.240> implant<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.780> chip

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
literally were able to implant the chip

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.810 
literally were able to implant the chip
in<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.259> brain<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.070> guy<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.609> actually

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
in the brain so this guy can actually

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.300 
in the brain so this guy can actually
think<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.659> connect<00:01:49.409> with<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> computer<00:01:50.070> that

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
think and connect with a computer that

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.969 
think and connect with a computer that
allowed<00:01:50.549> him<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.759> control<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.179> robotic<00:01:51.570> arm

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
allowed him to control a robotic arm

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.319 
allowed him to control a robotic arm
