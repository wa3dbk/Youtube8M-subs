 know I'm going to do if I'm going to do 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.550
 boil some water in which I 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.190
 will set fire to have the seeds 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.890

 which I'm going to put the two nets 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.010
 to cook let's say about three minutes I 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:10.439
 cook both sides of his two 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:16.380

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.990
 go remove the water I will continue and 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.030
 there now I need a robot 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.159
 in which I'm going to h and the chicken 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.530
 with the other ingredients 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.420
 the chicken is not cooked entirely 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.430
 we remain a step do the big 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.009
 pieces before putting it in their 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.030
 robot I'm going to add now the 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.369
 salt spices this is powdered cumin 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.820
 I'm going to put two teaspoons to 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.530
 coffee this is the corian dry beam 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.100
 I will also put two spoons to 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.259
 coffee 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.950
 I will add a little bit of spice 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.170
 red one can also add a pepper 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.390
 cool like that if you like to eat 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.640
 spicy you can add a whole 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.280
 little bit of garam masala the hull 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.290
 masala 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.569
 it is a mixture of spices keeps request 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.150
 cinnamon pepper what we already have 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.020
 took a small step when cooking 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.020
 the chicken 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.600
 you can put in it's a little 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.490
 butter or a little olive oil 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.910
 I prefer to use a little oil 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.840
 olive so that it stays soft 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.820
 after in this recipe as I had 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.380
 chicken fillets I will add 2 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.380
 tablespoons of olive oil 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.540
 I will check to see if it's ok 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:57.400
 h and I see there are still some 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:58.989
 pieces of onions so another round I 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.150
 am going to start preparing the dumplings 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:07.299
 but in the meantime I will start 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:12.849
 to dry the same stove on which I'm going 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:16.500
 to make the croquettes the hair is hot 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:18.970
 and I'm going to put some olive oil 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.389
 are two tablespoons in the 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.739
 stove and the time it gets hot I 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:26.940
 go prepare the cabs 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.430
 either you can do like his galette 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.959
 little happiness for Thai spending on 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.209
 your taste if you want to eat like 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.629

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:40.599
 if you want to eat like a drink 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:43.750
 you can make them smaller there 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.489
 starts to heat up now what 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.230
 I'm going to do what I'm going to ask 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:53.099
 cameras 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:53.099
 the croquettes on the stove 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.480
 you can also do it on your 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.690
 barbecue on a cat plane it's very 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.690
 easy 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.670

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.910

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:25.010

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:27.700
 brown croquettes are press 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.100

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:35.480

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:45.410
