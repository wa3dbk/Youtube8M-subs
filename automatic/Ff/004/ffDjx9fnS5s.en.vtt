00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.620 

keep<00:01:24.829> in<00:01:24.979> mind<00:01:25.009> these<00:01:25.399> these<00:01:25.880> motors<00:01:26.240> do<00:01:26.390> make

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
keep in mind these these motors do make

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.270 
keep in mind these these motors do make
a<00:01:26.659> lot<00:01:26.899> of<00:01:26.960> vibration<00:01:27.200> they<00:01:27.829> move<00:01:28.039> pretty

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
a lot of vibration they move pretty

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.459 
a lot of vibration they move pretty
quickly<00:01:28.609> right<00:01:29.060> so<00:01:29.479> they<00:01:29.659> will<00:01:29.780> cause<00:01:30.049> some<00:01:30.320> of

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
quickly right so they will cause some of

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:32.740 
quickly right so they will cause some of
that<00:01:30.590> to<00:01:30.799> happen<00:01:31.000> usually<00:01:32.000> not<00:01:32.329> a<00:01:32.360> big<00:01:32.570> deal

this gear cover off and to be how would
I<00:01:40.130> know<00:01:40.280> whether<00:01:40.789> it's<00:01:41.000> one<00:01:41.210> of<00:01:41.329> those<00:01:41.479> three

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
I know whether it's one of those three

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.959 
I know whether it's one of those three
options<00:01:42.380> as<00:01:42.950> soon<00:01:43.130> as<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.340> spur<00:01:43.579> gear<00:01:43.610> comes

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
options as soon as the spur gear comes

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.819 
options as soon as the spur gear comes
off<00:01:44.179> or<00:01:44.689> the<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:45.079> spirt<00:01:45.289> cover<00:01:45.469> comes<00:01:45.679> off

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
off or the the spirt cover comes off

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.429 
off or the the spirt cover comes off
you'll<00:01:46.039> be<00:01:46.159> able<00:01:46.219> to<00:01:46.310> see<00:01:46.490> right<00:01:46.700> away<00:01:47.439> so

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
you'll be able to see right away so

00:01:48.439 --> 00:02:04.639 
you'll be able to see right away so
let's<00:01:48.740> see<00:01:49.009> about<00:01:49.579> first<00:01:50.000> one<00:01:50.179> off

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.729 

yeah<00:02:06.869> magnetite<00:02:07.869> screwdrivers<00:02:08.440> make<00:02:08.709> a

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
yeah magnetite screwdrivers make a

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.469 
yeah magnetite screwdrivers make a
difference<00:02:09.190> will<00:02:09.670> make<00:02:09.819> it<00:02:09.970> easier<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:10.270> get

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
difference will make it easier to get

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.400 
difference will make it easier to get
these<00:02:10.660> screws<00:02:10.929> out<00:02:11.050> of<00:02:11.200> here<00:02:12.420> okay<00:02:13.420> so<00:02:14.230> if<00:02:14.319> we

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
these screws out of here okay so if we

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.380 
these screws out of here okay so if we
look<00:02:14.440> right<00:02:14.800> here<00:02:14.880> go<00:02:15.880> ahead<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.209> let<00:02:16.300> the

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
look right here go ahead and let the

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.350 
look right here go ahead and let the
camera<00:02:16.750> zoom<00:02:16.780> in<00:02:17.050> on<00:02:17.140> this<00:02:17.819> you<00:02:18.819> can<00:02:18.970> see<00:02:19.180> where

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
camera zoom in on this you can see where

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.750 
camera zoom in on this you can see where
this<00:02:19.540> spur<00:02:20.260> gear<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:21.040> actually<00:02:21.370> not<00:02:21.459> touching

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
this spur gear is actually not touching

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.210 
this spur gear is actually not touching
the<00:02:21.849> pinion<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.380> starts<00:02:23.530> rubbing<00:02:23.800> against

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
the pinion so it starts rubbing against

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.559 
the pinion so it starts rubbing against
it<00:02:24.310> that<00:02:24.730> gives<00:02:24.819> it<00:02:24.970> that<00:02:25.000> sound<00:02:25.360> that<00:02:25.540> you

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
it that gives it that sound that you

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.839 
it that gives it that sound that you
were<00:02:25.720> hearing<00:02:25.959> okay<00:02:26.590> okay<00:02:26.860> so<00:02:27.340> more<00:02:27.550> unlikely

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
were hearing okay okay so more unlikely

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.360 
were hearing okay okay so more unlikely

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
we want to do is move our motor see how

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.710 
we want to do is move our motor see how
the<00:02:56.860> whole<00:02:57.040> thing<00:02:57.069> moves<00:02:57.430> okay<00:02:58.330> we<00:02:58.450> actually

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
the whole thing moves okay we actually

want to bring it in contact with the

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.100 
want to bring it in contact with the
spur<00:03:00.130> gear<00:03:00.330> see<00:03:01.330> now<00:03:01.480> they're<00:03:01.630> meshing<00:03:01.959> up

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
spur gear see now they're meshing up

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
spur gear see now they're meshing up
hold<00:03:03.069> it<00:03:03.190> there<00:03:05.430> tighten<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.489> back<00:03:06.519> down

another<00:03:09.130> thing<00:03:09.280> you<00:03:09.370> can<00:03:09.459> do<00:03:09.640> we<00:03:09.790> recommend<00:03:10.359> is

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
another thing you can do we recommend is

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.050 
another thing you can do we recommend is
use<00:03:10.810> some<00:03:10.930> blue<00:03:11.140> loctite<00:03:11.730> that'll<00:03:12.730> hold<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:12.970> in

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
use some blue loctite that'll hold it in

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.509 
use some blue loctite that'll hold it in
place<00:03:13.150> keep<00:03:13.450> it<00:03:13.570> from<00:03:13.660> vibrating<00:03:14.079> loose<00:03:14.519> okay

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
place keep it from vibrating loose okay

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.360 
place keep it from vibrating loose okay
so<00:03:16.180> now<00:03:16.329> it's<00:03:16.540> matched<00:03:16.750> up<00:03:17.049> that<00:03:17.950> sound<00:03:18.220> is

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
so now it's matched up that sound is

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.210 
so now it's matched up that sound is
gone<00:03:18.609> and<00:03:19.319> if<00:03:20.319> you'll<00:03:20.590> do<00:03:20.739> me<00:03:20.769> a<00:03:20.890> favor<00:03:21.069> just

it go all the way through once it comes
out<00:03:34.540> their<00:03:34.720> side<00:03:35.019> what<00:03:35.709> you<00:03:35.799> want<00:03:35.920> to<00:03:35.980> make

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
out their side what you want to make

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.550 
out their side what you want to make
sure<00:03:36.100> is<00:03:36.370> that<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.639> paper<00:03:36.880> is<00:03:37.290> crinkled<00:03:38.290> but

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
sure is that the paper is crinkled but

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.559 
sure is that the paper is crinkled but
not<00:03:38.709> torn<00:03:39.010> in<00:03:39.190> this<00:03:39.819> case<00:03:40.000> we<00:03:40.150> got<00:03:40.329> a<00:03:40.359> little

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
not torn in this case we got a little

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.870 
not torn in this case we got a little
bit<00:03:40.780> of<00:03:40.810> tearing<00:03:41.230> going<00:03:41.470> on<00:03:41.590> okay<00:03:42.250> so<00:03:42.760> we're

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
bit of tearing going on okay so we're

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.099 
bit of tearing going on okay so we're
going<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.120> do<00:03:43.209> is<00:03:43.389> we're<00:03:43.540> going<00:03:43.630> to<00:03:43.690> back<00:03:43.900> off

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
going to do is we're going to back off

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.280 
going to do is we're going to back off
that<00:03:44.139> motor<00:03:44.530> just<00:03:44.889> the<00:03:45.160> hair<00:03:45.400> that<00:03:46.290> will

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
that motor just the hair that will

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.620 
that motor just the hair that will
protect<00:03:47.470> our<00:03:47.829> pinion<00:03:48.459> gear<00:03:48.700> from<00:03:49.150> eating<00:03:49.510> up

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
protect our pinion gear from eating up

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
our skirts / gear prematurely now in

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.190 
our skirts / gear prematurely now in
this<00:03:54.790> case<00:03:55.049> it<00:03:56.049> was<00:03:56.170> a<00:03:56.260> quick<00:03:56.500> easy<00:03:56.709> fix<00:03:58.200> every

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
this case it was a quick easy fix every

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.940 
this case it was a quick easy fix every
once<00:03:59.530> in<00:03:59.739> a<00:03:59.799> while<00:04:00.690> your<00:04:01.690> pinion<00:04:02.530> gear<00:04:02.769> which

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
once in a while your pinion gear which

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.979 
once in a while your pinion gear which
is<00:04:03.069> a<00:04:03.100> smaller<00:04:03.459> gear<00:04:03.700> will<00:04:04.450> have<00:04:04.569> come<00:04:04.750> loose

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
is a smaller gear will have come loose

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.430 
is a smaller gear will have come loose
completely<00:04:05.859> okay<00:04:06.700> okay<00:04:07.000> so<00:04:07.750> what<00:04:07.900> you<00:04:08.049> do<00:04:08.200> in
