 hi youtube hi community today 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.320
 I would like to make a small announcement I 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.769
 created a channel that illuminated sharpening 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.440
 knives 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.839
 created a channel on youtube link to this 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.400
 You can see the channel in the description below. 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.529
 video on the main page of my channel 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.359
 actually go and if you have one 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.180
 need for materials 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.359
 sharpeners subscribe in the future all 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.850
 sharpening materials 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:36.000
 whale knives nuances god is not averse to everything 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.930
 will appear there and from this channel 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.160
 it will go away the reason for this is quite simple 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.350
 but not obvious for. a little bit 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.739
 different from reviews or even tests 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.079
 knives 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.829
 despite being direct 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.920
 continuation of this topic reviews and tests 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.989
 they allow you to apply multiple 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.989
 playful disc format you want to continue 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.769
 cool that is some kind of format some 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.240
 jokes or more often here is the format to hard 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.299
 tough talk over. 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.049
 This process is complex and multifaceted in 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:17.100
 largely intuitive because no 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.259
 single let's say a set of rules like 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.799
 grind one way or another can have a line of steel 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.590
 comes under some tasks 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:29.490
 this is the first reason the second reason is very 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.189
 important when i was doing video sharpening and in 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.590
 including what I don't do so often 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.400
 Now I said a very polite relationship 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:43.250
 yourself any video for daughters but takes 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.649
 time any and if done well and clearly 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.290
 neat and careful how it is done 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.140
 usually this time can reach 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.430
 absolutely fantastic dimensions yes 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:00.050
 yes, if a standard review or test 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.680
 this is something in the area there 6-30 minutes 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.690
 30 very many then for sure the video can 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.980
 reach 3 hours when you take pictures 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.250
 video in one outline 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.470
 for one audience you even try 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.680
 your for sure you are doing interesting 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:20.810
 squeeze as far as possible 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:24.250
 adhan this is the area where the nuances where 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.260
 moments and details they are very important and 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.760
 so maybe I do not know how the 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.940
 noun possible on this channel 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.950
 will appear and raw meaning it is 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.560
 video in which maybe the sound is not 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.450
 will and will be but without me I will not 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.040
 give or listen to music is something profitable 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.780
 will sharpen the knife from start to finish 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.750
 maybe this video was taking two three 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.730
 four hours and accordingly the appearance 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.970
 its on my channel on the basis of that 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.250
 let's say less format and format not 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.550
 as much for the audience as for me 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.670
 it's easier for me to separate these two 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.540
 process into two separate some 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.340
 the degree of independent channel to one 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.080
 try all the same with us on the main 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.250
 channel try to squeeze as much as possible 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.739
 information date and minimum 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.890
 minimum time to save time 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:22.400
 7 scans people watching 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.440
 and in the grinding channel Iâ€™ll go to the gap 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.959
 let me not put such tasks 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.550
 I will definitely know what the exact channel is 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.000
 I will watch only people who are 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:37.850
 really need it I will not be such 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.470
 problems like that, that is, if you 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.080
 interesting topic sharpening if you 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.090
 interested in everything that is connected with it can 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.430
