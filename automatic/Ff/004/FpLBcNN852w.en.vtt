 Boats with Scarlet sails from zucchini - it's delicious 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.410
 and original. 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.670
 Prepare the stuffing: grate carrots on a large 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:49.329
 grater, onion cut into cubes. 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.790
 Lay out on a frying pan warmed with vegetable oil 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:01:04.239
 carrots, fry uncovered, 2-3 minutes. 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:13.479
 Add the onions and fry all together until cooked, not 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.040
 covering with a lid. 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:29.540
 Cut one tomato into cubes. 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:38.380
 Hard grated cheese, 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.560
 divide it into two parts. 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.470
 One part will go in mince, the second part we will post 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.770
 on squash. 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.909
 Chicken fillet mince. 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:02:01.509
 Add fried vegetables, salt, ground black pepper 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:09.289
 (salt and pepper to taste) and mix well. 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:30.019
 Add 2 eggs, mix again. 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:37.480
 Pour one piece of grated cheese, mix. 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.211
 Then add diced one tomato. 

00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:43.211
 We will cut the second tomato into plates and make 

00:02:43.211 --> 00:02:46.420
 them "Scarlet Sails". 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.919
 Our stuffing is ready. 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:53.099
 Prepare zucchini: Zucchini cut along 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.099
 into two parts. 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:03:04.370
 Remove some of the pulp (seeds), I have young zucchini 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.249
 no seeds. 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:14.189
 I remove the pulp with a teaspoon, it has 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:37.949
 sharp edges. 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:04:04.680
 Fill zucchini with minced meat, put on a greased vegetable 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.680
 butter pan. 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.439
 Send zucchini in the oven preheated to 200C, bake 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.579
 20-25 minutes. 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:27.330
 While zucchini baked, let's make "Scarlet Sails". 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.180
 Cut the tomato into two parts, cut each part 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.180
 the plates. 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:45.810
 Secure the tomato slices to the toothpick, at the edge. 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.490
 Remove the zucchini from the oven, sprinkle with remaining solid. 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.849
 cheese 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:05:18.870
 In each half zucchini stick a toothpick with a sail. 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:44.100
 Looks beautiful on two sails. 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.430
 Again, send the zucchini in the oven for 10 minutes. 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:57.780
