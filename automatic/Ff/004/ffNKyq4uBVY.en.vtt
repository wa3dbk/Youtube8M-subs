00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.500
 good afternoon, we started the wheel of 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.070
 press pepe mel please name and a half 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.070
 before each question 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.130
 good ramón roland sometimes 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.540
 and mathematics still tells us that 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.800
 the betis is in first but if they say 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.450
 that the coming days could 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.380
 be it once and for all 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.380
 I guess happy 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.820
 it's true that we are better than 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.240
 last week and one week less 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.480
 but 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.300
 12 points remain and we only get 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.610
 6 therefore it is not enough there is 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.170
 follow we have to go to Santander to 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.110
 win because if in Santander we lose 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.430
 we can go back to 3 so there's 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.640
 than to win as we always do and 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.710
 that we are good but I think that the 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.810
 team deserves all the recognition and 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.940
 all the pride of beticismo because today 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.350
 it was a difficult day with a lot of heat 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.869
 matured well the party 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.420
 and I think in the end physically the 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.700
 team has been very good and with the 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.890
 matured party because we have had the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.040
 tranquility of having the marker to 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.040
 favor 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.140
 maybe the first few minutes have seen us 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.570
 a good betis but has reached the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.540
 stuck and in the end the good match has 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.370
 left until the final stretch we see that 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.340
 as I tell you about these parties we have 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.350
 already had three or four here with me 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.240
 party had to mature what is there 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.149
 work it is very difficult to earn a 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.289
 soccer match at 10 minutes 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.930
 I remember the osasuna match that was 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.360
 similar 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.920
 the party we knew that in addition to the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.320
 heat that he did and the way he played 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.210
 has the lugo were going to make us run 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.340
 behind the ball but I think the team 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.690
 he has run well he has done well and in the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.450
 the second part we have already removed the 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.060
 ball us and I sincerely believe that 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.770
 I do not know if the marker reflects what happened 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.890
 but the betis has won because it has been 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.890
 best 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.180
 and good pp that you have searched with the 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.830
 changes a recognition to 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.490
 front or the best thinking of three 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.490
 matches in a week 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.910
 it is not time for recognition for anyone 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.240
 it's time to think that on Thursday we have 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.330
 another and the party was solved and 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.400
 give him more minutes in the field besides 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.980
 people like rené the one that works very well 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.100
 with his mouth shut working hard 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.500
 going to the front always deserves its 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.780
 minutes and deserves to participate and deserves the 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.190
 goal that he has had and that the coach 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.370
 recognize the work you do during the 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.070
 week and this form is tremendous not what's 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.650
 rubén and mill one Sunday yes the other 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.480
 also in the next at least 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.020
 since I'm here if I do not know what 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.020
 I would go before 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.549
 good afternoon to see what happened to 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.790
 piccinini looked like he had options of 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:09.069
 play magnet not even analysts 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.590
 piccini yesterday had a small problem 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.659
 again in the old injury and although 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.250
 it does not seem alarming or anything 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:18.099
 preferred having three parties in the 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.049
 week we have preferred we thought that 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.870
 we were more consistent that miller plays 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:25.620
 this one that has rest from mallorca 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.800
 until today they are seven days 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.380
 not 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.410
 Thursday that is more space is more 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.090
 short and good to see if we get that 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.890
 Christian arrive for Thursday and if not 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.750
 Well, we will have to look for another alternative 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.970
 because we also have the problem that 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.430
 miller has four cards for the 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.790
 Sunday the newspaper has fallen and good now 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:50.270
 we have this antonio adam is ceballos 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.450
 is Cadiz is miller with four 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.400
 cards and good in this tanda of three 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.610
 matches in seven days that's important 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.610
 as well 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.230
 any more questions could be sprayed 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.230
 see you later
