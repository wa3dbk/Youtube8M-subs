00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
see over there be careful of the web app

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.550 
see over there be careful of the web app
because<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.479> web<00:01:21.630> app<00:01:21.780> could<00:01:21.990> be<00:01:22.140> down<00:01:22.380> if

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
because the web app could be down if

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.260 
because the web app could be down if
there's<00:01:22.710> too<00:01:22.860> many<00:01:22.979> users<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.030> you

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
there's too many users on it so you

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.730 
there's too many users on it so you
probably<00:01:24.810> get<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.020> error<00:01:25.259> message<00:01:25.590> over

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
probably get that error message over

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.020 
probably get that error message over
there<00:01:26.040> or<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.340> might<00:01:26.490> not<00:01:26.610> even<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.820> able<00:01:26.939> to

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
there or you might not even be able to

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.550 
there or you might not even be able to
get<00:01:27.210> onto<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.600> web<00:01:27.720> app<00:01:27.869> like<00:01:28.080> last<00:01:28.320> year

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
get onto the web app like last year

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.020 
get onto the web app like last year
there<00:01:28.680> was<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.829> few<00:01:29.070> problems<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.670> went<00:01:29.880> down

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
there was a few problems that went down

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.149 
there was a few problems that went down
and<00:01:30.240> many<00:01:31.229> people<00:01:31.350> couldn't<00:01:31.770> get<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.009> web

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
and many people couldn't get on the web

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.130 
and many people couldn't get on the web
app<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.520> i'd<00:01:32.610> recommend<00:01:32.640> guys<00:01:33.270> try<00:01:33.840> using<00:01:33.990> your

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
app so i'd recommend guys try using your

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.499 
app so i'd recommend guys try using your
consoles<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.790> will<00:01:35.909> avoid<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.299> know

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
consoles and it will avoid you know

is<00:03:09.890> going<00:03:10.010> to<00:03:10.069> be<00:03:10.190> consumables<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.290> someone

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
is going to be consumables and someone

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.390 
is going to be consumables and someone
was<00:03:12.410> asking<00:03:12.530> me<00:03:12.799> what<00:03:13.010> happens<00:03:13.280> to

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
was asking me what happens to

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.309 
was asking me what happens to
consumables<00:03:13.940> this<00:03:14.120> time<00:03:14.390> of<00:03:14.600> year<00:03:14.630> because<00:03:15.140> of

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
consumables this time of year because of

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.380 
consumables this time of year because of
Team<00:03:15.530> of<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.680> Year<00:03:15.739> now<00:03:16.489> as<00:03:16.850> you<00:03:17.060> guys<00:03:17.269> see

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
Team of the Year now as you guys see

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.210 
Team of the Year now as you guys see
that<00:03:17.420> put<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:17.780> little<00:03:17.890> paragraph<00:03:18.890> over<00:03:19.070> there

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
that put a little paragraph over there

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.949 
that put a little paragraph over there
consumables<00:03:19.730> are<00:03:19.790> likely<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.150> follow<00:03:20.570> in

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
consumables are likely to follow in

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.740 
consumables are likely to follow in
decreasing<00:03:21.470> in<00:03:21.769> value<00:03:21.829> and<00:03:22.600> that's<00:03:23.600> because

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
decreasing in value and that's because

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.270 
decreasing in value and that's because
loads<00:03:24.109> of<00:03:24.230> people<00:03:24.320> are<00:03:24.530> going<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:24.709> open<00:03:24.890> packs

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
loads of people are going to open packs

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.920 
loads of people are going to open packs
and<00:03:25.579> they're<00:03:26.239> going<00:03:26.329> to<00:03:26.390> want<00:03:26.570> to<00:03:26.630> make<00:03:26.780> more

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
and they're going to want to make more

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.539 
and they're going to want to make more
coins<00:03:27.230> as<00:03:27.440> quickly<00:03:27.650> as<00:03:27.829> they<00:03:27.950> can<00:03:28.130> to<00:03:28.310> open

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
coins as quickly as they can to open

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:29.620 
coins as quickly as they can to open
another<00:03:28.700> pack<00:03:29.000> they're<00:03:29.239> going<00:03:29.359> to<00:03:29.420> be<00:03:29.480> on<00:03:29.570> the

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
another pack they're going to be on the

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.449 
another pack they're going to be on the
hype<00:03:29.840> for<00:03:30.140> wanting<00:03:30.380> to<00:03:30.410> get<00:03:30.620> some<00:03:30.799> packs<00:03:31.070> so

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
hype for wanting to get some packs so

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.940 
hype for wanting to get some packs so
and<00:03:31.700> making<00:03:32.390> more<00:03:32.540> coins<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:33.650> what<00:03:33.799> they<00:03:33.859> can

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
and making more coins so what they can

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.140 
and making more coins so what they can
do<00:03:34.100> is<00:03:34.190> they<00:03:34.220> can<00:03:34.400> list<00:03:34.549> their<00:03:34.670> stuff<00:03:34.880> up<00:03:35.030> for

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
do is they can list their stuff up for

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.360 
do is they can list their stuff up for
150<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:35.900> they're<00:03:36.410> gonna<00:03:36.530> really<00:03:36.799> undercut

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
150 and they're gonna really undercut

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.310 
150 and they're gonna really undercut
each<00:03:37.430> other<00:03:37.760> very<00:03:38.090> you<00:03:38.329> know<00:03:38.359> cutthroat<00:03:38.720> stuff

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
each other very you know cutthroat stuff

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.140 
each other very you know cutthroat stuff
so<00:03:39.680> consumables<00:03:40.489> will<00:03:40.670> go<00:03:40.760> down<00:03:40.940> in<00:03:41.120> value

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
so consumables will go down in value

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.780 
so consumables will go down in value
I've<00:03:41.600> put<00:03:41.840> position<00:03:42.230> modifiers<00:03:42.790> the

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
I've put position modifiers the

I've put position modifiers the
chemistry<00:03:44.150> styles<00:03:44.660> I<00:03:44.810> just<00:03:45.290> put<00:03:45.470> a<00:03:45.500> couple<00:03:45.769> of

the<00:04:00.260> shadow<00:04:00.560> for<00:04:01.160> defenders<00:04:01.850> now<00:04:02.120> these<00:04:02.660> are

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
the shadow for defenders now these are

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.319 
the shadow for defenders now these are
all<00:04:02.930> increases<00:04:03.410> in<00:04:03.530> pace<00:04:03.769> and<00:04:04.069> then<00:04:04.340> also<00:04:04.609> then

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
all increases in pace and then also then

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.740 
all increases in pace and then also then
sub<00:04:05.780> increases<00:04:06.440> in<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:07.459> attribute<00:04:08.359> for<00:04:08.540> an

sub increases in the attribute for an

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.270 
sub increases in the attribute for an
attacker<00:04:08.989> would<00:04:09.200> be<00:04:09.319> shooting<00:04:09.739> for<00:04:10.190> a

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
attacker would be shooting for a

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.309 
attacker would be shooting for a
midfielder<00:04:10.730> to<00:04:10.790> be<00:04:10.880> passing<00:04:11.420> and<00:04:11.600> for<00:04:12.290> a

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
midfielder to be passing and for a

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.559 
midfielder to be passing and for a
defender<00:04:12.769> it'd<00:04:12.920> be<00:04:13.040> defending<00:04:13.579> so<00:04:13.850> those<00:04:14.389> will

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
defender it'd be defending so those will

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.090 
defender it'd be defending so those will
probably<00:04:14.630> go<00:04:14.930> down<00:04:15.109> in<00:04:15.290> value<00:04:15.319> as<00:04:15.650> well<00:04:15.829> from

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
probably go down in value as well from

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.420

you can see there's a lot of volatility
in<00:05:34.350> the<00:05:34.380> graph<00:05:34.680> and<00:05:34.980> that's<00:05:35.190> because<00:05:35.390> lots<00:05:36.390> of

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
in the graph and that's because lots of

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.090

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
value so you get the bite the price you

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.260 
value so you get the bite the price you
bought<00:06:13.020> your<00:06:13.290> player<00:06:13.470> for<00:06:13.710> you-<00:06:14.370> it<00:06:14.700> from<00:06:15.000> your

the market which gives you the decreased
value<00:06:20.700> in<00:06:20.820> price<00:06:21.120> then<00:06:21.780> you<00:06:21.870> get<00:06:22.020> that<00:06:22.170> value

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
value in price then you get that value

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.440 
value in price then you get that value
you<00:06:22.830> divide<00:06:23.160> it<00:06:23.310> by<00:06:23.460> your<00:06:23.610> initial<00:06:23.940> value<00:06:24.330> that

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
you paid for the player back when you

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.560 
you paid for the player back when you
did<00:06:26.040> pay<00:06:26.250> for<00:06:26.400> them<00:06:26.520> and<00:06:26.640> that<00:06:26.700> will<00:06:27.390> give<00:06:27.420> you

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
did pay for them and that will give you

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.300 
did pay for them and that will give you
a<00:06:27.630> decimal<00:06:28.080> figure<00:06:28.500> now<00:06:28.980> you're<00:06:29.070> going<00:06:29.160> to<00:06:29.250> get

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
a decimal figure now you're going to get

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.250 
a decimal figure now you're going to get
that<00:06:29.400> decimal<00:06:29.730> figure<00:06:30.030> multiply<00:06:30.870> it<00:06:30.930> by<00:06:30.960> 100

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
that decimal figure multiply it by 100

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.440 
that decimal figure multiply it by 100
that<00:06:32.160> will<00:06:32.280> give<00:06:32.400> you<00:06:32.490> your<00:06:32.640> percentage<00:06:33.210> of

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450 
that will give you your percentage of

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.540 
that will give you your percentage of
the<00:06:34.050> depreciation<00:06:34.740> it's<00:06:35.010> either<00:06:35.130> gone<00:06:35.310> down

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
the depreciation it's either gone down

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.790 
the depreciation it's either gone down
in<00:06:35.729> value<00:06:35.760> in<00:06:36.090> the<00:06:36.180> market<00:06:36.540> so<00:06:36.800> lewandowski's

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
in value in the market so lewandowski's

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.140 
in value in the market so lewandowski's
gone<00:06:37.919> down<00:06:38.070> by<00:06:38.220> fourteen<00:06:38.550> percent

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
gone down by fourteen percent

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.150 
gone down by fourteen percent
but<00:06:39.690> I<00:06:39.720> didn't<00:06:40.020> include<00:06:40.200> his<00:06:40.500> value<00:06:40.800> today<00:06:40.920> so

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
but I didn't include his value today so

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.980 
but I didn't include his value today so
it<00:06:41.730> could<00:06:41.850> have<00:06:41.940> gone<00:06:42.030> down<00:06:42.240> even<00:06:42.660> more<00:06:42.690> to

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
it could have gone down even more to

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.440 
it could have gone down even more to
round<00:06:43.200> about<00:06:43.350> eighteen<00:06:43.680> percent<00:06:43.860> so<00:06:44.790> moving

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.450 
round about eighteen percent so moving

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.180 
round about eighteen percent so moving
on<00:06:45.570> how<00:06:46.170> you<00:06:46.230> guys<00:06:46.440> can<00:06:46.650> pick<00:06:46.800> up<00:06:46.920> deals

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
on how you guys can pick up deals

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.130 
on how you guys can pick up deals
because<00:06:47.460> not<00:06:48.210> very<00:06:48.240> many<00:06:48.540> methods<00:06:48.870> will<00:06:49.110> work

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.140 
because not very many methods will work

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.960 
because not very many methods will work
very<00:06:49.290> effectively<00:06:49.770> but<00:06:50.490> I've<00:06:50.550> got<00:06:50.700> one<00:06:50.730> at<00:06:50.910> the
