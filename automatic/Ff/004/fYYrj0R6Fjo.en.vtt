00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
philosophy that I went about was the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.190 
philosophy that I went about was the
same<00:02:59.880> as<00:03:00.030> in<00:03:00.150> recruiting<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.810> recruiting

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
philosophy we're going to go find the

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.850 
philosophy we're going to go find the
best<00:03:02.819> no<00:03:03.000> matter<00:03:03.030> where<00:03:03.390> they<00:03:03.540> are<00:03:03.569> and<00:03:03.870> we

best no matter where they are and we

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.740 
best no matter where they are and we
started<00:03:05.190> with<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.730> being<00:03:06.150> an<00:03:06.269> offensive

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
to look at the other side of the ball

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.240 
to look at the other side of the ball
cuz<00:03:10.170> I<00:03:10.230> didn't<00:03:10.410> want<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.620> have<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:10.799> spend<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.160> lot

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
and running the office I had to make

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.180 
and running the office I had to make
sure<00:03:16.829> that<00:03:17.130> over<00:03:17.549> there<00:03:17.670> we<00:03:17.880> felt<00:03:18.420> good<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.780> so

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
sure that over there we felt good and so

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.170 
sure that over there we felt good and so
we<00:03:20.190> did<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.370> same<00:03:20.549> thing<00:03:20.609> instead<00:03:20.970> of<00:03:21.030> just

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
we did the same thing instead of just

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.759 
we did the same thing instead of just
looking<00:03:21.359> in<00:03:21.600> college<00:03:21.959> or<00:03:22.079> looking<00:03:22.320> at<00:03:22.440> in<00:03:22.650> the

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
looking in college or looking at in the

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.349 
looking in college or looking at in the
conference<00:03:23.220> we<00:03:23.280> went<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:23.549> found<00:03:23.760> what<00:03:24.239> we

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
conference we went and found what we

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.270 
conference we went and found what we
thought<00:03:24.390> was<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.870> best<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.470> best<00:03:25.829> coaching

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
thought was the best the best coaching

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.800 
thought was the best the best coaching
College<00:03:26.430> or<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.760> NFL<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.299> so<00:03:27.600> we<00:03:27.720> were<00:03:27.780> able

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
College or the NFL and so we were able

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.780 
College or the NFL and so we were able
to<00:03:28.019> get<00:03:28.230> him<00:03:28.380> get<00:03:28.950> him<00:03:29.010> locked<00:03:29.220> up<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.640> get<00:03:29.730> him

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
to get him get him locked up and get him

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.910 
to get him get him locked up and get him
tied<00:03:30.030> down<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.329> I<00:03:30.989> guess<00:03:31.380> it<00:03:31.530> helped<00:03:31.739> that<00:03:31.769> he

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
tied down and I guess it helped that he

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.370 
tied down and I guess it helped that he
had<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.100> same<00:03:32.310> like<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:32.760> big<00:03:33.000> yeah<00:03:33.630> but<00:03:34.140> it<00:03:34.260> was

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
had the same like it big yeah but it was

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.750 
had the same like it big yeah but it was
a<00:03:34.410> long<00:03:34.590> recruiting<00:03:35.010> process<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.519> get<00:03:35.640> them

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
a long recruiting process to get them

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.460 
a long recruiting process to get them
but<00:03:36.060> we're<00:03:36.239> real<00:03:36.420> excited<00:03:36.450> about<00:03:36.959> it<00:03:37.140> we<00:03:37.230> think

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
but we're real excited about it we think

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.410 
but we're real excited about it we think
it<00:03:37.560> puts<00:03:37.739> us<00:03:37.890> in<00:03:38.040> position<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.940> have<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.150> great

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
it puts us in position to have a great

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.720 
it puts us in position to have a great
defense<00:03:39.630> on<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.049> field<00:03:40.079> but<00:03:40.500> also<00:03:40.680> once<00:03:41.459> again

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
defense on the field but also once again

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.370 
defense on the field but also once again
I'd<00:03:41.850> can't<00:03:42.420> imagine<00:03:42.780> that<00:03:42.900> there<00:03:43.019> aren't<00:03:43.139> that

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
I'd can't imagine that there aren't that

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.140 
I'd can't imagine that there aren't that
every<00:03:43.709> kid<00:03:43.889> in<00:03:44.069> southeast<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.819> country

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
every kid in southeast and the country

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.460 
every kid in southeast and the country
that's<00:03:45.359> a<00:03:45.420> great<00:03:45.630> defensive<00:03:46.019> player<00:03:46.230> does<00:03:46.440> not

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
that's a great defensive player does not

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.840 
that's a great defensive player does not
have<00:03:46.739> a<00:03:46.769> strong<00:03:47.040> interest<00:03:47.190> in<00:03:47.489> Tennessee

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
have a strong interest in Tennessee

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.449 
have a strong interest in Tennessee
right<00:03:48.030> now<00:03:48.180> now<00:03:48.930> I<00:03:48.959> think<00:03:49.620> people<00:03:50.040> when<00:03:50.370> they

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
right now now I think people when they

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.400 
right now now I think people when they
think<00:03:50.970> about<00:03:51.209> your<00:03:51.540> dad<00:03:51.690> they<00:03:51.810> think<00:03:51.989> NFL

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
think about your dad they think NFL

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.379 
think about your dad they think NFL
lifer<00:03:52.799> but<00:03:53.010> you<00:03:53.250> know<00:03:53.340> he<00:03:53.459> spent<00:03:53.760> what<00:03:53.910> 10<00:03:54.060> 11

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
lifer but you know he spent what 10 11

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:55.640 
lifer but you know he spent what 10 11
years<00:03:54.540> in<00:03:54.600> Nebraska<00:03:55.170> three<00:03:55.380> years<00:03:55.560> at

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
years in Nebraska three years at

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.800 
years in Nebraska three years at
Arkansas<00:03:56.130> was<00:03:56.609> the<00:03:56.730> head<00:03:56.880> coach<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:57.269> NC<00:03:57.540> State

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
Arkansas was the head coach to NC State

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.780 
Arkansas was the head coach to NC State
I<00:03:57.840> think<00:03:58.109> for<00:03:58.260> three<00:03:58.500> seasons<00:03:58.739> so<00:03:59.130> he<00:03:59.579> does

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
I think for three seasons so he does

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.699 
I think for three seasons so he does
have<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.030> college<00:04:00.569> experience<00:04:01.079> to<00:04:01.200> go<00:04:01.319> along

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
have that college experience to go along

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.280 
have that college experience to go along
with<00:04:01.859> like<00:04:02.040> 26<00:04:02.549> seasons<00:04:02.850> in<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.209> NFL<00:04:03.450> what<00:04:04.230> are

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
with like 26 seasons in the NFL what are

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.990 
with like 26 seasons in the NFL what are
you<00:04:04.350> guys<00:04:04.500> going<00:04:04.799> to<00:04:04.829> do<00:04:05.040> defensively<00:04:05.489> is<00:04:05.880> he

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
you guys going to do defensively is he

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.849 
you guys going to do defensively is he
going<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.209> have<00:04:06.329> to<00:04:06.480> kind<00:04:06.660> of<00:04:06.720> tone<00:04:07.500> it<00:04:07.650> down<00:04:07.680> a

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
going to have to kind of tone it down a

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.440 
going to have to kind of tone it down a
little<00:04:07.950> bit<00:04:08.220> because<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:08.579> the<00:04:08.790> sophistication

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
little bit because of the sophistication

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.690 
little bit because of the sophistication
of<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.720> of<00:04:09.900> his<00:04:10.049> pro<00:04:10.260> defense<00:04:10.680> yo<00:04:11.280> I<00:04:11.340> think<00:04:11.459> I

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
of the of his pro defense yo I think I

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.160 
of the of his pro defense yo I think I
think<00:04:11.910> first<00:04:12.090> of<00:04:12.239> all<00:04:12.389> it<00:04:12.480> was<00:04:12.569> very<00:04:12.780> important

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
think first of all it was very important

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.199 
think first of all it was very important
not<00:04:13.200> to<00:04:13.380> get<00:04:13.680> an<00:04:13.859> NFL<00:04:14.340> coach<00:04:14.549> that<00:04:14.850> just

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
not to get an NFL coach that just

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.909 
not to get an NFL coach that just
because<00:04:15.480> they<00:04:15.600> came<00:04:15.750> from<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:15.989> NFL<00:04:16.169> this<00:04:16.739> is

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
because they came from the NFL this is

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.080 
because they came from the NFL this is
somebody<00:04:17.190> who's<00:04:17.310> had<00:04:17.489> great<00:04:17.700> success<00:04:18.060> in

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
somebody who's had great success in

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.520 
somebody who's had great success in
college<00:04:18.419> one<00:04:18.810> a<00:04:18.840> couple<00:04:19.169> of<00:04:19.229> national

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530

championships why was that Nebraska

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.960
