00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.100
 23 million things 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:17.740
 all of them so that these of them 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:22.150
 this is from these of this this afternoon 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.150
 and all those things that are hers 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.400
 and all those things have to put them 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.560
 here that I am full 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.560
 no matter they want to buy other 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.690
 Y 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.080
 well yes obviously but we left 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.410
 is done 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.660
 the suitcase of Cordoba and friends does not weigh 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.660
 too 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.960
 and I'm missing many things all this from 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.470
 that 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.470
 or 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.420
 I say that the handle is not going to close the 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.050
 from Cordoba primo a greeting cousin says 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.220
 that if he took a plane for us we're going 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.220
 you always come 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.060
 an airplane for the rich 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.050
 A bar 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.600
 to greater 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.600
 almost 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.620
 but buying a suitcase 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:00.010
 and now let's make my suitcase 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.780
 soon 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.780
 How beautiful you see my love 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.790
 the suitcase 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.239
 pure makeup 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.690
 that makeup suitcase the clothes 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.010
 but not 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.640
 where the things that you do not want 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.480
 they see so many things 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.480
 direct 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.819
 hydrating creams 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:00.650
 because the most important of all 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.930
 holes then we're getting like 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.230
 the big things and then the 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.230
 little girls 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:15.960
 squeeze and and of course roll up though 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:19.680
 in another video of mowing his shirt has not 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.680
 been less 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.409
 As I told you, the most important thing is 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.299
 take advantage of the space then what if 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:29.769
 have these glasses then I'm 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.769
 filling accessories because 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.330
 and this 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.870
 of the 20 creams of why I understand 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.810
 two 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:05.670
 shit 4 and 5 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.670
 and all that cost me less than cream 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.389
 Y 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:29.590
 I did not 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.700
 in all things a double 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.819
 for the box 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.580
 that obsessive object with the stars 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.130
 6 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.370
 Look 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:14.070
 well we achieved the impossible and I liked it 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.070
 in the bed 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.070
 and yes 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.620
 now ironically after so much 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:33.449
 try to put things in the suitcase 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.449
 let's buy another suitcase 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.640
 and we found the suitcase can 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.630
 find it as very familiar to another 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.630
 suitcase that you have seen before 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.560
 we are prepared to buy food 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:58.580
 junk and you talk to him he does not understand if 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.580
 you put our
