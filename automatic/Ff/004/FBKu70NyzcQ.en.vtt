 Stock exchanges can install as 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.429
 first you go on the side 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.900
 the bottom of the description is in it 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.150
 and let you down when it's down 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.779
 is now get on then come on 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.439
 window then you go here on the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.619
 version 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.740
 you can also 6/14 of all there's yet 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.290
 not so much i mean 1.455 then 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.380
 can be found here a few mods then click 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.649
 the twelve years and I'll take it now 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.239
 such a few standard poor's and then 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.239
 do you get here to change version 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:01:05.910
 completed successful and has finished loading 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:08.600
 does her new one scream some and if 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.600
 be inside you there 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.560
 are you the only player I have the 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.560
 world is already created 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.610
 that is how it works 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:31.209
 so you have to mini items it hangs 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.610
 really it's not like you then 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:38.830
 you can see singleplayer here now 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:41.760
 comments and if I now only yellow 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:47.760
 presses options 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:53.080
 There is also taxation here 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:58.120
 So for so I'm doing now if 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:00.940
 deep and that too is really almost 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.340
 every computer almost does not work 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:08.190
 He can be supported like many 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.810
 make others and it is very funny 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.799
 because then you change the version of it 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.690
 you can then, for example, often receives 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:22.890
 the version can go 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:28.049
 here below for example alfalfa 1.1 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:31.980
 Conversion end changed 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.980
 you you go minecraft 1 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:44.260
 that is really the oldest so it 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:49.569
 There is an older one but there it is 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:04:02.860
 then it was with me then and that 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:04:06.489

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:10.560
