00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
bedbugs yeah well what I was thinking is

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.140 
bedbugs yeah well what I was thinking is
we<00:02:18.980> could<00:02:19.010> we<00:02:19.400> could<00:02:19.520> write<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.700> speculative

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
we could we could write a speculative

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.240 
we could we could write a speculative
fix<00:02:20.540> for<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:20.900> but<00:02:21.170> hey<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.470> change<00:02:21.770> because<00:02:22.040> all

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.580 
got to fix bugs and us are really really
important<00:02:28.580> because<00:02:29.120> every<00:02:30.110> time<00:02:30.140> we<00:02:30.260> fix<00:02:30.500> a

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
important because every time we fix a

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.680 
important because every time we fix a
bug<00:02:30.770> you<00:02:31.130> enter<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.670> possibility<00:02:32.270> of<00:02:32.300> causing

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
bug you enter the possibility of causing

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.350 
bug you enter the possibility of causing
another<00:02:33.050> bug<00:02:33.290> so<00:02:34.100> try<00:02:34.490> not<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.760> destabilize

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
another bug so try not to destabilize

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.150 
another bug so try not to destabilize
code<00:02:35.660> like<00:02:35.870> that<00:02:36.050> now<00:02:36.380> you<00:02:36.440> pointed<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.040> out

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
code like that now you pointed it out

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.820 
code like that now you pointed it out
now<00:02:37.370> I<00:02:37.400> know<00:02:38.200> they're<00:02:39.200> really<00:02:39.380> important<00:02:39.740> we

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
now I know they're really important we

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:40.930 
now I know they're really important we
fix<00:02:40.040> them<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.220> then<00:02:40.370> we've<00:02:40.490> checked<00:02:40.700> just

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
fix them and then we've checked just

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.370 
fix them and then we've checked just
that<00:02:41.060> area<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.420> lot<00:02:41.600> we<00:02:41.840> can<00:02:41.960> leave<00:02:42.110> it<00:02:42.200> on<00:02:42.260> the
