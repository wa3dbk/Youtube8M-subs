what<00:00:19.340> were<00:00:19.430> the<00:00:19.520> particular<00:00:19.760> highlights<00:00:20.240> for

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
what were the particular highlights for

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.490 
what were the particular highlights for
you<00:00:20.480> in<00:00:20.630> terms<00:00:20.780> of<00:00:20.930> where<00:00:21.110> you<00:00:21.230> felt<00:00:21.440> you

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
you in terms of where you felt you

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.470 
you in terms of where you felt you
really<00:00:21.830> got<00:00:21.980> the<00:00:22.100> advantage<00:00:22.340> I<00:00:22.760> think<00:00:23.270> one<00:00:23.390> of

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
really got the advantage I think one of

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.870 
really got the advantage I think one of
the<00:00:23.540> key<00:00:23.750> things<00:00:24.020> for<00:00:24.110> us<00:00:24.320> was<00:00:24.640> being<00:00:25.640> able<00:00:25.730> to

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
the key things for us was being able to

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.850 
the key things for us was being able to
stay<00:00:26.119> in<00:00:26.240> touch<00:00:26.420> the<00:00:26.660> first<00:00:26.930> the<00:00:27.349> first<00:00:27.619> night

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
stay in touch the first the first night

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.830 
stay in touch the first the first night
which<00:00:28.130> was<00:00:28.340> heavy<00:00:28.910> heavy<00:00:29.000> air<00:00:29.540> up<00:00:29.660> wind

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
which was heavy heavy air up wind

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.060 
which was heavy heavy air up wind
conditions<00:00:30.349> which<00:00:30.560> we<00:00:30.740> thought<00:00:30.920> they<00:00:31.040> might

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
conditions which we thought they might

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.340 
conditions which we thought they might
get<00:00:31.400> away<00:00:31.580> but<00:00:31.700> there<00:00:32.660> was<00:00:32.870> perhaps<00:00:33.020> it<00:00:33.260> was

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
get away but there was perhaps it was

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.110 
get away but there was perhaps it was
rough<00:00:33.559> enough<00:00:33.800> that<00:00:34.070> you<00:00:34.520> know<00:00:34.640> both<00:00:34.820> boats

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
rough enough that you know both boats

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.299 
rough enough that you know both boats
had<00:00:35.300> to<00:00:35.420> slow<00:00:35.660> down<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:36.140> manage<00:00:36.650> looking

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
had to slow down and manage looking

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.310 
had to slow down and manage looking
after<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:37.699> boat<00:00:37.850> so<00:00:38.120> we<00:00:38.150> came<00:00:38.989> out<00:00:39.170> of<00:00:39.199> that

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
after the boat so we came out of that

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.290 
after the boat so we came out of that
sort<00:00:39.980> of<00:00:40.010> in<00:00:40.160> touch<00:00:40.370> with<00:00:40.670> them<00:00:40.850> and<00:00:41.090> then<00:00:41.180> we

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
sort of in touch with them and then we

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.850 
sort of in touch with them and then we
got<00:00:41.480> some<00:00:41.720> light<00:00:41.930> air<00:00:42.170> where<00:00:42.440> this<00:00:42.559> boats

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
got some light air where this boats

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.780 
got some light air where this boats
really<00:00:43.220> strong<00:00:43.550> and<00:00:44.590> managed<00:00:45.590> to<00:00:45.739> get<00:00:46.489> past

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
really strong and managed to get past

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.520 
really strong and managed to get past
them<00:00:47.030> and<00:00:47.180> wriggle<00:00:47.720> away<00:00:47.809> a<00:00:47.960> little<00:00:48.170> bit<00:00:48.290> and

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
them and wriggle away a little bit and

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.810 
them and wriggle away a little bit and
then<00:00:48.650> it<00:00:48.739> was<00:00:48.860> just<00:00:48.890> a<00:00:49.190> little<00:00:49.370> bit<00:00:49.519> of<00:00:49.640> rich

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
then it was just a little bit of rich

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.700 
then it was just a little bit of rich
get<00:00:50.059> richer<00:00:50.420> as<00:00:50.540> we<00:00:50.690> fed<00:00:50.989> into<00:00:51.199> the<00:00:51.290> new<00:00:51.440> breeze

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
get richer as we fed into the new breeze

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.280 
get richer as we fed into the new breeze
and<00:00:52.150> got<00:00:53.150> enough<00:00:53.390> of<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.600> lead<00:00:53.780> to<00:00:53.960> hold<00:00:54.140> them

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
and got enough of the lead to hold them

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.729 
and got enough of the lead to hold them
off

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
off

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.090 
off
I<00:00:54.769> always<00:00:55.460> nerve-wracking<00:00:56.299> approaching

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
I always nerve-wracking approaching

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.590 
I always nerve-wracking approaching
Tasman<00:00:58.100> Island<00:00:58.430> at<00:00:58.519> that<00:00:58.640> time<00:00:58.879> of<00:00:59.030> day<00:00:59.059> not

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
Tasman Island at that time of day not

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.060 
Tasman Island at that time of day not
knowing<00:00:59.809> where<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.080> sea<00:01:00.290> breeze<00:01:00.530> is<00:01:00.739> going<00:01:00.860> to

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
knowing where the sea breeze is going to

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.829 
knowing where the sea breeze is going to
fill<00:01:01.280> in<00:01:01.460> nicely<00:01:01.699> or<00:01:02.089> whether<00:01:02.269> we<00:01:02.360> have<00:01:02.510> a<00:01:02.540> park

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
fill in nicely or whether we have a park

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.590 
fill in nicely or whether we have a park
up<00:01:03.049> there<00:01:03.080> so<00:01:03.470> we're<00:01:03.619> certainly<00:01:03.830> worried<00:01:04.640> but

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
up there so we're certainly worried but

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.149 
up there so we're certainly worried but
you<00:01:06.020> know<00:01:06.140> when<00:01:06.320> we<00:01:06.409> saw<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.619> sea<00:01:06.830> breeze<00:01:07.010> had

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
you know when we saw the sea breeze had

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:08.649 
you know when we saw the sea breeze had
Phil<00:01:07.369> down<00:01:07.490> all<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:07.820> way<00:01:07.909> to<00:01:07.940> Hobart<00:01:08.450> we

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
Phil down all the way to Hobart we

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.120 
Phil down all the way to Hobart we
thought<00:01:08.869> you<00:01:09.049> know<00:01:09.170> only<00:01:09.320> a<00:01:09.440> major<00:01:09.680> calamity

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
thought you know only a major calamity

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.430 
thought you know only a major calamity
will<00:01:10.460> stop<00:01:10.700> at<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:11.090> inside<00:01:11.450> and<00:01:11.750> given<00:01:12.229> that<00:01:12.320> I

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
will stop at the inside and given that I

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.050 
will stop at the inside and given that I
gather<00:01:12.650> it<00:01:12.799> was<00:01:12.920> really<00:01:13.280> bumpy<00:01:13.460> you<00:01:13.610> know<00:01:13.820> in

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
gather it was really bumpy you know in

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.550 
gather it was really bumpy you know in
close<00:01:14.330> to<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:14.540> coast<00:01:14.780> on<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.110> first<00:01:15.290> night

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
close to the coast on the first night

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.679 
close to the coast on the first night
there<00:01:15.909> just<00:01:16.909> as<00:01:17.000> well<00:01:17.119> you<00:01:17.210> fix<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.510> gooseneck

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
there just as well you fix the gooseneck

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.810 
there just as well you fix the gooseneck
I<00:01:17.990> guess<00:01:18.170> oh<00:01:18.439> that's<00:01:18.740> right<00:01:19.220> it<00:01:19.400> was<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:19.670> know

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
I guess oh that's right it was you know

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.700 
I guess oh that's right it was you know
it<00:01:19.880> was<00:01:20.030> it<00:01:20.479> was<00:01:20.540> pretty<00:01:20.810> fortunate<00:01:21.170> that<00:01:21.560> it

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
what more could you do to this thing to

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.550 
what more could you do to this thing to
get<00:01:40.520> it<00:01:40.580> faster<00:01:41.300> we've<00:01:41.960> still<00:01:42.230> got<00:01:42.380> a<00:01:42.410> few

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
get it faster we've still got a few

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.110 
get it faster we've still got a few
tricks<00:01:42.620> up<00:01:43.040> our<00:01:43.160> sleeve<00:01:43.430> so<00:01:43.700> we'll<00:01:43.820> see<00:01:44.000> what

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
tricks up our sleeve so we'll see what

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.030
