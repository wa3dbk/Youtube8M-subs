now<00:00:59.129> my<00:00:59.280> strategy<00:00:59.550> for<00:00:59.969> doing<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.329> if<00:01:00.539> you're

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
now my strategy for doing this if you're

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.510 
now my strategy for doing this if you're
a<00:01:00.719> somewhat<00:01:01.140> low<00:01:01.260> level<00:01:01.620> such<00:01:01.859> as<00:01:02.010> myself<00:01:02.190> at

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
a somewhat low level such as myself at

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.520 
a somewhat low level such as myself at
the<00:01:02.579> time<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.539> deal<00:01:03.750> damage<00:01:04.049> and

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the time is to deal damage and

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.250 
the time is to deal damage and
especially<00:01:05.250> use<00:01:05.970> what<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.210> just<00:01:06.510> did<00:01:06.720> marked

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
especially use what I just did marked

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.789 
especially use what I just did marked
for<00:01:07.409> death

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
for death

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.620 
for death
very<00:01:08.130> good<00:01:08.400> shout<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.850> use<00:01:09.030> against<00:01:09.330> bosses

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
very good shout to use against bosses

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.750 
very good shout to use against bosses
what<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.080> does<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.560> slowly<00:01:10.830> drains<00:01:11.340> them<00:01:11.610> of

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
what it does is it slowly drains them of

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.080 
what it does is it slowly drains them of
health<00:01:12.439> the<00:01:13.439> more<00:01:13.950> upgrade<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
health the more upgrade it is and the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.820 
health the more upgrade it is and the
more<00:01:15.270> words<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.689> have<00:01:15.869> clearly<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.530> better

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
more words you have clearly the better

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.249 
more words you have clearly the better
and<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.970> more<00:01:18.119> damage<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.720> deals<00:01:18.960> for<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
and the more damage it deals for the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.870 
and the more damage it deals for the
longer<00:01:19.619> period<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.950> time<00:01:20.189> or<00:01:20.340> whatever<00:01:20.610> I

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
longer period of time or whatever I

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.240 
longer period of time or whatever I
really<00:01:21.810> like<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.470> what<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:22.920> do<00:01:23.070> is

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
really like that so what you can do is

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.980 
really like that so what you can do is
you<00:01:23.400> can<00:01:23.549> hit<00:01:23.670> him<00:01:23.790> with<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.119> let's<00:01:24.630> say<00:01:24.750> it's

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
you can hit him with that let's say it's

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.359 
you can hit him with that let's say it's
you<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.259> face<00:01:25.439> with<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> shard<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.250> ice
