00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.970
 los angeles clippers for that 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.949
 generation with lamar odon quentin 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.509
 richardson and darjus mails among others 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.750
 michael jordan who was the one who 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.669
 I hooked up that there are many the nba there 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.269
 times that is punctured in bone there is one of 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:38.280
 Orlando magic gray or ugly the Houston 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:41.660
 rockets that they had like a rocket in the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.660
 chest I did not like it much either 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.510
 and the one of denver of multicolor because 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.579
 last in which jordan wins a ring 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.879
 against me carvings with that release 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.950
 as he passed his hand and got up he did 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.129
 silence comes out and if you find out then 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.930
 I remember one with three extensions a 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.239
 chicago bulls boston celtics I think that 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.850
 it was my second season that on channel + and 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.350
 I remember it with a lot of love because I 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.960
 I had a great time it was very long very 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.200
 intense and then I remember one 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.960
 especially that it's a lakers san 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.460
 antonio spurs in which the player of 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.740
 Western conference final in which the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.000
 lakers win and pau gasol becomes 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.410
 the first Spanish player to play a 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.990
 final and then lose in front of boston 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.970
 celtics but there I was already the one that most 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.670
 has impacted in recent years the 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.869
 griffin by that physical domain or lebron 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.820
 James for that physical domain and 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.860
 technical but obviously always 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.619
 will be to jordan and of course 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.890
 on top of all visually it was 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.810
 shaquille o'neal that is immense 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.340
 I am more a team player I would give it 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.370
 but if there's little time left I'll throw it 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.159
 2000 is about cowards and the biggest 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.500
 world show for health the 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.700
 conference this for passion the 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.790
 west conference 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.000
 would be jordan always jordan shaquille 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.000
 o'neal 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.280
 larry green 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.390
 iverson chris webber team give here I do not know 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.390
 but there is always order 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.950
 to
