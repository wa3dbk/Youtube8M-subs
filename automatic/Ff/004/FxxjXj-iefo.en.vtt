00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
been looking at right now we replace

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.310 
been looking at right now we replace
replace<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.639> statue<00:00:14.910> figure<00:00:15.360> with<00:00:15.540> better

replace the statue figure with better

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.529

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
hall and I'll talk about this for a

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.220 
hall and I'll talk about this for a
second<00:05:06.460> here<00:05:06.640> so<00:05:07.300> the<00:05:07.540> back<00:05:07.690> of<00:05:07.840> town<00:05:08.020> hall

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
second here so the back of town hall

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.880 
second here so the back of town hall
over<00:05:08.560> here<00:05:09.720> we<00:05:10.720> can't<00:05:10.990> really<00:05:11.230> do<00:05:11.380> an<00:05:11.500> inside

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
over here we can't really do an inside

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.530 
over here we can't really do an inside
because<00:05:12.280> it's<00:05:12.430> just<00:05:12.490> not<00:05:12.760> feasible<00:05:12.970> and<00:05:13.360> weak

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
because it's just not feasible and weak

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.180 
because it's just not feasible and weak
or<00:05:13.840> we're<00:05:14.260> starting<00:05:14.560> to<00:05:14.620> run<00:05:14.800> pretty<00:05:15.010> low<00:05:15.160> on

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
or we're starting to run pretty low on

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.340 
or we're starting to run pretty low on
pieces<00:05:15.669> so<00:05:15.850> that's<00:05:16.030> not<00:05:16.870> always<00:05:17.020> the<00:05:17.110> best

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
pieces so that's not always the best

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.810 
pieces so that's not always the best
thing<00:05:17.500> but<00:05:17.860> what<00:05:18.040> we're<00:05:18.190> gonna<00:05:18.280> do<00:05:18.550> is<00:05:18.730> we're

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
thing but what we're gonna do is we're

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.730 
thing but what we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:05:18.910> have<00:05:19.120> a<00:05:19.150> motif<00:05:19.540> sort<00:05:19.930> of<00:05:20.020> thing<00:05:20.169> so<00:05:20.680> you

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
gonna have a motif sort of thing so you

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.980 
gonna have a motif sort of thing so you
can<00:05:20.919> see<00:05:21.070> the<00:05:21.190> mayor<00:05:21.400> and<00:05:21.730> his<00:05:21.760> a<00:05:21.970> little<00:05:22.720> desk

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
it's the back of it so that's what we're

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.230 
it's the back of it so that's what we're
going<00:05:26.680> to<00:05:26.770> do<00:05:26.860> there<00:05:27.040> good<00:05:27.850> idea<00:05:28.060> we'll<00:05:28.210> have

going to do there good idea we'll have
some<00:05:28.570> sort<00:05:28.750> of<00:05:28.840> inside<00:05:29.169> to<00:05:29.350> it<00:05:29.470> that<00:05:29.770> means<00:05:29.950> we

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
some sort of inside to it that means we

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.670 
some sort of inside to it that means we
also<00:05:30.190> have<00:05:30.370> to<00:05:30.460> create<00:05:30.640> a<00:05:30.729> mayor<00:05:30.970> figure<00:05:31.360> and<00:05:31.680> I

rebuild<00:05:43.300> it<00:05:43.510> so<00:05:43.860> what<00:05:44.860> it's<00:05:45.010> sort<00:05:45.280> of<00:05:45.400> like<00:05:45.520> is

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
rebuild it so what it's sort of like is

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.130 
rebuild it so what it's sort of like is
it's<00:05:45.940> going<00:05:46.030> to<00:05:46.090> be<00:05:46.240> a<00:05:46.270> more<00:05:46.870> high-end

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
it's going to be a more high-end

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.500 
it's going to be a more high-end
boutique<00:05:47.740> type<00:05:47.979> store<00:05:48.340> and<00:05:48.580> I<00:05:49.120> think<00:05:49.390> it's

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
boutique type store and I think it's

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.940 
boutique type store and I think it's
going<00:05:49.630> to<00:05:49.690> have<00:05:49.810> two<00:05:49.960> levels<00:05:50.320> we<00:05:50.440> just<00:05:50.620> haven't

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
going to have two levels we just haven't

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.730 
going to have two levels we just haven't
really<00:05:51.460> got<00:05:51.700> to<00:05:51.850> that<00:05:51.970> yet<00:05:52.000> so<00:05:52.320> the<00:05:53.320> start<00:05:53.620> of

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
really got to that yet so the start of

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.130 
really got to that yet so the start of
it<00:05:53.800> is<00:05:53.950> here<00:05:54.190> there's<00:05:54.400> the<00:05:54.520> walkway<00:05:54.910> up<00:05:55.140> sides

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
it is here there's the walkway up sides

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.800 
it is here there's the walkway up sides
and<00:05:56.880> we're<00:05:57.880> going<00:05:58.000> to<00:05:58.030> make<00:05:58.120> it<00:05:58.300> fancier<00:05:58.690> on

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
and we're going to make it fancier on

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.150 
and we're going to make it fancier on
the<00:05:58.900> bottom<00:05:59.169> here<00:05:59.290> we<00:05:59.410> just<00:05:59.500> haven't<00:05:59.770> it's

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
the bottom here we just haven't it's

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.800 
the bottom here we just haven't it's
it's<00:06:00.400> just<00:06:00.520> started<00:06:01.030> like<00:06:01.180> the<00:06:01.270> past<00:06:01.479> two<00:06:01.660> days

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
it's just started like the past two days

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.020 
it's just started like the past two days
so<00:06:01.990> we<00:06:02.350> finally<00:06:03.010> got<00:06:03.100> an<00:06:03.220> idea<00:06:03.460> for<00:06:03.520> there<00:06:03.790> were

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
so we finally got an idea for there were

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.330 
so we finally got an idea for there were
working<00:06:04.540> on<00:06:04.660> it<00:06:04.810> so<00:06:05.020> good<00:06:05.800> for<00:06:05.950> that<00:06:06.100> place
