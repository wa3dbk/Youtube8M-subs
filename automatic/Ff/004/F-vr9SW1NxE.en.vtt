going to show you guys that right now
and<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> best<00:00:54.149> way<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.390> install<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.840> is

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
and so the best way to install this is

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.260 
and so the best way to install this is
to<00:00:55.170> start<00:00:55.440> with<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.860> bottom<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:57.149> bottom

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
to start with the bottom the bottom

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.150 
to start with the bottom the bottom
front<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.109> want<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.379> go<00:00:58.649> ahead<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.039> it

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
front so you want to go ahead and do it

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.630 
front so you want to go ahead and do it
like<00:00:59.280> this<00:01:00.289> and<00:01:01.289> then<00:01:01.680> pull<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:02.070> on<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
like this and then pull up on the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.270 
like this and then pull up on the
plastic<00:01:03.420> around<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.439> top<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.680> then<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> rest

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
plastic around the top and then the rest

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.710 
plastic around the top and then the rest
of<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.519> device<00:01:05.760> should<00:01:05.790> snap<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.390> place<00:01:06.540> no

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
of the device should snap and place no

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.109 
of the device should snap and place no
problem<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:08.159> it's<00:01:08.310> really<00:01:08.430> starting<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.939> there

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
problem so it's really starting in there

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.840 
problem so it's really starting in there
this<00:01:09.810> device<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> perfect<00:01:11.159> mold<00:01:11.369> so

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
this device is this is a perfect mold so

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.760 
this device is this is a perfect mold so
you<00:01:12.810> don't<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.110> worry<00:01:13.229> about<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.530> moving

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
you don't have to worry about it moving

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.870 
you don't have to worry about it moving
around<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.189> there<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.430> don't<00:01:14.520> have<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.760> worry

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
around in there you don't have to worry

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.780 
around in there you don't have to worry
about<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.210> accidentally<00:01:15.900> coming<00:01:16.140> off<00:01:16.790> and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
about it accidentally coming off and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.130 
about it accidentally coming off and
then<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.030> reason<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.570> had<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.720> install<00:01:19.080> it

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
then the reason we had to install it

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.420 
then the reason we had to install it
from<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> front<00:01:19.530> as<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.770> can<00:01:19.890> see<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
from the front as you can see that the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.580 
from the front as you can see that the
back<00:01:20.640> has<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.150> it's<00:01:21.689> really<00:01:21.869> tapered<00:01:22.380> over

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
back has this it's really tapered over

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.760 
back has this it's really tapered over
there<00:01:22.770> down<00:01:23.549> on<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:23.970> back<00:01:24.299> top<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.530> sides

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
there down on the back top and the sides

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.429 
there down on the back top and the sides
and<00:01:26.220> even<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.610> bottom<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.119> i<00:01:27.390> think<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.110> front

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
and even the bottom so i think the front

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.080 
and even the bottom so i think the front
is<00:01:28.590> actually<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.009> only<00:01:29.189> possible<00:01:29.880> way<00:01:30.060> to

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
is actually the only possible way to

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.090 
is actually the only possible way to
install<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.170> thing<00:01:31.380> without<00:01:31.619> breaking<00:01:32.009> it

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
install this thing without breaking it

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.420 
install this thing without breaking it
so<00:01:32.820> anyway<00:01:33.090> we<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.720> here<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.560> just<00:01:34.979> I'm

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
so anyway we have it on here it just I'm

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.069 
so anyway we have it on here it just I'm
not<00:01:35.610> sure<00:01:35.790> how<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.329> going<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.659> protect<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
not sure how it's going to protect the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.170 
not sure how it's going to protect the
phone<00:01:37.290> yet<00:01:37.530> obviously<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.430> haven't<00:01:38.700> dropped<00:01:38.970> it

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
phone yet obviously I haven't dropped it

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.990 
phone yet obviously I haven't dropped it
and<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.360> don't<00:01:39.540> want<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.979> but<00:01:40.979> from<00:01:41.759> what<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.909> can

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
and I don't want to but from what I can
