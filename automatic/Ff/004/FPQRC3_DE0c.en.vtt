00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.000
I kept speaking to myself, looking at your photo

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.480
you can ask the breeze

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.920
I found peace sketching your face in the sky

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.920
you can ask the earth

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.420
My heart keeps on singing please let it sing

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.960
in your way

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.120
I get happy as the moment passes

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.860
Is this love.....?

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.900
Is this love.....?

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.920
I became lost in the depth of your eyes

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.580
I lost myself in your thoughts

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.480
So lost in you thoughts, I don't even know where I am

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.840
you can ask my heart

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.080
My heart keeps on singing please let it sing

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.120
in your way

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.440
I get happy as the moment passes

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.600
Is this love....?

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.440
Is this love....?

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.600
Is this love....?

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.280
Is this love....?

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:17.120
Is this love....?

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.840
Is this love....?

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.400
Is this love....?

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:38.080
Is this love....?
