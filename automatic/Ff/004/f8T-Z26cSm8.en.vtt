tank what I've decided to do is I've

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.440 
tank what I've decided to do is I've
gone<00:00:07.140> back<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:08.130> secondary<00:00:08.880> fish<00:00:09.179> tank

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
gone back to a secondary fish tank

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.160 
gone back to a secondary fish tank
that's<00:00:09.719> going<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:09.960> drain<00:00:10.320> into<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:11.309> sump<00:00:11.910> tank

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
that's going to drain into the sump tank

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.600 
that's going to drain into the sump tank
you<00:00:13.170> see<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.500> on<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.650> lot<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.860> systems<00:00:14.070> and

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
you see this on a lot of systems and

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.960 
you see this on a lot of systems and
when<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:14.880> initially<00:00:15.120> setup<00:00:15.570> my<00:00:15.839> system<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:17.039> kind

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
when I initially setup my system I kind

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.160 
when I initially setup my system I kind
of<00:00:18.000> dabbled<00:00:18.330> with<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.600> but<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.779> thought<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.020> was

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
of dabbled with it but I thought it was

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.420 
of dabbled with it but I thought it was
more<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.619> pain<00:00:19.859> than<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.160> was<00:00:20.279> worth

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
more of a pain than it was worth

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.980 
more of a pain than it was worth
considering<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.029> was<00:00:21.060> using<00:00:21.300> Rubbermaid<00:00:21.750> totes

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
considering I was using Rubbermaid totes

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.200 
considering I was using Rubbermaid totes
for<00:00:22.320> fish<00:00:22.470> tanks<00:00:22.769> at<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.890> time<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.970> didn't

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
for fish tanks at the time and I didn't

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.429 
for fish tanks at the time and I didn't
really<00:00:24.330> think<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.810> allowed<00:00:25.019> my<00:00:25.230> fish

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
really think that it allowed my fish

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.710 
really think that it allowed my fish
quite<00:00:25.710> enough<00:00:25.980> for<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.430> roam<00:00:26.670> if<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.539> look

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
quite enough for you to roam if you look

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.179 
quite enough for you to roam if you look
at<00:00:27.810> my<00:00:27.960> old<00:00:28.109> video<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.650> I'll<00:00:28.740> try<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.070> put<00:00:29.160> a

we've<00:03:35.320> got<00:03:35.500> that<00:03:35.530> nice<00:03:35.770> and<00:03:35.980> tight<00:03:36.040> you<00:03:36.490> can

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
we've got that nice and tight you can

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.260 
we've got that nice and tight you can
see<00:03:38.160> we've<00:03:39.160> got<00:03:39.250> a<00:03:39.310> pretty<00:03:39.490> decent<00:03:39.580> seal<00:03:40.060> there

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
see we've got a pretty decent seal there

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.600 
see we've got a pretty decent seal there
and<00:03:40.560> if<00:03:41.560> I<00:03:41.650> do<00:03:41.710> end<00:03:41.920> up<00:03:42.040> having<00:03:42.100> a<00:03:42.370> little<00:03:42.550> bit

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
and if I do end up having a little bit

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.010 
and if I do end up having a little bit
of<00:03:42.670> a<00:03:42.790> leak<00:03:42.940> I<00:03:43.120> can<00:03:43.330> always<00:03:43.450> find<00:03:43.690> a<00:03:43.870> pipe

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
of a leak I can always find a pipe

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.130 
of a leak I can always find a pipe
wrench<00:03:45.330> shouldn't<00:03:46.330> eat<00:03:46.450> it<00:03:46.480> though<00:03:46.720> haven't

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
wrench shouldn't eat it though haven't

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.680 
wrench shouldn't eat it though haven't
needed<00:03:47.230> it<00:03:47.500> on<00:03:47.650> most<00:03:48.340> of<00:03:48.520> these<00:03:48.670> so<00:03:49.390> I'll<00:03:49.570> be

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
needed it on most of these so I'll be

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.180 
needed it on most of these so I'll be
really<00:03:49.930> surprised<00:03:50.260> if<00:03:50.410> I<00:03:50.560> do<00:03:50.620> need<00:03:50.830> it<00:03:50.980> on<00:03:51.070> this

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
really surprised if I do need it on this

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.250 
really surprised if I do need it on this
one<00:03:51.340> I<00:03:51.730> think<00:03:52.330> it's<00:03:52.510> just<00:03:52.630> giving<00:03:53.020> me<00:03:53.140> attitude

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
one I think it's just giving me attitude

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.050 
one I think it's just giving me attitude
because<00:03:53.739> it's<00:03:53.890> cold<00:03:56.550> all<00:03:57.550> right<00:03:57.670> so<00:03:57.820> when<00:03:57.970> we

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
because it's cold all right so when we

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.220 
because it's cold all right so when we
brought<00:03:58.209> this<00:03:58.390> home<00:03:58.600> from<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:58.840> store<00:03:59.020> we

brought this home from the store we

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.300 
brought this home from the store we
discovered<00:03:59.650> it's<00:03:59.770> got<00:03:59.860> a<00:03:59.890> whole<00:04:00.040> bunch<00:04:00.070> of

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
discovered it's got a whole bunch of

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.310 
discovered it's got a whole bunch of
glitter<00:04:00.520> finish<00:04:00.700> and<00:04:01.000> stuff<00:04:01.180> inside<00:04:01.360> of<00:04:01.570> it<00:04:01.750> so

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
I'm gonna have to give this a quick bath

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.880 
I'm gonna have to give this a quick bath
before<00:04:04.330> I<00:04:04.360> put<00:04:04.600> my<00:04:04.630> fish<00:04:04.989> anywhere<00:04:05.530> near<00:04:05.770> it

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
before I put my fish anywhere near it

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.890 
before I put my fish anywhere near it
and<00:04:06.010> I'm<00:04:06.910> not<00:04:07.030> gonna<00:04:07.209> waste<00:04:07.390> your<00:04:07.570> time<00:04:07.750> with

that so we'll get back once I'm a little

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.729 
that so we'll get back once I'm a little

I've done and what I'm doing so here you
can<00:04:15.040> see<00:04:15.220> just<00:04:15.370> how<00:04:15.489> basic<00:04:15.970> that<00:04:16.150> drain<00:04:16.419> is

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
can see just how basic that drain is

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.099 
can see just how basic that drain is
gonna<00:04:16.810> be<00:04:17.489> I've<00:04:18.489> got<00:04:18.730> just<00:04:19.090> a<00:04:19.419> little<00:04:19.660> tiny<00:04:19.840> gap

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
gonna be I've got just a little tiny gap

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.560 
gonna be I've got just a little tiny gap
at<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.590> bottom<00:04:20.859> there<00:04:21.070> for<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.090> water<00:04:22.270> to<00:04:22.419> be

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
at the bottom there for the water to be

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.200 
at the bottom there for the water to be
sucked<00:04:23.320> up<00:04:23.530> and<00:04:24.010> hopefully<00:04:24.250> it'll<00:04:24.520> take<00:04:24.730> vast

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
sucked up and hopefully it'll take vast

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.170 
sucked up and hopefully it'll take vast
majority<00:04:25.660> of<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:25.870> solid<00:04:26.200> waste<00:04:26.320> with<00:04:26.590> it

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
majority of the solid waste with it

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.820 
majority of the solid waste with it
through<00:04:28.180> here<00:04:28.419> through<00:04:29.230> the<00:04:29.380> miracle<00:04:29.740> of

through here through the miracle of

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.920 
through here through the miracle of
siphoning<00:04:30.240> where<00:04:31.240> it<00:04:31.300> will<00:04:31.450> come<00:04:31.630> out<00:04:31.750> this

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
siphoning where it will come out this

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.350 
siphoning where it will come out this
side<00:04:32.310> to<00:04:33.310> eventually<00:04:33.730> drain<00:04:33.940> to<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.120> sump

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360

gonna mark a semicircle I'm gonna cut it

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.909 
gonna mark a semicircle I'm gonna cut it
out<00:04:40.540> of<00:04:40.600> there<00:04:40.810> so<00:04:40.990> that<00:04:41.440> I've<00:04:41.530> got<00:04:41.650> somewhere

the plan here is I'm going to reroute
the<00:05:04.870> plumbing<00:05:05.050> from<00:05:05.860> this<00:05:06.070> mess<00:05:06.280> at<00:05:06.460> the<00:05:06.550> end

the plumbing from this mess at the end
so<00:05:07.510> that<00:05:07.540> it<00:05:07.690> shoots<00:05:07.900> over<00:05:08.110> and<00:05:08.520> fills<00:05:09.520> through

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
so that it shoots over and fills through

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.400 
so that it shoots over and fills through
my<00:05:10.570> hole<00:05:10.750> in<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:10.990> lid<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:13.780> cannon<00:05:14.110> will<00:05:14.230> fill

here's<00:05:59.580> a<00:05:59.670> quick<00:05:59.940> look<00:06:00.120> at<00:06:00.360> basically<00:06:00.840> how

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
here's a quick look at basically how

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.210 
here's a quick look at basically how
this<00:06:01.350> is<00:06:01.470> gonna<00:06:01.560> work<00:06:02.150> so<00:06:03.150> I<00:06:03.480> tapped<00:06:04.230> off<00:06:04.440> of<00:06:04.680> my

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
this is gonna work so I tapped off of my

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.850 
this is gonna work so I tapped off of my
pump<00:06:05.460> line<00:06:05.810> so<00:06:06.810> just<00:06:06.840> kind<00:06:07.170> of<00:06:07.260> drain<00:06:07.470> in<00:06:07.650> here

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
pump line so just kind of drain in here

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.580 
pump line so just kind of drain in here
and<00:06:08.070> it's<00:06:08.160> gonna<00:06:08.280> create<00:06:08.430> a<00:06:08.610> bit<00:06:08.730> of<00:06:08.820> a<00:06:08.880> swirl

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
and it's gonna create a bit of a swirl

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.290 
and it's gonna create a bit of a swirl
I'm<00:06:10.590> gonna<00:06:10.800> fill<00:06:11.010> up<00:06:11.160> and<00:06:11.790> drain<00:06:12.000> it<00:06:12.120> all<00:06:12.210> the

I'm gonna fill up and drain it all the

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.660 
I'm gonna fill up and drain it all the
way<00:06:12.420> from<00:06:12.630> the<00:06:12.720> bottom<00:06:14.720> when<00:06:15.720> it<00:06:15.810> overflows

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:16.670 
way from the bottom when it overflows

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.970 
way from the bottom when it overflows
down<00:06:17.670> and<00:06:18.030> into<00:06:18.450> the<00:06:18.540> sump<00:06:18.750> tank<00:06:18.930> just<00:06:19.890> like

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:22.920 
the rack that you see so now if my pump

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.730 
the rack that you see so now if my pump
keeps<00:06:23.100> going<00:06:23.550> and<00:06:23.900> drains<00:06:24.900> the<00:06:25.020> sub<00:06:25.260> tank<00:06:25.500> out

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740
