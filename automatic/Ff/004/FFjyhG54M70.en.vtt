the<00:00:07.139> side<00:00:07.410> if<00:00:08.040> you<00:00:08.700> can<00:00:08.940> see<00:00:09.090> that<00:00:09.240> it's<00:00:09.420> a

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
the side if you can see that it's a

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.970 
the side if you can see that it's a
school<00:00:09.840> board<00:00:10.050> but<00:00:10.380> it's<00:00:10.500> different<00:00:10.740> than

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
school board but it's different than

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.500 
school board but it's different than
normal<00:00:11.100> because<00:00:11.370> instead<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.760> players<00:00:12.180> being

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.510 
normal because instead of players being

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.730 
normal because instead of players being
listed<00:00:12.720> on<00:00:12.960> that<00:00:12.990> it's<00:00:13.290> actually<00:00:13.620> my

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
listed on that it's actually my

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.129 
listed on that it's actually my
objectives<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:15.120> normally<00:00:15.300> that<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:15.930> have

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
objectives so normally that that have

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.660 
objectives so normally that that have
players<00:00:16.439> for<00:00:16.560> scores<00:00:17.070> for<00:00:17.340> something

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
players for scores for something

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.150 
players for scores for something
specific<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:19.260> would<00:00:19.380> only<00:00:19.530> show<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:19.950> for

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
specific and that would only show it for

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.680 
specific and that would only show it for
one<00:00:20.340> objective<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.210> shows<00:00:21.420> multiple

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:21.690 
one objective and this shows multiple

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.769 
one objective and this shows multiple
you<00:00:22.470> can<00:00:22.590> see<00:00:22.740> if<00:00:22.920> i<00:00:23.039> move<00:00:23.190> about<00:00:23.490> my<00:00:24.360> distant

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
you can see if i move about my distant

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.689 
you can see if i move about my distant
objective<00:00:25.199> move<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.830> I'll<00:00:26.130> show<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.550> other

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
objective move and I'll show the other

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.000 
objective move and I'll show the other
ones<00:00:26.850> later<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:28.020> redstone<00:00:28.500> for<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.800> may

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
ones later the redstone for this may

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.800 
ones later the redstone for this may
look<00:00:29.190> complicated<00:00:29.460> but<00:00:29.910> really<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.390> run<00:00:30.630> it

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
look complicated but really to run it

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.749 
look complicated but really to run it

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
it to the side bar slot and all these

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:48.590 
it to the side bar slot and all these
command<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.969> be<00:00:48.059> available<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.569> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
command to be available in the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.879 
command to be available in the
description<00:00:48.780> for<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.409> to<00:00:49.530> use<00:00:50.420> now<00:00:51.649> this<00:00:52.649> one

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:52.889 
description for you to use now this one

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:54.349 
description for you to use now this one
here<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.249> will<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.549> initiate<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
here it will just initiate the

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:55.969 
here it will just initiate the
objectives<00:00:54.929> you<00:00:55.019> can<00:00:55.199> see<00:00:55.379> already<00:00:55.620> come<00:00:55.859> up

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979 
objectives you can see already come up

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:59.090 
objectives you can see already come up
on<00:00:56.190> there<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.989> this<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.260> creates<00:00:58.379> objective

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
on there and this just creates objective

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.369 
on there and this just creates objective
so<00:00:59.429> this<00:00:59.670> one's<00:00:59.909> for<00:01:00.089> using<00:01:00.389> a<00:01:00.479> spawn<00:01:00.809> egg<00:01:01.049> and

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
so this one's for using a spawn egg and

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.500 
so this one's for using a spawn egg and
you<00:01:01.530> can<00:01:01.619> see<00:01:01.739> here<00:01:01.979> it's<00:01:02.190> by<00:01:02.519> the<00:01:02.579> spawn<00:01:03.329> egg

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
you can see here it's by the spawn egg

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.780 
you can see here it's by the spawn egg
one<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.440> for<00:01:04.619> if<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.799> break<00:01:05.070> bow<00:01:05.400> and

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
one this is for if you break bow and

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.400 
one this is for if you break bow and
this<00:01:06.330> one's<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:06.690> how<00:01:06.840> far<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.230> walk<00:01:08.780> now<00:01:09.780> this

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
this one's for how far you walk now this

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.680 
this one's for how far you walk now this
here<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> clock<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:12.390> quite<00:01:12.600> an

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
here is a clock and it's quite an

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.130 
here is a clock and it's quite an
interesting<00:01:12.960> clock<00:01:13.550> because<00:01:14.550> it<00:01:14.880> uses<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.750> fill

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
interesting clock because it uses a fill

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
interesting clock because it uses a fill
command<00:01:16.500> also<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.520> uses<00:01:18.740> take<00:01:19.740> use<00:01:19.980> of

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
command also and it uses take use of

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.430 
command also and it uses take use of
this<00:01:20.310> concept<00:01:20.730> here<00:01:21.000> which<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.050> where<00:01:22.230> you<00:01:22.290> can

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
this concept here which is where you can

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.980 
this concept here which is where you can
make<00:01:22.590> command<00:01:23.580> box<00:01:23.850> exclude<00:01:24.420> each<00:01:24.570> other<00:01:24.780> in

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
make command box exclude each other in

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.860 
make command box exclude each other in
order<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.620> you<00:01:26.550> need<00:01:26.760> that<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.210> make<00:01:27.330> sure<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
order and you need that to make sure the

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.510 
order and you need that to make sure the
sidebar<00:01:28.260> is<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.470> glitchy<00:01:28.710> agency<00:01:29.280> here<00:01:29.490> I

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
sidebar is it glitchy agency here I

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.120 
sidebar is it glitchy agency here I
press<00:01:29.730> the<00:01:29.820> button<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.390> these<00:01:30.870> all<00:01:31.130> operate

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
press the button and these all operate

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.740 
press the button and these all operate
in<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.310> same<00:01:32.370> order<00:01:32.880> every<00:01:33.030> single<00:01:33.600> time

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
in the same order every single time

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.960 
in the same order every single time
press<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> button<00:01:34.410> and<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:35.490> works<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.850> both

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
press the button and it works in both

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.440 
press the button and it works in both
directions<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.750> just<00:01:36.960> different<00:01:37.200> order<00:01:38.450> so

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
directions it's just different order so

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.990 
directions it's just different order so
what's<00:01:40.200> going<00:01:40.440> on<00:01:40.530> here<00:01:40.860> basically<00:01:41.850> this

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
what's going on here basically this

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.580 
what's going on here basically this
these<00:01:42.450> three<00:01:42.630> coins<00:01:42.810> here<00:01:43.050> just<00:01:43.320> park<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
these three coins here just park the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.220 
these three coins here just park the
clocking<00:01:43.890> stop<00:01:44.370> and<00:01:44.520> start<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.900> fills

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
clocking stop and start it this fills

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.649 
clocking stop and start it this fills
this<00:01:46.500> space<00:01:46.770> here<00:01:46.950> with<00:01:47.100> wool<00:01:47.370> this<00:01:48.270> fills<00:01:48.570> the

it's going to set these blocks all along
here<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.780> even<00:02:01.710> though<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:01.920> can't<00:02:02.430> see<00:02:02.580> it

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
here and even though you can't see it

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.060 
here and even though you can't see it
they're<00:02:03.420> actually<00:02:03.870> quickly<00:02:04.320> changing

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
they're actually quickly changing

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.969 
they're actually quickly changing
between<00:02:05.610> redstone<00:02:06.570> box<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.050> wool<00:02:07.409> very<00:02:07.710> very

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
between redstone box and wool very very

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.550 
between redstone box and wool very very
quickly<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:09.299> powering<00:02:09.629> these<00:02:09.869> one<00:02:10.349> box

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
quickly and it's powering these one box

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.500 
quickly and it's powering these one box
20<00:02:10.889> times<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.219> second

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
20 times a second

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.930 
20 times a second
now<00:02:13.510> eat<00:02:14.440> these<00:02:14.709> are<00:02:14.890> pairing<00:02:15.190> order<00:02:15.580> so<00:02:15.730> have

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
now eat these are pairing order so have

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.550 
now eat these are pairing order so have
a<00:02:15.970> look<00:02:16.060> which<00:02:16.300> one<00:02:16.540> what's<00:02:16.720> going<00:02:16.900> first<00:02:17.230> it's

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
a look which one what's going first it's

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.220 
a look which one what's going first it's
going<00:02:17.709> to<00:02:17.769> be<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.010> one<00:02:18.129> in<00:02:18.250> this<00:02:18.400> position<00:02:18.940> and

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
going to be the one in this position and

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.619 
going to be the one in this position and
closest<00:02:20.230> here<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.709> sucks<00:02:20.920> with<00:02:21.010> me<00:02:21.099> this<00:02:21.250> and

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
closest here it sucks with me this and

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.790 
closest here it sucks with me this and
that<00:02:22.629> setting<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.530> school<00:02:23.890> of<00:02:24.069> a<00:02:25.800> fantastical

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
that setting the school of a fantastical

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.699 
that setting the school of a fantastical
player<00:02:27.190> whole<00:02:27.459> distance<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.530> we're<00:02:29.530> going<00:02:29.650> to

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
player whole distance and we're going to

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.759 
player whole distance and we're going to
set<00:02:29.860> his<00:02:30.069> corpse<00:02:30.730> of<00:02:31.239> objective<00:02:31.959> scores<00:02:32.319> 2-0

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
set his corpse of objective scores 2-0

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.940 
set his corpse of objective scores 2-0
and<00:02:33.840> then<00:02:34.840> in<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.470> same<00:02:35.769> tick<00:02:36.280> but<00:02:36.970> afterwards

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
and then in the same tick but afterwards

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.610 
and then in the same tick but afterwards
exploiting<00:02:38.950> this<00:02:39.129> order<00:02:40.090> here<00:02:40.470> we're<00:02:41.470> going

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
exploiting this order here we're going

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.680 
exploiting this order here we're going
to<00:02:41.739> do<00:02:41.890> something<00:02:42.430> which<00:02:42.700> was<00:02:43.120> introducing

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
to do something which was introducing

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.120 
to do something which was introducing
the<00:02:43.810> new<00:02:43.900> snapshots<00:02:44.500> which<00:02:44.709> is<00:02:44.920> very<00:02:45.099> useful

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
the new snapshots which is very useful

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.370 
the new snapshots which is very useful
we're<00:02:46.030> going<00:02:46.120> to<00:02:46.180> do<00:02:46.269> an<00:02:46.360> operation<00:02:46.810> on<00:02:47.290> a

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
we're going to do an operation on a

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.130 
we're going to do an operation on a
player<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:49.269> Facebook<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:49.840> it's<00:02:49.959> let<00:02:50.079> me

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
player and the Facebook and it's let me

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.780 
player and the Facebook and it's let me
on<00:02:50.230> play<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.620> distance<00:02:51.160> we're<00:02:51.370> going<00:02:51.489> to<00:02:51.579> set

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
on play a distance we're going to set

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.880 
on play a distance we're going to set
his<00:02:51.970> school's<00:02:52.420> we're<00:02:53.410> going<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.590> increment

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
his school's we're going to increment

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.390 
his school's we're going to increment
his<00:02:54.250> schools<00:02:54.610> by<00:02:55.030> my<00:02:55.480> school<00:02:55.930> of<00:02:56.170> distance<00:02:56.739> so

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
his schools by my school of distance so

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.250 
his schools by my school of distance so
it's<00:02:57.519> just<00:02:57.640> been<00:02:57.790> set<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.209> zero<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:58.959> then

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
it's just been set to zero and then

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.800 
it's just been set to zero and then
adding<00:02:59.769> on<00:02:59.890> to<00:03:00.069> zero<00:03:00.340> my<00:03:00.640> school<00:03:01.120> we're<00:03:01.690> going

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
adding on to zero my school we're going

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.720 
adding on to zero my school we're going
to<00:03:01.900> do<00:03:02.019> that<00:03:02.170> every<00:03:02.470> single<00:03:02.500> tick<00:03:03.129> so<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:03.610> will

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
to do that every single tick so it will

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.839 
to do that every single tick so it will
appear<00:03:04.150> is<00:03:04.420> in<00:03:05.049> the<00:03:05.410> person<00:03:06.069> called<00:03:06.250> distances

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
appear is in the person called distances

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.400 
appear is in the person called distances
score<00:03:07.390> on<00:03:07.629> the<00:03:07.840> objective<00:03:08.319> scores<00:03:09.040> is<00:03:10.410> my

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
score on the objective scores is my

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.619 
score on the objective scores is my
distance<00:03:12.069> if<00:03:12.549> you<00:03:12.730> get<00:03:12.879> on<00:03:13.000> saying<00:03:13.360> and

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
distance if you get on saying and

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.900 
distance if you get on saying and
basically<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.980> same<00:03:15.160> thing<00:03:15.220> happening<00:03:15.730> with

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
basically the same thing happening with

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.059 
basically the same thing happening with
the<00:03:16.000> other<00:03:16.090> ones<00:03:16.329> for<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.260> use<00:03:17.470> egg<00:03:17.680> school

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
the other ones for the use egg school

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.860 
the other ones for the use egg school
it's<00:03:18.519> the<00:03:18.639> same<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.150> then<00:03:19.389> we're<00:03:19.569> doing<00:03:19.690> the

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
it's the same and then we're doing the

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.379 
it's the same and then we're doing the
operation<00:03:20.079> on<00:03:20.500> it<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:20.889> you<00:03:21.819> continue<00:03:22.239> that

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
operation on it and you continue that

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:25.379 
operation on it and you continue that
out<00:03:22.569> and<00:03:22.780> out<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.049> out<00:03:23.519> now<00:03:24.519> for<00:03:24.579> the<00:03:24.970> order<00:03:25.329> of

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
out and out and out now for the order of

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:26.670 
out and out and out now for the order of
these<00:03:25.540> you're<00:03:25.750> always<00:03:25.900> going<00:03:26.079> to<00:03:26.139> put<00:03:26.440> them<00:03:26.530> on

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
these you're always going to put them on

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.710 
these you're always going to put them on
up<00:03:26.769> together<00:03:26.920> so<00:03:27.100> I'm<00:03:27.849> going<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.060> have<00:03:28.239> to<00:03:28.269> set

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
up together so I'm going to have to set

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.990 
up together so I'm going to have to set
the<00:03:28.840> school<00:03:29.079> 201<00:03:29.799> in<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.040> one<00:03:30.190> position<00:03:30.760> and

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
the school 201 in the one position and

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.449 
the school 201 in the one position and
then<00:03:31.329> the<00:03:31.450> operation<00:03:31.870> into<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:32.530> then<00:03:33.280> you'll

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
then the operation into and then you'll

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.220 
then the operation into and then you'll
do<00:03:33.579> the<00:03:33.700> next<00:03:33.880> one<00:03:34.060> on<00:03:34.209> three<00:03:34.660> so<00:03:34.959> it's<00:03:35.109> all<00:03:35.170> an

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
do the next one on three so it's all an

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.319 
do the next one on three so it's all an
order<00:03:35.700> now<00:03:36.700> this<00:03:37.510> order<00:03:37.959> works<00:03:38.230> on<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:39.299> z<00:03:40.299> axis

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
order now this order works on the z axis

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.509 
order now this order works on the z axis
so<00:03:41.169> you<00:03:41.230> can<00:03:41.319> see<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.620> blue<00:03:41.859> line<00:03:42.069> there<00:03:42.340> is

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
so you can see the blue line there is

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.420 
so you can see the blue line there is
the<00:03:42.669> z<00:03:42.880> axis<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:44.200> you<00:03:44.560> do<00:03:44.709> it<00:03:44.799> like<00:03:44.919> that<00:03:45.190> but

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
the z axis and you do it like that but

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.110 
the z axis and you do it like that but
if<00:03:45.549> you're<00:03:45.790> in<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.769> x<00:03:47.769> axis<00:03:48.370> you'll<00:03:48.730> do<00:03:48.970> it

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
if you're in the x axis you'll do it

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.699 
if you're in the x axis you'll do it
this<00:03:49.359> ways<00:03:49.630> you<00:03:49.750> can<00:03:49.840> see<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.079> red<00:03:50.230> line<00:03:50.440> on<00:03:50.470> my

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
this ways you can see the red line on my

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.479 
this ways you can see the red line on my
cursor<00:03:51.220> bill<00:03:51.880> just<00:03:52.150> slightly<00:03:52.359> different<00:03:53.489> I've
