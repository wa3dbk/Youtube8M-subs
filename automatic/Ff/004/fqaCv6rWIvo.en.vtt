so these the options here that we've got
for<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.230> applications<00:02:35.769> as<00:02:36.640> you<00:02:36.700> can<00:02:36.879> see

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
for the applications as you can see

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.780 
for the applications as you can see
there's<00:02:37.659> not<00:02:37.810> many<00:02:37.989> here<00:02:38.409> but<00:02:38.920> if<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.459> look<00:02:39.640> at

obviously<00:02:55.720> for<00:02:56.379> a<00:02:56.409> nascent<00:02:56.980> machine<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:58.060> I've

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
obviously for a nascent machine and I've

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.630 
obviously for a nascent machine and I've
got<00:02:58.360> one<00:02:58.540> more<00:02:58.569> screenshot<00:02:59.230> here<00:02:59.620> for<00:03:00.489> you

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
obviously if it was a brand new machine

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.309 
obviously if it was a brand new machine

of toolbars they add in there for some
reason<00:03:37.389> sometimes<00:03:37.919> overdoing<00:03:38.919> it<00:03:39.099> but<00:03:39.310> you

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
reason sometimes overdoing it but you

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.369 
reason sometimes overdoing it but you
can<00:03:39.970> undo<00:03:40.299> those<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:40.540> get<00:03:40.900> rid<00:03:41.049> of<00:03:41.109> them<00:03:41.290> if

can undo those and get rid of them if

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.320 
can undo those and get rid of them if
you<00:03:41.530> want<00:03:41.739> okay

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.940 

let's<00:03:44.870> have<00:03:45.020> a<00:03:45.080> little<00:03:45.200> look<00:03:45.380> and<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:45.620> start

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
let's have a little look and the start

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.480 
let's have a little look and the start
up<00:03:46.130> again<00:03:47.470> you<00:03:48.470> can<00:03:48.650> do<00:03:48.860> whatever<00:03:49.070> you<00:03:49.340> like

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
up again you can do whatever you like

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.490 
up again you can do whatever you like
here<00:03:49.790> take<00:03:50.090> these<00:03:50.270> air<00:03:50.510> you'll<00:03:50.750> probably<00:03:51.200> have

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
here take these air you'll probably have

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.320 
here take these air you'll probably have
a<00:03:51.530> big<00:03:51.770> list<00:03:51.950> of<00:03:52.130> stuff<00:03:52.430> here<00:03:52.670> if<00:03:52.850> it's<00:03:53.030> a<00:03:53.090> brand

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
a big list of stuff here if it's a brand

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.000 
a big list of stuff here if it's a brand
new<00:03:53.360> machine<00:03:53.540> so<00:03:53.930> always<00:03:54.170> seem<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.380> load<00:03:54.710> it<00:03:54.890> up

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010

so we've got a restore button here as
well<00:04:06.490> there's<00:04:07.490> an<00:04:07.670> optimum<00:04:08.030> optimum<00:04:08.840> or

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
well there's an optimum optimum or

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.930 
well there's an optimum optimum or
optimizer<00:04:10.630> that<00:04:11.630> you<00:04:11.720> can<00:04:11.900> use<00:04:12.170> and<00:04:12.790> as<00:04:13.790> you

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
optimizer that you can use and as you

optimizer that you can use and as you
can<00:04:14.000> see<00:04:14.060> start<00:04:14.900> up<00:04:15.100> it<00:04:16.100> will<00:04:16.370> optimize<00:04:17.060> the

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
can see start up it will optimize the

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.130 
can see start up it will optimize the
startup<00:04:18.470> and<00:04:18.680> also<00:04:19.459> services<00:04:20.150> so<00:04:20.900> you<00:04:20.959> can

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
startup and also services so you can

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.950 
startup and also services so you can
remove<00:04:21.760> remove<00:04:22.760> which<00:04:23.000> is<00:04:23.180> selected<00:04:23.690> so<00:04:23.870> if
