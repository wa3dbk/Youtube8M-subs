00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:13.170
 hello today we will try 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.890
 get rid of in the future so 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.750
 unwanted aggression . 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.180
 so we can calmly come in i 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.779
 come up when he eats bone yet 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:31.550
 something in my bowl now on 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:36.960
 became interested went to eat 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:42.300
 my palms served in the same bowl 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:45.660
 the very food of the mind is tempted to give hands 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:52.710
 continuously constantly so that he understood 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:56.510
 that we fit it and without our hand in 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.510
 basically get nothing 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:08.190
 Now the puppy likes it now 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:12.180
 feed with a knife waiting for himself and we him 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.180
 we start from the hand feed 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:37.160
 the same can be done with the bone 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:40.300

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.980

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:48.800

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:51.370

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.370
 young 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.390

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.079
 this age, he basically can not 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.079
 be no aggression 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.450

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.050

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.890
