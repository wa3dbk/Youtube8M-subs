00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
by looking at our right hand for most

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.160 
by looking at our right hand for most
full-grown<00:00:38.340> people<00:00:38.910> when<00:00:39.480> we<00:00:39.629> play<00:00:39.870> clarinet

full-grown people when we play clarinet

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.520 
full-grown people when we play clarinet
we<00:00:40.800> actually<00:00:41.160> want<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:42.030> angle<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.780> our

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
we actually want the angle of our

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.350 
we actually want the angle of our
forearm<00:00:44.600> to<00:00:45.600> our<00:00:45.840> wrist<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.800> our<00:00:46.950> hand<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:48.210> be

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
forearm to our wrist to our hand to be

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.660 
forearm to our wrist to our hand to be
as<00:00:48.629> straight<00:00:49.200> as<00:00:49.440> possible<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.190> really<00:00:50.460> want

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
as straight as possible we really want

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.950 
as straight as possible we really want
to<00:00:50.789> avoid<00:00:50.850> our<00:00:51.270> hand<00:00:51.570> our<00:00:51.989> wrist<00:00:52.590> tilting<00:00:53.399> out

or like this and yet I see many many

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.229 
or like this and yet I see many many
people<00:00:58.230> doing<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.829> it's<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.070> really<00:00:59.640> common

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
people doing that it's a really common

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.399 
people doing that it's a really common
habit<00:01:01.370> when<00:01:02.370> we're<00:01:02.579> when<00:01:03.180> we're<00:01:03.359> at<00:01:03.750> an<00:01:03.899> angle

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
habit when we're when we're at an angle

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.350 
habit when we're when we're at an angle
here<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:05.100> tendons<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.670> work<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.000> our<00:01:06.090> hand

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
here the tendons that work in our hand

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.090 
here the tendons that work in our hand
are<00:01:06.600> being<00:01:06.840> bent<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.350> they<00:01:07.439> don't<00:01:07.710> work<00:01:07.920> as

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
are being bent and they don't work as

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.340 
are being bent and they don't work as
efficiently<00:01:08.400> we<00:01:09.240> want<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.540> straight<00:01:09.780> now<00:01:10.229> we

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
efficiently we want it straight now we

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.960 
efficiently we want it straight now we
also<00:01:10.470> want<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.830> look<00:01:11.040> straight<00:01:11.310> from<00:01:11.820> this

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
also want it to look straight from this

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.200 
also want it to look straight from this
angle<00:01:12.619> most<00:01:13.619> people<00:01:13.979> most<00:01:14.490> people<00:01:14.790> are<00:01:14.880> pretty

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
angle most people most people are pretty

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.969 
angle most people most people are pretty
good<00:01:15.509> from<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.080> angle<00:01:16.259> but<00:01:16.530> I'm<00:01:16.619> showing<00:01:16.830> you

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
good from this angle but I'm showing you

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.490 
good from this angle but I'm showing you
that<00:01:17.070> Vantage<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:17.700> well<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.509> straight<00:01:19.170> this

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
that Vantage as well so straight this

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.710 
that Vantage as well so straight this
way<00:01:20.509> straight<00:01:21.860> this<00:01:22.860> way<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.520> when<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.570> pick

way straight this way and when you pick
up<00:01:24.780> your<00:01:24.930> instrument<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.740> really<00:01:26.220> want<00:01:26.400> to

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
hand I see so many people who stick

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.810 
hand I see so many people who stick
their<00:01:29.880> elbows<00:01:30.509> out<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.259> then<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.280> order<00:01:32.520> to

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
their elbows out and then in order to

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.330 
their elbows out and then in order to
fit<00:01:33.150> their<00:01:33.540> right<00:01:33.720> hand<00:01:34.110> they<00:01:34.860> need<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.189> kind

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
fit their right hand they need to kind

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.149 
fit their right hand they need to kind
of<00:01:35.520> bend<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.420> at<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> very<00:01:37.020> sharp<00:01:37.500> angle<00:01:37.770> here

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
of bend it at a very sharp angle here

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.670 
of bend it at a very sharp angle here
that<00:01:38.610> does<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.939> causes<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.780> few<00:01:40.110> problems<00:01:40.350> for

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
that does it causes a few problems for

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.370 
that does it causes a few problems for
you<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.579> makes<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.090> hard<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.390> your<00:01:42.689> fingers<00:01:43.170> to

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
you it makes it hard for your fingers to

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.590 
you it makes it hard for your fingers to
wrap<00:01:43.560> around<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.950> hit<00:01:44.159> those<00:01:44.340> bottom<00:01:44.790> keys<00:01:45.060> so

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
wrap around and hit those bottom keys so

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.210 
wrap around and hit those bottom keys so
you're<00:01:45.720> often<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.290> find<00:01:46.590> certain<00:01:46.890> notes

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
you're often going to find certain notes

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.310 
you're often going to find certain notes
in<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.640> high<00:01:47.790> register<00:01:48.000> are<00:01:48.420> delayed<00:01:48.869> or<00:01:49.170> they

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
in the high register are delayed or they

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.200 
in the high register are delayed or they
feel<00:01:49.530> hard<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.009> blow<00:01:50.189> as<00:01:50.520> our<00:01:50.759> fingers<00:01:51.149> like

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
feel hard to blow as our fingers like

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.090 
feel hard to blow as our fingers like
they're<00:01:51.899> naturally<00:01:52.409> going<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.649> fit<00:01:52.890> better

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
they're naturally going to fit better

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.399 
they're naturally going to fit better
when<00:01:53.729> we<00:01:53.850> get<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.210> into<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.659> straight<00:01:55.110> line

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
when we get this into a straight line

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.590 
when we get this into a straight line
the<00:01:56.009> other<00:01:56.189> thing<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.549> if<00:01:56.850> your<00:01:57.000> elbows<00:01:57.390> are

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
the other thing is if your elbows are

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.030 
the other thing is if your elbows are
sticking<00:01:58.079> out<00:01:58.200> like<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.530> look<00:01:58.860> at<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
sticking out like this look at the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.370 
sticking out like this look at the
tension<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.490> my<00:01:59.520> body<00:01:59.759> right<00:02:00.060> now<00:02:00.380> you're

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
tension in my body right now you're

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.980 
tension in my body right now you're
probably<00:02:01.909> putting<00:02:02.909> tension<00:02:03.360> into<00:02:03.719> your

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
probably putting tension into your

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.469 
probably putting tension into your
throat<00:02:04.380> which<00:02:04.860> impedes<00:02:05.520> your<00:02:05.759> air<00:02:05.909> flow<00:02:06.149> and

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
throat which impedes your air flow and

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.059 
throat which impedes your air flow and
into<00:02:07.020> your<00:02:07.170> fingers<00:02:07.530> your<00:02:07.680> fingers<00:02:07.950> will

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
into your fingers your fingers will

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.949 
into your fingers your fingers will
start<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.429> slam<00:02:08.729> on<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.090> instrument<00:02:09.569> which<00:02:09.929> is

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
start to slam on the instrument which is

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.750 
start to slam on the instrument which is
not<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.289> good<00:02:10.590> habit<00:02:10.770> we<00:02:11.039> always<00:02:11.280> want<00:02:11.489> very

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
not a good habit we always want very

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.339 
not a good habit we always want very
light<00:02:12.060> relaxed<00:02:12.660> fingers

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
light relaxed fingers

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.089 
light relaxed fingers
now<00:02:13.890> if<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.549> change<00:02:15.359> your<00:02:15.659> wrist<00:02:15.900> angle<00:02:16.379> two

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
now if you change your wrist angle two

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.459 
now if you change your wrist angle two
ways<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.579> do<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:17.879> one<00:02:18.569> is<00:02:18.810> simply<00:02:19.260> by

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:19.469 
ways to do that one is simply by

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:22.399 
ways to do that one is simply by
changing<00:02:20.129> where<00:02:20.489> your<00:02:20.639> elbow<00:02:20.969> sits<00:02:21.329> so<00:02:22.170> if<00:02:22.290> I

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
changing where your elbow sits so if I

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.030 
changing where your elbow sits so if I
move<00:02:22.620> my<00:02:22.680> elbow<00:02:23.249> in<00:02:23.540> I've<00:02:24.540> altered<00:02:25.109> this<00:02:25.560> angle

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
move my elbow in I've altered this angle

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.959 
move my elbow in I've altered this angle
here<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:26.519> elbow<00:02:27.359> out<00:02:27.569> my<00:02:28.560> wrist<00:02:28.799> is<00:02:28.980> bent<00:02:29.159> elbow

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:29.969 
here so elbow out my wrist is bent elbow

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.149 
here so elbow out my wrist is bent elbow
and<00:02:30.329> it's<00:02:30.810> easier<00:02:31.170> for<00:02:31.379> me<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.530> maintain<00:02:32.129> a

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
and it's easier for me to maintain a

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.610 
and it's easier for me to maintain a
straight<00:02:32.489> line<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:33.139> generally<00:02:34.139> you<00:02:34.260> just<00:02:34.439> want

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
straight line so generally you just want

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.890 
straight line so generally you just want
your<00:02:34.799> arms<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.489> relax<00:02:35.849> at<00:02:36.120> your<00:02:36.269> side<00:02:36.510> they

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
your arms to relax at your side they

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.330 
your arms to relax at your side they
they<00:02:37.319> could<00:02:37.469> just<00:02:37.650> sit<00:02:37.859> where<00:02:38.069> they<00:02:38.099> would

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
they could just sit where they would

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.240 
they could just sit where they would
normally<00:02:38.819> sit<00:02:39.079> you<00:02:40.079> may<00:02:40.349> find<00:02:40.859> that<00:02:41.069> this

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
normally sit you may find that this

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.119 
normally sit you may find that this
affects<00:02:41.760> where<00:02:42.659> you<00:02:42.989> put<00:02:43.230> your<00:02:43.319> thumb<00:02:43.379> on<00:02:43.859> the

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
affects where you put your thumb on the

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.789 
affects where you put your thumb on the
thumb<00:02:44.370> rest<00:02:44.579> sometimes<00:02:45.450> if<00:02:45.719> you've<00:02:46.500> had<00:02:46.769> your

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
thumb rest sometimes if you've had your

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.000 
thumb rest sometimes if you've had your
wrist<00:02:47.250> tucked<00:02:47.609> really<00:02:48.239> far<00:02:48.540> in<00:02:49.010> you've

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
wrist tucked really far in you've

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.490 
wrist tucked really far in you've
probably<00:02:50.250> been<00:02:50.599> far<00:02:51.599> in<00:02:51.900> with<00:02:52.109> your<00:02:52.290> thumb

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
probably been far in with your thumb

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.530 
probably been far in with your thumb
rest<00:02:52.769> and<00:02:52.949> as<00:02:53.099> we<00:02:53.489> straighten<00:02:53.909> our<00:02:54.000> wrist<00:02:54.269> out

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
rest and as we straighten our wrist out

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.899 
rest and as we straighten our wrist out
you<00:02:55.139> may<00:02:55.319> need<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.650> slide<00:02:55.919> closer<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.639> the<00:02:56.760> end

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
you may need to slide closer to the end

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.080 
you may need to slide closer to the end
of<00:02:57.060> your<00:02:57.180> thumb<00:02:57.449> I<00:02:57.689> do<00:02:58.199> have<00:02:58.409> another<00:02:58.739> video

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
of your thumb I do have another video

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.490 
of your thumb I do have another video
specifically<00:03:00.090> about<00:03:00.389> right<00:03:00.629> hand<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.290> right

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
specifically about right hand and right

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.679 
specifically about right hand and right
thumb<00:03:01.829> pain<00:03:02.189> that<00:03:02.639> talks<00:03:02.909> about<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.299> ideal

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
thumb pain that talks about the ideal

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.959 
thumb pain that talks about the ideal
position<00:03:04.230> for<00:03:04.260> your<00:03:04.590> thumb<00:03:04.889> rest<00:03:05.219> I<00:03:05.519> do

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:05.969 
position for your thumb rest I do

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:07.640 
position for your thumb rest I do
suggest<00:03:06.329> you<00:03:06.629> watch<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:07.169> if<00:03:07.319> you<00:03:07.439> haven't

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
suggest you watch that if you haven't

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.729 
suggest you watch that if you haven't
seen<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.129> but<00:03:08.969> basically<00:03:09.359> we<00:03:10.319> usually<00:03:10.590> end<00:03:10.680> up

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
seen it but basically we usually end up

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.129 
seen it but basically we usually end up
being<00:03:10.919> a<00:03:10.980> little<00:03:11.310> bit<00:03:11.459> closer<00:03:11.989> to<00:03:12.989> our

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
being a little bit closer to our

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.259 
being a little bit closer to our
thumbnail<00:03:13.760> sometimes<00:03:14.760> if<00:03:14.909> we're<00:03:15.060> in<00:03:15.180> the

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
thumbnail sometimes if we're in the

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.420 
thumbnail sometimes if we're in the
ideal<00:03:15.569> position<00:03:15.620> so<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.829> angle<00:03:17.040> is<00:03:17.280> really

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
ideal position so that angle is really

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.270 
ideal position so that angle is really
important<00:03:18.030> all<00:03:18.329> you<00:03:18.569> need<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.870> do<00:03:18.989> is<00:03:19.280> record

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
important all you need to do is record

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.759 
important all you need to do is record
yourself<00:03:20.819> on<00:03:21.060> video<00:03:21.239> or<00:03:21.870> sit<00:03:22.290> in<00:03:22.319> front<00:03:22.470> of<00:03:22.620> a

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
yourself on video or sit in front of a

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.429 
yourself on video or sit in front of a
mirror<00:03:22.979> and<00:03:23.250> just<00:03:23.759> look<00:03:23.909> at<00:03:24.060> that<00:03:24.139> now<00:03:25.139> this<00:03:25.379> is

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:25.439 
mirror and just look at that now this is

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.039 
mirror and just look at that now this is
true<00:03:25.829> for<00:03:26.009> our<00:03:26.040> left<00:03:26.310> hand<00:03:26.609> as<00:03:26.790> well<00:03:27.030> as<00:03:27.359> much

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
true for our left hand as well as much

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.110 
true for our left hand as well as much
as<00:03:28.259> we<00:03:28.409> can<00:03:28.709> we<00:03:29.340> want<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.609> have<00:03:29.729> a<00:03:29.759> straight

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
as we can we want to have a straight

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.960 
as we can we want to have a straight
line<00:03:30.299> here<00:03:30.629> too<00:03:30.930> I<00:03:31.139> do<00:03:31.829> find<00:03:32.340> this<00:03:32.519> varies

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
line here too I do find this varies

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.300 
line here too I do find this varies
depending<00:03:33.449> on<00:03:33.540> people's<00:03:34.049> arm<00:03:34.500> lengths<00:03:35.069> and

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
depending on people's arm lengths and

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.849 
depending on people's arm lengths and
finger<00:03:35.759> length<00:03:36.049> it's<00:03:37.049> a<00:03:37.109> little<00:03:37.439> harder<00:03:37.709> to

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
finger length it's a little harder to

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.460 
finger length it's a little harder to
maintain<00:03:38.120> perfectly<00:03:39.120> straight<00:03:39.449> left<00:03:40.169> hand

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
maintain perfectly straight left hand

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.550 
maintain perfectly straight left hand
but<00:03:40.680> as<00:03:40.799> much<00:03:41.040> as<00:03:41.099> you're<00:03:41.400> able<00:03:41.579> to<00:03:42.349> so<00:03:43.349> if<00:03:43.439> I'm

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
but as much as you're able to so if I'm

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.869 
but as much as you're able to so if I'm
looking<00:03:43.739> at<00:03:43.949> myself<00:03:44.400> now<00:03:44.549> I<00:03:44.579> would<00:03:44.849> probably

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
looking at myself now I would probably

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.629

let's bring that in now I'm pretty
straight<00:03:49.769> here<00:03:50.129> now<00:03:51.060> I'm<00:03:51.299> pretty<00:03:51.509> straight

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
straight here now I'm pretty straight

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.059 
straight here now I'm pretty straight
here<00:03:53.120> ready<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.299> play<00:03:54.509> in<00:03:55.139> good<00:03:55.439> position<00:03:55.889> and

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
here ready to play in good position and

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.949 
here ready to play in good position and
it<00:03:56.129> allows<00:03:56.430> my<00:03:56.729> fingers<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.479> go<00:03:57.599> into<00:03:57.870> that

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
it allows my fingers to go into that

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.140 
it allows my fingers to go into that
really<00:03:58.199> relaxed<00:03:58.889> around<00:03:59.009> in<00:03:59.370> arch<00:03:59.549> position

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
really relaxed around in arch position

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.990 
really relaxed around in arch position
that<00:04:00.540> we<00:04:00.719> like<00:04:01.009> so<00:04:02.009> it's<00:04:02.159> a<00:04:02.219> relatively<00:04:02.669> simple

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
that we like so it's a relatively simple

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.449 
that we like so it's a relatively simple
pointer<00:04:03.599> yet<00:04:04.169> most<00:04:04.500> people<00:04:04.680> aren't<00:04:05.099> aware<00:04:05.400> of

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
pointer yet most people aren't aware of

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.110 
pointer yet most people aren't aware of
it<00:04:05.729> and<00:04:05.969> the<00:04:06.810> benefit<00:04:07.349> to<00:04:07.650> doing<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:08.250> first<00:04:08.909> of

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
it and the benefit to doing it first of

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.749 
it and the benefit to doing it first of
all<00:04:09.239> is<00:04:09.479> it<00:04:09.750> will<00:04:10.319> cut<00:04:10.530> down<00:04:10.709> on<00:04:10.889> any<00:04:11.069> fatigue

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:11.759 
all is it will cut down on any fatigue

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:14.059 
all is it will cut down on any fatigue
that<00:04:12.090> might<00:04:12.299> happen<00:04:12.599> it<00:04:12.870> reduces<00:04:13.379> fatigue<00:04:13.590> in

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
that might happen it reduces fatigue in

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.189 
that might happen it reduces fatigue in
the<00:04:14.219> tendons<00:04:14.729> and<00:04:14.909> muscles<00:04:14.969> of<00:04:15.479> your<00:04:15.599> arms<00:04:15.959> and
