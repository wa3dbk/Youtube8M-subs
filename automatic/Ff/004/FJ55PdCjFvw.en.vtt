but the best benefit for at least for a

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.290 
but the best benefit for at least for a
power<00:00:18.869> washer<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.560> they<00:00:20.340> hold<00:00:20.820> their<00:00:21.029> color

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300

power washer is they hold their color
the<00:00:21.570> best<00:00:21.750> because<00:00:21.960> they're<00:00:22.109> usually<00:00:22.260> made

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
the best because they're usually made

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.170 
the best because they're usually made
out<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.710> 100<00:00:23.039> percent<00:00:23.189> polyester<00:00:23.550> or<00:00:24.029> nylon

out of 100 percent polyester or nylon

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.710 
out of 100 percent polyester or nylon
and<00:00:25.310> being<00:00:26.310> inorganic<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.510> police

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
and being inorganic like that the police

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.179 
and being inorganic like that the police
really<00:00:27.990> doesn't<00:00:28.260> affect<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.680> only<00:00:28.859> affects

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
really doesn't affect it only affects

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.669 
really doesn't affect it only affects
the<00:00:29.279> dyes<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:30.060> sometimes<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.199> size<00:00:31.380> will

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
the dyes and sometimes the size will

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.020 
the dyes and sometimes the size will
start<00:00:31.920> showing<00:00:32.070> but<00:00:32.279> either<00:00:32.489> way

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
start showing but either way

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.819 
start showing but either way
it<00:00:33.300> definitely<00:00:33.510> lasts<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.079> lot<00:00:34.260> longer<00:00:34.320> than<00:00:34.770> I

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
it definitely lasts a lot longer than I

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.370
