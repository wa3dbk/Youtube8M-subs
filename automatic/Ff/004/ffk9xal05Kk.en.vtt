00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.579 

well<00:00:00.299> I<00:00:00.359> told<00:00:00.570> you<00:00:00.690> we<00:00:00.840> learn<00:00:01.020> how<00:00:01.170> to<00:00:01.199> play<00:00:01.410> any

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
well I told you we learn how to play any

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.560 
well I told you we learn how to play any
song<00:00:01.860> by<00:00:02.100> ear<00:00:02.370> and<00:00:02.610> what<00:00:03.090> we're<00:00:03.240> going<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.389> do

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
song by ear and what we're going to do

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.390 
song by ear and what we're going to do
is<00:00:03.689> we're<00:00:03.840> going<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:03.990> look<00:00:04.170> at<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.529> major

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
is we're going to look at the major

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.570 
is we're going to look at the major
scale<00:00:05.730> through<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.270> key<00:00:06.450> of<00:00:06.600> F<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.580> we'll

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
scale through the key of F and we'll

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.150 
scale through the key of F and we'll
just<00:00:08.760> start<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.090> third<00:00:09.300> fret<00:00:09.540> fourth<00:00:09.900> string

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
just start the third fret fourth string

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.169 
just start the third fret fourth string
we're<00:00:11.160> gonna<00:00:11.250> play<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.429> major<00:00:11.580> scale<00:00:11.730> on<00:00:12.030> one

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
we're gonna play a major scale on one

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:19.060 
we're gonna play a major scale on one
string<00:00:12.509> so<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:12.750> can<00:00:12.900> see<00:00:13.080> how<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.410> works

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.400 

now<00:00:20.070> here's<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.550> trick<00:00:20.869> for<00:00:21.869> our<00:00:21.990> chord<00:00:22.260> we

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
now here's the trick for our chord we

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.050 
now here's the trick for our chord we
only<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:22.800> three<00:00:23.220> notes<00:00:23.430> through<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.820> scale

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
only have three notes through that scale

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.660 
only have three notes through that scale
that<00:00:24.269> we<00:00:24.359> use<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.779> first<00:00:25.019> at<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.099> second<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
that we use the first at the second the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.810 
that we use the first at the second the
third<00:00:26.750> not<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.930> fourth<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.590> fifth<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.519> not

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
third not the fourth the fifth and not

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.540 
third not the fourth the fifth and not
the<00:00:30.000> sixth<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.510> not<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.869> seventh<00:00:31.260> but<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
the sixth and not the seventh but the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.150 
the sixth and not the seventh but the
octave<00:00:32.940> again<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> first<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.380> third<00:00:34.440> we

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
octave again so the first the third we

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.080 
octave again so the first the third we
can<00:00:35.280> do<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.460> third<00:00:35.670> here<00:00:37.430> the<00:00:38.430> fifth<00:00:38.700> instead

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
can do the third here the fifth instead

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.500 
can do the third here the fifth instead
of<00:00:39.180> doing<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.420> there<00:00:39.690> will<00:00:40.530> be<00:00:40.559> here<00:00:41.420> that<00:00:42.420> way

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
of doing it there will be here that way

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.760 
of doing it there will be here that way
we<00:00:42.629> can<00:00:42.780> play<00:00:42.870> three<00:00:43.079> notes<00:00:43.110> at<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.379> same<00:00:43.590> time

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
we can play three notes at the same time

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.560 
we can play three notes at the same time
so<00:00:44.370> that's<00:00:44.489> fourth<00:00:44.820> string<00:00:45.149> third<00:00:45.420> fret

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
so that's fourth string third fret

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.479 
so that's fourth string third fret
middle<00:00:46.050> finger<00:00:46.289> third<00:00:46.500> string<00:00:46.530> second<00:00:47.430> fret

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
middle finger third string second fret

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.709 
middle finger third string second fret
first<00:00:48.480> finger<00:00:48.539> second<00:00:49.110> string<00:00:49.140> first<00:00:49.980> fret

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
first finger second string first fret

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.000 
first finger second string first fret
and<00:00:51.840> that's<00:00:52.170> our<00:00:52.320> three<00:00:52.530> notes<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.980> major

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
and that's our three notes of a major

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.310 
and that's our three notes of a major
scale<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:54.149> make<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.449> chord<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.840> first<00:00:55.019> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
scale that make the chord the first the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.139 
scale that make the chord the first the
third<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.860> fifth<00:00:56.039> now<00:00:56.820> we're<00:00:57.000> going<00:00:57.090> to

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
third and the fifth now we're going to

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.509 
third and the fifth now we're going to
let<00:00:57.269> the<00:00:57.390> seventh<00:00:57.719> rest<00:00:58.039> and<00:00:59.039> we<00:00:59.129> use<00:00:59.280> what<00:00:59.460> we

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
let the seventh rest and we use what we

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.670 
let the seventh rest and we use what we
call<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> active<00:01:00.300> which<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.019> the<00:01:01.140> eighth<00:01:01.350> or

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
call the active which is the eighth or

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.460 
call the active which is the eighth or
the<00:01:01.769> first<00:01:01.980> year<00:01:02.250> one<00:01:02.670> three<00:01:03.059> five<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.750> eight

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
the first year one three five and eight

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.130 
the first year one three five and eight
nice<00:01:05.369> thing<00:01:05.549> about<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.150> gives<00:01:06.869> me<00:01:06.990> my

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
nice thing about this is gives me my

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.210 
nice thing about this is gives me my
first<00:01:07.440> third<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.130> fifth<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:10.220> unmovable

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
first third and fifth as a unmovable

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.160 
first third and fifth as a unmovable
triad<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.270> don't<00:01:12.450> get<00:01:12.630> anything<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:13.080> between

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
triad you don't get anything in between

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.340 
triad you don't get anything in between
them<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.159> don't<00:01:14.430> want<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.610> break<00:01:14.820> up<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
them so I don't want to break up the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.749 
them so I don't want to break up the
continuity<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:17.420> arpeggio<00:01:19.130> by<00:01:20.130> using<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
continuity of that arpeggio by using a

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.120 
continuity of that arpeggio by using a
different<00:01:21.420> version<00:01:21.690> like<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.799> would<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
different version like it would in the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.529 
different version like it would in the
Caged<00:01:23.430> method<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.030> I'll<00:01:24.090> explain<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.390> later

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
Caged method and I'll explain that later

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.330 
Caged method and I'll explain that later
but<00:01:24.840> let's<00:01:24.990> get<00:01:25.110> down<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.679> understanding<00:01:25.950> this

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
but let's get down to understanding this

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.980 
but let's get down to understanding this
so<00:01:26.490> we<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> first<00:01:27.000> third<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.659> fifth

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
so we have the first third and fifth

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.200 
so we have the first third and fifth
that's<00:01:28.890> one<00:01:29.190> way<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.369> play<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.640> chord<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.149> I

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
that's one way to play a chord and I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.499 
that's one way to play a chord and I
play<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.509> octave<00:01:30.929> of<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.080> first

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
play the octave of the first

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.880 
play the octave of the first
so<00:01:33.509> that's<00:01:33.690> my<00:01:33.810> first<00:01:34.020> way<00:01:34.289> to<00:01:34.350> play<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.679> kick

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
so that's my first way to play the kick

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.499 
so that's my first way to play the kick
the<00:01:35.130> chord<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.670> next<00:01:35.909> way<00:01:36.030> would<00:01:36.210> be<00:01:36.300> to

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
the chord and the next way would be to

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.779 
the chord and the next way would be to
start<00:01:36.690> on<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.899> third<00:01:36.929> note<00:01:37.399> so<00:01:38.399> I'll<00:01:38.490> do<00:01:38.640> that

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
start on the third note so I'll do that

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.749 
start on the third note so I'll do that
on<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.030> fourth<00:01:39.270> string<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:41.280> that's<00:01:41.429> my<00:01:41.580> third

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
on the fourth string so that's my third

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.309 
on the fourth string so that's my third
note<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.119> scale<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.569> after<00:01:43.050> that<00:01:43.140> I'll

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:43.319 
note of the scale and after that I'll

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.830 
note of the scale and after that I'll
use<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.649> fifth<00:01:43.970> which<00:01:44.970> I'll<00:01:45.149> do<00:01:45.270> here<00:01:45.300> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
use the fifth which I'll do here the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.710 
use the fifth which I'll do here the
third<00:01:46.050> string<00:01:46.380> my<00:01:47.190> octave<00:01:47.580> of<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.759> first<00:01:48.000> I'll

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
third string my octave of the first I'll
