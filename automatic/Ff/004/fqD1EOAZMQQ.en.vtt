00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
now basically it's the same principle

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.560 
now basically it's the same principle
with<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.900> z10<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.740> do<00:01:35.369> wish<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.880> cable<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
with the z10 I do wish the cable and the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.940 
with the z10 I do wish the cable and the
q10<00:01:36.930> battery<00:01:37.229> bundle<00:01:37.530> was<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.650> little<00:01:37.860> bit

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
q10 battery bundle was a little bit

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.850 
q10 battery bundle was a little bit
longer<00:01:38.189> like<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.670> z10<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.350> but<00:01:40.350> unfortunately

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
longer like the z10 is but unfortunately

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.600 
longer like the z10 is but unfortunately
not<00:01:42.710> same<00:01:43.710> thing<00:01:43.860> we<00:01:44.009> plug<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:46.430> hit<00:01:47.430> that

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
not same thing we plug it in hit that

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.160 
not same thing we plug it in hit that
button<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:49.670> now<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.729> z10<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.659> also<00:01:52.200> charging

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
button and now the z10 is also charging

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.660 
button and now the z10 is also charging
most<00:01:55.170> people<00:01:55.439> take<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:55.950> flip<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.430> way

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
most people take it and flip it this way

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.120 
most people take it and flip it this way
I<00:01:57.110> for<00:01:58.110> some<00:01:58.229> reason<00:01:58.290> like<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.770> flip<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.040> around

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
I for some reason like to flip it around

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.219 
I for some reason like to flip it around
this<00:01:59.399> way<00:01:59.579> just<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.420> keep<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.689> battery<00:02:00.990> on<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
this way just to keep the battery on the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.280 
this way just to keep the battery on the
way<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.619> set<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.460> down<00:02:03.320> okay

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
way and set it down okay

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.480
