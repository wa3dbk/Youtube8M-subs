00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
it to be the little animal print and I

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.880 
it to be the little animal print and I
am<00:01:50.220> going<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.670> place<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:54.290> layer<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.440> batting

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
am going to place a layer of batting

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.020 
am going to place a layer of batting
which<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.250> cut<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.760> same<00:01:57.030> width<00:01:57.330> as<00:01:57.570> my<00:01:57.600> strip

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
which is cut the same width as my strip

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.750 
which is cut the same width as my strip
so<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.360> make<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> fabric<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.530> sandwich<00:02:02.490> and

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
so I just make a fabric a sandwich and

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.130 
so I just make a fabric a sandwich and
then<00:02:03.290> the<00:02:04.290> tricky<00:02:04.740> part<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:06.020> what<00:02:07.020> I'm

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
then the tricky part to this is what I'm

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.059 
then the tricky part to this is what I'm
going<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.500> do<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:08.069> take<00:02:08.399> my<00:02:08.640> top<00:02:08.970> fabric<00:02:09.390> and

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
going to do is take my top fabric and

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.030 
going to do is take my top fabric and
put<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.189> to<00:02:11.430> right<00:02:12.420> sides<00:02:12.780> together<00:02:13.019> to<00:02:13.830> that

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
put it to right sides together to that

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.510 
put it to right sides together to that
strip<00:02:14.610> I'm<00:02:15.739> going<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.950> layer<00:02:17.370> my<00:02:17.760> batting<00:02:18.269> next

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
strip I'm going to layer my batting next

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.230 
strip I'm going to layer my batting next
then<00:02:20.520> I<00:02:20.700> flip<00:02:21.209> this<00:02:21.450> over<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:23.640> put<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.030> last

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
then I flip this over and I put the last

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.490 
then I flip this over and I put the last
strip

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
strip

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.240 
strip

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.110 
on the bottom so this is for my first
row<00:02:29.960> now<00:02:30.960> we<00:02:31.020> need<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.680> do<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.890> row<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.400> stitching

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
row now we need to do a row of stitching

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.110

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.740 

now<00:04:03.780> just<00:04:04.110> that<00:04:04.380> quick<00:04:04.800> I<00:04:05.160> have<00:04:05.820> my<00:04:06.360> row<00:04:06.570> of

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
now just that quick I have my row of

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.950 
now just that quick I have my row of
stitching<00:04:07.350> on<00:04:07.500> this<00:04:07.980> side<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:08.610> you<00:04:09.330> can<00:04:09.570> see

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
stitching on this side and you can see

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.740 
stitching on this side and you can see
the<00:04:10.800> chain<00:04:11.130> stitch<00:04:11.490> on<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.910> other<00:04:11.940> which<00:04:12.570> is

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
the chain stitch on the other which is

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.400 
the chain stitch on the other which is
very<00:04:13.020> strong<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:13.920> very<00:04:13.950> durable<00:04:15.350> now<00:04:16.350> the

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
very strong and very durable now the

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.970 
very strong and very durable now the
next<00:04:17.010> step<00:04:17.250> is<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.700> bring<00:04:18.140> that<00:04:19.140> second<00:04:19.800> layer

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
next step is to bring that second layer

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.290 
next step is to bring that second layer
forward<00:04:20.670> on<00:04:20.820> this<00:04:21.390> side<00:04:22.790> then<00:04:23.790> I'm<00:04:23.940> going<00:04:24.180> to

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
forward on this side then I'm going to

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.290 
forward on this side then I'm going to
flip<00:04:24.600> it<00:04:24.630> over<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:28.250> bring<00:04:29.250> these<00:04:29.520> forward<00:04:30.150> on

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
flip it over and bring these forward on

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.740 
flip it over and bring these forward on
this<00:04:31.200> side<00:04:33.410> so<00:04:34.410> just<00:04:34.440> like<00:04:35.130> that<00:04:35.550> we<00:04:36.480> have

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
this side so just like that we have

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.080 
this side so just like that we have
completed<00:04:37.350> two<00:04:38.220> rows<00:04:38.520> of<00:04:38.790> our<00:04:39.210> quilt<00:04:40.700> the<00:04:41.700> next

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
completed two rows of our quilt the next

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.570 
completed two rows of our quilt the next
step<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.720> best<00:04:42.900> step<00:04:43.200> would<00:04:43.350> be<00:04:43.410> to<00:04:43.530> go<00:04:43.830> in<00:04:44.100> to

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
step the best step would be to go in to

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.660 
step the best step would be to go in to
the<00:04:44.730> iron<00:04:44.940> and<00:04:45.330> press<00:04:45.900> these<00:04:46.320> then<00:04:47.190> I<00:04:47.220> would<00:04:47.490> go

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
the iron and press these then I would go

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.570 
the iron and press these then I would go
to<00:04:47.700> my<00:04:48.030> rotary<00:04:48.450> cutter<00:04:48.600> and<00:04:49.400> straighten<00:04:50.400> this

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
to my rotary cutter and straighten this

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.310 
to my rotary cutter and straighten this
to<00:04:50.790> make<00:04:50.970> sure<00:04:51.000> everything<00:04:51.870> is<00:04:52.020> running

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
to make sure everything is running

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.560 
to make sure everything is running
straight<00:04:53.930> then<00:04:54.930> I'm<00:04:55.140> ready<00:04:55.380> for<00:04:55.650> my<00:04:55.800> third<00:04:56.130> row

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
straight then I'm ready for my third row

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:03.200 
straight then I'm ready for my third row
which<00:04:57.570> again<00:04:57.990> I<00:04:58.290> place<00:04:59.280> this<00:04:59.790> on<00:05:00.060> top<00:05:01.880> place<00:05:02.880> my

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
which again I place this on top place my

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.690 
which again I place this on top place my
batting<00:05:03.780> on<00:05:04.820> top<00:05:05.820> of<00:05:06.030> that<00:05:06.210> piece<00:05:06.540> I<00:05:07.550> flip<00:05:08.550> it

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
batting on top of that piece I flip it

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:15.640 
batting on top of that piece I flip it
to<00:05:08.910> the<00:05:09.090> back<00:05:13.010> put<00:05:14.010> the<00:05:14.040> bottom<00:05:14.520> strip<00:05:14.880> on<00:05:15.090> and

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
to the back put the bottom strip on and

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:47.339 
to the back put the bottom strip on and
again<00:05:16.650> I<00:05:16.860> go<00:05:17.220> to<00:05:17.280> my<00:05:17.550> serger
