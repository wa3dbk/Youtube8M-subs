00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
up as you roam around the map is going

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.090 
up as you roam around the map is going
to<00:01:39.030> upgrade<00:01:39.240> your<00:01:39.750> basic<00:01:40.259> Dragon<00:01:40.619> Ball<00:01:40.770> attack

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
to upgrade your basic Dragon Ball attack

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.429 
to upgrade your basic Dragon Ball attack
into<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> super<00:01:42.270> dragon<00:01:42.630> sphere<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.200> that's

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
into a super dragon sphere and that's

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.139 
into a super dragon sphere and that's
going<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.649> do<00:01:43.799> more<00:01:43.950> damage<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.490> fire<00:01:44.909> at<00:01:45.090> a

going to do more damage and fire at a

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.670 
going to do more damage and fire at a
faster<00:01:45.509> rate<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:45.960> obviously<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:46.500> going<00:01:46.530> to

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
faster rate so obviously it's going to

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.109

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
manage to land it it does do quite a bit

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.040

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.400 
content we're done in less than 10
minutes<00:05:10.210> probably<00:05:10.539> I<00:05:10.720> think<00:05:10.960> this<00:05:11.080> one<00:05:11.260> goes

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
minutes probably I think this one goes

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.990 
minutes probably I think this one goes
about<00:05:11.440> seven<00:05:12.039> seven<00:05:12.310> and<00:05:12.400> a<00:05:12.430> half<00:05:12.460> minutes

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
about seven seven and a half minutes

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.969 
about seven seven and a half minutes
something<00:05:13.150> like<00:05:13.240> that<00:05:13.539> and<00:05:13.960> we<00:05:14.680> didn't<00:05:14.889> even

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
something like that and we didn't even

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:16.590 
something like that and we didn't even
have<00:05:15.190> two<00:05:15.430> full<00:05:15.700> teams<00:05:15.970> all<00:05:16.300> the<00:05:16.419> time

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
have two full teams all the time

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.659 
have two full teams all the time
sometimes<00:05:16.870> we<00:05:17.139> had<00:05:17.320> three<00:05:17.889> or<00:05:18.010> four<00:05:18.220> or<00:05:18.400> four

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
sometimes we had three or four or four

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.029 
sometimes we had three or four or four
on<00:05:18.820> five<00:05:19.110> so<00:05:20.110> it's<00:05:20.289> definitely<00:05:20.710> going<00:05:20.830> to<00:05:20.889> be<00:05:21.010> a

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
on five so it's definitely going to be a

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.190 
on five so it's definitely going to be a
fast-paced<00:05:21.700> action<00:05:21.970> packed<00:05:22.300> mode<00:05:22.479> that<00:05:23.020> you

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
can jump in and complete a game pretty
