00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.620
 small video about two gaming articles 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.040
 who got sent by laien cast 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.629
 have 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.250
 I would like to say that first 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.320
 although I keep the things video 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.000
 absolute may only my opinion called 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.519
 and that's the way it is with linen cast 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.809
 agreed and as desired by those 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.990
 First I want you the mechanical 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.820
 keyboard leyen cast erika 30 imagine 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.710
 the keyboard are completely black 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.189
 held and has a white 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.960
 backlight to the me now 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.340
 can be adjusted to adjust the 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.510
 different modes of lighting 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.769
 such is the strength , for example 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.359
 changeable, however, can also be changed 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.160
 turn on games like for example 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.840
 the wave mode being each 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.730
 keyboard stops a wave of 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.260
 lights are activated I think 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.730
 personally fully horny I get up like that 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.800
 fast, but there we come now 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.079
 to a small point of criticism I know 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.730
 Although that matters and his yes 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.770
 completely unimportant and unnecessary that is now 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.350
 to mention personally I would think colorful 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.270
 light just a lot cooler so easy 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.010
 only better than white but as I said 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.660
 my opinion also one can its 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.579
 Let the keyboard breathe or the keyboard 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.989
 according to ambient noise the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.039
 let equalizer play 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.199
 Schnickschnack you do not necessarily 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.670
 but the cool one is about the new one 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.199
 cast button which on the top right 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.299
 can be placed between gaming 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.860
 and office mode switch in the inside 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.420
 game mode will then be the example of 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.770
 windows button disabled so that one 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.810
 not out of it when gambling on it 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.549
 Good for you because the keyboard 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.140
 However, a mechanical keyboards in 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.640
 my case with brown cherry switches 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.810
 equipped is the keyboard 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.799
 slightly higher, but you have to do that now 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.540
 times if you look at one 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.280
 mechanical keyboard I bought it found 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.270
 really annoying at the beginning but me 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.520
 I make friends very nice so 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.840
 I have to say the top of a keyboard 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.670
 we still have four macro buttons for 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.350
 programming your own key combination 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.610
 I like the keyboard all around 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.409
 she is smart to look at and 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.420
 works great nothing wrong 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.640
 the mouse you want to introduce yourself 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.500
 small box m30 and falls immediately 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.610
 strong with her many lights on me 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.250
 have the course times in green 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.630
 set and already heard you can 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.159
 the mouse is not complete with its own 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.509
 you can feed colors every mood 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.520
 stop to choose another color 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:58.290
 on the left side we have where the 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.009
 thumb on it put 12 12 12 buttons to 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.360
 vacant 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.070
 So I have something on it then how 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.719
 next song has to pause or 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.219
 microphone mute capable of really cool 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.770
 and now something that really surprises me 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.509
 it does not bother playing and that 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.709
 I was really surprised and I have 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.400
 never provided any 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.470
 become 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.329
 also a song there is a plus point 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.799
 Attention, some could use the buttons 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.209
 may disturb which, although 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.439
 ergonomically adjusted but depending on 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.239
 how sensitive some people are 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.799
 Maybe they could bother and around 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.450
 to be honest I have no idea 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.400
 I tell you, even versions of 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.200
 That's why it was the first time 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.000
 but you have not stopped either 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.379
 a little try and keyboard 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.750
 to test then maybe now really 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.670
 your world has come long ago for me 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.829
 for one of you still the amateur kastel 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.180
 k10 keyboard sent with the castle 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.370
 is the win then sets up 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.709
 twitter with you and a tweet why you 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.450
 want to have the keyboard under hashtag 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.519
 Send riol keyboard 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.519
 that was it in and see you soon
