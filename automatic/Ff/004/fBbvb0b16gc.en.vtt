Now you did a jailbreak and all is cool on your phone

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.500
But now, when i want install my apps, iTunes 
 tells me: NO. It just doesnt work

00:00:24.288 --> 00:00:28.288
It shows me ERROR 0xE8008001

00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:34.267
I simple cannot install my own apps anymore

00:00:35.338 --> 00:00:39.338
But there is a solution to solve that issue

00:00:40.043 --> 00:00:43.043
and this i wanne show you today

00:00:43.514 --> 00:00:46.514
First you must start Cydia on your iOS Device

00:00:46.502 --> 00:00:49.502
And here we have to install a package

00:00:49.804 --> 00:00:52.804
Click on the bottom line to MANAGE

00:00:52.708 --> 00:00:54.708
Now click to SOURCES

00:00:55.143 --> 00:00:57.143
Click now the EDIT button on the right top corner

00:00:57.412 --> 00:00:59.412
Now click the ADD on the corner top left

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.280
Now you must add this URL

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.140
Now click the Add Source button

00:01:14.014 --> 00:01:18.014
You get a warning now, just ignore it! And add the source

00:01:18.925 --> 00:01:21.925
Now it adds the source to the repository of Cydia apps

00:01:22.204 --> 00:01:24.204
Back to Cydia now!

00:01:24.307 --> 00:01:26.307
Click Categories now on the bottom

00:01:26.292 --> 00:01:28.292
choose hackulo.us

00:01:28.511 --> 00:01:33.511
Now choose the right AppSync for the installed iOS version on your device

00:01:36.618 --> 00:01:40.620
Click it and on top corner right you 
 see the INSTALL button, click it :)

00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:43.010
And click it again to accept

00:01:43.118 --> 00:01:46.120
It might take a moment now as it gets all installed

00:01:44.913 --> 00:01:46.910
Click BACK TO CYDIA

00:01:51.107 --> 00:01:54.110
I would suggest you restart the iOS device!

00:01:58.543 --> 00:02:02.540
After the restart you might wonder that you see no changes :)

00:02:02.834 --> 00:02:06.830
The reason is that this is an internal fix, so nothing interface related

00:02:09.606 --> 00:02:13.610
So lets reconnect the iPad to my Mac and see what happens

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.930
I sync all my apps again and if 
 all is well the error should disapear
