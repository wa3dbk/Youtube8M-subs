00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.070 
wear with that much so let's go and
build<00:02:28.780> a<00:02:28.930> little<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.500> guess<00:02:30.330> views<00:02:31.330> get<00:02:31.810> there

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
build a little I guess views get there

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.970 
build a little I guess views get there
and<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:33.780> guess<00:02:34.780> well<00:02:35.170> should<00:02:35.440> we<00:02:35.470> just<00:02:35.650> start<00:02:35.860> it

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
and I guess well should we just start it

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.910 
and I guess well should we just start it
inside<00:02:36.130> here<00:02:36.670> I<00:02:37.200> hadn't<00:02:38.200> fill<00:02:38.320> this<00:02:38.470> up<00:02:38.530> and

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
inside here I hadn't fill this up and

inside here I hadn't fill this up and
then<00:02:38.980> fill<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:39.460> up<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.760> I'll<00:02:39.940> be<00:02:40.060> ready<00:02:40.240> to

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
then fill this up and I'll be ready to

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.660 
then fill this up and I'll be ready to
go<00:02:40.360> forgot<00:02:41.290> about<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.890> should've<00:02:42.370> talking

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
just because i think it's needed so I'm

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.260 
just because i think it's needed so I'm
just<00:03:49.950> going<00:03:50.100> to<00:03:50.160> build<00:03:50.370> this<00:03:50.490> pretty<00:03:50.820> far<00:03:51.090> out

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
just going to build this pretty far out

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.060 
just going to build this pretty far out
i<00:03:51.300> can<00:03:51.660> put<00:03:51.960> repeaters<00:03:52.470> so<00:03:52.680> i<00:03:52.710> could<00:03:52.980> go

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
i can put repeaters so i could go

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.800 
i can put repeaters so i could go
farther<00:03:53.810> so<00:03:55.670> I'd<00:03:56.670> say<00:03:56.850> this<00:03:56.970> be<00:03:57.180> good<00:03:57.420> distance

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
farther so I'd say this be good distance

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.390 
farther so I'd say this be good distance
I'm<00:03:57.990> just<00:03:58.170> laughs<00:03:58.380> look<00:03:58.770> at<00:03:58.860> it<00:03:59.010> and<00:03:59.100> i<00:03:59.220> will

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
I'm just laughs look at it and i will

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.080 
I'm just laughs look at it and i will
turn<00:03:59.550> take<00:03:59.850> time<00:04:00.000> before<00:04:00.120> i<00:04:00.330> do<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.600> by<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.840> way

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
turn take time before i do it by the way

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.300 
turn take time before i do it by the way
something<00:04:03.090> found<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:04.050> repeaters<00:04:04.470> here<00:04:04.650> but

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
something found the repeaters here but

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.070 
something found the repeaters here but
yeah<00:04:05.460> just<00:04:05.760> I<00:04:06.060> wanted<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.540> get<00:04:06.600> those<00:04:06.750> videos
