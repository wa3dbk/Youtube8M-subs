00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.480
 Hey guys, you too, Lucas. 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.340
 of the working-class rage and today 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.630
 I bring you the temperature test 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.270
 consume noise with the r9 390 shale and ex 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.609
 this farm at the end of the video I'll show you 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.039
 also some benchmark results 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.140
 you are at this moment in time. 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.970
 viewing a temperature and consumption test 3 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.150
 May strike performance 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.850
 side by side we have the board in stock 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.590
 and overclock at the top of the screen we have the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.860
 information about the video card and 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:43.200
 Processor 90 now 47 here are four 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.570
 points 55 to the network and memory to 2,133 mega 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.340
 hertz at the bottom of the screen 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.129
 they are seeing a device that the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.320
 p3d internet does not show with your 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.870
 lotus the entire earthen bench is 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.489
 from the wall outlet, remembering that 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.039
 a difference between what is being 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.230
 required by the hardware what is being 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.420
 removed from the outlet because the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.240
 waste energy in the process of 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.890
 conversion and rectification and this difference 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.479
 you can find according to 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.310
 source efficiency 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.570
 for this reason I use one with high 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:19.380
 efficiency of the x760 80plus platinum 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.640
 up to 92% efficiency on average with 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.340
 board in stock 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.180
 the device registers about 420 hours 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.189
 extra power is taken with peaks up to 450 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.020
 watts at certain times 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.409
 with the overclocking board are strangers 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.590
 to take about 520 or 100 hours to 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.290
 than in stock with peaks up to 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.000
 544 ocs on the temperature 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.119
 How are you seeing a temperature 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.270
 very reasonable in stock the maximum value 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.880
 reached was 71 degrees in overclock was 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.670
 77 degrees on both tests 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.579
 the fan was in automatic mode then the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.920
 reasonable values showing that the 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:04.100
 safar did a great job on this board 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.100
 Ok let's go to the plate noise test 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.310
 the staff now let's see the results 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.190
 no 3d mark performance extreme and other 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.620
 with the video card in stock in 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.770
 overclock reminding that all tests 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.540
 made on the same bench of tests using 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.150
 the same processor on the same system 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.370
 operational and on the same day as in 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.290
 description left the result links 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:38.660
 if anyone wants to take a good look 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:44.239
 stock at r 9 390 x made 13 1,212 points 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:47.150
 in overclock she made 14,390 a raise 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.760
 of 8.91 percent 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.590
 it was not the debut that extreme in stock 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:59.959
 she did 5,872 overclock again 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:02.630
 increase of 8.37 percent 6364 and 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:07.040
 finally would not make uterus 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:11.630
 she stocked 2,931 overclocked her 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:15.769
 made 3,173 in increase graph score 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.390
 of 8.25 percent and suffered a touch that 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.150
 I did on the personal board was the overclock 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.090
 The most I got from her without being 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.450
 unstable without stopping the test ok I rode 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.720
 with the GPU in the 1170 mega hertz and the 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.360
 memory at 1600mhz you are seeing 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.750
 on the screen the prints of the results 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.000
 Okay then the board as much as I 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.280
 I managed to extract it from the plate. 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.799
 The result is obvious that depending on the 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.780
 plate can you climb more or less 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:48.170
 that varies a lot 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:54.170
 ok and here on the channel I have tests with 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:56.299
 290 x with 970 980 with atomic to taeq 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.250
 So, whoever you want, feel free to 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.579
 compare the results have results there 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.070
 on several boards in these benchmarks in 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:07.430
 games also ok then in the description i will 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:10.190
 leave the results given 90 x that the 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.560
 predecessor of this hoq plate this Tuesday 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.630
 90 x what is this personal 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.609
 Thank you so much for getting here. 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.979
 I hope you have enjoyed the next 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.070
 I'm going to do some more tests with 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:22.820
 other 90 x at your request in emotion 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.730
 performance 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.860
 also in other resolutions and other 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.810
 Settings after many people 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.370
 Buy time to win 2k to get 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.610
 even four cards I'll show you 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.440
 you different resolutions ok then 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.450
 so you do not lose the drive if you 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.030
 not yet registered in the channel enjoy 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.370
 to sign up now, take your turn 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.770
 also operates and radio.br lucas pereira 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.970
 blog there on facebook can always some 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.510
 news 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.160
 This is what the next videos will look like ok 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.280
 the staff if you want to leave a 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.470
 suggestion some criticism in your opinion 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.300
 feel free to comment below 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.580
 see your like too if you like it 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.230
 this video and if you liked it so much then 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.870
 I ask you to share with your 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:08.000
 friends shows for them 's performance 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.090
 in that plate temperature and consumption 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.980
 noise she had suddenly will be a 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.640
 differential and for your friend to buy this 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:19.930
 plate or not ok then a big hug and 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.930
 see you later
