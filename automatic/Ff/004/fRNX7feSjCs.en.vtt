00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 very good to everyone in general we are in 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.060
 minecraft 1.7 points 10 let's see a 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.610
 mod a mod that adds a few weapons 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.950
 so very cool and let's go let's go 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.219
 proving the truth is that it is 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.350
 pretty good the weapons you're here has 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.690
 appeared here next is that this does not 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.070
 have nothing then in fact have a 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.199
 villager or two is not provided 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.180
 one go out to megan music and two messages 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.279
 there was only one is that it was sad 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.500
 poor, that's why this seed is a 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.910
 little kaka but good the question 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.969
 first we need to do this from here 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.100
 the blog launching part that is done with 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.020
 two pistons one of reston and one block 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.879
 of iron and from this we can 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.390
 make all other weapons for example 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.820
 the tnt launcher that is with good this is 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.870
 different where is he hey I want the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.949
 tnt launcher here estate with iron the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.520
 puppy we've seen the block 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.010
 launching part 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.400
 the lighter one of glass wood and 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.570
 remains we make this here that no 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.890
 there was man 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.989
 thus seen is a little bit here 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.320
 true but good works like a bow 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:12.380
 and only works with year tnt 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.720
 issues that you can not launch very 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.450
 fast indeed now I am 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.670
 holding down you see and it takes a while 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.729
 in reloading another tmt but good 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.920
 we also have the tnt canon this that 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.930
 it also only works with tnt which is one 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.200
 of iron the block lounge inn this a 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.759
 wood burner and rest and this the 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.640
 question is that it is faster but not 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.950
 it explodes directly I do not know if it's better 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.219
 when giving mod to know 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.490
 it does not just launch the activated TNT 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:45.679
 but does not directly exploit this if 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.469
 this as soon as you touch you see that it explodes very 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:51.079
 fast this is like it costs more 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:54.649
 but it launches faster that yes then the 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.869
 block riffel this rifle fixed my level of 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.659
 very good english from here with none 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.700
 of iron the blog clown without this one of 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.770
 rest to wooden child and this what 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.840
 allows is to throw blocks but to see a 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.569
 moment because copper this I think that 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.000
 also but obsidian for example of what 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.580
 that we're not going to try it anyway 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.069
 to see should launch land that is 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.660
 which is closer as you see we keep 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.860
 pressed and starts to throw like crazy 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.620
 pretty valley then let's see if 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.030
 you catch it too but it launches slower and 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.170
 you realize that throws much more 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.430
 slow 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.930
 and obsidian can not be there is another weapon 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.750
 which is for excited obsidian if 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.910
 this can throw light blocks because 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.010
 somehow then we have the south 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.950
 block this that is kind of like 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.120
 shotgun that is here that is done with 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.790
 a saw of the bloc launch impact this 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.410
 rest one of leather and a stick and this is 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.360
 a shotgun that is pretty biker 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.730
 it's just what I say this just for 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.780
 own light we give right click you see 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:03.100
 throwing as many while I am 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.100
 rebuilding this with the nonsense 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.269
 Ireland not having been rebuilt 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.750
 it happens to me here and to finish we have 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.000
 the canon blog this is done here 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.709
 we are with an obsidian blog lounge 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.519
 inn parts of the fiscal time that is done 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.560
 for all the arrest and one of one of 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.500
 iron and this what allows to launch 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.790
 heavy blocks ie the two by 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.890
 example counts as what the 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.299
 obsidian too and the question is that 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.370
 this is supposed to kill a blow 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:40.030
 always we will see Spanish Yes 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:43.660
 let's take off there we're going to try the 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.170
 Spanish obsidian took also in 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.170
 recharge 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.250
 but hey these are all weapons 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.470
 but I wanted to teach you for example with the 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.330
 rifle this we have seen that can 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.319
 throw lightweight blocks we can throw 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.840
 sab links for example 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.019
 well 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.580
 and they stay planted is pretty cool 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.490
 that we can rethink everything 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.040
 forest if we want 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.800
 he's very cool uncle but hey this is the 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.990
 model is a pretty curious mode 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.580
 also some pretty cool weapons 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.870
 hurt me especially what more what 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.930
 the more I felt I have not seen it has been what 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.180
 of the appas that is hallucinated 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.820
 the pity is that there is not one that throws 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.650
 faster even than this one would be 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.000
 cool to take by saco the villagers 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.000
 because it destroys 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:37.210
 the description 1.7 point 10 if it will be 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.240
 with forge et cetera I hope that I have 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.240
 liked 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.009
 bye
