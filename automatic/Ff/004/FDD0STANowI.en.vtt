it<00:01:00.390> because<00:01:00.539> they<00:01:00.629> can<00:01:00.780> go<00:01:00.870> off<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.199> watch<00:01:01.440> TV

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
it because they can go off and watch TV

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.280 
it because they can go off and watch TV
themselves<00:01:02.370> or<00:01:02.489> surf<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.820> internet<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.420> you

themselves or surf the internet and you
know<00:01:04.350> radio<00:01:04.799> then<00:01:05.369> they've<00:01:05.489> done<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.790> can

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
know radio then they've done you can

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.000 
know radio then they've done you can
google<00:01:06.150> these<00:01:06.270> studies<00:01:06.689> because<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:07.830> to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
google these studies because you have to

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.130 
google these studies because you have to
listen<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.610> then<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.750> your<00:01:09.930> mind

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
listen and then you have in your mind

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.560 
listen and then you have in your mind
images<00:01:10.939> everything<00:01:11.939> you're<00:01:12.060> hearing<00:01:12.390> if<00:01:12.479> I

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
to image it just from hearing it one way

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.440

Mesmer<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.719> mean<00:02:07.079> they<00:02:07.229> designed<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.979> take

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
Mesmer I mean they designed it to take

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.580 
Mesmer I mean they designed it to take
control<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.459> your<00:02:08.580> mind<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.720> they<00:02:10.440> are

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
control of your mind and so they are

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.100 
control of your mind and so they are
hitting<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.400> bombarding<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.360> with<00:02:12.390> this

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
hitting you and bombarding you with this

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.620 
hitting you and bombarding you with this
and<00:02:13.200> there's<00:02:14.190> all<00:02:14.340> these<00:02:14.490> studies<00:02:14.730> out<00:02:15.120> it's

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
and there's all these studies out it's

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.360 
and there's all these studies out it's
just<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.900> fact<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.320> violent<00:02:16.860> video<00:02:17.070> games

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
just a fact that violent video games

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.550 
just a fact that violent video games
bring<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.330> into<00:02:18.660> an<00:02:18.780> even<00:02:18.960> lower<00:02:19.140> state

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
bring you into an even lower state

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.500 
bring you into an even lower state
because<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.640> would<00:02:20.790> think<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.090> because

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
because you would think that because

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.960 
because you would think that because
you're<00:02:21.690> concentrating<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:23.190> watching<00:02:23.880> a

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
you're concentrating and watching a

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.460 
you're concentrating and watching a
screen<00:02:24.180> with<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.630> flicker<00:02:24.900> rate<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.350> would

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
screen with a flicker rate that would

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.260 
screen with a flicker rate that would
actually<00:02:25.740> increase<00:02:25.950> cognitive<00:02:26.460> but<00:02:27.180> it

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
actually increase cognitive but it

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.810 
actually increase cognitive but it
lowers<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:28.410> brain<00:02:28.680> not<00:02:29.010> just<00:02:29.220> into<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.460> sleep

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
lowers the brain not just into a sleep

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.760 
lowers the brain not just into a sleep
state<00:02:30.120> or<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.360> sleepwalking<00:02:30.960> state<00:02:31.230> but

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
state or a sleepwalking state but

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.800 
state or a sleepwalking state but
playing<00:02:32.040> video<00:02:32.310> games<00:02:32.640> for<00:02:33.240> long<00:02:33.390> periods<00:02:33.750> of

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
playing video games for long periods of

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.770 
playing video games for long periods of
time<00:02:33.890> will<00:02:34.890> people<00:02:35.430> die<00:02:35.730> doing<00:02:36.060> this<00:02:36.330> will

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
time will people die doing this will

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.860 
time will people die doing this will
bring<00:02:36.990> you<00:02:37.200> into<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:38.000> state<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:39.660> only

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
bring you into a state that is only

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.340 
bring you into a state that is only
found<00:02:40.200> in<00:02:40.440> people<00:02:40.590> with<00:02:40.740> serious<00:02:41.190> sleep<00:02:41.610> apnea

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
found in people with serious sleep apnea

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.560 
found in people with serious sleep apnea
very<00:02:43.350> low<00:02:43.680> oxygen<00:02:44.460> levels<00:02:44.790> but<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.030> oxygens

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
very low oxygen levels but the oxygens

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.960 
very low oxygen levels but the oxygens
there<00:02:45.810> but<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.620> areas<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.070> brain<00:02:47.190> go<00:02:47.550> into

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
there but the areas of the brain go into

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.870 
there but the areas of the brain go into
death<00:02:48.270> mode<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:49.130> because<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.430> people<00:02:50.610> are

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
death mode and because the people are

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.310 
death mode and because the people are
fully<00:02:51.150> focused<00:02:51.690> are<00:02:51.840> basically<00:02:52.140> like

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
fully focused are basically like

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.830 
fully focused are basically like
hypnotized<00:02:53.120> they're<00:02:54.120> they're<00:02:54.510> meditating

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
hypnotized they're they're meditating

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.900 
hypnotized they're they're meditating
and<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.980> mean<00:02:56.100> I'm<00:02:56.190> gonna<00:02:56.280> play<00:02:56.490> video<00:02:56.580> games

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
and I mean I'm gonna play video games

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.370 
and I mean I'm gonna play video games
and<00:02:57.120> then<00:02:57.240> that<00:02:57.390> was<00:02:57.480> just<00:02:57.630> donkey<00:02:57.959> kong<00:02:58.140> stuff

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
and then that was just donkey kong stuff

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.510 
and then that was just donkey kong stuff
and<00:02:58.500> I<00:02:58.530> would<00:02:58.620> get<00:02:58.709> so<00:02:58.740> focus<00:02:59.280> because<00:02:59.459> the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
and I would get so focus because the

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.180 
and I would get so focus because the
levels<00:02:59.790> have<00:02:59.880> took<00:02:59.970> such<00:03:00.180> exact<00:03:00.740> focusing<00:03:01.740> and

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
levels have took such exact focusing and

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.340 
levels have took such exact focusing and
you<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.459> for<00:03:02.610> hours<00:03:03.000> just<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.450> was<00:03:03.900> there<00:03:04.080> play

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
you and for hours just I was there play

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.230 
you and for hours just I was there play
and<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.160> remember<00:03:05.400> like<00:03:05.580> stopping<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.090> game

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
and I remember like stopping the game

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.160 
and I remember like stopping the game
when<00:03:06.360> somebody<00:03:06.570> came<00:03:06.750> in<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:06.959> I<00:03:06.990> would<00:03:07.050> be

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
when somebody came in and I would be

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.530 
when somebody came in and I would be
like<00:03:07.320> dizzy<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:07.920> then<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.370> in<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:08.550> daze<00:03:08.790> you

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
like dizzy and then and in a daze you

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.449 
like dizzy and then and in a daze you
were<00:03:09.630> under<00:03:09.959> mind<00:03:10.200> control<00:03:10.290> but<00:03:11.070> now<00:03:11.250> you're

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
were under mind control but now you're

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.880 
were under mind control but now you're
not<00:03:11.570> beating<00:03:12.570> you<00:03:13.110> know<00:03:13.200> stuff<00:03:13.440> with<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.620> hammer

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
not beating you know stuff with a hammer

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.949 
not beating you know stuff with a hammer
it<00:03:14.550> is<00:03:14.880> ripping<00:03:15.240> people<00:03:15.510> Scott's<00:03:15.750> out

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
it is ripping people Scott's out

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.239 
it is ripping people Scott's out
