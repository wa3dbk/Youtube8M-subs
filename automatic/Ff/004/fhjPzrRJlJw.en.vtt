 officially see what you have on 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.579

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.619
 average rate calculates 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.259
 sands for whom the thirty is God's co 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:13.700

 was on cards for someone 150 300 this 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.720
 allowable amount to each his 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.860
 let's not let go when in moderation 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.810
 its paranoid thinks about this figure 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.000
 how to withdraw money so that 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.729
 in fact, they were clean for you 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.250
 crystal clear nothing smarter and 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.010
 and about ide nothing exchangers yet 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.450
 came up with there are type 2 exchangers this 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.850
 exchangers which 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.270
 knock on skype and we say come on 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.549
 we would be on m in alpha and 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.670
 you actually transfer the person 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.680
 money from a private person besides they if 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.470
 you withdraw large sums that is thousands 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.070
 three hundred they will break you a payment from a cloud 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.140
 everyones 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.600
 private individuals, that is, you will receive a pack 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.900
 payments from individuals with any 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.200
 note style private gift transfer 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.220
 new year for a wedding for a bottle of jack 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.869
 Daniels 700 thousand rubles and 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.090
 accordingly so you get 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.640
 what you get is get money 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.680
 private person and nothing complicated with that 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.410
 no, they just gave me this 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.610
 or the second option is exchangers in your 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.860
 the city has some of them not even about 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.610
 what is a passport yes it happens you too 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.040
 Come 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.400
 translate mvm anyway and 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.390
 actually get your money 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.790
 in cash 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.740
 that is, the money will be clean you them 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.910
 got cash from where are they there is it already 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.680
 no no that's a completely different story 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.570
 be careful when withdrawing from webmoney 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.720
 that is, by means of deception 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.060
 that is, the right key to send to the bank 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.400
 bank with such methods be careful 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.830
 because many payments come from 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.690
 legal entity is even worse is even worse 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.540
 some payments account for a note 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.310
 for securities transactions if not 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.530
 I was mistaken for a long time did not remember 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.610
 so if you are soaring about it 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.890
 pay through private exchangers 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.739
 45 percent either arrange and pay 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.620
 pay 6 percent are you here on your 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.340
 taste and how ready you are for it 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.050
 so 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.060
 in general, until you earn 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.340
 decent amounts even in which it seems 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.680
 you are decent or which you think 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.080
 indecent don't worry about withdrawal 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.239
 all this is nonsense and everything will be fine 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.500
 most importantly do you earn these traffic with 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.120
 you were Alexander Kornilov
