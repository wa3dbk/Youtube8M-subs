00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:05.700
 there was when facing the next charismatic garment the 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.059
 organization the night my instinct percent garments 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.049
 as if always 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.269
 I feel very happy and wanting to share competence and efficiency 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.000
 Murray who knows all his roommates with seven 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.640
 there is not or there is not enough 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.999
 as well as four 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:30.300
 Four. Five% 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.110
 which is very strong 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.180
 what it does not do 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.050
 put my batteries 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.350
 well I'll try to present the people followed later from a little further 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.670
 chub properties 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.670
 40 and fell like this job 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.520
 these cases 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.960
 min 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.550
 one month 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.550
 nooo 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.839
 they do not exist 

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:02.839
 this month 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:37.089
 we go there to 

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:39.619
 assumption nov efe - 

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:40.939
 my love 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:44.269
 you have to discuss with respect 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:45.879
 the excellent 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.879
 impossible that is not so a demanding work wrong 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.879
 I ask you please keep and felt that you are worried and henry 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:55.649
 oltra 

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:56.499
 efe 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:59.499
 no not in my personal opinion 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.529
 I'm here for my personal opinion 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:06.529
 Perell was dismissed that having delivered 

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:13.549
 if this song is definitely on tour 

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.949
 for you 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:18.069
 for your voice 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:21.329
 interpretation that we have fit perfect 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.110
 but it seems a hundred 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.379
 that like 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:26.279
 to reach it 

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:29.430
 I'm worried about how Lorena says 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.770
 the voice that comes out perfect 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.310
 is to go the perfection producers 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.290
 but then 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.840
 when opening it have fun tineke 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.289
 and make all this movement not 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:45.649
 he has to be fluid has to not notice that the public does not feel that but 

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:47.159
 that he had forever 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:50.159
 But otherwise, fine 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.330
 in front of it I think it has 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.550
 we want problems with shifts 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.660
 by the way is guarded by the kills 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:05.340
 to try to attack a note 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.099
 at a given moment of the song 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:09.659
 perhaps 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:12.659
 in this edition 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.089
 at the beginning the aggression 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:18.309
 the bull such misfortune half bull higher 

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:23.779
 and I would not have been guarding that just to give one annotated one 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:25.889
 note that says 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.849
 to submit it 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:34.219
 maybe he revealed it as much cell as it came out much better now that does not bother me 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:38.499
 I do not mind tul bogarde I like a lot of wonderful time that 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:42.620
 I give you a gift but I feel that your presence and stage still leaves something 

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:44.409
 be desired 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.809
 who feels for this efe 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:49.710
 as the height of the deputy of psc 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.939
 because this what you like to be defense will be sung 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.889
 in that same audience that even 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:00.309
 even the league will be that I april in the 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:03.819
 yesterday track that there is not necessarily a scenic presence to do a lot 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:05.619
 of things on stage 

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:07.229
 but what not 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:10.229
 in its interpretation 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:12.189
 military 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:13.330
 peace 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.330
 on the other hand 

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:29.379
 how will you see 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:31.119
 when the public loves you 

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:34.119
 they forgive you 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.159
 However 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:39.960
 However 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.710
 not just an artist but any large person what a 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.190
 cameraman soundman is a carpenter a man who sells sandwiches 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:52.199
 it's not what others say about it in what sepad 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:54.499
 so 

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:57.089
 it is imperative 

00:06:57.089 --> 00:06:58.830
 that you understand 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:59.909
 that it got 

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:03.199
 it's much more powerful and much stronger than your stage presence 

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:08.330
 as soon as you want to marry the two as soon as the character of brenda 

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:12.750
 can be the one that goes out to sing that day you're going to break the entire fleet of 

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:15.599
 I recomend you 

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:18.210
 look at many videos of women artists 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.490
 for things I invented because you think but you really fix 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:26.520
 hands are essential as voice is no doubt the best 

00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:32.729
 given peace on the rise 

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:34.099
 the markets 

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:37.099
 the comments 

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:45.649
 the table after having won low have contributed nothing 

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:53.129
 3 

00:07:53.129 --> 00:07:53.639
