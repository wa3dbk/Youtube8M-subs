if<00:01:47.110> you<00:01:47.229> guys<00:01:47.350> even<00:01:47.560> noticed<00:01:47.979> it<00:01:48.100> or<00:01:48.250> thought

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
if you guys even noticed it or thought

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.490 
if you guys even noticed it or thought
it<00:01:48.520> was<00:01:48.610> a<00:01:48.670> problem<00:01:48.850> whatever<00:01:49.180> but<00:01:49.570> I<00:01:49.780> did<00:01:50.469> a

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
it was a problem whatever but I did a

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.840 
it was a problem whatever but I did a
little<00:01:50.619> bit<00:01:50.799> of<00:01:50.829> research<00:01:51.219> and<00:01:51.460> found<00:01:51.610> out

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
little bit of research and found out

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.480 
little bit of research and found out
that<00:01:51.909> it<00:01:52.360> can<00:01:52.600> be<00:01:52.810> your<00:01:53.530> power<00:01:53.890> supply<00:01:54.070> on<00:01:54.250> your

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
that it can be your power supply on your

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.800 
that it can be your power supply on your
pc<00:01:54.759> if<00:01:54.880> you<00:01:54.969> don't<00:01:55.119> have<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.359> best<00:01:55.539> power

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
pc if you don't have the best power

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.670 
pc if you don't have the best power
supply<00:01:57.060> sometimes<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.240> problem<00:01:58.450> dog<00:01:59.409> is

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
supply sometimes the problem dog is

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.380 
supply sometimes the problem dog is
shaking<00:02:00.130> I'm<00:02:00.340> sorry<00:02:00.579> if<00:02:00.700> you<00:02:00.759> heard<00:02:00.939> that<00:02:01.180> he's

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
shaking I'm sorry if you heard that he's

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.279 
shaking I'm sorry if you heard that he's
he's<00:02:01.810> kind<00:02:02.079> of<00:02:02.109> retarded<00:02:03.570> but<00:02:04.570> yeah<00:02:05.170> he<00:02:06.119> dog

let out fuck anyways what was i even
saying<00:02:12.580> oh<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:13.030> power<00:02:13.300> supply<00:02:13.570> so<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:13.930> did<00:02:14.290> a

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
saying oh the power supply so I did a

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.690 
saying oh the power supply so I did a
little<00:02:14.380> bit<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.680> research<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.190> I<00:02:15.250> found<00:02:15.280> out

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
little bit of research and I found out

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.680 
little bit of research and I found out
that<00:02:15.940> if<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:18.090> if<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:19.210> don't<00:02:19.360> have<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.570> best

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
that if you if you don't have the best

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.140 
that if you if you don't have the best
power<00:02:19.930> supply<00:02:20.320> sometimes<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.430> solution<00:02:21.610> can

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
power supply sometimes the solution can

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.920 
power supply sometimes the solution can
be<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:23.080> use

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
be to use

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.780 
be to use
an<00:02:24.140> external<00:02:25.810> hub<00:02:26.810> for<00:02:27.349> a<00:02:27.650> USB<00:02:28.129> hub<00:02:28.340> Jesus

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
an external hub for a USB hub Jesus

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.280 
an external hub for a USB hub Jesus
Christ<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.150> dog<00:02:29.299> got<00:02:29.480> me<00:02:29.599> all<00:02:29.719> flustered<00:02:29.900> I

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
Christ the dog got me all flustered I

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.270 
Christ the dog got me all flustered I
didn't<00:02:30.530> remember<00:02:30.680> what<00:02:30.859> I<00:02:30.920> was<00:02:31.040> talking<00:02:31.159> about

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
didn't remember what I was talking about

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.789 
didn't remember what I was talking about
but<00:02:31.819> a<00:02:31.879> USB<00:02:32.329> hub<00:02:32.540> with<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.959> power<00:02:33.290> supply<00:02:33.560> just

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
but a USB hub with a power supply just

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.979 
but a USB hub with a power supply just
just<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:34.430> regular<00:02:34.609> USB<00:02:35.120> hub<00:02:35.480> that<00:02:35.629> doesn't<00:02:35.900> have

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
just a regular USB hub that doesn't have

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.449 
just a regular USB hub that doesn't have
a<00:02:36.019> power<00:02:36.230> supply<00:02:36.379> won't<00:02:36.739> fix<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.069> problem<00:02:37.340> but

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
a power supply won't fix the problem but

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.059 
a power supply won't fix the problem but
and<00:02:38.239> I<00:02:38.299> actually<00:02:38.450> had<00:02:38.719> a<00:02:38.750> power<00:02:38.989> supply<00:02:39.140> USB

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
and I actually had a power supply USB

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.129 
and I actually had a power supply USB
hub<00:02:40.280> laying<00:02:40.489> around<00:02:40.730> so<00:02:40.939> I<00:02:40.969> tried<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:41.689> and<00:02:41.780> I

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:42.139 
hub laying around so I tried it and I

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:43.240 
hub laying around so I tried it and I
think<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.379> eliminated<00:02:42.769> a<00:02:42.920> lot<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:43.189> the

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
think it eliminated a lot of the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.789 
think it eliminated a lot of the
background<00:02:43.430> noise<00:02:43.819> in<00:02:44.120> my<00:02:44.150> audio<00:02:44.629> so<00:02:44.900> also<00:02:45.620> let

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
background noise in my audio so also let

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.160 
background noise in my audio so also let
me<00:02:45.829> know<00:02:45.920> if<00:02:46.310> you<00:02:46.459> guys<00:02:46.670> have<00:02:47.629> noticed<00:02:47.840> a

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
me know if you guys have noticed a

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.869 
me know if you guys have noticed a
difference<00:02:48.409> in<00:02:48.769> my<00:02:48.799> audio<00:02:49.280> quality<00:02:49.549> in<00:02:49.790> the

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
difference in my audio quality in the

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.539 
difference in my audio quality in the
last<00:02:50.030> couple<00:02:50.209> days<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.950> yeah<00:02:52.159> I've<00:02:52.250> got<00:02:52.430> that

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
last couple days so yeah I've got that

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.399 
last couple days so yeah I've got that
going<00:02:52.849> on<00:02:52.939> also<00:02:53.209> other<00:02:53.540> than<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:53.930> I<00:02:54.170> can

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:54.409 
going on also other than that I can

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.110 
going on also other than that I can
still<00:02:54.769> like<00:02:55.099> I<00:02:55.189> can<00:02:55.340> hear<00:02:55.489> my<00:02:55.609> fan<00:02:55.790> right<00:02:55.970> now

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
still like I can hear my fan right now

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.220 
still like I can hear my fan right now
and<00:02:56.239> it's<00:02:56.359> probably<00:02:56.629> being<00:02:56.780> picked<00:02:57.019> up<00:02:57.109> a

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
and it's probably being picked up a

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.039 
and it's probably being picked up a
little<00:02:57.470> bit<00:02:57.590> on<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:57.859> mic<00:02:58.480> my<00:02:59.480> fan<00:02:59.720> and<00:02:59.989> my

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
little bit on the mic my fan and my

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.030 
little bit on the mic my fan and my
computer<00:03:00.439> is<00:03:00.470> really<00:03:01.430> dusty<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:03.139> need<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.530> I

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
computer is really dusty and I need to I

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.429 
computer is really dusty and I need to I
need<00:03:04.579> to<00:03:04.790> take<00:03:04.939> the<00:03:05.030> case<00:03:05.180> off<00:03:05.389> my<00:03:05.599> pc<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:05.959> just

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:06.439 
need to take the case off my pc and just

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:07.990 
need to take the case off my pc and just
clean<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:06.769> fan<00:03:07.010> out<00:03:07.220> but<00:03:07.459> I<00:03:07.489> haven't<00:03:07.909> done

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
clean the fan out but I haven't done

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.209 
clean the fan out but I haven't done
that<00:03:08.060> yet<00:03:08.239> so<00:03:08.629> that's<00:03:09.349> also<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.739> little<00:03:10.010> bit<00:03:10.099> but

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:10.219 
that yet so that's also a little bit but

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:11.830 
that yet so that's also a little bit but
I'm<00:03:10.519> working<00:03:10.730> on<00:03:10.909> that<00:03:11.060> so<00:03:11.269> you<00:03:11.329> know<00:03:11.599> I<00:03:11.629> tried

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
I'm working on that so you know I tried

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.080 
I'm working on that so you know I tried
the<00:03:11.959> power<00:03:12.109> supply<00:03:12.319> USB<00:03:13.010> hub<00:03:13.219> and<00:03:13.609> I<00:03:13.790> think<00:03:14.000> it

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
the power supply USB hub and I think it

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.509 
the power supply USB hub and I think it
helped<00:03:14.329> a<00:03:14.419> little<00:03:14.659> bit<00:03:14.840> so<00:03:15.079> let<00:03:15.650> me<00:03:15.739> know<00:03:15.889> also
