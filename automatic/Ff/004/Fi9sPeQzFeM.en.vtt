00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.840
 hi to all moba lovers and men in 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.179
 multicolor tights on air 10 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.640
 superhero level intent krayzis 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.650
 moba game from turbines and and events 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.279
 unfolding in the cartoon universe of disi 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.039
 comic strip 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.590
 a world where heroes we are used to exist 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.260
 in several totally different friends 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.660
 other forms yet jo says 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.969
 us about the great threat to prevent 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.640
 which only the legendary can 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.290
 this very universe for that they 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.020
 there is a lot to train on 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.620
 special pvp arena than we actually 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:48.300
 and let's do the game brief information 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:51.329
 ppp have 1 no spread type 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:57.600
 frituley food platform running 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:59.460
 windows so the game meets us quite 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.829
 modest minimum in which eyes 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.769
 rush unless two buttons play and 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.380
 Of course the store well start 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.630
 perhaps it is from him shop here to me 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.150
 Auchan certainly pulls more on a small 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.600
 tent with crackers and in fact the whole 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.790
 u range comes down to three things a 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.979
 purchases of champions that is heroes in 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.740
 buying costumes for these same 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.409
 champions and in purchasing additional 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.960
 abilities for again these sleds 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.840
 champions at the moment 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.560
 do without donata and see what's here 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.990
 and without it, so we start the game on 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.049
 the choice we have is two modes gotham heights and 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.130
 split year map 1 very much 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.659
 looks like well yes to this 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.479
 moment she is on stage 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.090
 Beta testing in general, start with her 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.579
 wait a couple of minutes and here we are on the screen 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.850
 choose a character as they say choose 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.159
 your test he and 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.350
 characters and to say the least bit this 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.380
 the problem is easily solved in the store where 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.430
 as I said, you can buy your favorite 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.979
 heroes disi 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.380
 And besides, the upcoming update I 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.989
 I think just around the corner so the characters 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.510
 there will be many but for now let's ka 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.040
 content with the fact that there is a team 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.890
 opponent blue 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.410
 as we see hidden from my eyes and so 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.840
 it will be until the very beginning of the match in 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.239
 In general, without thinking twice about my choice, I guess 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.100
 I will stop on Batman's sworn enemy 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.180
 In this case, he sympathizes with me 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.120
 stronger than all 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.230
 and now the moment of loading the map 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.910
 lie down on the table and we see that the batman 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.910
 h4 two on each side 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.340
 poor-poor joker look at the map and 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.100
 we understand that yes we are in dota only instead 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.040
 all there sven juggernauts and course u 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.100
 us joker superman and batman and of course 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.970
 as everyone else in the rest of the same, and 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.230
 not about mid and then the same tower on the lines 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.019
 same creeps 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.170
 they are drones on line as well 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.989
 neutral deep in the map well this is the same 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.070
 the final challenge today we will talk about 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.130
 power 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.850
 except, unlike dota, there is no chat 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.850
 mata 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.110
 Yes, and then finish up the fungi is not necessary 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.420
 If you did not kill the creep 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.460
 all the same , their main money falls out 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.950
 have time to lift however and 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.930
 maximum number of monetary units per 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.730
 killing a single creep 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.210
 you only get in that case 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.340
 if you strike him the last blow and so 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.980
 a bit of heroes in our team with us 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.760
 here the usual batman he's a superman killer 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.870
 trasher i blaster and as many as two arrows 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.570
 steampunk batman and kiba 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.510
 as we see every character here perform 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.770
 our role and our task is only competently 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:05.510
 combine these same roles of their own 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:08.720
 heroes but we have so-so 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.670
 This is my first fight if you were attacked 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.860
 you can always merge to the base for 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.990
 restore mana and health 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.810
 the same can be done using the button 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.209
 b truth make it so us secluded 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.670
 place of the Russian Federation there they move not 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.950
 to base a straight to hell and the game of themes 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.800
 time constantly advises us what 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.590
 download and what to buy for me, for example 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.169
 as a beginner, quite like those who 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.930
 claws have already fallen and can help 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.780
 neglect self shaking something 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.030
 it seems to them the most optimal 2 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.380
 mode from afar looks like 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.750
 dominion and evil 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.020
 you just look at this map but 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.950
 getting here is very difficult i did 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.140
 about 15 attempts and this is not a joke 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:57.830
 some of which are on time out 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:00.230
 exceeded a full hour during this time you can 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.510
 play a couple of dota games or say 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.390
 Bleed a character in archeage up to 10 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.840
 level I have the exact same question 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:12.370
 buddy okay anyway with the second 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.860
 modes are available in the old fashioned and 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.320
 so the essence of the regime so we appear on 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.050
 round map with 5 control points and 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.210
 two player bases besides on it 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.020
 there is a central key . 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.699
 as well as various sites with buffs 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.910
 each team has five 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:32.620
 lines of health regime goals grab 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.060
 more checkpoints 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.740
 thereby depriving the opponent of a supply of points 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.800
 cards and then partially destroyed and 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.720
 some heroes say superman easily 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.490
 can lift a parked car and 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.009
 throw it at opponents 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.440
 also worth noting visibility zones and 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:52.270
 central points capture which 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.270
 possible through a certain segment 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.530
 time at the end I will say the same as in 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.539
 separate review 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.270
 the game is unlikely to seriously interest 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:01.870
 fans of dota and lola but fans of disi 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.259
 comic strip 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:07.750
 well here you and moba and favorite characters 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:10.020
 why not actually add on 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.569
 here also marvel would be generally 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:16.599
 awesome now 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:19.150
 but so, too, not bad but what I have to 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:21.969
 this all pump character up to 10 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.280
 level can also as in dota exactly for 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:28.110
 one fight everyone thanks 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.110
 don't get sick before new releases
