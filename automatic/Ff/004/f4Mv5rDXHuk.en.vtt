already<00:01:00.320> got<00:01:00.500> it<00:01:00.530> broke<00:01:00.860> of<00:01:01.130> course<00:01:02.440> but<00:01:03.440> this

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
already got it broke of course but this

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.170 
already got it broke of course but this
is<00:01:04.070> Spencer<00:01:04.460> next<00:01:04.699> cell<00:01:06.040> block<00:01:07.040> is<00:01:08.000> actually

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
is Spencer next cell block is actually

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.730 
is Spencer next cell block is actually
pretty<00:01:08.570> decent<00:01:08.750> I<00:01:11.229> mean<00:01:12.229> it<00:01:12.350> could<00:01:12.500> definitely

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
pretty decent I mean it could definitely

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.280 
pretty decent I mean it could definitely
use<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.310> torsion<00:01:13.910> bar<00:01:13.940> system<00:01:14.300> because<00:01:15.050> I<00:01:15.140> mean

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
use a torsion bar system because I mean

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.700 
use a torsion bar system because I mean
it<00:01:15.410> is<00:01:15.530> real<00:01:15.830> soft<00:01:16.720> but<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:17.840> tank<00:01:18.050> itself<00:01:18.380> is

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
it is real soft but the tank itself is

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:29.800 
it is real soft but the tank itself is
actually<00:01:19.900> you<00:01:20.900> know<00:01:20.990> not<00:01:21.229> that<00:01:21.259> bad<00:01:27.640> and<00:01:28.810> of

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
actually you know not that bad and of

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.420 
actually you know not that bad and of
course<00:01:30.020> I<00:01:30.140> got<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.440> airsoft<00:01:30.830> version<00:01:30.979> so<00:01:31.369> I

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430
