oil and garlic and then roasted so
that's<00:00:13.620> why<00:00:13.769> they're<00:00:13.950> this<00:00:14.099> dark<00:00:14.429> they<00:00:15.179> have

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
that's why they're this dark they have

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.359 
that's why they're this dark they have
roasted<00:00:15.870> taken<00:00:16.230> on<00:00:16.379> an<00:00:16.560> incredible<00:00:17.070> flavor

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.939 
roasted taken on an incredible flavor
and<00:00:17.670> as<00:00:18.449> they<00:00:18.690> rose<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.109> lose<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.350> lot<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.800> their

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
and as they rose to lose a lot of their

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.220 
and as they rose to lose a lot of their
moisture<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.699> they're<00:00:20.880> just<00:00:21.150> tiny<00:00:21.660> little

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
moisture and so they're just tiny little

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.550 
moisture and so they're just tiny little
little<00:00:22.859> morsels<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.869> eggplant<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.140> really

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
little morsels of eggplant that really

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.410 
little morsels of eggplant that really
hold<00:00:25.740> together<00:00:25.920> when<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.849> put<00:00:26.880> them<00:00:27.269> in<00:00:27.390> a

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
hold together when you put them in a

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.720 
hold together when you put them in a
soup<00:00:27.830> now<00:00:28.830> that's<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.279> key<00:00:29.460> here

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
soup now that's the key here

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.030 
soup now that's the key here
one<00:00:30.150> reason<00:00:30.359> for<00:00:30.539> two<00:00:31.230> reasons<00:00:31.560> for<00:00:31.710> roasting

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
one reason for two reasons for roasting

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.290 
one reason for two reasons for roasting
your<00:00:32.130> vegetables<00:00:32.669> for<00:00:32.820> soup<00:00:33.059> one<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:35.300> the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
your vegetables for soup one is the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.040 
your vegetables for soup one is the
flavor<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.809> much<00:00:37.559> more<00:00:38.120> amazing<00:00:39.120> much<00:00:39.690> more

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
flavor is much more amazing much more

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.709 
flavor is much more amazing much more
enjoyable<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> other<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:42.390> lose

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
enjoyable and the other is you lose

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.110 
enjoyable and the other is you lose
moisture<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:44.040> roasting<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.000> when

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
moisture in the roasting so that when

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.840 
moisture in the roasting so that when
you<00:00:45.210> put<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.510> into<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> soup<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:47.280> vegetable

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
you put it into the soup the vegetable

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.850 
you put it into the soup the vegetable
that<00:00:47.879> you've<00:00:48.120> roasted<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.660> not<00:00:48.870> likely<00:00:49.500> to

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
that you've roasted is not likely to

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.600 
that you've roasted is not likely to
fall<00:00:50.100> apart<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.610> your<00:00:50.640> soup<00:00:51.949> great<00:00:52.949> point<00:00:53.280> and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
fall apart in your soup great point and

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.729 
fall apart in your soup great point and
a<00:00:53.850> real<00:00:54.059> advantage<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:55.050> what<00:00:55.440> we're<00:00:55.590> going<00:00:55.680> to

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
a real advantage so what we're going to

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.660 
a real advantage so what we're going to
do<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.520> take<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:56.910> over<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.480> stove<00:00:57.539> and

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
do is take this over to the stove and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
do is take this over to the stove and
I've<00:00:59.670> already<00:00:59.969> made<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.480> cream<00:01:00.989> sauce<00:01:01.350> with<00:01:02.340> a

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
I've already made a cream sauce with a

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.530 
I've already made a cream sauce with a
based<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.199> bison<00:01:04.799> fat<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:05.909> fat<00:01:06.330> that

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
based on of bison fat this is fat that

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.410 
based on of bison fat this is fat that
came<00:01:06.689> off<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.260> bison<00:01:07.710> bones<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.549> were<00:01:08.790> being

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
came off of bison bones that were being

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.740 
came off of bison bones that were being
turned<00:01:09.869> into<00:01:10.080> bone<00:01:10.560> broth<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.600> in<00:01:12.600> our

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
turned into bone broth and in our

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.170 
turned into bone broth and in our
experiment<00:01:13.350> because<00:01:13.590> how<00:01:14.070> do<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.250> that's<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
experiment because how do you that's the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.760 
experiment because how do you that's the
way<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> learn<00:01:15.540> you're<00:01:15.780> always<00:01:15.930> trying<00:01:16.409> things

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
way to learn you're always trying things

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.580 
way to learn you're always trying things
so<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:18.270> looked<00:01:18.720> at<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.960> fat<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.409> thought

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
so I looked at the fat and I thought

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.899 
so I looked at the fat and I thought
this<00:01:19.799> looks<00:01:20.009> different<00:01:20.159> than<00:01:20.520> what<00:01:20.670> I'm<00:01:20.759> used

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
this looks different than what I'm used

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.810 
this looks different than what I'm used
to<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.240> terms<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.780> chicken<00:01:22.350> fat<00:01:22.619> or<00:01:22.979> beef<00:01:23.549> fat

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
to in terms of chicken fat or beef fat

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.249 
to in terms of chicken fat or beef fat
this<00:01:24.119> looks<00:01:24.330> really<00:01:24.450> different<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.020> looked

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
this looks really different it looked

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.410 
this looks really different it looked
like<00:01:25.380> almost<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.830> cosmetic<00:01:26.610> grade<00:01:26.909> of

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
like almost like a cosmetic grade of

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.630 
like almost like a cosmetic grade of
something<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:28.979> took<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> little<00:01:29.340> taste

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
something and so I took a little taste

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.630 
something and so I took a little taste
oh<00:01:30.680> you<00:01:31.680> know<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.799> took<00:01:31.890> another<00:01:32.220> little<00:01:32.490> taste

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
oh you know I took another little taste

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.670

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
line so you want we need to try this and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.370 
line so you want we need to try this and
see<00:01:35.579> what<00:01:35.850> happens<00:01:36.329> because<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.930> was<00:01:37.049> full<00:01:37.350> of

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
see what happens because it was full of

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.789 
see what happens because it was full of
flavor<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.240> once<00:01:39.240> we<00:01:39.509> tried<00:01:39.840> tried<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.740> a

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
flavor and once we tried tried it in a

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.520 
flavor and once we tried tried it in a
white<00:01:40.979> sauce<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.700> said<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.600> know<00:01:42.720> what<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.290> is

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
white sauce I said you know what this is

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.020 
white sauce I said you know what this is
a<00:01:43.560> basis<00:01:43.979> for<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.189> great<00:01:44.460> cream<00:01:44.820> soup<00:01:45.180> now<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
a basis for a great cream soup now the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.740 
a basis for a great cream soup now the
the<00:01:48.030> bison<00:01:48.600> flavor<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.380> strong<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:51.600> will

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
the bison flavor is strong and it will

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.109 
the bison flavor is strong and it will
sing<00:01:52.170> well<00:01:52.619> with<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> strong<00:01:53.549> flavor<00:01:53.970> of

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
sing well with a strong flavor of

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.880 
sing well with a strong flavor of
eggplant<00:01:54.600> once<00:01:54.810> you've<00:01:54.990> raced<00:01:55.259> roasted

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
eggplant once you've raced roasted

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.889 
eggplant once you've raced roasted
eggplant<00:01:56.130> with<00:01:56.670> garlic<00:01:57.210> you've<00:01:57.390> got<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> strong

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899

eggplant with garlic you've got a strong
flavor<00:01:58.140> here<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.920> those<00:01:59.130> two<00:01:59.340> flavors<00:01:59.790> will

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939

it<00:02:41.900> makes<00:02:42.020> it<00:02:42.170> even<00:02:42.320> more<00:02:42.470> fragrant<00:02:43.070> so<00:02:43.760> we'll

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120
