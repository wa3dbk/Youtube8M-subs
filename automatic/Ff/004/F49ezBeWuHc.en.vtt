00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
right here it is just gravity fed so you

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.330 
right here it is just gravity fed so you
don't<00:00:58.680> need<00:00:58.920> a<00:01:00.199> box<00:01:01.199> on<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.530> side<00:01:01.829> or<00:01:01.890> anything

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
10-gallon tank and i put a sheet of

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.920 
10-gallon tank and i put a sheet of
acrylic<00:01:33.689> right<00:01:34.259> here<00:01:34.970> so<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.090> water<00:01:36.299> goes

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
acrylic right here so the water goes

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.170 
acrylic right here so the water goes
through<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.350> pipe<00:01:37.619> goes<00:01:38.490> up<00:01:38.700> got<00:01:39.000> some

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
through this pipe goes up got some

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.039 
through this pipe goes up got some
bioballs<00:01:39.600> goes<00:01:40.560> over<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.729> right<00:01:42.570> here<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.810> got

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
bioballs goes over and right here I got

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.219 
bioballs goes over and right here I got
some<00:01:44.060> star<00:01:45.060> gray<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.509> don't<00:01:45.810> know<00:01:45.899> what<00:01:46.079> it's

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
some star gray I don't know what it's

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.200 
some star gray I don't know what it's
called<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:47.540> think<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:49.340> sees<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.549> ponds<00:01:50.820> and

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
called but I think it sees in ponds and

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.730 
called but I think it sees in ponds and
whatnot<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.899> some<00:01:52.890> e<00:01:53.009> hime<00:01:53.430> substrate<00:01:54.740> pretty

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
whatnot and some e hime substrate pretty

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.709 
whatnot and some e hime substrate pretty
sure<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.189> works<00:01:56.460> really<00:01:56.729> well<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.360> how<00:01:57.570> much

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
sure it works really well for how much

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.749 
sure it works really well for how much
it<00:01:57.869> costs<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.409> it's<00:01:58.649> kind<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:58.890> expensive<00:01:59.280> and

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
it costs it it's kind of expensive and

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.899 
it costs it it's kind of expensive and
so<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.840> see<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.200> water<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:02.250> goes<00:02:02.520> through

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
so you can see the water it goes through

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.200 
so you can see the water it goes through
here<00:02:03.390> goes<00:02:04.110> down<00:02:04.350> here<00:02:04.560> up<00:02:04.860> around<00:02:05.640> down<00:02:06.180> here

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
here goes down here up around down here

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.360 
here goes down here up around down here
and

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
and

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
and
then<00:02:07.490> you're<00:02:08.450> more<00:02:09.200> bioballs<00:02:09.800> and<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:11.090> pump

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
then you're more bioballs and the pump

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.700 
then you're more bioballs and the pump
is<00:02:11.720> right<00:02:12.140> here<00:02:12.670> it's<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:14.110> 425<00:02:15.110> gallon<00:02:15.500> per<00:02:15.620> hour

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
is right here it's a 425 gallon per hour

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.370 
is right here it's a 425 gallon per hour
pump<00:02:16.070> bought<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.150> from<00:02:17.270> home<00:02:17.510> depot<00:02:17.750> for<00:02:18.230> like

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
my imagination and it seems to be

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.070 
my imagination and it seems to be
working<00:04:28.390> pretty<00:04:28.960> well<00:04:29.850> so<00:04:30.850> all<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.690> doodoo
