two<00:01:07.260> tablespoons<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:08.460> flour<00:01:10.280> I'm<00:01:11.280> pretty<00:01:11.520> sure

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
two tablespoons of flour I'm pretty sure

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.550 
two tablespoons of flour I'm pretty sure
it<00:01:11.790> has<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.030> be<00:01:12.150> self<00:01:12.360> rising<00:01:12.689> flour<00:01:12.720> but<00:01:13.350> I

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
it has to be self rising flour but I

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.230 
it has to be self rising flour but I
didn't<00:01:13.770> have<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.310> added<00:01:14.490> some<00:01:14.640> baking

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
didn't have that so I added some baking

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.480 
didn't have that so I added some baking
powder<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:16.140> let's<00:01:16.380> hope<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.920> turns<00:01:17.250> out

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.700 
powder so let's hope that that turns out
ok<00:01:17.820> then<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.869> add<00:01:19.110> two<00:01:19.470> tablespoons<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:20.490> sugar
