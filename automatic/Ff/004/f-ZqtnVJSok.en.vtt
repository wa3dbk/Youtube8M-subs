00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
really you get two of each sides there

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.050 
really you get two of each sides there
you've<00:01:46.170> got<00:01:46.259> extra<00:01:46.560> small<00:01:46.799> small<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.340> large<00:01:47.850> I

you've got extra small small and large I
believe<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.570> there<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:48.990> put<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.409> side

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
believe in there so put that to the side

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.359 
believe in there so put that to the side
as<00:01:49.799> well<00:01:49.950> there's<00:01:50.850> nothing<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.299> one<00:01:52.369> and

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
as well there's nothing in this one and

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.010 
as well there's nothing in this one and
this<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.780> pair<00:01:54.990> of

this is the this is the pair of
headphones<00:01:55.229> itself<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.130> take<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.280> out

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
headphones itself and just take that out

give you a closer look there city is

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.240 
give you a closer look there city is
what<00:02:03.990> they<00:02:04.110> look<00:02:04.259> like<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.590> got<00:02:04.740> pioneer

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
what they look like so you got pioneer

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.950 
what they look like so you got pioneer
written<00:02:05.579> on<00:02:05.700> there<00:02:05.939> it's<00:02:06.420> got<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:06.719> our

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
written on there it's got this our

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.109 
written on there it's got this our
flexible<00:02:07.590> ear<00:02:07.920> clip<00:02:08.429> there<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.910> actually

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
flexible ear clip there so you actually

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.300 
flexible ear clip there so you actually
clip<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:09.810> on<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.050> year<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:11.009> will<00:02:11.129> give

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
clip that on to year and that will give

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.830 
clip that on to year and that will give
you<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.550> tight<00:02:11.819> fitting<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.450> need<00:02:12.629> as

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
you that tight fitting that you need as

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.880 
you that tight fitting that you need as
well<00:02:13.080> so<00:02:13.319> it's<00:02:13.470> not<00:02:13.530> going<00:02:13.709> to

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
well so it's not going to

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.309 
well so it's not going to
lose<00:02:14.550> so<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.180> would<00:02:15.330> adjust<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:16.020> your<00:02:16.170> ear

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
lose so that would adjust to your ear

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.559 
lose so that would adjust to your ear
size<00:02:16.590> as<00:02:16.830> well<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.700> if<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.910> look<00:02:18.060> on<00:02:18.180> here<00:02:18.300> one

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
size as well so if you look on here one

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.449 
size as well so if you look on here one
thing<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:18.900> they've<00:02:19.020> got<00:02:19.230> here<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.830> sort

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
thing that they've got here is this sort

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.210 
thing that they've got here is this sort
of<00:02:20.520> active<00:02:21.000> active<00:02:21.810> fit<00:02:22.080> mechanism<00:02:22.530> there<00:02:23.069> so

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
of active active fit mechanism there so

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.250 
of active active fit mechanism there so
it's<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.400> ball-joint<00:02:23.640> system<00:02:24.390> there<00:02:24.600> so<00:02:25.050> once

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
it's a ball-joint system there so once

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.840 
it's a ball-joint system there so once
you've<00:02:25.350> got<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:25.620> inside<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.130> here<00:02:26.280> this<00:02:26.670> will

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
you've got this inside of here this will

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.059 
you've got this inside of here this will
move<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.780> go<00:02:27.959> with<00:02:28.140> what<00:02:28.560> you're<00:02:28.680> doing<00:02:28.800> your

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
move to go with what you're doing your

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.770 
move to go with what you're doing your
movement<00:02:29.490> your<00:02:29.670> ear<00:02:29.880> shape<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.510> kind<00:02:30.690> of

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
movement your ear shape and that kind of

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.960 
movement your ear shape and that kind of
stuff<00:02:31.020> so<00:02:31.050> this<00:02:31.770> is<00:02:31.980> built<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.459> fit<00:02:32.640> everyone

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
stuff so this is built to fit everyone

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.340 
stuff so this is built to fit everyone
really<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:33.570> you<00:02:33.630> can<00:02:33.840> see<00:02:33.990> that<00:02:34.110> sort<00:02:34.320> of

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
really so you can see that sort of

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.900 
really so you can see that sort of
movement<00:02:34.470> there<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:34.980> moving<00:02:35.280> up<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.490> down<00:02:35.580> and

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
movement there so moving up and down and

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.330 
movement there so moving up and down and
also<00:02:36.510> moving<00:02:36.750> sideways<00:02:37.470> as<00:02:37.680> well<00:02:37.709> which<00:02:38.310> is

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
also moving sideways as well which is

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.100 
also moving sideways as well which is
really<00:02:38.820> good<00:02:39.000> it's<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.209> really<00:02:39.480> good<00:02:39.600> mechanism

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
really good it's a really good mechanism

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.170 
really good it's a really good mechanism
to<00:02:40.230> have<00:02:40.350> what<00:02:41.130> they've<00:02:41.250> also<00:02:41.370> got<00:02:41.640> is<00:02:41.910> coiled

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
to have what they've also got is coiled

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.880 
to have what they've also got is coiled
cable<00:02:42.959> there<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:43.350> that<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.620> can<00:02:43.770> actually

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
cable there so that you can actually

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.250 
cable there so that you can actually
have<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.250> extended<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:45.090> can<00:02:45.239> use<00:02:45.510> just<00:02:45.959> fully

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
have it extended you can use just fully

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.530 
have it extended you can use just fully
dynamic<00:02:46.500> really<00:02:47.070> to<00:02:47.190> movement<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:48.330> kind

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
dynamic really to movement and that kind

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.210 
dynamic really to movement and that kind
of<00:02:48.600> stuff<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:48.840> what<00:02:49.440> that<00:02:49.620> also<00:02:49.770> allows<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.190> to

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
of stuff so what that also allows you to

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.800 
of stuff so what that also allows you to
do<00:02:50.430> is<00:02:50.489> once<00:02:50.790> you've<00:02:50.910> got<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.090> on<00:02:51.300> your<00:02:51.510> ears

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
do is once you've got it on your ears

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.570 
do is once you've got it on your ears
behind<00:02:52.500> your<00:02:52.650> head<00:02:52.769> you<00:02:52.920> can<00:02:53.040> have<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.340> tied

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
behind your head you can have that tied

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.060 
behind your head you can have that tied
up<00:02:53.840> if<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:55.019> like<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:55.410> now<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.590> just<00:02:55.680> get<00:02:55.950> that

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
up if you like so now you just get that

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.620 
up if you like so now you just get that

extra fitting that you need the tight
fit<00:02:57.660> so<00:02:58.080> it's<00:02:58.470> not<00:02:58.650> annoying<00:02:58.860> or<00:02:59.190> moving

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
fit so it's not annoying or moving

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.550 
fit so it's not annoying or moving
everywhere<00:02:59.910> when<00:03:00.690> you're<00:03:00.810> working<00:03:01.200> our<00:03:01.320> way

so<00:03:17.850> you<00:03:17.910> can<00:03:18.030> see<00:03:18.209> nice<00:03:18.450> fit<00:03:18.810> there<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.230> it's

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
so you can see nice fit there and it's

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.199 
so you can see nice fit there and it's
got<00:03:19.709> that<00:03:19.890> extra<00:03:20.220> support<00:03:20.459> on<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.910> edge<00:03:21.000> on

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
got that extra support on the edge on

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.090 
got that extra support on the edge on
the<00:03:21.390> inch<00:03:21.540> there<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:21.989> that<00:03:22.170> won't<00:03:22.410> add<00:03:22.829> so<00:03:23.070> that

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
the inch there so that won't add so that

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.410 
the inch there so that won't add so that
means<00:03:23.370> it<00:03:23.459> will<00:03:23.519> last<00:03:23.670> long<00:03:23.850> basically<00:03:24.269> so

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
means it will last long basically so
