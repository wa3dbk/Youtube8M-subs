00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.210 
I'm actually working on at the moment I
thought<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:18.900> put<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.680> drops<00:01:20.040> -<00:01:20.189> I

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
thought I just put in the drops - I

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.499 
thought I just put in the drops - I
actually<00:01:20.400> got<00:01:20.549> throughout<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.180> end<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
actually got throughout the end of the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.969 
actually got throughout the end of the
task<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:21.900> if<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.049> click<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.380> video<00:01:22.530> every

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
task so if you click on this video every

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.429 
task so if you click on this video every
kill<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.250> actually<00:01:23.520> see<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.540> decimal<00:01:24.930> now<00:01:25.409> I

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
kill you actually see is a decimal now I

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.320 
kill you actually see is a decimal now I
decided<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.890> actually<00:01:26.009> make<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.790> put<00:01:27.210> in

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
decided to actually make it so I put in

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.730 
decided to actually make it so I put in
the<00:01:27.450> full<00:01:27.720> kills<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.170> could<00:01:28.350> have<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:28.590> skip

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
the full kills I could have just skip

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.810 
the full kills I could have just skip
straight<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.100> looper<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.610> video

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
straight to the looper and the video

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.749 
straight to the looper and the video
would<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.030> been<00:01:30.180> like<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.810> minute<00:01:31.470> long<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.070> I

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
would have been like a minute long and I

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:33.890 
would have been like a minute long and I
wouldn't<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:33.030> able<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.270> say<00:01:33.479> much<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:33.840> I

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
wouldn't be able to say much so I

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.780 
wouldn't be able to say much so I
thought<00:01:34.140> it'd<00:01:34.259> be<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.770> thought<00:01:35.400> I'd<00:01:35.520> be<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> lot

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
thought it'd be I thought I'd be a lot

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.609 
thought it'd be I thought I'd be a lot
better<00:01:35.909> if<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.150> actually<00:01:36.240> put<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.409> four

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
better if I actually put in the the four

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.990 
better if I actually put in the the four

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
but yeah a lot of the milan is so this

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.000 
but yeah a lot of the milan is so this
could<00:03:04.170> be<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.260> potentially<00:03:04.680> i'm<00:03:04.799> and<00:03:04.950> i've

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
could be the potentially i'm and i've

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.500 
could be the potentially i'm and i've
got<00:03:05.159> this<00:03:05.250> item<00:03:05.400> i<00:03:05.640> may<00:03:05.879> not<00:03:06.030> have<00:03:06.090> ever<00:03:06.239> got<00:03:06.420> it

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
got this item i may not have ever got it

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.270 
got this item i may not have ever got it
simply<00:03:06.780> because<00:03:06.989> I<00:03:07.019> actually<00:03:07.200> did<00:03:07.980> manage<00:03:08.250> to

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
simply because I actually did manage to

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.949 
simply because I actually did manage to
kill<00:03:08.489> it<00:03:08.579> instead<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:08.940> not<00:03:09.090> killing<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.510> but

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
kill it instead of it not killing it but

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.630 
kill it instead of it not killing it but
yeah<00:03:10.079> I<00:03:10.109> mean<00:03:10.319> that's<00:03:10.470> all<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:11.040> really<00:03:11.400> wanted

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
yeah I mean that's all I really wanted

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.220 
yeah I mean that's all I really wanted
to<00:03:11.819> say<00:03:12.180> in<00:03:12.299> this<00:03:12.390> video<00:03:12.659> so<00:03:12.780> hopefully<00:03:12.959> this

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
to say in this video so hopefully this

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.229 
to say in this video so hopefully this
is<00:03:13.319> a<00:03:13.349> relatively<00:03:14.340> enjoyable<00:03:14.879> to<00:03:15.030> watch<00:03:15.120> I

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
is a relatively enjoyable to watch I

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.550 
is a relatively enjoyable to watch I
guess<00:03:15.420> it's<00:03:15.540> probably<00:03:15.659> I<00:03:16.140> mean<00:03:16.409> you're

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
guess it's probably I mean you're

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.990 
guess it's probably I mean you're
probably<00:03:16.650> actually<00:03:16.890> skipping<00:03:17.459> here<00:03:17.609> when<00:03:17.970> I

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
probably actually skipping here when I

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.159 
probably actually skipping here when I
make<00:03:18.209> videos<00:03:18.239> like<00:03:18.569> this<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:18.959> might<00:03:19.079> have

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
make videos like this you might have

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:20.180 
make videos like this you might have
been<00:03:19.290> listening<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.560> me<00:03:19.680> until<00:03:19.829> you<00:03:19.919> probably

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
been listening to me until you probably

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.220 
been listening to me until you probably
skipping<00:03:20.609> through<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.030> em<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.019> drop

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
skipping through to the em to the drop

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.360 
skipping through to the em to the drop
so<00:03:22.349> I<00:03:22.410> guess<00:03:22.560> we<00:03:22.680> ever<00:03:22.799> make<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.010> video<00:03:23.250> like

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
so I guess we ever make a video like

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.559 
so I guess we ever make a video like
this<00:03:23.430> in<00:03:23.609> the<00:03:23.669> future<00:03:23.790> probably<00:03:24.030> just<00:03:24.329> throw

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
this in the future probably just throw

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.479 
this in the future probably just throw
in<00:03:24.720> some<00:03:24.799> things<00:03:25.799> in<00:03:25.919> the<00:03:26.010> description<00:03:26.370> so<00:03:26.430> you

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
in some things in the description so you

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.740 
in some things in the description so you
can<00:03:26.519> just<00:03:26.609> skip<00:03:26.849> to<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.000> jobs<00:03:27.299> cuz<00:03:27.450> that<00:03:27.569> sort

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
can just skip to the jobs cuz that sort

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.240 
can just skip to the jobs cuz that sort
of<00:03:27.780> some<00:03:27.930> people<00:03:28.139> may<00:03:28.230> care<00:03:28.440> about<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:28.829> that's

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
of some people may care about and that's

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.379 
of some people may care about and that's
completely<00:03:29.519> fine<00:03:29.700> I<00:03:29.910> mean<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.090> click<00:03:30.209> on<00:03:30.329> the

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
completely fine I mean you click on the

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:31.520 
completely fine I mean you click on the
video<00:03:30.599> that<00:03:30.629> might<00:03:30.870> be<00:03:30.959> why<00:03:31.079> you<00:03:31.139> want<00:03:31.319> to<00:03:31.379> hear

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
normally loops to see me kill the boss

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.210 
normally loops to see me kill the boss
