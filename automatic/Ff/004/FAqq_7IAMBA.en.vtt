00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.240 
strike at Karkand map it is golf of omen
and<00:00:17.520> I'm<00:00:18.180> pretty<00:00:18.570> sure<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.560> small

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
and I'm pretty sure it is a small

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.090 
and I'm pretty sure it is a small
conquest<00:00:21.119> map<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.660> do<00:00:22.109> believe<00:00:22.500> Z<00:00:22.859> large

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
conquest map I do believe Z large

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.330 
conquest map I do believe Z large
conquest<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:24.029> six<00:00:24.480> or<00:00:24.689> seven<00:00:25.109> flags<00:00:25.410> on<00:00:25.800> this

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
conquest is six or seven flags on this

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.259 
conquest is six or seven flags on this
particular<00:00:26.519> map<00:00:27.320> so<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:29.250> only<00:00:29.429> has<00:00:29.609> 48<00:00:30.090> now

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
particular map so this only has 48 now

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.510 
particular map so this only has 48 now
so<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.570> do<00:00:30.689> believe<00:00:30.960> it's<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.230> small<00:00:31.500> map<00:00:31.710> but

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
so I do believe it's a small map but

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.520 
so I do believe it's a small map but
yeah<00:00:33.120> not<00:00:33.300> really<00:00:33.360> important<00:00:33.930> all<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.410> you

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
yeah not really important all that you

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.130 
yeah not really important all that you
need<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.800> know<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.280> conquest<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.180> one

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
interesting round I'm going to be using

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.859 
interesting round I'm going to be using
the<00:01:28.950> m4<00:01:29.430> carbine<00:01:29.850> as<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.150> can<00:01:30.270> see<00:01:30.479> here

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the m4 carbine as you can see here

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.780 
the m4 carbine as you can see here
carbine<00:01:31.799> carbine<00:01:32.340> whatever<00:01:32.790> red<00:01:33.570> dot

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
carbine carbine whatever red dot

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
carbine carbine whatever red dot
suppressor<00:01:35.790> don't<00:01:36.329> really<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:36.630> using

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
suppressor don't really like using

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.350 
suppressor don't really like using
suppressors<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.829> m4<00:01:38.220> seems<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.820> handle

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
suppressors but the m4 seems to handle

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.969 
suppressors but the m4 seems to handle
very<00:01:39.570> well<00:01:39.630> with<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.320> said<00:01:40.650> may<00:01:40.799> as<00:01:40.890> well

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
very well with it so I said may as well

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.639 
very well with it so I said may as well
use<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.340> suppressor<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.899> foregrip<00:01:43.409> and

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
use a suppressor and the foregrip and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.440 
use a suppressor and the foregrip and
you'll<00:01:44.070> notice<00:01:44.250> me<00:01:44.369> used<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.670> foregrip<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.240> lot

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
you'll notice me used a foregrip a lot

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.810 
you'll notice me used a foregrip a lot
and<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.350> reason<00:01:46.590> for<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:47.220> just<00:01:47.549> keep<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
and the reason for that is just keep the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.999 
and the reason for that is just keep the
accuracy<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.619> when<00:01:49.619> you're<00:01:49.710> swinging<00:01:49.860> a

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
accuracy and when you're swinging a

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.800 
accuracy and when you're swinging a
long-range<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:50.729> keep<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.060> accuracy<00:01:51.509> and

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
long-range just keep that accuracy and

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.260 
long-range just keep that accuracy and
the<00:01:51.899> weapon<00:01:52.229> from<00:01:52.439> spraying<00:01:53.009> around<00:01:53.220> too<00:01:54.030> much

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
the weapon from spraying around too much

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.850 
the weapon from spraying around too much
so<00:01:54.630> that's<00:01:54.780> why<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:54.960> like<00:01:55.020> using<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.470> foregrip

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
so that's why I like using the foregrip

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.230

necessarily<00:03:59.680> bad<00:04:00.370> it's<00:04:01.000> nice<00:04:01.240> joining<00:04:01.630> these

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
necessarily bad it's nice joining these

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.440 
necessarily bad it's nice joining these
guys<00:04:02.050> because<00:04:02.410> you<00:04:02.680> can<00:04:02.830> increase<00:04:03.040> your

nice<00:04:07.690> when<00:04:07.930> joining<00:04:08.200> rounds<00:04:08.950> like<00:04:09.100> this<00:04:09.370> and

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
nice when joining rounds like this and

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.949 
nice when joining rounds like this and
one<00:04:10.540> tactic<00:04:10.959> strategy<00:04:11.380> here<00:04:11.880> with<00:04:12.880> maps<00:04:13.480> that

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
one tactic strategy here with maps that

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.170 
one tactic strategy here with maps that
allow<00:04:14.620> a<00:04:14.650> lot<00:04:14.980> of<00:04:15.100> aircraft<00:04:15.640> a<00:04:15.820> lot<00:04:15.970> of<00:04:16.060> air

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
allow a lot of aircraft a lot of air

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.510 
allow a lot of aircraft a lot of air
superiority<00:04:16.540> it's<00:04:17.440> not<00:04:17.770> a<00:04:17.830> good<00:04:18.130> idea<00:04:18.220> to

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520 
superiority it's not a good idea to

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.970 
superiority it's not a good idea to
bring<00:04:18.730> a<00:04:18.940> tank<00:04:19.239> out<00:04:19.540> through<00:04:20.380> deep<00:04:20.680> desert

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
bring a tank out through deep desert

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.400 
bring a tank out through deep desert
like<00:04:21.489> me<00:04:21.669> and<00:04:21.760> Collin<00:04:22.120> or<00:04:22.240> doing<00:04:22.479> here<00:04:22.810> and<00:04:22.960> as

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
like me and Collin or doing here and as

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.080 
like me and Collin or doing here and as
you<00:04:23.440> can<00:04:23.710> see<00:04:23.740> we<00:04:24.040> got<00:04:24.190> ripped<00:04:24.460> up<00:04:24.669> pretty

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
you can see we got ripped up pretty

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.960 
you can see we got ripped up pretty
badly<00:04:25.390> from

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
badly from

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.700 
badly from
attack<00:04:26.240> chopper<00:04:26.720> I<00:04:26.750> do<00:04:26.870> believe<00:04:27.260> that<00:04:27.530> was<00:04:27.680> a

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
attack chopper I do believe that was a

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.820 
attack chopper I do believe that was a
chopper<00:04:28.220> and<00:04:28.540> yeah<00:04:29.540> so<00:04:29.840> when<00:04:30.380> you're<00:04:30.500> on<00:04:30.590> wide

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
chopper and yeah so when you're on wide

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.400 
chopper and yeah so when you're on wide
maps<00:04:31.130> like<00:04:31.370> this<00:04:31.670> in<00:04:31.910> my<00:04:32.390> last<00:04:32.750> video<00:04:33.050> when<00:04:33.350> i

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
maps like this in my last video when i

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.370 
maps like this in my last video when i
talk<00:04:33.590> about<00:04:33.710> tanks<00:04:34.190> i<00:04:34.310> said<00:04:34.520> to<00:04:34.670> stay<00:04:34.970> in<00:04:35.390> open

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
talk about tanks i said to stay in open

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.980 
talk about tanks i said to stay in open
areas<00:04:36.710> near<00:04:37.010> buildings<00:04:37.460> and<00:04:37.610> stuff<00:04:37.870> this<00:04:38.870> is

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
areas near buildings and stuff this is

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.140 
areas near buildings and stuff this is
going<00:04:39.140> to<00:04:39.230> be<00:04:39.290> reversed<00:04:39.620> so<00:04:39.980> if<00:04:40.760> you're<00:04:41.030> on

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
going to be reversed so if you're on

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.880 
going to be reversed so if you're on
maps<00:04:41.420> like<00:04:41.660> for<00:04:41.870> example<00:04:41.960> Caspian<00:04:42.740> Border

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
maps like for example Caspian Border

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.680

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
wears a lot of airplanes a lot of a lot

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.690 
wears a lot of airplanes a lot of a lot
of<00:04:44.780> helicopters<00:04:45.350> get<00:04:45.650> up<00:04:45.740> against<00:04:46.010> walls<00:04:46.280> and

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
of helicopters get up against walls and

buildings and get entry cover and stuff

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.370 
buildings and get entry cover and stuff
just<00:04:49.580> so<00:04:49.820> you're<00:04:50.030> not<00:04:50.060> out<00:04:50.420> in<00:04:50.480> the<00:04:50.720> open<00:04:50.840> as

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
just so you're not out in the open as

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.890 
just so you're not out in the open as
much<00:04:52.130> as<00:04:52.400> you<00:04:53.030> would<00:04:53.180> be<00:04:53.360> when<00:04:53.540> you're<00:04:53.660> in<00:04:53.810> the

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
open like me and Colin just were there I

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.490 
open like me and Colin just were there I
got<00:04:56.000> lucky<00:04:56.150> I<00:04:56.330> bailed<00:04:56.660> out<00:04:56.870> before<00:04:57.200> the<00:04:57.290> tank

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
got lucky I bailed out before the tank

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.310 
got lucky I bailed out before the tank
blew<00:04:57.710> up<00:04:57.860> Colin<00:04:58.340> didn't<00:04:59.030> make<00:04:59.240> it<00:04:59.450> as<00:04:59.570> far<00:05:00.020> I

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
blew up Colin didn't make it as far I

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.050 
blew up Colin didn't make it as far I

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
was going to go to repair them but

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.420 
was going to go to repair them but
choppers<00:05:02.930> just<00:05:03.140> really<00:05:03.410> killed<00:05:03.860> tanks<00:05:04.220> really

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
choppers just really killed tanks really

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.340 
choppers just really killed tanks really
fast<00:05:04.640> I<00:05:04.820> just<00:05:05.000> had<00:05:05.090> no<00:05:05.120> time<00:05:05.450> so<00:05:06.050> as<00:05:06.140> you<00:05:06.260> can

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
fast I just had no time so as you can

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.400 
fast I just had no time so as you can
see<00:05:06.530> here<00:05:07.000> PTF<00:05:08.000> owing<00:05:08.360> like<00:05:08.570> a<00:05:08.600> boss<00:05:08.930> and

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
see here PTF owing like a boss and

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.230 
see here PTF owing like a boss and
usually<00:05:09.680> do<00:05:10.040> that<00:05:10.280> when<00:05:10.610> you're<00:05:10.760> in<00:05:10.880> a<00:05:10.970> strong

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
usually do that when you're in a strong

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.740 
usually do that when you're in a strong
squad<00:05:11.660> and<00:05:11.990> a<00:05:12.560> strong<00:05:12.830> team<00:05:13.070> so<00:05:13.130> I<00:05:13.700> mean<00:05:14.390> I'm

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
squad and a strong team so I mean I'm

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.420 
squad and a strong team so I mean I'm
your<00:05:14.900> captain<00:05:15.260> flags<00:05:15.590> left<00:05:15.890> right<00:05:16.070> and<00:05:16.220> center

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
your captain flags left right and center

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.310 
your captain flags left right and center
and<00:05:16.490> the<00:05:16.580> team<00:05:16.760> really<00:05:17.000> didn't<00:05:17.270> have<00:05:17.419> much<00:05:17.690> to

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
and the team really didn't have much to

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.020 
and the team really didn't have much to
do<00:05:18.500> because<00:05:18.919> a<00:05:19.160> lot<00:05:19.520> of<00:05:19.550> them<00:05:19.669> were<00:05:19.790> in<00:05:19.850> the<00:05:19.910> air

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
do because a lot of them were in the air

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.640 
do because a lot of them were in the air
as<00:05:20.240> you<00:05:20.360> see<00:05:20.540> there<00:05:20.720> I<00:05:20.750> got<00:05:20.960> killed<00:05:21.200> by<00:05:21.410> a

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
as you see there I got killed by a

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.680 
as you see there I got killed by a
attack<00:05:22.550> chopper<00:05:22.970> that<00:05:23.419> just<00:05:23.630> killed<00:05:23.840> us<00:05:23.930> so

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
attack chopper that just killed us so

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.600 
attack chopper that just killed us so
yeah<00:05:26.690> it's<00:05:26.900> that's<00:05:27.260> basically<00:05:27.620> wrapping<00:05:28.520> it

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
yeah it's that's basically wrapping it

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.090 
yeah it's that's basically wrapping it
up<00:05:28.700> there<00:05:29.110> as<00:05:30.110> you<00:05:30.350> can<00:05:30.470> see<00:05:30.620> we<00:05:30.710> have<00:05:30.740> it<00:05:30.890> for

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
up there as you can see we have it for

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.670 
up there as you can see we have it for
capped<00:05:31.400> here<00:05:31.640> now<00:05:31.820> so<00:05:32.210> you<00:05:32.930> know<00:05:32.960> not<00:05:33.440> really

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
capped here now so you know not really

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.150 
capped here now so you know not really
not<00:05:34.490> really<00:05:34.550> a<00:05:35.150> difficult<00:05:36.020> challenging<00:05:36.890> round

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
not really a difficult challenging round

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.540 
not really a difficult challenging round
like<00:05:37.490> I<00:05:37.580> was<00:05:37.669> talking<00:05:37.910> about<00:05:38.030> earlier<00:05:38.210> we<00:05:38.990> just

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
like I was talking about earlier we just

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.920 
like I was talking about earlier we just
sometimes<00:05:40.550> just<00:05:40.880> get<00:05:41.000> in<00:05:41.090> the<00:05:41.180> groove<00:05:41.390> and<00:05:41.750> the

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
sometimes just get in the groove and the

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.840 
sometimes just get in the groove and the
enemies<00:05:42.200> just<00:05:42.410> can't<00:05:42.680> just<00:05:43.340> can't<00:05:43.490> get<00:05:43.610> out<00:05:43.729> of

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
enemies just can't just can't get out of

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.030 
enemies just can't just can't get out of
it<00:05:43.970> so<00:05:44.210> we<00:05:44.390> are<00:05:45.169> we<00:05:45.320> got<00:05:45.470> lucky<00:05:45.650> on<00:05:45.770> this<00:05:45.890> one

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
it so we are we got lucky on this one

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.860 
it so we are we got lucky on this one
the<00:05:46.580> teams<00:05:46.790> were<00:05:46.970> actually<00:05:47.240> fighting<00:05:47.600> pretty

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
the teams were actually fighting pretty

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.490 
the teams were actually fighting pretty
hard<00:05:48.169> throughout<00:05:48.530> each<00:05:49.250> matches<00:05:49.850> so<00:05:50.780> this<00:05:51.350> one

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
hard throughout each matches so this one

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.219 
hard throughout each matches so this one
I<00:05:51.530> guess<00:05:51.800> I<00:05:52.070> guess<00:05:52.640> people<00:05:52.669> just<00:05:53.110> fell<00:05:54.110> apart

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229 
I guess I guess people just fell apart

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.290 
I guess I guess people just fell apart
or<00:05:54.470> something<00:05:54.770> didn't<00:05:54.950> like<00:05:55.040> the<00:05:55.130> math<00:05:55.310> but<00:05:55.910> I

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
or something didn't like the math but I

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.270 
or something didn't like the math but I
had<00:05:56.690> another<00:05:56.870> gameplay<00:05:57.169> there<00:05:57.650> I<00:05:57.860> when<00:05:58.130> I<00:05:58.160> was

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
had another gameplay there I when I was

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.670 
had another gameplay there I when I was
playing<00:05:58.340> as<00:05:58.520> 2d<00:05:58.700> crew<00:05:58.880> guys<00:05:59.090> of<00:05:59.390> some<00:05:59.870> rush<00:06:00.080> but

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
playing as 2d crew guys of some rush but

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.030 
playing as 2d crew guys of some rush but
it<00:06:01.669> was<00:06:01.850> defending<00:06:02.419> once<00:06:02.630> again<00:06:02.930> rush<00:06:03.590> on<00:06:03.800> sign

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.040 
it was defending once again rush on sign

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.250 
it was defending once again rush on sign
crossing<00:06:04.580> and<00:06:05.000> I<00:06:05.090> thought<00:06:05.300> some<00:06:05.960> of<00:06:05.990> you<00:06:06.140> guys

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
crossing and I thought some of you guys

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260 
crossing and I thought some of you guys
would<00:06:06.470> like<00:06:06.530> to<00:06:06.650> see<00:06:06.800> some<00:06:07.190> p2k<00:06:07.550> gameplay

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
would like to see some p2k gameplay

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.140 
would like to see some p2k gameplay
instead<00:06:08.630> of<00:06:08.750> some<00:06:09.020> more<00:06:09.700> defense<00:06:10.700> rush<00:06:10.970> or

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
instead of some more defense rush or

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.090 
instead of some more defense rush or
whatever<00:06:11.419> so<00:06:11.660> I<00:06:11.870> thought<00:06:12.500> this<00:06:12.650> would<00:06:12.710> be<00:06:12.830> nice

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
whatever so I thought this would be nice

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.290 
whatever so I thought this would be nice
if<00:06:13.370> you<00:06:13.460> guys<00:06:13.610> want<00:06:13.820> to<00:06:13.880> see<00:06:14.000> some<00:06:14.180> more

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
if you guys want to see some more

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.260 
if you guys want to see some more

gameplay of D crew I'd be happy to post
it<00:06:17.570> may<00:06:17.720> be<00:06:17.780> some<00:06:17.960> more<00:06:18.050> tactical<00:06:18.620> stuff<00:06:18.860> I

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
it may be some more tactical stuff I

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.950 
it may be some more tactical stuff I
played<00:06:19.580> a<00:06:19.610> game<00:06:19.850> last<00:06:20.180> night<00:06:20.450> where<00:06:20.720> we<00:06:20.840> were

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
played a game last night where we were

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.020 
played a game last night where we were
actually<00:06:21.200> I<00:06:21.590> got<00:06:22.130> put<00:06:22.310> on<00:06:22.340> the<00:06:22.490> other<00:06:22.610> team<00:06:22.850> so

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
actually I got put on the other team so

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.210 
actually I got put on the other team so
I<00:06:23.060> was<00:06:23.180> against<00:06:23.419> stone<00:06:23.660> face<00:06:23.990> and<00:06:24.260> we<00:06:25.190> actually

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
I was against stone face and we actually

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.530 
I was against stone face and we actually
managed<00:06:25.669> to<00:06:25.729> win<00:06:25.910> the<00:06:26.030> round<00:06:26.150> which<00:06:26.390> is

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:26.540 
managed to win the round which is

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.120 
managed to win the round which is
surprising<00:06:27.080> I<00:06:27.229> thought<00:06:27.800> we<00:06:27.890> were<00:06:27.950> going<00:06:28.070> to

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
surprising I thought we were going to

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.620 
surprising I thought we were going to
get<00:06:28.220> ran<00:06:28.430> over<00:06:28.460> but<00:06:28.910> I<00:06:28.940> think<00:06:29.210> they<00:06:29.360> were<00:06:29.419> down

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
get ran over but I think they were down

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.090 
get ran over but I think they were down
a<00:06:29.660> couple<00:06:29.930> players<00:06:30.290> so<00:06:30.530> I<00:06:30.560> don't<00:06:30.740> blame<00:06:30.919> them

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
a couple players so I don't blame them

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.100 
a couple players so I don't blame them
but<00:06:31.729> if<00:06:32.120> you<00:06:32.180> want<00:06:32.330> guys<00:06:32.570> want<00:06:32.780> to<00:06:32.840> teach<00:06:32.990> on
