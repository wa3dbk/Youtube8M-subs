 watch television or movies 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.679
 in this same application just as a 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:53.780
 quick tour I want to show you that 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:55.760
 regularly you will find some 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.600
 eyelashes like for example the weather 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.729
 whenever you give it a break, it will bring you 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.769
 a step back we have here also what 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.970
 which are photographs where you can 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.940
 add 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.530
 Sources of known pages on the internet 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.810
 how are you what are you seeing from this 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.210
 side where when you click with the 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.870
 simple fact of installing automatically 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.850
 that source is placed in what is the 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.610
 section of photographs for you 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.350
 You can observe each one of them 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.260
 the same way you will have the possibility 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.770
 if you give him this side, return to you 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.660
 adhere another source perhaps directly 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.420
 from your computer so that from that 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.550
 Enjoy your family photos 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.520
 within the videos section of this 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.130
 side can we add what they are 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.500
 the videos of homs if we give you 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.930
 one click here we are going to see a 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.330
 list of all those sources that 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.030
 we have currently stored 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.090
 within this section all this that you 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.080
 you are seeing here I have already added it 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.509
 above and I'll show you to 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.880
 then how could you add the 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.040
 content that you would like if we leave 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.040
 to the bottom we will find 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.350
 get more refers to the content and 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.819
 on this side we will see a list 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.159
 pretty big 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.900
 from sources that you can add to the 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.999
 previous section that I just showed you 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.769
 so you can see that kind of 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:21.950
 content that each of these pages 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.870
 presents you if I can see under 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.939
 many of them of different 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.219
 categories how can you tell 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:30.709
 many of these are enabled with 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:33.170
 this word because I previously already 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.659
 I have added them as you add one of 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.669
 if you like, let's suppose 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:40.819
 that I want to add this that says of 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:42.889
 tm tv point when you click 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.599
 we will regularly see here 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:47.419
 a description about what is 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.510
 try let's say this channel and if you give it 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:53.599
 install automatically it would start to 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.639
 download until it was enabled 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.560
 if we go up and you 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:59.449
 we click on this section to 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.599
 come back a step back or the same 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:05.629
 way with this button we would reach the 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.459
 section that I would have shown you with 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.620
 anticipation if you do not get to see it 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.209
 for some situation you always have the 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.849
 possibility of returning to the menu 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.990
 principal to come to what are the 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.910
 videos 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.370
 this side we will find exactly 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.260
 what we have added and here is 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.720
 I mentioned is what makes a 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.420
 moment now as we can see 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.890
 content by all of these 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.900
 accounts that we have added 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.570
 let's suppose that I want to see 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.630
 content of this company called 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.980
 revision 3 when you click 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.770
 automatically the application starts to 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.900
 work shows me a category in 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.620
 where I can choose what kind of videos 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.010
 I want to see 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.130
 I give a click and from this side I appear 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.430
 that content that I can start to see 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:55.010
 let's say quickly I'm going to give you a 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.200
 Click the X in the top me 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.650
 I'm going to return here more or less 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.650
 I was 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.290
 let's go into another section so that 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.360
 I show you exactly what it is about 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.519
 this one that says eyes films 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.739
 I personally occupy it quite 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.810
 Within this category we 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.930
 we have subcategories where we can 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.209
 watch movies we can have music and 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.910
 television programs we are going to 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.860
 selecting movies here gives us another 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.220
 sub category where we can 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.139
 choose the popular quality or maybe the 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.570
 last ones that have been added if I 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.920
 Here I want to see the last to be 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.290
 have added 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.540
 in the next window I would be 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.330
 showing all those movies that 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.030
 recently they have added to what 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.890
 it is this fountain that is called ice fields 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.810
 when we want to see a 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.630
 movie with the simple act of giving it a 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.510
 click another submenu appears in 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.070
 where will I choose the quality 720 p and what 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.660
 only thing that remains in this case is 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.730
 wait for it to start playing 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.530
 however, another one appears 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.750
 subcategory where I'm going to choose 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.690
 any of these sources so that 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:09.870
 automatically start playing 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:12.390
 my movie we are going to wait 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:16.420
 and here we have what is technically the 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:19.270
 content of the movie which 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.750
 I had mentioned you and well I want 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.240
 tell you that the quality is very good is 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.340
 quite acceptable I think that for 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.460
 have content let's say for free 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.380
 It's pretty good if you want to get out 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.720
 with the simple fact that you move your 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.810
 mouse can from this side get out or 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.780
 maybe stop the movie altogether 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:43.900
 I want to mention that you are mediacenter 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.960
 it's quite complete you can add 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.120
 sources in many different ways I 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.740
 I would recommend that you download to 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.140
 then I'll tell you the page 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.290
 where you can download it in this 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:59.080
 case if you come to the xp ms page 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:01.420
 dot or heretic diagonal down such and 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.130
 you see it here in the downloads section 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.680
 that we are already inside you can 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:08.380
 choose what your operating system is and 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.330
 technically install it now I'll 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.030
 I mentioned that you can add many 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.790
 sources this source that we see 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:19.689
 here it is called in this way as it is 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:22.299
 here where you can download maybe 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:24.819
 and this plugin and add another kind of 

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:26.860
 content with other types of channels will be 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:29.110
 good to investigate a little 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.689
 respect for you to realize how 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:35.079
 you can add additional content but 

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:38.229
 I want to mention that the program comes 

00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:40.779
 loaded with what are many sources 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:43.719
 that you can technically observe and 

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:46.689
 decide if any of them you think 

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:48.879
 good and install it then I love you 

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:51.639
 stop homework that you observe this 

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:53.289
 program analyzes it and leave me your 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:55.119
 Comment below if it is 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:57.639
 what do you want to share with others 

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:59.679
 some kind of additional plugin that 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:02.139
 you want to install and it's possible that more

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:09.639
 additional sources to this program but 

00:07:08.019 --> 00:07:11.829
