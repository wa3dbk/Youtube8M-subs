 for those who are starting out as DJs 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.980

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.070
 any ask for who is starting 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.510
 for those who have been in the market for some time 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.660
 and how much this 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.660
 is nothing more than the headset the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.660
 headset he has his main 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.480
 function that is to listen to the next song 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.390
 always the next song and try 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.820
 fit it with the current song that the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:53.100
 Audience is listening at the party. 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:57.059
 the headset he has recommended to 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.760
 with a bigger fence is for you to be able 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.300
 listen well to the music you're going 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.949
 put in sequence will mix is more 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.990
 for beginners do not need 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.850
 invest in both the headset with 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.010
 much technique is the album another brand that 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.909
 be professional you can start with 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:21.810
 headset there is not spending too much 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.200
 It's not for those who play even for those who like it. 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.450
 to play and there has its headphone such gives 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.310
 To use for a friends party is 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.530
 that end-of-the-year fraternization 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.520
 week without problem 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.820
 when you go to party 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.100
 public is observing is the issue 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.710
 visual you're going to have a little party 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.840
 more professional is more recommended 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.340
 you have a nice little oven phone being 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.950
 cool, right? 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:55.350
 even for the quality of the audio to 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:58.380
 Return quality one earphone 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.890
 I do not say it has to be a 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.140
 certain brand is home by day to 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.940
 every professional is even for those who are 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:12.720
 Starting it's good you try several headphones 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:16.770
 until you find a model type 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:22.020
 that you like that you get it right in your 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:24.959
 profile is of such hard is position everything 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:28.769
 Be nice and comfortable for you. 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:31.050
 during the performance of the party, no 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:35.970
 You can not buy an iphone by brand. 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:38.730
 or because it is too expensive and not 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.920
 being comfortable throughout the night 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.660
 You're not going to party 100 for 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.290
 cent 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.830
 the second tip 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:53.519
 The second tip is you start not 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:57.989
 investing if you have a good value is 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:03:00.540
 to invest is to start knowing the 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.470
 mixing work through a 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.220
 software 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:09.299
 The software is that I can 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:13.410
 recommend is the virtual of the vector of 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:16.560
 some other year professionals hate 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.500
 some defenders of the tractor and other 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.489
 software and did not speak very well of 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.730
 virtual dj 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:26.730
 but that's the same question as the headset. 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:31.489
 have professionals who like to 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.489
 equipment a or equipment b 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.290
 the recommendation of virtual dj is because 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.739
 it is a program that depends on the 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.750
 Do you have a laptop or even a PC? 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.200
 if you do not have a notebook for 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:49.170
 to take to the parties is that he attends 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:54.150
 any type of machine with a minimum 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:57.030
 of configuration it caters well to the other 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.010
 software as a tractor for example it 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.109
 needs you to have a good 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:06.190
 machine configuration so that it 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:09.880
 turn smooth without locking and the purpose here 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:14.980
 is to use a certain software a or b is 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.970
 port using a brand 11 software 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.420
 professional 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.370
 the idea was to use software that 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.940
 function smoothly throughout the entire 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.270
 night 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.370
 Anyone who is enjoying the event will not 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.820
 want to know what software you are 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:34.870
 using but it is clear that music 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.720
 100% touch software is more 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.840
 interesting for you to start than one 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.770
 equipment to start understanding 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:48.850
 a little bit of step by step mixing and 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.990
 what it's like to be a professional 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:54.070
 software 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:57.490
 it becomes less costly in your 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:00.370
 pocket there because software like this 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:06.400
 you will depend much less on the value of 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:09.340
 that one and dj up to cd jotas as acs da 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.190
 already out of line 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.870
 are out of the market and you still 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:20.800
 can find some used for 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:22.930
 buy for sale in the market is anyway 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.120
 the software ends up being more recommended 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:30.480
 initially until you get a good 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.480
 practice and understand what this market is 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:38.470
 The third tip 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:41.440
 so yes to cbj 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.680
 to cbj she will become a third party 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.169
 point is not is when you already have some 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.560
 knowledge of what is the step-by-step 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:53.380
 message which is a bpm and all 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.210
 technical points to get you started 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.030
 Yes, work with her. 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:01.450
 Of course, to get to the ccj 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:04.600
 You'll have to have a case already mounted. 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.680
 with your cds recorded snow will have to 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.530
 have one 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:12.490
 the organization there to be able to 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:15.520
 to play with is to be able to test is Ã© 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:19.389
 it is advisable to take a course online 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:22.810

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.600
 cnj functionality 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:33.190
 So that's where you can work. 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:35.229
 it is a more manual way to fine tune 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:40.660
 of the songs in the case of the 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:44.199
 speed is mixing do not mark the point 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.970
 or is to give the play change the song you 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:48.880
 can do this more manually 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:51.840
 while in software while you 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.520
 It's starting, you can automate it. 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:58.479

 in the way the message is made 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:13.539
 the beating of the beats and then 

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:16.599
 subsequently having some 

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:19.180
