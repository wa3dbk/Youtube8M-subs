00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.080
 let's do it in a slow cooker 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.099
 let's start with the fact that we fry mince 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.330
 we install the multicooker program 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:22.160

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.050

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.000
 so I have everything under control in any 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:35.450

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:39.980

 mince him where you mainly trust to 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.969
 the macaroni tastes better 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.090
 suggests adding a little creamy 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.090
 oils rubles porsche 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:04.020
 we only need to fry it slightly and 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.020
 it is important that 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.840

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.840
