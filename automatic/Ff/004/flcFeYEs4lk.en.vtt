solely an opinion this is in fact I'm

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.620 
solely an opinion this is in fact I'm
not<00:01:23.100> going<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.370> be<00:01:23.880> over<00:01:24.090> here<00:01:24.270> saying<00:01:24.480> that

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
not going to be over here saying that

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.080 
not going to be over here saying that
this<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.930> total<00:01:25.380> fact<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.340> my<00:01:26.640> opinion

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
this is a total fact this is my opinion

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.510 
this is a total fact this is my opinion
on<00:01:27.300> something<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.260> we<00:01:28.560> commentators<00:01:29.250> say<00:01:29.490> a

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
on something that we commentators say a

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.550 
on something that we commentators say a
lot<00:01:29.910> and<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.600> think<00:01:30.870> it's<00:01:31.020> kind<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.290> a

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
lot and I think it's kind of a

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.670 
lot and I think it's kind of a
misperception<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.670> bad<00:01:33.000> habit<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.750> my<00:01:34.350> opinion

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
misperception a bad habit in my opinion

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.030 
misperception a bad habit in my opinion
and<00:01:35.300> this<00:01:36.300> is<00:01:36.420> about<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.840> whole<00:01:37.080> controversy

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and this is about the whole controversy

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.000 
and this is about the whole controversy
I<00:01:38.340> waste<00:01:38.580> of<00:01:38.700> me<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.620> commentators<00:01:40.620> saying

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
I waste of me of commentators saying

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.040 
I waste of me of commentators saying

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.990 
people say game play in the background I
feel<00:03:44.320> as<00:03:44.470> if<00:03:44.560> they're<00:03:44.860> implying<00:03:45.580> that<00:03:45.850> the

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
feel as if they're implying that the

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.340 
feel as if they're implying that the
gameplay<00:03:46.420> is<00:03:46.540> not<00:03:46.780> as<00:03:46.990> good<00:03:47.140> as<00:03:47.260> the

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
gameplay is not as good as the

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.560 
gameplay is not as good as the
commentary<00:03:47.860> as<00:03:48.010> if<00:03:48.310> people<00:03:48.790> are<00:03:49.000> only<00:03:49.240> there

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
commentary as if people are only there

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.110 
commentary as if people are only there
for<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:49.870> commentary<00:03:50.580> now<00:03:51.580> in<00:03:51.700> some<00:03:51.910> cases

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
for the commentary now in some cases

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.580 
for the commentary now in some cases
that's<00:03:52.390> true<00:03:52.660> however<00:03:52.870> I<00:03:53.110> kind<00:03:53.410> of<00:03:53.470> think

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
that's true however I kind of think

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.310 
that's true however I kind of think
that's<00:03:53.800> a<00:03:53.890> little<00:03:54.360> egotistical<00:03:55.360> in<00:03:55.540> my

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
that's a little egotistical in my

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.350 
that's a little egotistical in my
opinion<00:03:56.590> when<00:03:56.770> it<00:03:56.800> comes<00:03:57.100> to<00:03:57.250> saying<00:03:57.520> this

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
opinion when it comes to saying this

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.300 
opinion when it comes to saying this
gameplay<00:03:58.690> is<00:03:59.020> in<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.260> background<00:03:59.470> I'm<00:03:59.920> front

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
gameplay is in the background I'm front

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.100 
gameplay is in the background I'm front
and<00:04:00.430> center<00:04:00.520> on<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.239> star<00:04:01.480> of<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.660> show<00:04:01.690> I

don't know that's how I see it but I

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.180 
don't know that's how I see it but I
think<00:04:04.810> that<00:04:04.840> many<00:04:05.200> people<00:04:05.290> don't<00:04:05.709> mean<00:04:05.950> it's

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
think that many people don't mean it's

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.470 
think that many people don't mean it's
just<00:04:06.250> like<00:04:06.430> a<00:04:06.459> bad<00:04:06.700> habit<00:04:06.730> it's<00:04:07.180> like<00:04:07.300> me
