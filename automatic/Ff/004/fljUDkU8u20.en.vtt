whether there's an explosion happening

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.199 
whether there's an explosion happening
and<00:03:32.720> that<00:03:33.139> also<00:03:33.349> echos<00:03:34.069> the<00:03:34.099> car<00:03:34.549> crash<00:03:34.849> in<00:03:35.090> the

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
and that also echos the car crash in the

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.870 
and that also echos the car crash in the
novel<00:03:35.709> one<00:03:36.709> of<00:03:36.829> the<00:03:36.919> falling<00:03:37.310> lights<00:03:37.519> in<00:03:37.760> the

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
novel one of the falling lights in the

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.449 
novel one of the falling lights in the
skies<00:03:38.180> could<00:03:38.780> be<00:03:38.959> sodium<00:03:39.319> glare<00:03:39.769> or<00:03:40.130> it<00:03:40.250> could

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
skies could be sodium glare or it could

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.400 
skies could be sodium glare or it could
be<00:03:40.579> a<00:03:40.609> tear<00:03:40.940> falling<00:03:41.660> from<00:03:41.930> one<00:03:42.079> of<00:03:42.169> the<00:03:42.260> eyes

be a tear falling from one of the eyes

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.539 
be a tear falling from one of the eyes
so<00:03:43.099> it's<00:03:43.220> a<00:03:43.280> very<00:03:43.489> evocative<00:03:43.819> symbolic<00:03:44.690> jacket

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
so it's a very evocative symbolic jacket

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.089 
so it's a very evocative symbolic jacket
unusual<00:03:46.549> for<00:03:46.700> this<00:03:46.790> time<00:03:47.319> it's<00:03:48.319> not<00:03:48.560> actually

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
an especially rare book there were over

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.229 
an especially rare book there were over
18,000<00:03:52.040> copies<00:03:52.370> printed<00:03:52.609> of<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.030> first

18,000 copies printed of the first

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.990 
18,000 copies printed of the first
edition<00:03:53.450> but<00:03:54.380> what<00:03:54.709> is<00:03:54.859> rare<00:03:55.160> is<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.489> survival

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
edition but what is rare is the survival

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.569 
edition but what is rare is the survival
of<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:56.180> dust<00:03:56.450> jacket<00:03:57.099> there<00:03:58.099> are<00:03:58.190> a<00:03:58.280> couple<00:03:58.430> of

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
of the dust jacket there are a couple of

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.089 
of the dust jacket there are a couple of
reasons<00:03:58.819> for<00:03:59.209> this

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
reasons for this

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.069 
reasons for this
notably<00:04:01.099> the<00:04:01.370> jacket<00:04:01.730> itself<00:04:02.090> is<00:04:02.389> printed

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
notably the jacket itself is printed

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.069 
notably the jacket itself is printed
just<00:04:03.709> very<00:04:04.130> slightly<00:04:04.609> too<00:04:05.030> tall<00:04:05.419> for<00:04:05.450> the<00:04:05.810> book

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
just very slightly too tall for the book

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.009 
just very slightly too tall for the book
which<00:04:06.829> you<00:04:06.889> can<00:04:07.220> see<00:04:07.489> there<00:04:07.790> and<00:04:08.329> so<00:04:08.840> the

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
which you can see there and so the

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.379 
which you can see there and so the
jacket<00:04:09.290> always<00:04:09.799> has<00:04:09.980> a<00:04:10.010> tendency<00:04:10.730> to<00:04:10.879> chip<00:04:11.209> at

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389 
jacket always has a tendency to chip at

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.300 
jacket always has a tendency to chip at
the<00:04:11.480> edges<00:04:11.870> that<00:04:12.109> paper<00:04:12.379> gets<00:04:12.650> brittle<00:04:12.919> and

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
the edges that paper gets brittle and

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.279 
the edges that paper gets brittle and
chips<00:04:13.970> away<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:15.500> so<00:04:15.919> that<00:04:16.989> argues<00:04:17.989> against

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
chips away and so that argues against

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.250 
chips away and so that argues against
its<00:04:18.560> survival<00:04:19.570> the<00:04:20.570> rather<00:04:20.720> interesting

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
its survival the rather interesting

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.350 
its survival the rather interesting
things<00:04:21.500> about<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:21.919> jacket<00:04:22.340> one<00:04:22.580> thing<00:04:23.180> that

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
things about the jacket one thing that

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.779 
things about the jacket one thing that
collectors<00:04:23.840> often<00:04:24.199> have<00:04:24.620> to<00:04:24.740> be<00:04:24.860> wary<00:04:25.280> of<00:04:25.430> is

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
collectors often have to be wary of is

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.150 
collectors often have to be wary of is
that<00:04:26.599> there<00:04:26.870> was<00:04:26.960> a<00:04:26.990> printing<00:04:27.470> mistake<00:04:27.860> on<00:04:28.070> the

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
that there was a printing mistake on the

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.089 
that there was a printing mistake on the
back<00:04:28.310> of<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:28.610> jacket<00:04:29.229> the<00:04:30.229> name<00:04:30.500> Jay<00:04:30.830> Gatsby

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:31.099 
back of the jacket the name Jay Gatsby

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:34.060 
back of the jacket the name Jay Gatsby
was<00:04:31.610> printed<00:04:31.970> with<00:04:32.000> a<00:04:32.150> lowercase<00:04:32.539> J<00:04:33.200> and<00:04:33.530> so

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
was printed with a lowercase J and so

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.550 
was printed with a lowercase J and so
every<00:04:34.400> copy<00:04:34.640> of<00:04:34.909> the<00:04:35.120> first<00:04:35.539> issue<00:04:35.780> jacket

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
every copy of the first issue jacket

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.670 
every copy of the first issue jacket
was<00:04:36.710> corrected<00:04:37.250> by<00:04:37.400> hand<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:39.080> capital

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
was corrected by hand and the capital

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.730 
was corrected by hand and the capital
letter<00:04:39.860> J<00:04:40.220> written<00:04:40.639> in<00:04:40.790> over<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.330> lowercase

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
letter J written in over the lowercase

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.400 
letter J written in over the lowercase
so<00:04:42.740> this<00:04:42.919> shows<00:04:43.190> that<00:04:43.570> this<00:04:44.570> is<00:04:44.630> a<00:04:44.810> first

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
so this shows that this is a first

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.270 
so this shows that this is a first

probable order of these sketches was

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.090 
probable order of these sketches was
that<00:05:39.000> the<00:05:39.480> first<00:05:39.780> one<00:05:40.050> here<00:05:40.410> is<00:05:40.440> a<00:05:40.740> sort<00:05:41.070> of

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
that the first one here is a sort of

that the first one here is a sort of
railway<00:05:41.550> scene<00:05:41.910> this<00:05:42.180> although<00:05:42.780> it<00:05:43.020> actually

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
railway scene this although it actually

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.060 
railway scene this although it actually
resembles<00:05:44.120> more<00:05:45.120> Spain<00:05:45.570> than<00:05:45.960> Long<00:05:46.650> Island

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
resembles more Spain than Long Island

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.730 
resembles more Spain than Long Island
this<00:05:47.190> is<00:05:47.430> the<00:05:47.610> Long<00:05:47.790> Island<00:05:48.210> Railroad<00:05:48.740> and

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
this is the Long Island Railroad and

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.400 
this is the Long Island Railroad and
here<00:05:50.460> you<00:05:50.610> get<00:05:50.760> the<00:05:50.910> first<00:05:51.180> conception<00:05:51.960> of<00:05:52.200> the

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
here you get the first conception of the

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.550 
here you get the first conception of the
faces<00:05:53.040> in<00:05:53.310> the<00:05:53.640> sky<00:05:53.970> watching<00:05:54.570> the<00:05:54.870> action<00:05:55.320> the

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
faces in the sky watching the action the

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.120 
faces in the sky watching the action the
the<00:05:56.070> eyes<00:05:56.310> and<00:05:56.820> the<00:05:56.880> clouds<00:05:57.180> so<00:05:58.080> that<00:05:58.740> that's

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
the eyes and the clouds so that that's

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.520 
the eyes and the clouds so that that's
an<00:05:59.430> evocative<00:05:59.790> beginning<00:06:00.540> it<00:06:00.750> then<00:06:01.200> seems

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
an evocative beginning it then seems

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.670 
an evocative beginning it then seems
that<00:06:01.740> Kouga<00:06:02.190> went<00:06:02.520> through<00:06:02.790> various<00:06:03.210> sketches

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
that Kouga went through various sketches

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.490 
that Kouga went through various sketches
developing<00:06:04.680> that<00:06:05.310> idea<00:06:05.970> we've<00:06:06.600> got<00:06:06.870> one<00:06:07.080> here

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
developing that idea we've got one here

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.270 
developing that idea we've got one here
where<00:06:07.920> he's<00:06:08.160> got<00:06:08.490> a<00:06:08.930> single<00:06:09.930> eye<00:06:10.200> and<00:06:10.740> a<00:06:11.040> sort

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
where he's got a single eye and a sort

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.480 
where he's got a single eye and a sort
of<00:06:11.340> rather<00:06:11.550> like<00:06:11.820> there's<00:06:12.090> an<00:06:12.210> auteur<00:06:12.450> profile

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
of rather like there's an auteur profile

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.310 
of rather like there's an auteur profile
as<00:06:14.490> if<00:06:14.970> it's<00:06:15.150> he's<00:06:15.480> trying<00:06:15.750> to<00:06:15.840> do<00:06:15.960> something

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
as if it's he's trying to do something

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.640
