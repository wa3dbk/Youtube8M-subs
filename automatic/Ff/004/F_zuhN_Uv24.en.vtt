00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:11.250
 In it is located in the Tools panel from the top this that four eyes the origin origin of 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:17.160
 I would like to explain how to use this button 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.390
 Move to do this by grabbing it Conservation Corps is at the time of the elite mode 8 is it common case 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.590
 I 'm in edit mode now 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:28.800
 If you grab the whole in elite mode and move it this way, it will return to object mode 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:31.270
 When the station of this origin position is completely different from the object when 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.540
 That something very in at Ekore 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:39.970
 I'll go into edit mode again to see how to get back a 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:42.710
 That the Well is not it quite troublesome Do whether return usually the origin at the center of this object 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:47.030
 Because it is better to have 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:51.140
 You can use this button at that time if you can not go back with just one shot 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.260
 origin Three choices come out when I get this button pressed 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.940
 For example, the second from the top 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.739
 Since there are origins and jam streets from the origin to the geometric center, use this button 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.309
 Press and yes this is it 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:07.280
 It bothers you can return to the center to 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:12.590
 Well without that Toka back and be good well into the edit mode 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:17.030
 You can bring in the You're relatively center of deduction in this button 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:22.759
 And again, for example, right now this is erash front right now 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.960
 If you turn it normally while looking from the front, it will go around here like this 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:29.570
 But also 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:33.409
 In that sort of time and want to turn around a place that strikes it is this, for example, here the feet 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.080
 You can still move to the position of this cursor 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:40.810
 I'll try 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:47.080
 Press this origin button and press this to turn it into 3d with one's origin 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:50.990
 And so the origin will move to the position of the 3d cursor Yes so we will move to 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:55.310
 If you turn it with, you will rotate around here 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:59.689
 It's when you do some kind of animation , so it's not in the middle, it's this 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.200
 If you want to turn around at your feet, move this origin in this way 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:05.460
 You need to 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:09.750
 It is when you move the origin to the place you like at such time 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:15.480
 I bring the location of the cursor here and people and jealousy 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.800
 Wind of that operation that turn in a future in which to bring here that the 3 d of the 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.220
 It will be possible 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.670
 Well this is the relationship between this object and the deduction point with these three operations 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.890
 To the freedom of something 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:33.260
 The origin I think more and may be placed know that can be moved 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.260
 Was button congratulation Jimbo was about how to use this
