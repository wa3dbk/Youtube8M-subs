00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.280 
an understanding with is he brown this
game<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.880> wasn't<00:01:39.150> as<00:01:39.329> good<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:40.170> could

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
game it wasn't as good you could

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.719 
game it wasn't as good you could
definitely<00:01:40.380> see<00:01:40.799> he's<00:01:40.920> good<00:01:41.130> going<00:01:41.400> forward

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
definitely see he's good going forward

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.010 
definitely see he's good going forward
but<00:01:41.850> i<00:01:41.909> think<00:01:42.119> it'd<00:01:42.210> be<00:01:42.420> interesting<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.840> see

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
but i think it'd be interesting to see

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.480 
but i think it'd be interesting to see
happens<00:01:43.350> with<00:01:43.500> him<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.860> Eden<00:01:44.130> Hazard

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
happens with him and Eden Hazard

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.039 
happens with him and Eden Hazard
together<00:01:44.850> because<00:01:45.329> especially<00:01:45.479> cuz<00:01:45.720> Eden

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
together because especially cuz Eden

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.590 
together because especially cuz Eden
doesn't<00:01:46.290> drink<00:01:47.040> he<00:01:47.130> doesn't<00:01:47.490> like<00:01:47.610> stay<00:01:48.270> wide

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
doesn't drink he doesn't like stay wide

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.240 
doesn't drink he doesn't like stay wide
he<00:01:48.899> drifts<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.439> which<00:01:49.740> means<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:49.950> would<00:01:50.100> give

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
he drifts in which means that would give

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.310 
he drifts in which means that would give
more<00:01:50.369> space<00:01:50.520> for<00:01:50.670> easter<00:01:51.390> darts<00:01:51.720> up<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.110> line

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
more space for easter darts up the line

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.830 
more space for easter darts up the line
so<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:52.860> would<00:01:53.070> be<00:01:53.100> interesting<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.640> see<00:01:53.840> but

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
so that would be interesting to see but

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.590 
so that would be interesting to see but

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.810 
was fast but you know we should really
put<00:05:03.030> it<00:05:03.120> in<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.270> back<00:05:03.419> of<00:05:03.450> the<00:05:03.660> net<00:05:04.490> check<00:05:05.490> out

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
put it in the back of the net check out

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.880 
put it in the back of the net check out
looking<00:05:06.240> touch<00:05:06.600> on<00:05:06.810> this<00:05:06.990> quickly<00:05:07.320> before<00:05:07.650> any

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
looking touch on this quickly before any

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.440 
looking touch on this quickly before any
videos<00:05:08.280> will<00:05:08.490> make<00:05:08.520> cotton<00:05:08.790> and<00:05:09.030> in<00:05:09.090> the<00:05:09.210> video

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450

I<00:05:09.690> think<00:05:10.410> that<00:05:10.530> check<00:05:10.860> today<00:05:11.070> kind<00:05:11.730> of<00:05:11.880> showed

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
I think that check today kind of showed

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.060 
I think that check today kind of showed
once<00:05:12.330> again<00:05:12.540> I<00:05:12.600> think<00:05:12.660> people<00:05:13.530> saw<00:05:13.800> it<00:05:13.830> might

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
once again I think people saw it might

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.290 
once again I think people saw it might
have<00:05:14.160> seen<00:05:14.310> what<00:05:14.400> I'm<00:05:14.490> trying<00:05:14.669> to<00:05:14.700> say<00:05:14.760> it

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
have seen what I'm trying to say it

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.730
