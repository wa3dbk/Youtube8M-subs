00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.540
 hello people how are you welcome to a 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.160
 new video on this channel already see that they 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.259
 had commented that every Wednesday and 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.420
 Saturday and homero a special video and the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.170
 today is a clear boxing yes 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.570
 like a boxing this is this monitor there 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.060
 the quality of this is that it is very 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.000
 long why it says an ultra wide place 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.490
 tells us that this cool car 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.800
 I have never tried one of these but 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.329
 for example one of the characteristics 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.520
 what it has is that it can be divided into 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.530
 several hundred and maybe not because it 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.780
 can divide into several in several 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.090
 screens here are two but you can 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.550
 divide up to four of the colors 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.340
 they are very alive is a gamer monitor if 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.980
 you want to enter at this time is where 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.840
 the gamers colors or the lanterns do not 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.920
 as the edition to Lyon in the shows and 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.520
 Well, come on, let's open the mind 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.090
 with the keys way 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.090
 way 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.840
 Mom NomÃ¡s keys look very well 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.290
 including those of us 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.050
 then put it down here 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.220
 let's see how we close this so that it does not 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.780
 we fall here comes control is something 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.440
 that will make life much easier 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.820
 because the monitors that I have I have to 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.820
 explain there the menu against 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.520
 the instruction hands to the disk to 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.700
 install then you need a driver or something 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.700
 A) Yes 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.229
 we can 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.659
 is the base look you come with touching him 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.000
 hdmi because they know that the hair is poor 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.470
 here is the cable hdmi the cable 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.770
 current 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.440
 because the name of these are different 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.570
 already come with another one look you saw 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.570
 how is it different from state 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.810
 that is, we are going to make the 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.090
 life already moves the computer or now the 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.020
 I can already do this with this console 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.010
 one little button and it 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.530
 wake up good sir 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.689
 let's go to the handsome to occupy for 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.689
 little gifts to wrap your notebooks 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:34.689
 for 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.030
 we have the screw base with the other 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.120
 small piece that I just showed you 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.120
 the base of the two 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.770
 this is the moment last night for then what 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:57.319
 I feel only true it smells good 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.319
 already here is the monitor 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.870
 here is the monitor as you can see 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.210
 is longer then they have been seen in 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.940
 those expose in those events where they have 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.530
 three monitors so glued and that all the 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.920
 screen of all the games extends 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.920
 those 3 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.629
 what we see 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.819
 we are 3 then now we read 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.819
 now there's nothing from his boss 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.350
 here it is 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.650
 pretty pretty, pretty thin 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.650
 can see there has an entry hdmi 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.270
 has usb and the other components and 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.940
 the antenna if you like to watch TV 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.670
 pay has another hdmi entry that I'm 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.000
 seeing 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.069
 and with two inputs hdmi is more than the 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.160
 perfect one for the monitor and another for 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.870
 the console and it's all good 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.060
 but people if you want to know more 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.250
 about this type of monitors, it is going to 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.930
 have another video with the review to see 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.880
 how it looks like it works like this is easy to 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.940
 use if it is not easy to use and if it is 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.650
 appropriate for gamers or not but 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.000

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.200
