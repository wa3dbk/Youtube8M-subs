00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
different if you're an economy yeah and

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.160 
different if you're an economy yeah and
I<00:04:34.970> think<00:04:35.030> another<00:04:35.360> point<00:04:35.690> is<00:04:35.810> because<00:04:36.050> it's

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
I think another point is because it's

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.780 
I think another point is because it's
one<00:04:36.320> of<00:04:36.440> the<00:04:36.530> funniest<00:04:36.860> movies<00:04:37.190> of<00:04:37.340> last<00:04:37.550> year
