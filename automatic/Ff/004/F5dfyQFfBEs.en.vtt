dark<00:02:33.860> color<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.190> drill<00:02:34.430> so<00:02:35.120> I'm<00:02:35.299> going<00:02:35.330> to<00:02:35.480> have

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
dark color to drill so I'm going to have

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.740 
dark color to drill so I'm going to have
to<00:02:35.600> deploy<00:02:35.900> extra<00:02:36.560> heavy<00:02:36.799> in<00:02:37.640> those<00:02:37.850> areas<00:02:38.360> to

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
to deploy extra heavy in those areas to

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.750 
to deploy extra heavy in those areas to
be<00:02:38.900> able<00:02:38.959> to<00:02:39.110> take<00:02:39.260> out<00:02:39.410> those<00:02:39.560> building<00:02:39.950> all

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
be able to take out those building all

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.009 
be able to take out those building all
right<00:02:40.880> so<00:02:41.000> let's<00:02:41.090> go<00:02:41.299> back<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.480> where<00:02:41.690> we<00:02:41.780> first

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
right so let's go back to where we first

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.170 
right so let's go back to where we first
started<00:02:42.410> so<00:02:42.560> we<00:02:42.769> can<00:02:43.070> see<00:02:43.519> our<00:02:43.670> progress<00:02:43.910> and

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
started so we can see our progress and

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.520 
started so we can see our progress and
see<00:02:44.540> if<00:02:44.660> we<00:02:44.810> are<00:02:44.930> taking<00:02:45.200> out<00:02:45.440> those

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
see if we are taking out those

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.699 
see if we are taking out those
nope<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:48.129> looks<00:02:48.280> like<00:02:48.430> we<00:02:48.610> have<00:02:48.640> not<00:02:48.969> taken<00:02:49.269> out

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
nope it looks like we have not taken out

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.410 
nope it looks like we have not taken out
those<00:02:50.709> canyons<00:02:51.040> over<00:02:51.489> here<00:02:51.730> it's<00:02:51.909> not<00:02:52.060> too<00:02:52.209> bad

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
those canyons over here it's not too bad

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.929 
those canyons over here it's not too bad
but<00:02:52.719> at<00:02:53.349> the<00:02:53.469> top<00:02:53.680> where<00:02:54.099> we<00:02:54.219> deployed<00:02:54.579> all<00:02:54.819> of

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:54.939 
but at the top where we deployed all of

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.259 
but at the top where we deployed all of
our<00:02:55.090> extra<00:02:55.540> troops<00:02:55.750> take<00:02:56.140> out<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.290> heroes<00:02:57.269> we

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
our extra troops take out the heroes we

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.360 
our extra troops take out the heroes we
did<00:02:58.450> not<00:02:58.689> take<00:02:59.290> out<00:02:59.439> those<00:02:59.590> buildings<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.219> now

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370

and took out a bunch of my troops so I

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.270 
and took out a bunch of my troops so I

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
did not take out those buildings that I

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.280 
did not take out those buildings that I
needed<00:03:06.549> to<00:03:06.760> so<00:03:07.030> that's<00:03:07.209> gonna<00:03:07.359> cost<00:03:07.629> me<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:07.900> lot

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
needed to so that's gonna cost me a lot

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.920 
needed to so that's gonna cost me a lot
of<00:03:08.349> percentage<00:03:09.010> I<00:03:09.939> still<00:03:10.390> have<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.540> couple<00:03:10.689> of

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
of percentage I still have a couple of

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.259 
of percentage I still have a couple of
extra<00:03:11.230> troops<00:03:11.439> left<00:03:11.739> but<00:03:12.700> before<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.060> do<00:03:13.150> that

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
extra troops left but before I do that

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.839 
extra troops left but before I do that
since<00:03:13.780> we<00:03:13.959> are<00:03:14.079> so<00:03:14.379> low<00:03:14.620> on<00:03:14.829> percentage<00:03:15.400> I'm

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
since we are so low on percentage I'm

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.129 
since we are so low on percentage I'm
going<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.090> use<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:16.239> couple<00:03:16.510> lightning<00:03:16.870> spells

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
going to use a couple lightning spells

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.720 
going to use a couple lightning spells
and<00:03:17.379> take<00:03:17.650> out<00:03:17.799> these<00:03:17.980> one<00:03:18.280> can't<00:03:18.489> kill

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730

buildings<00:03:19.180> that<00:03:20.139> are<00:03:20.200> all<00:03:20.379> grouped<00:03:20.709> up<00:03:20.950> so<00:03:21.609> I

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
buildings that are all grouped up so I

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.759 
buildings that are all grouped up so I
got<00:03:21.909> lucky<00:03:22.120> and<00:03:22.480> got<00:03:22.540> a<00:03:23.170> good<00:03:23.500> amount<00:03:23.680> of

percentage<00:03:24.220> from<00:03:24.400> those<00:03:24.639> two<00:03:24.879> lightning

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
percentage from those two lightning

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.390
