00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
the galaxy tab 2 10.1 if you know what

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.890 
the galaxy tab 2 10.1 if you know what
that<00:00:23.590> is<00:00:23.890> it's<00:00:24.849> basically<00:00:24.939> obviously<00:00:25.720> its

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
that is it's basically obviously its

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.320 
that is it's basically obviously its
successor<00:00:26.349> to<00:00:26.500> the<00:00:26.529> galaxy<00:00:26.980> tab<00:00:27.160> 10.1<00:00:27.339> but

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
successor to the galaxy tab 10.1 but

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.970 
successor to the galaxy tab 10.1 but
what<00:00:28.480> I<00:00:28.509> notice<00:00:28.750> is<00:00:28.960> that<00:00:29.019> as<00:00:29.349> this<00:00:29.500> the<00:00:29.769> same

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
what I notice is that as this the same

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.280 
what I notice is that as this the same
speaker<00:00:30.369> position<00:00:31.150> design<00:00:31.419> as<00:00:31.630> a<00:00:31.660> galaxy<00:00:32.080> tab

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
speaker position design as a galaxy tab

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.590 
speaker position design as a galaxy tab
2<00:00:32.500> 10.1<00:00:33.160> where<00:00:33.400> is<00:00:33.520> the<00:00:33.700> two<00:00:34.030> speakers<00:00:34.300> are<00:00:34.510> on

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
2 10.1 where is the two speakers are on

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.930 
2 10.1 where is the two speakers are on
both<00:00:35.020> the<00:00:35.170> left<00:00:35.379> and<00:00:35.590> right<00:00:35.680> sides<00:00:36.100> of<00:00:36.340> the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
both the left and right sides of the

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.000 
both the left and right sides of the
tablet<00:00:37.329> however<00:00:37.719> this<00:00:37.989> tablet<00:00:38.410> is<00:00:38.440> much<00:00:38.770> more

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
tablet however this tablet is much more

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.279 
tablet however this tablet is much more
curved<00:00:39.430> around<00:00:39.700> the<00:00:39.940> edges<00:00:40.120> so<00:00:40.750> that's<00:00:40.989> just<00:00:41.079> a

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
curved around the edges so that's just a

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:42.930 
curved around the edges so that's just a
bit<00:00:41.410> of<00:00:41.500> design<00:00:41.890> things<00:00:42.250> that<00:00:42.399> I<00:00:42.430> noticed<00:00:42.550> now

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
bit of design things that I noticed now

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.520 
bit of design things that I noticed now
let's<00:00:43.120> go<00:00:43.329> into<00:00:43.600> more<00:00:43.750> of<00:00:43.780> the<00:00:43.960> specs<00:00:44.289> two

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
let's go into more of the specs two

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.319 
let's go into more of the specs two
features<00:00:44.920> and<00:00:44.949> I'll<00:00:45.640> round<00:00:45.879> up<00:00:46.059> the<00:00:46.210> video

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
features and I'll round up the video

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:47.970 
features and I'll round up the video
with<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.809> pricing<00:00:47.289> and<00:00:47.410> stuff<00:00:47.530> like<00:00:47.770> that<00:00:47.829> so

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
with the pricing and stuff like that so

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.160 
with the pricing and stuff like that so
first<00:00:48.370> of<00:00:48.550> all<00:00:48.609> this<00:00:49.149> is<00:00:49.449> going<00:00:49.750> to<00:00:49.899> have<00:00:50.020> an

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
first of all this is going to have an

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.260 
first of all this is going to have an
amazing<00:00:50.260> display<00:00:50.949> it<00:00:51.280> is<00:00:51.399> a<00:00:51.430> super<00:00:51.910> amoled

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
amazing display it is a super amoled

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.979 
amazing display it is a super amoled
display<00:00:52.660> and<00:00:52.899> it<00:00:53.230> has<00:00:53.350> a<00:00:53.379> resolution<00:00:53.680> of<00:00:54.989> 2560

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
display and it has a resolution of 2560

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.819 
display and it has a resolution of 2560
by<00:00:56.710> 1600<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:58.690> means<00:00:58.930> that<00:00:59.289> equates<00:00:59.620> your

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
by 1600 that means that equates your

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.310 
by 1600 that means that equates your
pixel<00:01:00.340> density<00:01:01.179> at<00:01:01.600> around<00:01:01.899> three<00:01:02.260> hundred

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
pixel density at around three hundred

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.229 
pixel density at around three hundred
that's<00:01:02.649> what<00:01:02.859> Google<00:01:03.250> is<00:01:03.280> promising<00:01:03.910> i<00:01:04.030> think

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
that's what Google is promising i think

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.880 
that's what Google is promising i think
that's<00:01:04.390> they<00:01:04.660> wanted<00:01:05.050> that<00:01:05.170> number<00:01:05.470> they<00:01:05.650> want

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
that's they wanted that number they want

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.210 
that's they wanted that number they want
to<00:01:06.130> aim<00:01:06.580> for<00:01:06.659> ppi<00:01:07.659> have<00:01:07.840> 300<00:01:08.530> so<00:01:08.890> that<00:01:09.100> they

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
to aim for ppi have 300 so that they

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.880 
to aim for ppi have 300 so that they
could<00:01:09.369> compete<00:01:09.670> with<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:09.970> ipad<00:01:10.170> 3<00:01:11.170> or<00:01:11.320> ipad<00:01:11.619> 4

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
could compete with the ipad 3 or ipad 4

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.679 
could compete with the ipad 3 or ipad 4
with<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.220> retina<00:01:12.549> display<00:01:12.880> and<00:01:13.119> this

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
with the retina display and this

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.270 
with the retina display and this
definitely<00:01:13.900> comes<00:01:14.380> into<00:01:14.650> retina<00:01:14.950> display

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
definitely comes into retina display

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.249 
definitely comes into retina display
territory<00:01:15.790> it's<00:01:15.939> amazing<00:01:16.390> in<00:01:16.869> terms<00:01:16.930> of

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
territory it's amazing in terms of

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.800 
territory it's amazing in terms of
battery<00:01:17.500> life<00:01:17.830> it's<00:01:18.250> gonna<00:01:18.670> get<00:01:19.090> around<00:01:19.450> nine

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
battery life it's gonna get around nine

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.719 
battery life it's gonna get around nine
