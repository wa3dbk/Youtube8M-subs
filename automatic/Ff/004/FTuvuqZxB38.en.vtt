the video just because it was a bad day
it's<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.840> pretty<00:02:49.870> pressured<00:02:50.530> Lake<00:02:50.709> so<00:02:50.859> what<00:02:51.010> I

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
it's a pretty pressured Lake so what I

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.309 
it's a pretty pressured Lake so what I
was<00:02:51.250> doing<00:02:51.280> is<00:02:51.670> what<00:02:51.819> was<00:02:52.000> key<00:02:52.269> was<00:02:52.989> getting

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
was doing is what was key was getting

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.199 
was doing is what was key was getting
those<00:02:53.470> fit<00:02:53.739> to<00:02:54.040> get<00:02:54.190> in<00:02:54.310> that<00:02:54.430> bait<00:02:54.669> in<00:02:54.970> the

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
those fit to get in that bait in the

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.320 
those fit to get in that bait in the
places<00:02:55.630> where<00:02:55.780> those<00:02:55.930> fish

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
places where those fish

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.720

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.890 
to come my hero idea so in this video
had<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:09.690> tournament<00:04:10.140> at<00:04:10.920> this<00:04:11.130> lake<00:04:11.370> so<00:04:12.030> he<00:04:12.720> went

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900

off the night before started practicing
what<00:04:15.540> happened<00:04:15.930> was<00:04:17.180> these<00:04:18.180> fish<00:04:18.419> were<00:04:18.630> still

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
what happened was these fish were still

what happened was these fish were still
kinda<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.709> pre-spawn<00:04:20.310> still<00:04:21.030> kind<00:04:21.239> of<00:04:21.299> eating

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
kinda and pre-spawn still kind of eating

kinda and pre-spawn still kind of eating
not<00:04:22.049> getting<00:04:22.410> ready<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.770> spawn<00:04:23.010> yet<00:04:23.340> so<00:04:23.850> we're

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
not getting ready to spawn yet so we're

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.280 
not getting ready to spawn yet so we're
catching<00:04:24.300> a<00:04:24.360> lot<00:04:24.479> of<00:04:24.630> them<00:04:24.720> a<00:04:24.810> crankbait<00:04:25.080> it's

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
catching a lot of them a crankbait it's

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.370 
catching a lot of them a crankbait it's
one<00:04:25.500> of<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.770> key<00:04:26.010> things<00:04:26.720> 90%<00:04:27.720> of<00:04:27.780> my<00:04:27.930> bites<00:04:28.140> on

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
one of the key things 90% of my bites on

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.130 
one of the key things 90% of my bites on
crankbaits<00:04:28.860> I'm<00:04:29.520> doing<00:04:30.000> it<00:04:30.150> to<00:04:30.840> make<00:04:30.960> those

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
crankbaits I'm doing it to make those

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.409 
crankbaits I'm doing it to make those
fish<00:04:31.380> react<00:04:31.680> so<00:04:31.860> what<00:04:32.040> I<00:04:32.070> did<00:04:32.190> you<00:04:33.060> wanted<00:04:33.360> to

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
fish react so what I did you wanted to

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:34.790 
fish react so what I did you wanted to
grind<00:04:33.690> that<00:04:33.870> crank<00:04:34.169> bait<00:04:34.229> whether<00:04:34.560> it<00:04:34.680> be

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800

structures some kind of cover that's

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.450 
structures some kind of cover that's
what<00:04:43.080> made<00:04:43.229> those<00:04:43.380> fish<00:04:43.620> bite<00:04:43.890> you<00:04:44.130> wouldn't

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
what made those fish bite you wouldn't

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.100 
what made those fish bite you wouldn't
just<00:04:44.610> get<00:04:44.729> a<00:04:44.790> hit<00:04:45.060> if<00:04:45.240> you<00:04:45.360> chucked<00:04:45.660> it<00:04:45.810> and

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
just get a hit if you chucked it and

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.540 
just get a hit if you chucked it and
just<00:04:46.350> start<00:04:46.530> winding<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:47.040> it<00:04:47.160> was<00:04:47.250> just<00:04:47.400> going

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
just start winding and it was just going

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.500 
just start winding and it was just going
through<00:04:47.729> the<00:04:47.820> water<00:04:47.940> you<00:04:48.150> would<00:04:48.270> have<00:04:48.390> to

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
through the water you would have to

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.450 
through the water you would have to
grind<00:04:48.780> it<00:04:49.050> on<00:04:49.260> the<00:04:49.770> rocks

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
grind it on the rocks

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.380 
grind it on the rocks
grind<00:04:51.090> it<00:04:51.240> on<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.860> wood<00:04:52.860> make<00:04:53.310> that<00:04:53.520> crank

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
grind it on the wood make that crank

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.270 
grind it on the wood make that crank
bait<00:04:54.450> deflect<00:04:55.050> off<00:04:55.260> all<00:04:55.530> that<00:04:55.710> cover<00:04:55.979> and

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
bait deflect off all that cover and

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.100 
bait deflect off all that cover and
that's<00:04:57.000> when<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.300> fish<00:04:57.450> would<00:04:57.630> bite<00:04:57.780> you'd<00:04:57.960> be

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
that's when the fish would bite you'd be

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.600 
that's when the fish would bite you'd be
grinding<00:04:58.530> it<00:04:58.650> down<00:04:58.680> and<00:04:59.130> be<00:04:59.250> hitting<00:04:59.520> those

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
grinding it down and be hitting those

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.190 
grinding it down and be hitting those
rocks<00:04:59.910> and<00:05:00.090> all<00:05:00.150> of<00:05:00.210> a<00:05:00.240> sudden<00:05:00.540> it<00:05:00.720> bounced<00:05:01.020> off

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
rocks and all of a sudden it bounced off

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.440 
rocks and all of a sudden it bounced off
a<00:05:01.260> rock<00:05:01.530> then<00:05:02.100> you<00:05:02.250> just<00:05:02.460> feel<00:05:02.610> that<00:05:02.640> fish<00:05:02.970> nail

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
a rock then you just feel that fish nail

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.810 
a rock then you just feel that fish nail
it

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
it

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.750 
it
that's<00:05:04.390> what<00:05:04.600> that<00:05:04.780> that<00:05:05.080> it<00:05:05.410> it<00:05:06.220> creates<00:05:06.640> a

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
that's what that that it it creates a

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.530 
that's what that that it it creates a
reaction<00:05:07.090> strike<00:05:07.570> so<00:05:08.260> what<00:05:08.440> that<00:05:08.590> does<00:05:08.860> is

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
reaction strike so what that does is

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.600 
reaction strike so what that does is
when<00:05:10.540> the<00:05:10.660> crankbait<00:05:11.050> if<00:05:11.590> it's<00:05:11.740> just<00:05:12.370> going

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
when the crankbait if it's just going

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.850 
when the crankbait if it's just going
really<00:05:12.850> slow<00:05:13.180> across<00:05:13.600> that<00:05:14.020> fish<00:05:14.230> has<00:05:14.440> time<00:05:14.680> to

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
really slow across that fish has time to

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.530 
really slow across that fish has time to
look<00:05:15.040> at<00:05:15.220> it<00:05:15.250> and<00:05:15.430> decide<00:05:15.610> whether<00:05:16.150> it<00:05:16.330> wants

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
look at it and decide whether it wants

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.540 
look at it and decide whether it wants
to<00:05:16.570> either<00:05:16.750> or<00:05:16.930> not<00:05:17.080> but<00:05:17.680> a<00:05:17.710> thought<00:05:17.980> crankbait

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
to either or not but a thought crankbait
