00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
reclaimed wood that I'm currently using

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.420 
reclaimed wood that I'm currently using
it<00:01:11.970> was<00:01:12.180> stacked<00:01:12.570> up<00:01:12.930> up<00:01:13.770> under<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.190> racks

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
it was stacked up up under the racks

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.660 
it was stacked up up under the racks
there<00:01:14.790> they<00:01:14.910> are<00:01:14.940> and<00:01:15.920> this<00:01:16.920> originally<00:01:17.640> I

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
there they are and this originally I

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.850 
there they are and this originally I
think<00:01:17.970> was<00:01:18.120> just<00:01:18.390> used<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:18.750> hay<00:01:19.110> storage<00:01:19.530> but

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
think was just used for hay storage but

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.670 
think was just used for hay storage but
then<00:01:19.980> over<00:01:20.070> time<00:01:20.370> a<00:01:20.400> lot<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:21.120> lumber<00:01:21.560> ended<00:01:22.560> up

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
then over time a lot of lumber ended up

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.670 
then over time a lot of lumber ended up
getting<00:01:23.040> stacked<00:01:23.490> up<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.240> luckily<00:01:25.230> I<00:01:25.350> ended

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
getting stacked up and luckily I ended

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.140 
getting stacked up and luckily I ended
up<00:01:25.770> with<00:01:25.980> it<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.280> then<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.640> outside<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150

quite<00:01:38.190> a<00:01:38.220> bit<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.460> work<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.880> get<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.150> all<00:01:39.420> taken

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
quite a bit of work to get it all taken

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.570 
quite a bit of work to get it all taken
apart<00:01:40.140> I'm<00:01:40.350> doing<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.650> all<00:01:40.770> by<00:01:40.950> hand<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.400> don't

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
apart I'm doing it all by hand I don't

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.510 
apart I'm doing it all by hand I don't
have<00:01:41.730> any<00:01:41.910> equipment<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.980> it'll<00:01:43.980> be<00:01:44.070> semi

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
have any equipment so it'll be semi

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.090 
have any equipment so it'll be semi
dangerous<00:01:45.120> and<00:01:45.660> very<00:01:45.960> time-consuming<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:47.040> I

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
dangerous and very time-consuming but I

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.800 
dangerous and very time-consuming but I
think<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.340> will<00:01:47.400> make<00:01:47.460> for<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> nice<00:01:48.060> video<00:01:48.450> and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
think it will make for a nice video and
