00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.089 
and this is my review of the iPhone 5c
so<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.719> has<00:00:12.840> its<00:00:12.990> own<00:00:13.110> for<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.380> few<00:00:13.590> weeks<00:00:13.740> now

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
so it has its own for a few weeks now

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.180 
so it has its own for a few weeks now
and<00:00:14.490> it's<00:00:15.030> been<00:00:15.330> fairly<00:00:15.660> interesting<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:17.070> I'm

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
and it's been fairly interesting so I'm

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.070 
and it's been fairly interesting so I'm
typically<00:00:17.490> an<00:00:17.699> Android<00:00:18.060> user<00:00:18.300> so<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:18.900> is

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
typically an Android user so this is

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.790 
typically an Android user so this is
really<00:00:19.380> my<00:00:19.740> first<00:00:20.359> hands-on<00:00:21.439> with<00:00:22.439> an<00:00:22.560> iOS

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
really my first hands-on with an iOS

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.060 
really my first hands-on with an iOS
device<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:24.300> was<00:00:24.390> pretty<00:00:24.840> solid<00:00:25.410> so

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
device and it was pretty solid so

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.920 
device and it was pretty solid so
starting<00:00:26.490> off<00:00:26.550> with<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.760> hardware<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.720> phone

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
starting off with the hardware the phone

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.019 
starting off with the hardware the phone
is<00:00:28.199> made<00:00:28.470> out<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.710> glass<00:00:29.039> on<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.340> front<00:00:29.490> with<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
is made out of glass on the front with a

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.630 
is made out of glass on the front with a
polycarbonate<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.439> back<00:00:31.619> pretty<00:00:32.489> much

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
polycarbonate on the back pretty much

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.580 
polycarbonate on the back pretty much
that's<00:00:32.820> kind<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.239> fancy<00:00:33.630> word<00:00:33.750> for<00:00:33.809> plastic

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
that's kind of a fancy word for plastic

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.830 
that's kind of a fancy word for plastic
however<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.790> doesn't<00:00:36.149> really<00:00:36.450> feel<00:00:36.660> like

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
however it doesn't really feel like

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.900 
however it doesn't really feel like
plastic<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.410> very<00:00:37.680> solid<00:00:37.950> it's<00:00:38.370> very<00:00:38.579> well

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
plastic it's very solid it's very well

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.060 
plastic it's very solid it's very well
built<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.540> know<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.050> few<00:00:40.260> blogs<00:00:40.590> out<00:00:40.770> there<00:00:40.829> were

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
built I know a few blogs out there were

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.950 
built I know a few blogs out there were
saying<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.489> felt<00:00:41.640> like<00:00:41.730> acrylic<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.450> wouldn't

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
saying it felt like acrylic and wouldn't

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.990 
saying it felt like acrylic and wouldn't
necessarily<00:00:43.469> say<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.250> high<00:00:44.460> quality

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
necessarily say it's that high quality

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.690 
necessarily say it's that high quality
however<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> very<00:00:46.590> solid<00:00:47.129> feel<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.399> I

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
however is a very solid feel and I

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.369 
however is a very solid feel and I
wouldn't<00:00:48.090> let<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.600> plastic<00:00:49.110> backing

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
wouldn't let the plastic backing

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.590 
wouldn't let the plastic backing

nice<00:01:13.680> they<00:01:14.670> just<00:01:14.880> tend<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.150> be<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.420> girlier

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
nice they just tend to be on the girlier

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.700 
nice they just tend to be on the girlier
side<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.229> things

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
side of things

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.520 
side of things
however<00:01:17.430> they<00:01:17.640> are<00:01:17.670> solid<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.810> there's<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.290> lot

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
however they are solid and there's a lot

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.960 
however they are solid and there's a lot
of<00:01:19.680> different<00:01:19.920> colors<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.220> choose<00:01:20.310> from<00:01:20.729> and

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
of different colors to choose from and

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.700 
of different colors to choose from and
then<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:21.689> get<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> couple<00:01:22.080> cool<00:01:22.290> cases

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
then you can get a couple cool cases

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.170 
then you can get a couple cool cases
that<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:23.040> actually<00:01:23.369> show<00:01:23.549> off<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.880> color<00:01:24.060> of

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
that can actually show off the color of

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.020 
that can actually show off the color of
the<00:01:24.270> phone<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.720> make<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.020> very<00:01:25.799> unique<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
the phone and make it very unique to the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.740 
the phone and make it very unique to the
user<00:01:27.680> now<00:01:28.680> trying<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.220> owe<00:01:29.250> s7<00:01:29.909> with<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.360> Apple

user now trying I owe s7 with the Apple
a6<00:01:31.110> processor<00:01:32.030> simply<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.780> about<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
a6 processor simply it's just about the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.960 
a6 processor simply it's just about the
same<00:01:34.350> exact<00:01:34.799> internals<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.670> they<00:01:35.820> brought

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
same exact internals that they brought

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.270 
same exact internals that they brought
over<00:01:36.119> from<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.509> iPhone<00:01:36.840> 5<00:01:37.079> however<00:01:37.799> they<00:01:38.100> did

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
over from the iPhone 5 however they did

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.950 
over from the iPhone 5 however they did
increase<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.700> battery<00:01:38.820> life<00:01:39.150> just<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.570> bit<00:01:39.720> and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
increase the battery life just a bit and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.020 
increase the battery life just a bit and
that<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.380> definitely<00:01:40.560> noticeable<00:01:41.030> battery
