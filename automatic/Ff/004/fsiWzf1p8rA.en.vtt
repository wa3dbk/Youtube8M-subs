00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
having a hardware problem one of my ram

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.290 
having a hardware problem one of my ram
stick<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.390> think<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.080> one<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.289> my<00:00:19.470> RAM<00:00:19.680> sticks

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
stick I think is one of my RAM sticks

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.960 
stick I think is one of my RAM sticks
they<00:00:21.300> are<00:00:21.980> pretty<00:00:22.980> much<00:00:23.100> when<00:00:23.699> I'm<00:00:23.850> most

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
they are pretty much when I'm most

they are pretty much when I'm most
screwed<00:00:24.390> up<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.869> was<00:00:25.740> running<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> diagnostic<00:00:26.250> in

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
screwed up I was running a diagnostic in

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.330 
screwed up I was running a diagnostic in
I<00:00:28.670> thought<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.820> was<00:00:30.000> my<00:00:30.210> other<00:00:30.480> Ram<00:00:31.019> stick<00:00:31.500> that

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
I thought it was my other Ram stick that

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.340 
I thought it was my other Ram stick that
was<00:00:32.489> messing<00:00:32.910> up<00:00:33.030> but<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.360> could<00:00:33.719> be<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.050> Ram

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
was messing up but it could be this Ram

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.020 
was messing up but it could be this Ram
stick<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:35.010> might<00:00:35.309> be<00:00:35.489> defective<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:38.030> that

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
stick this might be defective so that

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
stick this might be defective so that
went<00:00:39.270> down<00:00:40.250> pick<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.430> one<00:00:41.670> up<00:00:41.899> but<00:00:42.899> then

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
went down pick this one up but then

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.330 
went down pick this one up but then
almost<00:00:46.050> had<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> diagonal<00:00:47.270> position<00:00:49.280> do<00:00:50.280> you

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
almost had a diagonal position do you

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.369 
almost had a diagonal position do you
want<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.640> push<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:53.059> push<00:00:54.059> down<00:00:54.329> too<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.780> hear

don't<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:01.890> screw<00:03:02.070> these<00:03:02.310> screws<00:03:02.640> in<00:03:02.790> they

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
don't you screw these screws in they

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.750 
don't you screw these screws in they
don't<00:03:03.090> have<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.450> be<00:03:03.570> super<00:03:03.840> tight<00:03:04.760> just

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
well if you don't screw them the right

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.410 
well if you don't screw them the right
way<00:03:19.950> so<00:03:21.500> is

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.120 

make<00:03:26.290> sure<00:03:26.590> you<00:03:26.710> screw<00:03:28.680> just<00:03:29.680> when<00:03:29.920> you<00:03:30.070> start

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
make sure you screw just when you start

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.640 
make sure you screw just when you start
feeling<00:03:30.730> some<00:03:31.180> resistance<00:03:31.780> when<00:03:32.320> you<00:03:32.410> can't

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
feeling some resistance when you can't

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.410 
feeling some resistance when you can't
really<00:03:32.800> screw<00:03:33.100> anymore<00:03:33.430> just<00:03:33.550> just<00:03:34.120> stop

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
really screw anymore just just stop

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.230 
really screw anymore just just stop
don't<00:03:34.960> you<00:03:35.280> don't<00:03:36.280> need<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.460> do<00:03:36.610> it<00:03:36.730> too<00:03:37.030> much

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
don't you don't need to do it too much

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:46.230 
don't you don't need to do it too much
so<00:03:42.000> what<00:03:43.000> I<00:03:43.060> did<00:03:43.120> I<00:03:43.300> just<00:03:43.420> took<00:03:43.660> that<00:03:44.970> this<00:03:45.970> Ram

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
so what I did I just took that this Ram

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.350 
so what I did I just took that this Ram
stick<00:03:46.540> might<00:03:46.780> be<00:03:46.930> defective<00:03:47.290> I<00:03:47.910> don't<00:03:48.910> know<00:03:49.090> I

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
stick might be defective I don't know I

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.390 
stick might be defective I don't know I
actually<00:03:49.720> have<00:03:50.050> RAM<00:03:50.260> sticks<00:03:50.620> under<00:03:51.310> the

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
actually have RAM sticks under the

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.030 
actually have RAM sticks under the
motherboard<00:03:51.910> and<00:03:52.000> I<00:03:52.590> really<00:03:53.590> don't<00:03:53.800> want<00:03:53.980> to

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
motherboard and I really don't want to

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:03.530 
motherboard and I really don't want to
go<00:03:54.160> under<00:03:54.490> there<00:03:55.230> bad<00:03:56.560> happens<00:03:59.340> so

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.640 

hopefully<00:04:04.540> I'm<00:04:04.660> gonna<00:04:04.810> have<00:04:05.020> to<00:04:05.170> go<00:04:05.290> under<00:04:05.440> the

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
hopefully I'm gonna have to go under the

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.090 
hopefully I'm gonna have to go under the
motherboard<00:04:06.190> and<00:04:06.340> get<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:06.820> RAM<00:04:07.000> sticks<00:04:07.950> we<00:04:08.950> do

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
motherboard and get the RAM sticks we do

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.680 
motherboard and get the RAM sticks we do
a<00:04:09.130> diagnostic<00:04:09.520> one<00:04:10.090> of<00:04:10.150> those<00:04:12.480> really<00:04:13.480> don't

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
a diagnostic one of those really don't

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.740 
a diagnostic one of those really don't
want<00:04:13.900> to<00:04:13.959> do<00:04:14.080> that<00:04:14.260> I<00:04:15.419> don't<00:04:16.419> think<00:04:16.570> I'm<00:04:16.630> gonna

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
want to do that I don't think I'm gonna

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.050 
want to do that I don't think I'm gonna
break<00:04:17.019> anything<00:04:17.470> but<00:04:17.709> so<00:04:18.640> always<00:04:18.820> it

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
break anything but so always it

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.820 
break anything but so always it
possibility<00:04:19.690> I<00:04:20.340> don't<00:04:21.340> have<00:04:21.459> a<00:04:21.549> job<00:04:21.790> I<00:04:22.830> don't

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
possibility I don't have a job I don't

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.120 
possibility I don't have a job I don't
have<00:04:24.070> any<00:04:24.250> money<00:04:25.230> so<00:04:26.230> I<00:04:26.260> break<00:04:26.590> this<00:04:26.800> laptop

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
have any money so I break this laptop

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.300 
have any money so I break this laptop
and<00:04:27.820> I<00:04:28.060> void<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.480> warranty<00:04:28.510> so<00:04:32.310> warranty

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
and I void the warranty so warranty

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.250 
and I void the warranty so warranty
sticker<00:04:33.610> right<00:04:33.760> there<00:04:33.940> probably<00:04:34.690> can't<00:04:35.020> see

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
sticker right there probably can't see

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.110 
sticker right there probably can't see
it<00:04:35.290> but<00:04:35.910> that's<00:04:36.910> the<00:04:37.090> warranty<00:04:37.540> stickers<00:04:37.990> on

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
it but that's the warranty stickers on

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.510 
it but that's the warranty stickers on
that's<00:04:40.120> that's<00:04:40.750> done<00:04:41.050> so<00:04:41.740> I'm<00:04:42.130> gonna<00:04:42.250> break

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
that's that's done so I'm gonna break

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:51.580 
that's that's done so I'm gonna break
this<00:04:42.669> laptop<00:04:46.710> on<00:04:47.710> smooth

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.590 

right
