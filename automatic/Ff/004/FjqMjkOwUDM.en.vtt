or<00:00:52.409> heat<00:00:53.339> styling<00:00:53.729> tools<00:00:54.229> our<00:00:55.229> hair<00:00:55.589> it's

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:55.799 
or heat styling tools our hair it's

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:59.000 
or heat styling tools our hair it's
basically<00:00:56.400> healthy<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.269> the<00:00:58.049> on<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.530> job<00:00:58.799> of

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
basically healthy and the on the job of

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.840 
basically healthy and the on the job of
protein<00:00:59.760> added<00:01:00.299> protein<00:01:00.479> and<00:01:00.930> treatments<00:01:01.440> are

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
protein added protein and treatments are

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.479 
protein added protein and treatments are
so<00:01:02.850> basically<00:01:03.299> rebuild<00:01:03.870> those<00:01:04.650> broken<00:01:05.159> down

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
so basically rebuild those broken down

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.770 
so basically rebuild those broken down
proteins<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.830> so<00:01:07.830> I'm<00:01:08.010> filling<00:01:08.540> like<00:01:09.540> all

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
proteins in the so I'm filling like all

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.200 
proteins in the so I'm filling like all
the<00:01:09.930> damage<00:01:10.350> spots<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.950> we<00:01:11.100> can<00:01:11.310> area<00:01:11.700> now<00:01:12.090> if

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the damage spots and we can area now if

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.090 
the damage spots and we can area now if
you<00:01:12.330> haven't<00:01:12.540> are<00:01:13.050> gonna<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> lifestyle

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
you haven't are gonna have a lifestyle

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.570 
you haven't are gonna have a lifestyle
that<00:01:14.190> some<00:01:15.290> hair<00:01:16.290> damaging<00:01:16.830> like<00:01:17.010> if<00:01:17.430> you're

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
that some hair damaging like if you're

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.760 
that some hair damaging like if you're
not<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.730> swimmer<00:01:18.210> or<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.750> don't<00:01:18.960> go<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.620> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
not a swimmer or you don't go to the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.350 
not a swimmer or you don't go to the
beach<00:01:20.010> all<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.280> time

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
beach all the time

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.010 
beach all the time
not<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:22.410> know<00:01:22.560> using<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.610> lot<00:01:23.760> of<00:01:23.910> heat<00:01:24.390> styling

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
not you know using a lot of heat styling

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.620 
not you know using a lot of heat styling
come<00:01:25.590> from<00:01:25.950> color<00:01:26.280> chemical<00:01:26.580> sides<00:01:27.180> went<00:01:27.750> to

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
come from color chemical sides went to

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.289 
come from color chemical sides went to
your<00:01:29.200> hair<00:01:29.439> structure<00:01:30.040> is<00:01:30.189> basically<00:01:30.880> intact

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
your hair structure is basically intact

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.109 
your hair structure is basically intact
so<00:01:31.869> when<00:01:32.049> you<00:01:32.140> add<00:01:32.430> protein<00:01:33.430> even<00:01:33.939> in<00:01:34.030> the

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
so when you add protein even in the

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.830 
so when you add protein even in the
smallest<00:01:34.390> amount<00:01:35.759> you're<00:01:36.759> basically<00:01:37.329> holding

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
smallest amount you're basically holding

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.709 
smallest amount you're basically holding
your<00:01:38.049> hair<00:01:38.350> with<00:01:39.539> the<00:01:40.539> protein<00:01:40.990> it's<00:01:41.530> not

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
your hair with the protein it's not

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:46.139 
your hair with the protein it's not
mending<00:01:43.719> there's<00:01:44.110> nothing<00:01:44.289> to<00:01:44.469> mend<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:46.090> you

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
mending there's nothing to mend so you

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.510 
mending there's nothing to mend so you
here<00:01:46.420> might<00:01:46.600> go<00:01:46.750> hard<00:01:47.049> it<00:01:47.590> might<00:01:47.890> feel<00:01:48.130> dryer

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
here might go hard it might feel dryer

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.850 
here might go hard it might feel dryer
and<00:01:48.880> this<00:01:49.299> will<00:01:49.509> go<00:01:49.750> away<00:01:49.780> with<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.649> use<00:01:50.829> of

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
and this will go away with the use of

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.649 
and this will go away with the use of
your<00:01:51.189> shampoo<00:01:51.610> and<00:01:51.789> conditioner<00:01:52.210> because<00:01:52.360> the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
your shampoo and conditioner because the

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.499 
your shampoo and conditioner because the
hair<00:01:52.840> will<00:01:52.990> work<00:01:53.200> back<00:01:53.439> down<00:01:54.000> let<00:01:55.000> me<00:01:55.119> say<00:01:55.329> this

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
hair will work back down let me say this

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.660 
hair will work back down let me say this
protein<00:01:56.170> is<00:01:56.200> not<00:01:56.590> necessary<00:01:57.250> that<00:01:57.369> every

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
protein is not necessary that every

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.170 
protein is not necessary that every
stage<00:01:58.390> of<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.679> earth<00:01:59.770> of<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.340> air<00:02:00.759> journey

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
the better huge feature here but a

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.820 
the better huge feature here but a
product

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
product

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.520 
product
the<00:02:08.340> less<00:02:08.550> manipulating<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:10.619> last<00:02:12.530> chemical

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
the less manipulating the last chemical

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.220 
the less manipulating the last chemical
processing<00:02:14.070> that<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.340> do<00:02:14.600> less<00:02:15.600> often<00:02:15.900> you

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
processing that you do less often you

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.140 
processing that you do less often you
couldn't<00:02:16.560> need<00:02:16.710> to<00:02:16.890> add<00:02:17.070> extra<00:02:17.430> protein

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.190 

a<00:02:20.860> regular<00:02:21.860> strengthened<00:02:22.340> shampoo<00:02:22.930> can<00:02:23.930> or

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
a regular strengthened shampoo can or

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.800 
a regular strengthened shampoo can or
strengthening<00:02:24.920> conditioner<00:02:25.180> with<00:02:26.180> egg

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
strengthening conditioner with egg

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.790 
strengthening conditioner with egg
protein

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
protein

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.210 
protein
so<00:02:29.800> protein<00:02:30.340> will<00:02:30.700> correct<00:02:31.120> any<00:02:31.420> minor<00:02:31.870> damage

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
so protein will correct any minor damage

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.680 
so protein will correct any minor damage
that<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.370> may<00:02:33.519> have<00:02:33.550> done<00:02:33.790> over<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.150> past<00:02:34.209> six
