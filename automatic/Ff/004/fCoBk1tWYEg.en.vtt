00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.799
 all parents need to feel 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.990
 proud of their children not only for their 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.480
 progress in school but also by 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.640
 the things that make them unique 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.050
 the parents of people with disorder 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.029
 of the autistic spectrum also 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.369
 what others see as obsessions 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.169
 useless rituals or manias can be 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.350
 ways of communicating and doing 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:33.360
 world more manageable and logical for them 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.700
 today we are going to attend a school 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.260
 particularly where our kids 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.470
 will teach to look and understand of a 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.350
 different way 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:46.750
 today is a special day today is the end of 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.750
 course at the academy of specialists 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.550
 hello my name is max and I can count all 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.980
 the white and red cars that I see in a 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.980
 these are my friends from school 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.270
 you're drawing better than anyone and not that 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.270
 escapes no detail of what you des 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:24.590
 Each town qualifies to eliminate all 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.590
 lint in a room 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.299
 but the doubts 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.119
 l 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.060
 Violet learns any song 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.060
 consume it once you have super heard 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.570
 not the collection to people's glasses 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.570
 who wears glasses 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.189
 Y 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:28.819
 and it has been many friends in the 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.730

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.270
 Right 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:54.030
 sometimes we get too many things into the 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.030
 time and we have to close the ends 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.540
 Martin is the champion in closing doors 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.130
 if there is someone who knows many 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.510
 dinosaurs that raise your hand safe 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.510
 what catalinas there is much more 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.629
 He is a specialist in said 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.230
 it is the later in taking turns the 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.860
 backwards and without looking at the photo for not 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.860
 get distracted 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.420
 Is a crack 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.830
 when we eat we are calm we have 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.400
 ordered things so that everything is in 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.400
 your site 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.700
 Y 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.390
 and you are very clueless 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.379
 gabriel my friend is a genius 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:10.319
 imitators can imitate more than 100 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:13.760
 hello people hello hello 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.760

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.150
 mariah with her notes for the 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.660
 bisector with a formula that only 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.660
 you know 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.480
 it's super ready 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:01.180
 for bertha uncles and the number 3 color 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.510
 green and order people with numbers and 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.510
 flowers 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.180
 yes 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.140
 i 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.140
 and never make a mistake 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.590
 Y 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.140
 all these super powers allow us 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.420
 see things that you do not see and thanks 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.630
 we felt safe and 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.630
 protected 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.930
 these skills to imitate mortar 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.120
 and ordering them also serve to 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.949
 defend yourself from the daily chaos to 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.960
 orient yourself in a society with too much 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:43.350
 information and to put a little bit of 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.420
 logic in everything that surrounds you 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.969
 the autism spectrum disorder is not 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.909
 a disease 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:51.439
 it is a different form of development and 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:54.199
 will help them with the difficulties that 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:56.629
 that entails we should give them some time their 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:59.089
 measure a space where they sit 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:01.939
 happy and calm because everything is in 

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:03.979
 a logical order and a shared way 

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:06.139
 to communicate swear not to give them 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:08.930
 too many stimuli at the same time so that 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:11.930
 do not end up disconnecting 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:15.139
 people with tea are more skilled 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.699
 we in some things see and feel 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:19.220
 the world in a different way than the 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:21.530
 our who are with them 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.919
 we must listen to them and try 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:28.039
 understand them but above all do that 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:30.490
 they feel loved that is all the 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:30.490
 secret
