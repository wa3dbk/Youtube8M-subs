00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.610
 do not 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.910
 Y 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.840
 and you real production welcome to your 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.700
 tutorials section today we will teach you 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.540
 how to make frost crack nails with 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.540
 vogel enamels 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:35.410
 the first step is to place base 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:39.450
 to make our nails stronger 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.190
 and that the enamel can last longer 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.440
 We can select any of 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.020
 small ministers of toys of the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.690
 fantastic neo collection that you 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.450
 you prefer I have decided the neon ones 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.280
 because they are stronger and have new 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.280
 trends and are adding love 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.820
 we reach it 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.020
 and we put them 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.020
 a Cape 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.930
 Y 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.980
 Y 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:28.979
 and so we repeat the process until 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:28.979
 let's have a base color 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.820
 we repeat it for three or four layers 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.250
 since the craquelure enamel 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:44.890
 it must be applied with a good base of 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.780
 funds because otherwise it will not work well 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.500
 then they passed the two or three layers 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.970
 in the nail we hope that they dry for 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.970
 proceed to crackle 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.830
 Once the enamel is dry, we use the 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.430
 cracked in this case I'm going to get 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.430
 black 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.640
 We apply a thin layer and almost no 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.650
 happen again because if craquelado 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.650
 you spend a lot does not catch you 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.060
 we see how little by little it is creating 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.450
 I will use in this case 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.849
 and our communion 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.859
 as you can see is a very thin layer 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.859
 so you can catch it well 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.370
 so 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.370
 pink 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.040
 and this I will use in this hand 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.750
 the most you have to be able to eat 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.470
 well and red I will be a contrast 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.470
 with the blue 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.850
 and we let it act for a while if 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.630
 you look at the one here 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.630
 look how it was 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.260
 and see how it starts from this 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.110
 the thicker the layer more 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.920
 delay impart while thinner more than 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:49.360
 part and the same with this is a tone 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.360
 like wampis is like 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:59.050
 for this nail use pastel base and 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:02.200
 black crackle for this neon 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:06.910
 electric and cracked graffiti plum 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:11.980
 for this I used cardinal and the 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:15.460
 pink crackle for this I used mango 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:19.390
 and the crackle purple as well as 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:21.810
 with this one that uses mango and craquelure 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.810
 purple 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.220
 to have a final finish and that 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.480
 your hand is bright and you can 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.730
 demand better put a layer of brightness 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:40.660
 obviously about the evil of the young man who 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:43.980
 as you have already used vogue products 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.980
 picks faster 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.890
 and so you look bright and it looks better
