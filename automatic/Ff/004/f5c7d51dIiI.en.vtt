00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.920 

alright<00:00:08.069> last<00:00:08.370> week<00:00:08.580> at<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.120> Apple<00:00:09.570> launch<00:00:09.780> of

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:09.930 
alright last week at the Apple launch of

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.840 
alright last week at the Apple launch of
the<00:00:10.019> new<00:00:10.050> iPad<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.740> lot<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.370> commentary<00:00:11.700> and

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:11.850 
the new iPad a lot of commentary and

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.310 
the new iPad a lot of commentary and
publicity<00:00:12.060> was<00:00:12.300> made<00:00:12.480> about<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.960> fact<00:00:13.200> that

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
publicity was made about the fact that

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.160 
publicity was made about the fact that
they<00:00:13.590> were<00:00:13.710> claiming<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.220> new<00:00:14.430> I<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:15.240> 5x

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
they were claiming the new I a 5x

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.589 
they were claiming the new I a 5x
processor<00:00:16.650> was<00:00:16.890> four<00:00:17.160> times<00:00:17.460> as<00:00:17.609> powerful<00:00:17.760> to

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:18.599 
processor was four times as powerful to

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.210 
processor was four times as powerful to
the<00:00:18.720> tickle<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:18.990> three<00:00:19.170> now<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:19.860> didn't<00:00:20.100> really

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
the tickle of three now we didn't really

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.830 
the tickle of three now we didn't really
believe<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.970> we<00:00:21.240> really<00:00:21.480> wanted<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.720> see

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
believe that and we really wanted to see

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.900 
believe that and we really wanted to see
the<00:00:21.930> results<00:00:22.140> ourselves<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:23.310> we've<00:00:23.490> done<00:00:23.699> some

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
the results ourselves so we've done some

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.750 
the results ourselves so we've done some
benchmarking<00:00:24.449> using<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> GL<00:00:25.320> benchmark<00:00:25.760> the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
benchmarking using the GL benchmark the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.970 
benchmarking using the GL benchmark the
same<00:00:26.940> app<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.330> on<00:00:27.480> both<00:00:27.720> machines<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.350> we've

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
same app is on both machines and we've

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.920 
same app is on both machines and we've
just<00:00:29.010> done<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.730> actual<00:00:30.270> test<00:00:30.449> itself<00:00:30.720> so

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
just done the actual test itself so

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.060 
just done the actual test itself so
we're<00:00:31.020> gonna<00:00:31.109> bring<00:00:31.260> up<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.500> results<00:00:31.680> for<00:00:31.980> you

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
we're gonna bring up the results for you

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.719 
we're gonna bring up the results for you
now<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.270> for<00:00:33.949> how<00:00:34.949> it<00:00:35.100> handles<00:00:35.429> 3d

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:35.729 
now so this is for how it handles 3d

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:39.619 
now so this is for how it handles 3d
graphics<00:00:36.229> bring<00:00:37.229> up<00:00:37.319> the<00:00:37.440> result<00:00:38.390> like<00:00:39.390> as<00:00:39.539> you

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
graphics bring up the result like as you

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.160 
graphics bring up the result like as you
can<00:00:39.780> see<00:00:39.929> here<00:00:40.289> for<00:00:41.249> the<00:00:41.819> GL<00:00:42.239> benchmark<00:00:42.359> Egypt

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
can see here for the GL benchmark Egypt

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.119 
can see here for the GL benchmark Egypt
we<00:00:43.920> have<00:00:43.949> 60<00:00:44.460> frames<00:00:44.729> a<00:00:44.879> second<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.379> on<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.710> GL

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
we have 60 frames a second and on the GL

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.610 
we have 60 frames a second and on the GL
benchmark<00:00:47.280> pro<00:00:47.969> we've<00:00:48.359> got<00:00:48.539> 73<00:00:49.019> frames<00:00:49.499> a

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
benchmark pro we've got 73 frames a

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.309 
benchmark pro we've got 73 frames a
second<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.879> when<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.120> comes<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> 3d<00:00:52.079> I'm

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:52.319 
second so when it comes to the 3d I'm

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:55.699 
second so when it comes to the 3d I'm
here<00:00:53.179> larger<00:00:54.179> is<00:00:54.329> better<00:00:54.359> effectively<00:00:55.260> so

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:55.709 
here larger is better effectively so

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:58.189 
here larger is better effectively so
we're<00:00:55.979> going<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.159> show<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.339> the<00:00:56.870> result<00:00:57.870> for

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
we're going to show you the result for

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.660 
we're going to show you the result for
the<00:00:58.409> new<00:00:58.559> iPad<00:01:00.619> as<00:01:01.619> we<00:01:01.769> just<00:01:01.920> go<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.069> results

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
the new iPad as we just go to results

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.960 
the new iPad as we just go to results
and<00:01:03.229> the<00:01:04.229> results<00:01:04.260> pretty<00:01:04.860> much<00:01:05.070> speak<00:01:05.369> for

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
and the results pretty much speak for

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.990 
and the results pretty much speak for
themselves<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:07.110> geo<00:01:07.740> benchmark<00:01:08.280> Egypt

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.920 
some simple benchmarking the new iPad
appears<00:01:34.440> to<00:01:34.620> really<00:01:35.160> be<00:01:35.630> extremely<00:01:36.630> strong

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930

not<00:01:37.530> only<00:01:37.800> to<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.550> industry<00:01:38.850> but<00:01:39.000> also

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
not only to the industry but also

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.170 
not only to the industry but also
compared<00:01:39.660> to<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.170> Tegra<00:01:40.500> 3<00:01:40.530> which<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.180> the

now<00:01:45.540> we're<00:01:45.659> going<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.840> do<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.140> look<00:01:46.350> at<00:01:46.560> a

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
now we're going to do is look at a

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.830 
now we're going to do is look at a
couple<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.730> other<00:01:47.960> browser<00:01:48.960> based<00:01:49.670> results

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
couple of other browser based results

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.840 
couple of other browser based results
first<00:01:51.840> one<00:01:51.960> we're<00:01:52.050> going<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.200> do<00:01:52.350> here<00:01:52.850> is

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
first one we're going to do here is

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.670 
first one we're going to do here is
what's<00:01:54.240> called<00:01:54.510> browser<00:01:54.780> mark<00:01:55.080> now<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.350> test

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
what's called browser mark now this test

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.910 
what's called browser mark now this test
the<00:01:55.890> HTML<00:01:56.820> rendering<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.500> see<00:01:58.680> here<00:01:58.890> that

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
the HTML rendering you can see here that

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.180 
the HTML rendering you can see here that
the<00:01:59.610> iPads<00:01:59.970> got<00:02:00.210> lights<00:02:00.510> 9,000<00:02:01.200> mark<00:02:01.380> in

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
the iPads got lights 9,000 mark in

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.620 
the iPads got lights 9,000 mark in
comparison<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.790> things<00:02:02.970> like<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.240> Nexus

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
comparison to things like the Nexus

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.140 
comparison to things like the Nexus
which<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:03.930> about<00:02:04.080> 98,000<00:02:04.979> higher<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.120> better

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
which is about 98,000 higher is better

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.449 
which is about 98,000 higher is better
when<00:02:06.720> it<00:02:06.870> comes<00:02:07.050> to<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.890> browser<00:02:08.039> mark<00:02:08.310> for

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:11.999 
this when we look at it on the chat

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:13.819 
this when we look at it on the chat
forum<00:02:12.150> prime<00:02:12.389> is<00:02:12.840> actually<00:02:13.230> better<00:02:13.439> again

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829 
forum prime is actually better again

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.010 
forum prime is actually better again
that<00:02:14.189> in<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.370> ipad<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:14.909> it's<00:02:15.269> a

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
that in the ipad so it's a

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.470 
that in the ipad so it's a
thousand<00:02:16.440> 849<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.460> was<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.760> test<00:02:18.420> the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
thousand 849 so that was the test the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.940 
thousand 849 so that was the test the
rear<00:02:18.600> end<00:02:18.750> there<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.350> prime<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.740> better

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
rear end there so the prime is better

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.490 
rear end there so the prime is better
from<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.730> browser<00:02:20.940> my<00:02:21.180> point<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.600> view<00:02:21.630> for

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
from a browser my point of view for

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
from a browser my point of view for
JavaScript<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.810> HTML<00:02:24.810> rendering<00:02:25.370> got<00:02:26.370> one

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
JavaScript and HTML rendering got one

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.440 
JavaScript and HTML rendering got one
that<00:02:26.640> we<00:02:26.700> ran<00:02:26.910> was<00:02:28.010> JavaScript<00:02:29.010> SunSpider<00:02:29.910> now

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
that we ran was JavaScript SunSpider now

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.380 
that we ran was JavaScript SunSpider now
in<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:30.990> case<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.500> lower<00:02:31.890> figure<00:02:32.130> is<00:02:32.310> better<00:02:32.520> so

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
in this case a lower figure is better so

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.270 
in this case a lower figure is better so
when<00:02:33.540> we<00:02:33.630> look<00:02:33.780> at<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.680> transformer<00:02:35.070> prime

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
when we look at the transformer prime

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.780 
when we look at the transformer prime
here<00:02:36.200> we<00:02:37.200> can<00:02:37.320> see<00:02:37.440> that<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.650> total<00:02:38.010> was<00:02:38.130> two

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
here we can see that the total was two

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.260 
here we can see that the total was two
three<00:02:39.060> four<00:02:39.300> four<00:02:39.480> milliseconds<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:42.030> when<00:02:42.180> we

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
three four four milliseconds and when we

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.530 
three four four milliseconds and when we
look<00:02:42.480> at<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.860> ipad<00:02:44.220> or<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.760> new<00:02:44.880> ipad<00:02:45.240> it

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
look at the ipad or the new ipad it

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.830 
look at the ipad or the new ipad it
comes<00:02:45.930> in<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.230> one<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.800> 25<00:02:47.460> milliseconds<00:02:47.840> so

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
comes in that one a 25 milliseconds so

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.770 
comes in that one a 25 milliseconds so
again<00:02:49.350> from<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:49.950> javascript<00:02:50.670> point<00:02:51.270> of<00:02:51.360> view<00:02:51.510> it

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
again from a javascript point of view it

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.350 
again from a javascript point of view it
looks<00:02:51.960> like<00:02:52.050> that<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.950> new<00:02:53.100> ipad<00:02:53.490> also<00:02:54.210> add

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
looks like that the new ipad also add

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.660 
looks like that the new ipad also add
performs<00:02:54.840> another<00:02:55.260> change<00:02:55.620> for<00:02:55.740> my<00:02:55.800> prime<00:02:56.040> so

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
performs another change for my prime so

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.760 
performs another change for my prime so
there<00:02:56.880> are<00:02:56.940> three<00:02:57.380> benchmarks<00:02:58.380> that<00:02:58.440> can<00:02:58.680> be

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
there are three benchmarks that can be

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.520 
there are three benchmarks that can be
done<00:02:58.890> across<00:02:59.190> both<00:02:59.940> platforms<00:03:00.350> i'm<00:03:01.350> sure

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
done across both platforms i'm sure

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.690 
done across both platforms i'm sure
we'll<00:03:01.650> be<00:03:01.680> digging<00:03:01.890> into<00:03:02.040> this<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.220> lot<00:03:02.400> more

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
we'll be digging into this a lot more

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.690 
we'll be digging into this a lot more
and<00:03:03.000> i'm<00:03:03.060> sure<00:03:03.240> this<00:03:03.390> video<00:03:03.660> will<00:03:04.550> induce<00:03:05.550> a

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
and i'm sure this video will induce a

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.370 
and i'm sure this video will induce a
few<00:03:05.880> comments<00:03:06.300> as<00:03:06.390> well<00:03:06.540> so<00:03:06.780> please<00:03:07.170> feel<00:03:07.320> free
