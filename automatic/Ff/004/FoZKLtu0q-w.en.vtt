friday june thirteenth of course the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.429 
friday june thirteenth of course the
question<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.570> when<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.890> going<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.130> be<00:00:26.310> over

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
question is when is it going to be over

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.259 
question is when is it going to be over
well<00:00:28.439> look<00:00:28.740> we<00:00:28.949> have<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.130> full<00:00:29.429> moon<00:00:29.580> today<00:00:29.880> and

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
well look we have a full moon today and

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.990 
well look we have a full moon today and
that's<00:00:31.019> often<00:00:31.289> enough<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.250> talk<00:00:32.460> about<00:00:32.669> but

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
that's often enough to talk about but

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.120 
that's often enough to talk about but
today<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:33.570> not<00:00:33.899> even<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.469> mean<00:00:34.770> it's

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
today it's not even I mean it's

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.770 
today it's not even I mean it's
certainly<00:00:35.399> an<00:00:35.550> important<00:00:36.000> thing<00:00:36.180> we<00:00:36.360> have<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
certainly an important thing we have the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.639 
certainly an important thing we have the
the<00:00:37.590> moon<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:39.300> Sagittarius<00:00:40.170> opposing

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
the moon in in in Sagittarius opposing

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.410 
the moon in in in Sagittarius opposing
the<00:00:40.739> Sun<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.070> Gemini<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.300> an

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
the Sun in Gemini this is an

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.619 
the Sun in Gemini this is an
informational<00:00:42.780> full<00:00:43.559> moon<00:00:43.829> it's<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.640> it's<00:00:45.450> a

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
informational full moon it's a it's a

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.720 
informational full moon it's a it's a
moon<00:00:45.840> that'll<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.739> encourages<00:00:47.219> us<00:00:47.700> to

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
moon that'll that it encourages us to

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.610 
moon that'll that it encourages us to
ask<00:00:48.030> questions<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.870> want<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> lot<00:00:49.590> of

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
ask questions and want to have a lot of

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.279 
ask questions and want to have a lot of
information<00:00:50.449> but<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.510> don't<00:00:51.780> think<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.199> we

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
information but I don't think that we

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.010 
information but I don't think that we
get<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.620> experience<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.579> full<00:00:53.910> moon<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.719> its

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
get to experience the full moon in its

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.110 
get to experience the full moon in its
natural<00:00:55.320> context<00:00:56.280> because<00:00:56.640> there<00:00:56.969> are

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
natural context because there are

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.939 
natural context because there are
weightier<00:00:57.629> things<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.350> are<00:00:58.469> pulling<00:00:58.800> us

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
weightier things that are pulling us

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.790 
weightier things that are pulling us
into<00:00:59.190> other<00:00:59.609> issues<00:01:00.210> well<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.020> there's<00:01:01.559> also

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
into other issues well and there's also

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.500 
into other issues well and there's also
the<00:01:01.980> fact<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.699> opposition<00:01:03.090> between

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
the fact that this opposition between

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.530 
the fact that this opposition between
the<00:01:04.260> moon<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.030> Sagittarius<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.180> need<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
the moon and Sagittarius I need the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.929 
the moon and Sagittarius I need the
absolute<00:01:07.110> answer<00:01:07.439> versus<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.520> Sun<00:01:08.760> and

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
absolute answer versus the Sun and

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.359 
absolute answer versus the Sun and
Gemini<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.600> want<00:01:09.900> more<00:01:09.960> data<00:01:10.950> that

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
Gemini but I want more data that

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.480 
Gemini but I want more data that
information<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.630> occurs<00:01:13.049> at<00:01:13.490> eleven

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
information that occurs at eleven

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.280 
information that occurs at eleven
minutes<00:01:14.640> after<00:01:15.119> midnight<00:01:15.150> east<00:01:15.720> coast<00:01:16.049> time

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
minutes after midnight east coast time

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.010 
minutes after midnight east coast time
in<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> US<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.250> almost<00:01:17.490> over<00:01:18.000> yeah<00:01:18.570> it's

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
in the US so it's almost over yeah it's

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.740 
in the US so it's almost over yeah it's
almost<00:01:19.439> over<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:19.979> sense<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:20.490> also<00:01:20.820> this

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
almost over in that sense but also this

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.840 
almost over in that sense but also this
is<00:01:21.900> not<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> heavily<00:01:22.560> aspect<00:01:23.159> at<00:01:23.340> full<00:01:23.670> moon

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
is not a heavily aspect at full moon

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.910 
is not a heavily aspect at full moon
there<00:01:24.150> all<00:01:24.299> right<00:01:24.330> planets<00:01:25.200> making<00:01:25.560> strong

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
there all right planets making strong

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.950 
there all right planets making strong
tight<00:01:26.340> angles<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.090> either<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.420> son<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
tight angles to either the son of the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.289 
tight angles to either the son of the
moon<00:01:28.140> however<00:01:28.979> there<00:01:29.280> are<00:01:29.460> other<00:01:29.700> aspects

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
moon however there are other aspects

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.810 
moon however there are other aspects
going<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.439> are<00:01:31.590> supported<00:01:32.220> by<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.430> moon

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
going on that are supported by the moon

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.359 
going on that are supported by the moon
as<00:01:33.150> well<00:01:33.360> changing<00:01:34.020> signs<00:01:34.350> moving<00:01:35.130> into

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
as well changing signs moving into

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.490 
as well changing signs moving into
Capricorn<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.180> early<00:01:36.450> afternoon<00:01:36.570> yeah

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
Capricorn in the early afternoon yeah

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.010 
Capricorn in the early afternoon yeah
and<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.250> primary<00:01:38.820> thing<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.299> motivates<00:01:39.810> a

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
and the primary thing that motivates a

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.069 
and the primary thing that motivates a
lot<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.590> today<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.220> early<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.329> morning<00:01:42.869> also

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
lot of today is early this morning also

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.569 
lot of today is early this morning also
just<00:01:43.590> moments<00:01:44.159> after<00:01:45.470> midnight<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:47.040> morning

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
just moments after midnight this morning

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.420 
just moments after midnight this morning
actually<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:49.140> three<00:01:49.530> minutes<00:01:49.740> before<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
actually just three minutes before the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.660 
actually just three minutes before the
actual<00:01:50.759> full<00:01:51.149> moon<00:01:51.360> itself<00:01:51.869> we<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:52.950> Venus

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
actual full moon itself we have Venus

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.149 
actual full moon itself we have Venus
Venus<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.570> planet<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:55.079> love<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.770> attraction

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
Venus the planet of love and attraction

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.389 
Venus the planet of love and attraction
and<00:01:56.700> desire<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:57.630> her<00:01:58.140> home<00:01:58.380> sign<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.950> Taurus

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
and desire in her home sign of Taurus

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.700 
and desire in her home sign of Taurus
runs<00:02:00.210> into<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.040> naysayer<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.399> Saturn<00:02:03.390> the

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
runs into the naysayer on Saturn the

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.580 
runs into the naysayer on Saturn the
taskmaster<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:05.159> Scorpio<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.180> this<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.229> think

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
taskmaster in Scorpio and this I think

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.200 
taskmaster in Scorpio and this I think
really<00:02:07.649> defines<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.700> lot<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.209> days<00:02:09.390> energy

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
really defines a lot of the days energy

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.320 
really defines a lot of the days energy
yeah<00:02:10.420> because<00:02:10.600> on<00:02:10.960> a<00:02:11.320> fundamentally

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
yeah because on a fundamentally

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.520 
yeah because on a fundamentally
undesirable<00:02:13.330> level<00:02:13.600> venus<00:02:13.960> saturn<00:02:14.140> means

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
undesirable level venus saturn means

and we talk about Venus as the planet of
love<00:02:46.600> it's<00:02:47.380> also<00:02:47.710> the<00:02:47.980> planet<00:02:48.400> of<00:02:48.490> money<00:02:49.150> or<00:02:49.420> of

anything nice or a value and certainly

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.220 
anything nice or a value and certainly
money<00:02:51.880> has<00:02:52.180> value<00:02:52.870> or<00:02:52.990> at<00:02:53.080> least

money has value or at least
theoretically<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:54.040> should<00:02:54.070> and<00:02:54.460> when<00:02:55.060> Venus

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
theoretically it should and when Venus

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.630 
theoretically it should and when Venus
runs<00:02:55.690> into<00:02:56.020> the<00:02:56.050> opposition<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:56.860> Saturn<00:02:57.250> we

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
runs into the opposition to Saturn we

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.640 
runs into the opposition to Saturn we
might<00:02:57.850> also<00:02:58.120> feel<00:02:58.600> like<00:02:58.630> we're<00:02:59.110> not<00:02:59.260> worth

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
might also feel like we're not worth

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.010 
might also feel like we're not worth
whatever<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.640> situation<00:03:00.850> is<00:03:01.420> that<00:03:01.480> we're<00:03:01.840> in

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
whatever the situation is that we're in

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.830 
whatever the situation is that we're in
or<00:03:02.260> we<00:03:02.740> might<00:03:02.770> not<00:03:03.280> have<00:03:03.640> enough<00:03:03.820> money<00:03:04.270> to<00:03:04.600> pay

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
or we might not have enough money to pay

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.320 
or we might not have enough money to pay
for<00:03:04.870> what<00:03:05.440> it<00:03:05.590> is<00:03:05.740> that<00:03:05.980> we<00:03:06.130> want<00:03:06.400> but<00:03:07.060> all<00:03:07.270> of

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
for what it is that we want but all of

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.570 
for what it is that we want but all of
these<00:03:07.810> things<00:03:08.080> have<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.560> same<00:03:08.800> effect<00:03:09.040> and

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
these things have the same effect and

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.960 
these things have the same effect and
that<00:03:10.150> is<00:03:10.360> it<00:03:10.770> separates<00:03:11.770> me<00:03:12.010> it<00:03:12.190> pulls<00:03:12.520> me<00:03:12.820> away

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
that is it separates me it pulls me away

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.570 
that is it separates me it pulls me away
from<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:14.050> moon<00:03:14.230> in<00:03:14.380> Gemini<00:03:14.830> is<00:03:14.890> connecting

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
from the moon in Gemini is connecting

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.160 
from the moon in Gemini is connecting
and<00:03:15.760> chitter<00:03:15.970> chattering<00:03:16.540> with<00:03:16.660> everything

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
and chitter chattering with everything

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.700 
and chitter chattering with everything
and<00:03:17.410> yet<00:03:17.830> this<00:03:18.040> opposition<00:03:18.570> with<00:03:19.570> from<00:03:20.380> Venus

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
and yet this opposition with from Venus

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.340 
and yet this opposition with from Venus
to<00:03:20.890> Saturn<00:03:21.280> is<00:03:21.460> kind<00:03:22.270> of<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.480> separating<00:03:23.170> an

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
to Saturn is kind of a separating an

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.500 
to Saturn is kind of a separating an
isolating<00:03:24.100> factor<00:03:24.580> yeah<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.090> we<00:03:25.240> think<00:03:25.420> that

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
isolating factor yeah and we think that

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.890 
isolating factor yeah and we think that
Saturn<00:03:26.140> sort<00:03:26.680> of<00:03:26.830> wins<00:03:27.040> because<00:03:27.490> at<00:03:28.060> 104<00:03:28.630> p.m.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
Saturn sort of wins because at 104 p.m.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.470 
Saturn sort of wins because at 104 p.m.
the<00:03:29.110> Moon<00:03:29.260> moves<00:03:29.320> into<00:03:30.190> Saturn's<00:03:30.760> home<00:03:31.000> sign

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
the Moon moves into Saturn's home sign

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.220 
the Moon moves into Saturn's home sign
Capricorn<00:03:32.380> so<00:03:33.340> that<00:03:33.520> regardless<00:03:34.030> of<00:03:34.450> what

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
information that we have that the

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.050 
information that we have that the
Capricorn<00:03:40.300> requirement<00:03:41.140> to<00:03:41.800> draw<00:03:42.550> the<00:03:42.610> map

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
Capricorn requirement to draw the map

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
Capricorn requirement to draw the map
make<00:03:43.960> a<00:03:43.990> plan<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:44.650> stick<00:03:44.770> to<00:03:45.370> it<00:03:46.080> reinforces

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
make a plan and stick to it reinforces

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.560 
make a plan and stick to it reinforces
the<00:03:47.410> venus<00:03:47.710> saturn<00:03:47.890> opposition<00:03:48.730> i<00:03:48.880> agree<00:03:49.390> with

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
the venus saturn opposition i agree with

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.090 
the venus saturn opposition i agree with
you<00:03:49.660> completely<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.380> i<00:03:50.470> think<00:03:50.680> there's<00:03:50.860> even

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
you completely and i think there's even

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.820 
you completely and i think there's even
another<00:03:51.730> note<00:03:52.060> behind<00:03:52.360> that<00:03:53.050> which<00:03:53.440> kind<00:03:53.770> of

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
another note behind that which kind of

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.030 
another note behind that which kind of
reinforces<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.970> reinforcement<00:03:55.930> and<00:03:56.110> that<00:03:56.800> is

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
reinforces the reinforcement and that is

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.070 
reinforces the reinforcement and that is
that<00:03:57.370> when<00:03:57.550> the<00:03:57.580> moon<00:03:57.880> moves<00:03:58.150> into<00:03:58.480> capricorn

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
that when the moon moves into capricorn

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.890 
that when the moon moves into capricorn
it<00:03:59.260> certainly<00:03:59.650> calls<00:04:00.430> up<00:04:00.790> or<00:04:01.030> you<00:04:01.600> know<00:04:01.690> that

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
it certainly calls up or you know that

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.350 
it certainly calls up or you know that
energy<00:04:02.350> of<00:04:02.500> venus<00:04:02.770> opposing<00:04:03.280> saturn<00:04:03.670> but<00:04:04.210> when

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
energy of venus opposing saturn but when

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
the moon moves into capricorn we have

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.030

mars<00:04:18.430> making<00:04:18.820> a<00:04:19.060> 90-degree<00:04:19.690> angle<00:04:19.720> a<00:04:20.230> square

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
mars making a 90-degree angle a square

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.500 
mars making a 90-degree angle a square
to<00:04:20.859> pluto<00:04:21.310> that<00:04:21.760> i<00:04:21.910> think

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
to pluto that i think

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.400 
to pluto that i think
has<00:04:22.900> to<00:04:23.200> be<00:04:23.230> felt<00:04:23.980> also<00:04:24.670> today<00:04:25.180> and<00:04:25.510> so<00:04:26.110> there's

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
has to be felt also today and so there's

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.070 
has to be felt also today and so there's
that<00:04:26.590> sense<00:04:26.890> of<00:04:27.160> again<00:04:27.610> it's<00:04:28.150> it's<00:04:28.630> it's<00:04:28.900> a

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
that sense of again it's it's it's a

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.800 
that sense of again it's it's it's a
heavier<00:04:29.500> energy<00:04:30.130> struggle<00:04:30.760> it's<00:04:30.970> a<00:04:31.150> struggle

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
heavier energy struggle it's a struggle

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.160 
heavier energy struggle it's a struggle
and<00:04:32.290> so<00:04:32.560> even<00:04:33.250> though<00:04:33.520> that<00:04:34.390> full<00:04:34.690> moon<00:04:34.930> and

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
and so even though that full moon and

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.890 
and so even though that full moon and
Gemini<00:04:35.560> wants<00:04:36.430> to<00:04:36.610> dance<00:04:37.030> and<00:04:37.510> find

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
Gemini wants to dance and find

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.410 
Gemini wants to dance and find
information<00:04:38.680> and<00:04:38.830> pull<00:04:39.400> books<00:04:39.700> off<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:39.970> shelf

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
information and pull books off the shelf

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.360 
information and pull books off the shelf
in<00:04:40.600> the<00:04:40.630> library<00:04:41.170> and<00:04:41.350> read<00:04:41.500> two<00:04:41.740> pages<00:04:41.770> out<00:04:42.310> of

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
in the library and read two pages out of

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.940 
in the library and read two pages out of
every<00:04:42.760> one<00:04:42.970> of<00:04:43.090> them<00:04:43.240> I<00:04:43.420> think<00:04:44.050> that<00:04:44.260> we<00:04:44.530> are

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
every one of them I think that we are

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.020 
every one of them I think that we are
forced<00:04:45.730> to<00:04:46.000> to<00:04:46.930> deal<00:04:47.530> with<00:04:47.770> something<00:04:48.220> and<00:04:48.430> and

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
forced to to deal with something and and

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.690 
forced to to deal with something and and
stay<00:04:49.360> with<00:04:49.570> it<00:04:49.720> and<00:04:49.990> go<00:04:50.470> deep<00:04:50.740> even<00:04:51.340> if<00:04:51.550> it

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
stay with it and go deep even if it

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.250 
stay with it and go deep even if it
involves<00:04:51.970> a<00:04:52.240> stream<00:04:52.450> yeah<00:04:52.630> I<00:04:52.690> think<00:04:52.990> it<00:04:53.110> takes

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
involves a stream yeah I think it takes

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.850 
involves a stream yeah I think it takes
a<00:04:53.440> sharp<00:04:53.770> compass<00:04:54.340> in<00:04:54.550> a<00:04:54.700> narrow<00:04:55.290> focus<00:04:56.290> to

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
a sharp compass in a narrow focus to

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.040 
a sharp compass in a narrow focus to
make<00:04:57.040> much<00:04:57.280> progress<00:04:57.610> today<00:04:58.180> and<00:04:58.600> tomorrow

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
make much progress today and tomorrow

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.860 
make much progress today and tomorrow
I'm<00:04:59.500> Jeff<00:04:59.830> job<00:05:00.070> and<00:05:00.280> for<00:05:00.940> planet<00:05:01.360> pulse<00:05:01.600> I'm

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
I'm Jeff job and for planet pulse I'm
