00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
yeah the two lines that I used was our

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.040 
yeah the two lines that I used was our
teeny<00:02:07.130> mini<00:02:07.370> tip<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:07.909> then<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.600> tip<00:02:08.810> taper

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
teeny mini tip and then the tip taper

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.000 
teeny mini tip and then the tip taper
175<00:02:09.979> which<00:02:10.220> is<00:02:10.399> really<00:02:10.700> close<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:10.970> a<00:02:11.209> tee<00:02:11.420> 200

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
175 which is really close to a tee 200

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.680 
175 which is really close to a tee 200
but<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.040> used<00:02:13.280> those<00:02:13.490> two<00:02:13.760> lines<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.420> they<00:02:14.630> were

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
but I used those two lines and they were

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.630 
but I used those two lines and they were
very<00:02:15.020> output<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:15.830> then<00:02:16.010> I<00:02:16.100> only<00:02:16.190> had<00:02:16.400> about<00:02:16.490> a

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
very output and then I only had about a

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.780 
very output and then I only had about a
four<00:02:16.910> foot<00:02:17.090> leader<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:18.620> would<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:19.340> probably

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
four foot leader and I would I probably

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.330 
four foot leader and I would I probably
I<00:02:20.390> know<00:02:20.900> that<00:02:21.260> I<00:02:21.410> know<00:02:21.530> ginger<00:02:22.130> was

I know that I know ginger was
outstanding<00:02:22.820> antique<00:02:23.750> gold<00:02:24.020> was<00:02:24.320> outstanding

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
most of the time we could so you just

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.640 
most of the time we could so you just
fish<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.360> runs<00:02:47.570> and<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:47.870> remember<00:02:48.200> this<00:02:48.410> I

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
fish the runs and I remember this I

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.320 
fish the runs and I remember this I
remember<00:02:49.040> this<00:02:49.310> one<00:02:49.519> I<00:02:49.550> god<00:02:49.790> he<00:02:49.970> was<00:02:50.120> probably

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
remember this one I god he was probably

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.509 
remember this one I god he was probably
about<00:02:50.660> maybe<00:02:51.560> twelve<00:02:52.010> pounds<00:02:52.370> was<00:02:52.489> a

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
about maybe twelve pounds was a

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.300 
about maybe twelve pounds was a
beautiful<00:02:53.000> fish<00:02:53.209> but<00:02:53.930> we<00:02:54.110> were<00:02:54.260> on<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.769> lower

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
beautiful fish but we were on the lower

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.640 
beautiful fish but we were on the lower
beat<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.000> then<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:56.510> river<00:02:56.900> went<00:02:57.140> down<00:02:57.320> made<00:02:57.620> a

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
beat and then the river went down made a

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.800 
beat and then the river went down made a
bend<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.550> then<00:02:58.730> you<00:02:58.880> could<00:02:59.030> hear<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.570> great

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
bend and then you could hear the great

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.930 
bend and then you could hear the great
big<00:03:00.080> waves<00:03:00.380> from<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.769> ocean<00:03:01.130> coming<00:03:01.400> in<00:03:01.640> so

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
big waves from the ocean coming in so

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.180 
big waves from the ocean coming in so
you<00:03:02.030> could<00:03:02.150> see<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.570> ocean<00:03:02.600> and<00:03:03.140> there<00:03:04.070> was<00:03:04.160> a

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
you could see the ocean and there was a

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.640 
you could see the ocean and there was a
rock<00:03:04.760> out<00:03:05.030> of<00:03:05.180> this<00:03:05.330> nice<00:03:05.540> long<00:03:05.930> run<00:03:06.320> I<00:03:06.470> mean

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
rock out of this nice long run I mean

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.440 
rock out of this nice long run I mean
you<00:03:06.799> mark<00:03:07.280> you<00:03:07.549> would<00:03:07.670> have<00:03:07.760> loved<00:03:07.940> it<00:03:08.150> I<00:03:08.239> swear

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
you with it you know we just spent more

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.789 
you with it you know we just spent more
time<00:03:10.519> there<00:03:11.000> but<00:03:11.600> anyway<00:03:12.049> I<00:03:12.079> thought<00:03:12.440> kind<00:03:12.709> of

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
time there but anyway I thought kind of

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.500 
time there but anyway I thought kind of
like<00:03:12.950> just<00:03:13.220> get<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.519> fly<00:03:13.730> up<00:03:13.940> there<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.269> swing

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
like just get the fly up there and swing

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.750 
like just get the fly up there and swing
it<00:03:14.540> by<00:03:14.750> that<00:03:14.989> rock<00:03:15.200> and<00:03:15.500> sure<00:03:16.070> enough<00:03:16.370> I<00:03:16.549> saw

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
it by that rock and sure enough I saw

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.860 
it by that rock and sure enough I saw
him<00:03:16.940> down<00:03:17.090> there<00:03:17.299> and<00:03:17.390> who<00:03:17.480> I<00:03:17.570> have<00:03:17.720> this

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
him down there and who I have this

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.229 
him down there and who I have this
vicious<00:03:18.350> hit<00:03:18.590> made<00:03:19.280> a<00:03:19.310> run<00:03:19.610> and<00:03:19.820> made<00:03:19.940> three

great<00:03:20.510> big<00:03:20.720> beautiful<00:03:20.930> jumps<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:21.620> it<00:03:21.739> was

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
great big beautiful jumps and it was

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.979 
great big beautiful jumps and it was
like<00:03:22.100> you<00:03:22.670> know<00:03:22.760> to<00:03:22.850> have<00:03:23.000> a<00:03:23.060> lot<00:03:23.480> of<00:03:23.510> sea<00:03:23.810> lice

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
like you know to have a lot of sea lice

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.360 
like you know to have a lot of sea lice
on<00:03:24.260> it<00:03:24.440> it<00:03:24.590> was<00:03:24.709> very<00:03:24.739> cool

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
most of my most of my fish were actually

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.930 
most of my most of my fish were actually
really<00:03:27.530> bright<00:03:27.769> was<00:03:28.010> sea<00:03:28.190> lice<00:03:28.370> but<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:28.760> big

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
really bright was sea lice but the big

really bright was sea lice but the big
one<00:03:29.120> that<00:03:29.299> I<00:03:29.329> got<00:03:29.570> had<00:03:29.780> been<00:03:29.930> in<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:30.110> river<00:03:30.260> a

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
one that I got had been in the river a

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.590 
one that I got had been in the river a
little<00:03:30.500> bit<00:03:30.769> but<00:03:31.370> he<00:03:31.459> was<00:03:31.640> so<00:03:31.940> much<00:03:32.150> better

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
little bit but he was so much better

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.630 
little bit but he was so much better
than<00:03:32.930> all<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.380> other<00:03:33.530> ones<00:03:33.829> all<00:03:34.250> that<00:03:34.489> you

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
than all the other ones all that you

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.370 
than all the other ones all that you
know<00:03:34.760> they're<00:03:35.269> more<00:03:35.450> streamlined<00:03:36.019> kind<00:03:36.320> of

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
know they're more streamlined kind of

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.890 
know they're more streamlined kind of
like<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.530> steelhead<00:03:36.890> you<00:03:37.370> know<00:03:37.489> and<00:03:38.090> not<00:03:38.630> you
