00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.410
 What can I do well 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.500
 A few days later 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:17.430
 You know how they're going to be in your face. 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.400
 It was like I could not write this at first, but now 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:28.230
 I found a lot of sense of stability compared to 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:32.430
 Well, the crowd is here to take care of what he did for his story. 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:38.040
 Fortunately, there followed a uniformly stable state care for the pups 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:41.190
 But I do not even see my husband when I was originally born after childbirth . 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.700
 I slept a lot. 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.470
 I could see it at first in the camera . 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:52.160
 U 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:57.980
 Unlike the old one, 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:00.140
 When I put my body down, the food that I had not eaten for a while 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:05.890
 I have a meal to watch . 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.890
 It was a three-price forecast. 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:15.710
 Not only does Nuri have better things to do 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:18.880
 While life called the holding tank or aggression found 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.880
 I look for stability. 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.270
 There are a lot of actors, and now if you buy this again, you will do better in the future. 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.689
 same 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:35.320
 And again, 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:39.610
 I wish I could grow healthier in the future. 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:43.750
 Suddenly grasp me. Three evil spirits attacking people. 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:47.260
 Behind them were born babies. 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:52.590
 In the past, we have regained stability. 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.590
 I want you to raise your young well 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.590
 There is a prominent dog on either side of a bus stop. 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:12.410
 Among the people hurling down the bus 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.410
 Who in the eager eyes do salpigon a man standing 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:21.390
 So getting a wander around stretching as if to find the martial music as if to tease 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.390
 It's a surprise . 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.010
 Suddenly one day, that's guarding the bus forward a Chair 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:39.709
 He can not live like that every day for some reason. 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.709
 Let's read this to protect it. 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.650
 An 8-lane roadster in the West Coast that can see a special crab 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:56.800
 Looking around, I see a dog on the far side of the road. 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.800
 That 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:06.770
 Next to the busy bus stop 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:15.440
 Out through the complex without knowing even before the motorcycle seat 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:16.400
 Insaeul'll keep sitting Mall geonya who came over to see the house so the house 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.780
 It's easy . 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.780
 I'll give it to the guard. 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.980
 I see signs of a struggle in the streets of a farmhouse when I see a losing master 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:35.530
 Not so 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:39.250
 How much is this guy who just stopped to look cool ? 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.459
 It's been two weeks, but it's still here. 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:47.019
 I'm not catching me a little dwaetneunde malgetda 300 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:52.540
 We've never jogged rice to eat just one school notices 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:55.660
 We are already guarding the bus stop for a month 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:02.550
 I was trying to settle down 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.550
 At the bus stop, the bus and the sound of the arrival arrive . 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:11.860
 Oh Yeah nochulnyeo Mucha Air tteot bus back hours later Kazaa 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:16.920
 It seems like people are familiar with the door 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.920
 Looking forward to what I am looking forward to 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:26.770
 Sit with your ass on it . 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:29.700
 There's a bus stop, and those who are worried about that sort of thing get their snacks. 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.700
 Give it a try. 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:38.919
 Eat a little more integrity in the last 5 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:42.760
 I've been a little bit more out of my interest in Korean language . 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:46.630
 Finally yeoseo not discard this becomes even snow 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:49.400
 And then again more Suga dinner is jeongman 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:53.330
 Listen to it. 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.840
 But four facial expressions 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:00.639
 What is something like a bigger eye 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.639
 It starts suddenly .
