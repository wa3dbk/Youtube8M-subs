we're<00:02:41.990> going<00:02:42.080> to<00:02:42.140> turn<00:02:42.350> on<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.560> heat<00:02:42.740> gun<00:02:43.240> let

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
we're going to turn on the heat gun let

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.310 
we're going to turn on the heat gun let
me<00:02:44.330> move<00:02:44.450> this<00:02:44.690> out<00:02:44.870> of<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.020> way<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:45.200> it

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
me move this out of the way so it

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:59.800 
me move this out of the way so it
doesn't<00:02:45.560> blow<00:02:45.710> around<00:02:45.890> everywhere

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:08.280 

you're<00:03:00.170> almost<00:03:00.290> done
