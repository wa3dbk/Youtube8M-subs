00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.920 
also going to similarly extract from the
packaging<00:02:17.520> it<00:02:17.640> has<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.000> same<00:02:18.330> SanDisk

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
packaging it has the same SanDisk

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.110 
packaging it has the same SanDisk
software<00:02:19.380> that<00:02:19.560> we<00:02:19.650> found<00:02:19.890> on<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.670> last<00:02:20.880> one

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
software that we found on the last one

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.899 
software that we found on the last one
and<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:21.780> has<00:02:21.989> similarly<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.519> know<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.640> actually

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
and it has similarly you know I actually

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.300 
and it has similarly you know I actually
saw<00:02:24.420> something<00:02:24.690> advert

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
saw something advert

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.089 
saw something advert
with<00:02:25.959> frustration-free<00:02:26.959> packaging<00:02:27.170> not<00:02:27.890> that

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
with frustration-free packaging not that

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.949 
with frustration-free packaging not that
long<00:02:28.250> ago<00:02:28.520> I<00:02:28.730> think<00:02:29.180> everyone<00:02:29.480> would<00:02:29.599> do<00:02:29.780> well

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
long ago I think everyone would do well

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.300 
long ago I think everyone would do well
to<00:02:29.989> adopt<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.590> frustration-free<00:02:31.190> packaging

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
to adopt the frustration-free packaging

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.850 
to adopt the frustration-free packaging
model<00:02:32.239> this<00:02:32.690> one<00:02:32.959> doesn't<00:02:33.200> have<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.530> same

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
model this one doesn't have the same

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.970 
model this one doesn't have the same
metal<00:02:34.250> casing<00:02:34.760> but<00:02:35.209> it<00:02:35.360> is<00:02:35.480> actually<00:02:36.200> smaller

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
metal casing but it is actually smaller

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.809 
metal casing but it is actually smaller
so<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:37.760> is<00:02:37.910> basically<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.810> size<00:02:39.140> of<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:40.310> USB

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
so it is basically the size of a USB

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.000 
so it is basically the size of a USB
connector<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:41.870> then<00:02:42.349> it<00:02:42.470> actually<00:02:42.620> comes

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
connector and then it actually comes

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.400 
connector and then it actually comes
with<00:02:43.069> a<00:02:43.220> cap<00:02:43.459> so<00:02:44.150> that<00:02:44.360> presumably<00:02:44.660> it's<00:02:45.230> a

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
with a cap so that presumably it's a

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.070 
with a cap so that presumably it's a
little<00:02:45.800> bit<00:02:45.980> more<00:02:46.250> difficult<00:02:47.000> to<00:02:47.060> lose<00:02:47.690> and

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
little bit more difficult to lose and

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.949 
little bit more difficult to lose and
then<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:48.470> tiny<00:02:48.950> little<00:02:49.580> a<00:02:49.940> tiny<00:02:50.450> little<00:02:50.690> hoop

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
then a tiny little a tiny little hoop

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.240 
then a tiny little a tiny little hoop
where<00:02:51.170> you<00:02:51.260> can<00:02:51.410> put<00:02:51.590> like<00:02:51.739> a<00:02:51.769> little<00:02:52.040> string

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
where you can put like a little string

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.229 
where you can put like a little string
on<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:52.489> and<00:02:52.580> you<00:02:52.640> could<00:02:52.760> store<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.060> somewhere

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
on it and you could store it somewhere

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.540 
on it and you could store it somewhere
this<00:02:53.540> one<00:02:53.780> again<00:02:54.319> I<00:02:54.560> would<00:02:54.920> feel<00:02:55.099> pretty<00:02:55.310> good

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
this one again I would feel pretty good

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.190 
this one again I would feel pretty good
about<00:02:55.610> on<00:02:55.910> my<00:02:56.060> keychain<00:02:56.300> because<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:57.019> little

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
about on my keychain because the little

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.449 
about on my keychain because the little
hook<00:02:57.410> is<00:02:57.560> metal<00:02:57.860> and<00:02:58.010> because<00:02:58.220> there's<00:02:58.400> no

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
hook is metal and because there's no

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.979 
hook is metal and because there's no
weight<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:58.970> this<00:02:59.090> thing<00:02:59.360> so<00:02:59.540> I'm<00:02:59.840> not

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
weight to this thing so I'm not

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.479 
weight to this thing so I'm not
expecting<00:03:00.440> it<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.620> get<00:03:00.769> broken<00:03:01.040> so<00:03:01.310> that's

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
expecting it to get broken so that's

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.850 
expecting it to get broken so that's
pretty<00:03:01.670> much<00:03:01.760> it<00:03:02.090> guys<00:03:02.120> I<00:03:02.600> have<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.260> hundred<00:03:03.650> and
