00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
a lot and it goes pretty darn fast verse

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.370 
a lot and it goes pretty darn fast verse
other<00:00:19.949> Jets<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.640> does<00:00:20.939> have<00:00:21.300> issues<00:00:21.630> at<00:00:22.020> times

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380

other Jets it does have issues at times
but<00:00:24.920> it<00:00:25.920> should<00:00:26.189> be<00:00:26.220> able<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.580> do<00:00:26.699> pretty

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
but it should be able to do pretty

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.150 
but it should be able to do pretty
decent<00:00:27.420> against<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.930> competition<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:29.039> I'm

decent against the competition that I'm

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.690 
decent against the competition that I'm
seeing<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.580> game<00:00:30.140> and<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.410> got<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> few<00:00:31.920> i<00:00:32.430> gotta

163 and make 15 and a big nine that
should<00:00:35.300> be<00:00:36.300> able<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.510> give<00:00:36.630> me<00:00:36.660> some<00:00:36.750> help

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.060 

the<00:00:41.970> repair<00:00:42.300> cost<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.810> immense<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:43.829> thing

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
the repair cost is immense on this thing

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.440 
the repair cost is immense on this thing
which<00:00:44.220> is<00:00:44.370> why<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.520> don't<00:00:44.760> bring<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.120> out<00:00:45.210> too

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
which is why I don't bring it out too

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.910 
which is why I don't bring it out too
often<00:00:45.980> i<00:00:46.980> still<00:00:47.730> have<00:00:47.940> free<00:00:48.780> repairs<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.380> it<00:00:49.410> so

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
often i still have free repairs on it so

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.869 
often i still have free repairs on it so
I'm<00:00:51.320> able<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:54.650> bypass<00:00:55.650> that<00:00:55.920> not<00:00:56.430> really<00:00:56.580> worry

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
I'm able to bypass that not really worry

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.740 
I'm able to bypass that not really worry
about<00:00:56.970> it<00:00:57.210> too<00:00:57.360> much

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.790 

but<00:01:02.480> when<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.570> does<00:01:03.690> come<00:01:03.960> down<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.530> i<00:01:04.620> have

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
but when it does come down to it i have

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.220 
but when it does come down to it i have
a<00:01:04.830> feeling<00:01:05.129> i<00:01:05.400> will<00:01:05.510> probably<00:01:06.510> take<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.990> out<00:01:07.080> at

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.230 
a feeling i will probably take it out at

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.720 
a feeling i will probably take it out at
the<00:01:07.260> end<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.530> games<00:01:07.740> when<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.370> need<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.550> get

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
the end of games when I just need to get

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.190 
the end of games when I just need to get
some<00:01:08.940> quick<00:01:09.210> kills<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.810> then<00:01:09.900> I'll<00:01:09.990> be<00:01:10.110> about

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
some quick kills and then I'll be about

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.560 
some quick kills and then I'll be about
it<00:01:12.440> I'll<00:01:13.440> go<00:01:13.970> nobody<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.090> really<00:01:15.210> see<00:01:15.450> me

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
it I'll go nobody can really see me

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.330 
it I'll go nobody can really see me
because<00:01:15.780> I'm<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.050> clouds<00:01:16.260> right<00:01:16.530> now<00:01:16.560> I'm

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
because I'm in the clouds right now I'm

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.160 
because I'm in the clouds right now I'm
going<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.640> drop<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.910> bunch<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.780> battleship

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
going to drop a bunch on this battleship

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.190 
going to drop a bunch on this battleship
and<00:01:19.560> then<00:01:19.710> get<00:01:19.920> out<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.220> here<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:24.390> hopefully

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
and then get out of here and hopefully

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.359 
and then get out of here and hopefully
be<00:01:25.619> able<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.860> do<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.070> again<00:01:28.040> and<00:01:29.040> again<00:01:29.190> and

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
be able to do it again and again and

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:39.470 
be able to do it again and again and
again<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.910> again

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:46.340 

but<00:01:40.050> here<00:01:40.230> we<00:01:40.380> go<00:01:41.360> erato<00:01:42.360> diving<00:01:43.730> and<00:01:45.200> get<00:01:46.200> out

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
but here we go erato diving and get out

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.080 
but here we go erato diving and get out
of<00:01:46.500> there

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.400 

and<00:01:52.090> apparently<00:01:52.570> that<00:01:52.600> didn't<00:01:53.020> take<00:01:53.230> out<00:01:53.380> a

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
and apparently that didn't take out a

00:01:53.410 --> 00:02:03.370 
and apparently that didn't take out a
battleship

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.130 

as<00:02:04.380> far<00:02:04.710> as<00:02:05.000> planes<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.150> can<00:02:06.450> chase<00:02:06.720> me<00:02:06.960> I'm

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
as far as planes that can chase me I'm

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.609 
as far as planes that can chase me I'm
faster<00:02:08.070> than<00:02:08.220> most<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.640> them<00:02:08.760> so<00:02:09.350> prop<00:02:10.350> planes

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
faster than most of them so prop planes

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.820 
faster than most of them so prop planes
I<00:02:10.770> really<00:02:11.010> don't<00:02:11.160> have<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.580> worry<00:02:11.730> about<00:02:11.850> I<00:02:12.830> do

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
I really don't have to worry about I do

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.550 
I really don't have to worry about I do
worry<00:02:14.790> about<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:15.030> 5s<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:15.810> Ellie's<00:02:16.020> evans<00:02:16.380> at

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
worry about a 5s and Ellie's evans at

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.580 
worry about a 5s and Ellie's evans at
times<00:02:16.800> if<00:02:17.040> they're<00:02:17.190> diving<00:02:18.260> but<00:02:19.260> other<00:02:19.410> than

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
times if they're diving but other than

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.870 
times if they're diving but other than
that<00:02:19.650> i<00:02:19.860> can<00:02:20.570> for<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.720> most<00:02:21.930> part<00:02:22.310> out<00:02:23.310> climb

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
that i can for the most part out climb

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:33.100 
that i can for the most part out climb
and<00:02:24.360> outrun<00:02:24.870> every<00:02:25.530> prop<00:02:25.800> plane

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.860 

climbs<00:02:33.800> at<00:02:34.040> 27<00:02:34.700> meters<00:02:34.910> per<00:02:35.060> second<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.480> has<00:02:35.600> no

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
climbs at 27 meters per second it has no

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.120 
climbs at 27 meters per second it has no
guns<00:02:36.200> but<00:02:37.360> for<00:02:38.360> a<00:02:38.390> bomber<00:02:38.630> to<00:02:38.930> be<00:02:39.050> able<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.500> run

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
guns but for a bomber to be able to run

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.550 
guns but for a bomber to be able to run
into<00:02:40.490> enemy<00:02:40.820> territory<00:02:40.850> and<00:02:41.390> not<00:02:41.600> get<00:02:41.780> hit<00:02:41.990> and

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
into enemy territory and not get hit and

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.060 
into enemy territory and not get hit and
then<00:02:42.650> run<00:02:42.890> back<00:02:42.920> out<00:02:44.380> even<00:02:45.380> with<00:02:45.530> jets<00:02:45.830> in<00:02:45.980> the

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
then run back out even with jets in the

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.280 
then run back out even with jets in the
game<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.490> definitely<00:02:47.390> makes<00:02:47.540> this<00:02:47.750> a<00:02:47.810> nice

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
game it definitely makes this a nice

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.980 
game it definitely makes this a nice
nice<00:02:49.840> bomber<00:02:52.210> however<00:02:53.210> this<00:02:53.330> Mick<00:02:53.540> 15

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
nice bomber however this Mick 15

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.050 
nice bomber however this Mick 15
probably<00:02:54.290> is<00:02:54.560> not<00:02:54.770> going<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.130> be<00:02:55.250> very<00:02:55.460> kind<00:02:55.880> to

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
probably is not going to be very kind to

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.770 
probably is not going to be very kind to
me<00:02:56.270> 02

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
me 02

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.990 
me 02

otherwise I wouldn't use it but uh I
just<00:07:53.659> kind<00:07:53.990> of<00:07:54.020> wanted<00:07:54.199> to<00:07:54.289> give<00:07:54.379> you<00:07:54.500> a<00:07:55.120> show

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:56.120 
just kind of wanted to give you a show

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.429 
just kind of wanted to give you a show
of<00:07:56.270> what<00:07:56.419> it<00:07:56.509> can<00:07:56.599> do<00:07:56.780> and<00:07:56.810> it<00:07:57.050> can<00:07:57.139> actually

00:07:57.429 --> 00:07:57.439 
of what it can do and it can actually

00:07:57.439 --> 00:07:59.830 
of what it can do and it can actually
handle<00:07:57.560> a<00:07:57.800> lot<00:07:57.979> of<00:07:58.189> a<00:07:58.370> lot<00:07:59.120> of<00:07:59.210> damage<00:07:59.389> it<00:07:59.659> just

00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840 
handle a lot of a lot of damage it just

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.809 
handle a lot of a lot of damage it just
takes<00:08:00.080> some<00:08:00.830> time<00:08:01.009> getting<00:08:01.310> used<00:08:01.430> to<00:08:01.789> it<00:08:01.909> and

00:08:03.809 --> 00:08:03.819 
takes some time getting used to it and

00:08:03.819 --> 00:08:06.339 
takes some time getting used to it and
well<00:08:04.819> I<00:08:04.939> only<00:08:05.090> have<00:08:05.330> two<00:08:05.479> free<00:08:05.719> repairs<00:08:06.080> left

00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:06.349 
well I only have two free repairs left

00:08:06.349 --> 00:08:08.980 
well I only have two free repairs left
so<00:08:06.560> that'll<00:08:07.520> probably<00:08:07.939> be<00:08:08.300> one<00:08:08.690> of<00:08:08.719> the<00:08:08.840> last

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:08.990 
so that'll probably be one of the last

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.260 
so that'll probably be one of the last
times<00:08:09.319> I<00:08:09.560> use<00:08:09.740> it<00:08:09.940> but<00:08:10.940> it<00:08:11.629> has<00:08:11.810> a<00:08:11.840> lot<00:08:12.020> of<00:08:12.050> fun

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:13.270 
times I use it but it has a lot of fun

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:19.479 
times I use it but it has a lot of fun
