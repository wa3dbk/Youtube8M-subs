and somewhat and this is that the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.750 
and somewhat and this is that the
difference<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.680> need<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:15.010> whisk<00:02:15.280> till<00:02:15.610> you

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
difference you need to whisk till you

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.750 
difference you need to whisk till you
get<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.030> peaks<00:02:16.990> like<00:02:17.290> this<00:02:17.530> after<00:02:18.130> adding<00:02:18.730> sugar
