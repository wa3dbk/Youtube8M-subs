video now my reasons behind this are

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.229 
video now my reasons behind this are
because<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.829> truly<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.399> believe<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.820> Rockstar

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
because I truly do believe that Rockstar

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.060 
because I truly do believe that Rockstar
should<00:00:48.480> add<00:00:48.660> some<00:00:48.690> kind<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.170> zombie<00:00:49.230> dlc<00:00:49.649> in

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
should add some kind of zombie dlc in

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.760 
should add some kind of zombie dlc in
the<00:00:50.190> future<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:51.539> my<00:00:51.690> opinion<00:00:51.930> zombies<00:00:52.440> tend<00:00:52.680> to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the future in my opinion zombies tend to

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.619 
the future in my opinion zombies tend to
make<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.920> game<00:00:53.160> better<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:54.270> generally

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
make a game better and just generally

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.270 
make a game better and just generally
adds<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.899> whole<00:00:54.930> new<00:00:55.199> aspect<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.800> game<00:00:55.829> now

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
adds a whole new aspect of the game now

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.069 
adds a whole new aspect of the game now
as<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.730> see<00:00:56.789> here<00:00:57.270> other<00:00:57.449> zombies<00:00:57.899> and

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
as you can see here other zombies and

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.779 
as you can see here other zombies and
they<00:00:58.109> are<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:58.680> reskin<00:00:59.219> versions<00:00:59.670> of

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
they are just reskin versions of

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.549 
they are just reskin versions of
pedestrians<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.570> unfortunately<00:01:01.199> they<00:01:01.410> don't

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
pedestrians so unfortunately they don't

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.139
