 portal glass and finger all mobile 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.660
 entertainment on glafi.com 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.390
 hello to you arrogant 73 site 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.490
 glafi.com and today we talk about 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.510
 British medium tank of the tenth level 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.460
 fv 4202 this tank is very 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.250
 specific all gameplay on it 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.650
 rather complicated due to the fact that we are not 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.590
 always take key points first 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.670
 or just do not have time to knock down the capture base 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.520
 We will talk more about this review. 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.260
 tanks in 4202 has a very good 100 5 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.070
 millimeter cannon that possesses 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.649
 base projectile damage of 350 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.170
 the remaining 440 tank has one 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.910
 feature instead of cumulative projectiles 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.790
 which are most commonly found as 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.160
 we have gold so-called hash land mines 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.800
 who have greater breakthrough than 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.379
 the usual landmine with the same alpha strikes 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.050
 the gun allows us to play effectively 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.240
 sniper so as accuracy us 032 on 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.539
 100 meters and time of information 2 seconds 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.000
 also has a good dpm equal to 2 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:18.830
 800 conventional damage per minute 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.090
 shells and 3520 hash mine bombs now 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.520
 let's talk about armor 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.220
 this is the strangest parameter in all 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.140
 tanks in the forehead of the case we have one hundred twenty 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.319
 one millimeter but thanks to the excellent 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.750
 tilt angle do not punch us even at t10 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:35.750
 and as for the tower, everything is here 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.179
 rather sadly punches us there all 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.050
 without exception, because there is a bit of scolding 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:44.869
 only 196 millimeters mask is missing 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.140
 In general, because of this, the tower does not tank 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:51.170
 it will turn out with mobility and dynamics 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.690
 acceleration of the tank's all right, we should 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.500
 800 horsepower ten horsepower engine 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.560
 force that gives us 20 horses per tonne and 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.190
 here with the speed we have big problems 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.489
 maximum speed of only 40 kilometers per hour is 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.440
 the worst indicator among all st10 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.900
 the rest of the car is enough 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.409
 versatile let's consider tactics 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.840
 our tank is fighting on it 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.700
 wide range of applications on 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.650
 implements allows you to use the machine in 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.379
 as a sniper to fight even 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.510
 well armored targets for accuracy 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.160
 guns makes it possible to grab in 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.599
 sight objects located on 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.900
 considerable distance 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:35.540
 but with tanks like IS-7 butting 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.790
 it will be very hard since breaking through 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.910
 scaling is not always enough for 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.849
 wins to these guys better to go 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.680
 from the side or behind a good overview allows 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.870
 detect an opponent who is 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.569
 quite far from our car and 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.150
 destroy it go unnoticed 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.030
 due to low maximum speed tank 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.010
 does not have time to take a favorable position 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.230
 if correctly calculate the course of the battle the 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.049
 machine depending on the position and 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.239
 situations can keep intelligence hold 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.879
 defense or support attack 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.980
 thanks to a good overview in some 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:12.349
 situations a tank can act as 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.930
 firefly transmitting data to allies 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.549
 besides, excellent dynamics gives 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.430
 the possibility of slow opponents 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.959
 spin on 1 2 but the main task 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.810
 machines still is support 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.389
 allies hiding behind tanks with good 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.450
 armor we can do damage with 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:32.000
 our good dpm but not losing the extra 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.549
 strength times which is important for st 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.310
 support rush medium tanks too 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.950
 bring a lot of good let's the same 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.670
 consider all the pros and cons of this 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.829
 cars to the pluses can be attributed excellent 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.019
 instrument stabilization and accuracy 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:51.470
 magnificent angles of vertical guidance 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.989
 which are -10 degrees good 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.540
 dynamics is especially noticeable when driving 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.569
 up landfills with high penetration 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.750
 Premium Projectiles Excellent Review 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.700
 rebound upper armor to the minus 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.030
 low maximum speed 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.010
 compared with steel st of its level 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.669
 weak armor of the tower sides nld and 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.690
 lack of mask tools lack 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:17.389
 alternative premium shells with 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.609
 a big breakthrough but on this i'm with you 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.560
 say goodbye to everyone thanks for watching
