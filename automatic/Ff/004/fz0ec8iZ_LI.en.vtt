 subtitle program and decorate is in the air 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.100
 and today we are going to talk about kitchens and 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.110
 If you already think about grandma cooking 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.629
 forget everything nowadays men 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.550
 invaded the space we also receive 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.100
 the woman to talk and of course 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.210
 the decoration then speaks louder then 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.210
 Let's go for the tips. 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.170
 and to talk about it I get 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.390
 our studios architect andrea meters 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.759
 thank you for joining most and 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.649
 André when we talk about cooking is 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.020
 really that's the same for that 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.520
 Just thinking of grandmother cooking 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.560
 What are you doing for us? 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.810
 nowadays people love being in the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.259
 The kitchen itself is now a 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.200
 activity that the family shares 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:40.560
 it is a moment of even relaxation and 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:43.500
 union of friends of the owner of a couple is is 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.509
 a moment for all very interesting and 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.950
 we can use this space in the 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.440
 projects you have currently done 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.179
 there is a constant request computation 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.149
 optimization of your opponent 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:57.450
 looks what involves a lot as soon as 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.729
 define in reality would be what you 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.130
 will use and how you will use right 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.920
 and then if it's a kitchen really 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.200
 functional to the point that you are a 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.630
 day to day kitchen that is a kitchen 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.910
 You need to have a big family. 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.000
 So you have to think in a way. 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.860
 now it is a kitchen and integrated to the free 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.840
 integrated into the rest of the 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.260
 home to a gourmet balcony 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.440
 it also has another provision that 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.390
 this part is in the analysis is perhaps even in the 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.640
 same person can buy time 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.090
 do a reform naturally after 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.930
 do it so because so for example 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:40.049
 if you take an apartment today and in that 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:45.209
 apartment you have a proposal for 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:48.510
 integrating so you can remove 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.370
 the wall of integration comes to you there is 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.859
 perfectly possible to do 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.680
 It is usually in the purchase of the property that you 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.090
 have to choose the property since the 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.310
 feature close to what you 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.290
 Want to stay a little easier? 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.299
 to drink it can only be a tip 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.190
 to save money is also more in france 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.859
 china and it is certainly possible the 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.319
 project in the purchase of the property only 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.720
 all have a professional in buying the 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.890
 and that's the solution for a 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.020
 project also after 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.030
 Also solve for us and 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.890
 colors and coatings there is some 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.020
 contemporary ideal thing is talking about 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.530
 taller you can use retro as 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:30.850
 task starts and looks like this 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:33.640
 color is me and so is a trend that 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.700
 I rather use what it is that they are colors 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.340
 strong in the kitchen so I have 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:44.290
 wood kitchens with one tone sounds and one 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:48.000
 green one orange one yellow and so on 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.860
 will depend on how the person interprets 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.200
 the color question is the user 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.430
 owner is whether they are afraid or not 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.300
 because there are many people who still 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.570
 coast on the wood-toned 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.370
 understood 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.840
 only in tones it 's only in beige tones, it's not 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.910
 You can play a lot 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.560
 but in this game you talk to use 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.750
 the strong colors so you have 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.989
 used plus what are the colors right? 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.780
 Look, I just made a kitchen. 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:21.459
 that it has a green silver tone is a 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:26.229
 little like the blouse shirt that is 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:30.070
 as the composition of pulling homs 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:33.940
 honorable such a light rose has another 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.910
 thing that I did black with one with 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.710
 almost a fifth in black fuchsia 30 still 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.310
 I created my kitchen from my kitchen 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.919
 my yellow house is black it is 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.169
 strained and black used and fought the environment 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:50.140
 the company a wall or parts of 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.390
 low as one who is not there depends on 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.600
 My composition for example is all 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:58.660
 black the black steps all sizes are 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:02.050
 of black glass and I have there yellow only 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.000
 marking the details where I have the 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.890
 domestic chancellors 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.320
 Wow this is very interesting, right? 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.580
 I do not really see the project aims 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.680
 to know how to work also make 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.229
 about even this is true then was the 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.930
 up to the kitchen integrated with lien 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:19.870
 really integrated with the room 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.390
 so I got to have and the kitchen 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.490
 It is dark the kitchen is not cramped 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.340
 He understood and is an easy cooking 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.110
 working easy to manu do have 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.900
 maintenance understand I have to think 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.600
 this is not this ease times this 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.400
 dynamism of having all this space is 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.660
 also important in the distance rule 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.970
 of electrons is because sometimes you are 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.380
 dealing with a game in which you can 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.620
 if you think about it at the time of 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.700
 project is so on is what are the 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.890
 difficulties when you have something 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.440
 very small a very large kitchen 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.900
 so a very large kitchen you have 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.110
 what to think ah I will put an island and 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.570
 on this island I'm going to leave at least her 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.600
 the stove next year is usually today 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:04.750
 You use a cooktop but I have there. 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.760
 suddenly a support tank is not 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.670
 that I would not be a gourmet vat and have 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.520
 another one to the cuba another point of support 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:15.400
 separately because you can prepare the 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.860
 food form one prepares the other 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.930
 You're handling and this distance. 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.360
 of home appliances is very important 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:26.070
 because otherwise the kitchen does not pass is not 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.870
 functional my basic rule of 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.740
 distribution is the triangulation then 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:35.110
 You take the food in the fridge. 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.210
 prepares on the counter and cooks so she 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.330
 kitchen handle is triangulation 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.560
 perfect no, and I like this program 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.720
 of young people and of court and I think 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.730
 People really learn to think. 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.320
 both the project and the renewal of 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.700
 home and really thinking about 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.950
 functionality even though we 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.570
 time without the big queues also has 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.640
 that end up being functional is money 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.350
 Nor is it very very important brigade. 

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.940
 andré for all our tips 

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.500
 chat to finish quickly because it 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.450
 quick on the internet even more

 thanks for the tips to mayor brigada 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.790
