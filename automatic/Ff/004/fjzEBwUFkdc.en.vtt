00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello welcome to a new one 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.750
 video from me today there is mine 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.880
 months favorites in the holiday month 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.380
 July I know for a bit late 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.750
 But better late than never 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.250
 and I have not had one for a while 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.809
 favorites video made more of that 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.130
 I thought that was one more thing 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.660
 bit for several months 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.970
 I also thought about something new 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.260
 because my last favorites videos 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.449
 Unfortunately, I did not believe that anymore 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.310
 so meaningful if that with the 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.320
 used up video everything falls to others 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.019
 but it's harder to get so many products 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.850
 shows what makes sense, so to speak and 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.770
 That's why I'm committed to myself 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.020
 first now for the few months video 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.210
 at least on ten products maximum too 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.430
 restrict and if possible only one 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.840
 from a category otherwise of course 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.930
 not forever but I have 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.670
 my ten categories picked out and 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.430
 just need a shower with the topic 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.280
 and since I've been here from the mitchells 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.100
 mandarin and with shower gel 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.649
 or is such a shower room the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.870
 you can foam so beautiful teaching 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.699
 really very good i had that one time 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.199
 have boxing for eternity in the box 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.090
 I kept it for a very long time, I think 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.770
 otherwise costs between 7 and 9 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.930
 But I am not sure and 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.939
 Has a very nice fragrance you can 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.950
 used for shaving and he just cares 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.080
 nice and that's why I find that very 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.840
 I have great area facial care 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.720
 me for the grease lightning and pimple 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.689
 moment decided and the tip I have 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.210
 I came to the sound and I have to 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.560
 say this is a bit more 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.170
 in 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.670
 a direction statistical 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.680
 Usage behavior my favorites video 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.479
 I've always used it before 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.000
 have seen worldly pimple and then 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.229
 But I did not want to fight 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.479
 so sure i dont have these 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.310
 miracle effect I have now to 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.140
 at the end of the month something really amazing discovered 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.539
 but it would have been stupid that in that 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.970
 to take favorite video because it believes 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.549
 I rather something for august yes otherwise 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.210
 I have a fragrance that I have earlier 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.170
 and that is the comics song 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.810
 holography and that's one of my 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.220
 My favorite smi would be mine 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.200
 Parents when I was there to visit 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.000
 The mammon fell down and then 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.250
 the whole house and let it be allowed 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.250
 not me anymore and it has a long time 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.370
 overcoming cost to the years after 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.420
 buy this is a very heavy one 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.610
 exceptional fragrance absolutely not for 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.110
 Anyone can not do it anywhere 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.540
 For example, I believe in this 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.280
 for the love of fragrance page order 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.799
 I do not know if it maybe too 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.660
 at Breuninger I do not know 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.370
 exactly it is not at all 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.609
 fruity and nothing important it is 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.320
 hard a bit yes how should i 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.660
 say it almost smells like that 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.910
 esoterically I know really gives 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.829
 when in there too i want you 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.000
 possibly the bin somewhere I link 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.200
 also not received and likely 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.209
 especially when I am describing myself 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.459
 did not prepare like this case 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.440
 but I like it just as extreme 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.720
 especially that is an eau de toilette 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.090
 and still holds as good as some 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.950
 other without some form so really one 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.260
 very great fragrance very exceptional 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.989
 My hair product is from bad is one 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.760
 dry shampoo two extra 14 red hairs 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.440
 that is a bit too hard 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.260
 actually everything makes the hair very much 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.790
 good and everything around it and me 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.410
 I have seen in my bathroom 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.870
 also one or the other red 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.880
 just play like that there is such a thing 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.980
 beautiful couple occupy something like that 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.420
 particle rain and then sits down 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.209
 also like to just go somewhere if you want 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.730
 the hair does not hit so before night 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.530
 just brother still as in white 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.019
 to have a woman slipping 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.280
 I 'd rather have a red one for that 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.720
 I bought in england though 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.109
 Maybe you'll get that over 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.599
 acers then my passion is favorite 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:38.720
 These sunglasses here he knows 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.310
 already from my new york hall and the 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.530
 I have just about everything I have 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.150
 also with very nice blogger colleagues 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:49.069
 bought together is from prada and 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.840
 yes I have very very happy 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.150
 then, of course, a beauty may 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.939
 makeup make-up is not missing there 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.250
 I've got the powder and that from pfs 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.530
 I now for the first time I believe in 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.700
 a nuance darker and used in 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:08.599
 77 natural this is still very bright 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.700
 but with me already very dark in now 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.069
 Not all of them do not look so dark 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.799
 I only wear it with one of those 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.950
 stepping up the industry easily and that 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.280
 was such an effect that I know so new 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.630
 otherwise sometimes even with the kwast 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.100
 so much too thick actually and now 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.020
 with the pest industry and then too 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.270
 calm the nuance darker I then like that 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.630
 can appear a bit brown 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.580
 me and brown an illusion but one 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.690
 very beautiful illusion i really like it 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.670
 like that is a bit 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.280
 Summer finally out then mine 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.590
 literature favorite i could barely 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.930
 in show between book and between on 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.600
 audiobook I'm here for that 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.980
 banned decided because I was there 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.950
 Wonderful heard this month and month 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.410
 although a whole half a year 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.970
 I had heard at orden waste but 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.160
 I'll show you that for a moment and I'll listen 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.270
 It really every day so you recognize 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.190
 not much the cover has sometimes 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.210
 bad a very bad quality 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:07.510
 here and from Julius I'm not sure 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:10.030
 how to pronounce it by whatever 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.500
 is very well read so scary 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.230
 Well, I have rarely experienced that 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.210
 it is intended fifteen hours or 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.840
 more so you really have a lot of it 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:22.600
 and I really have that every day 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.130
 go to sleep and to jog and to 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.050
 Rinse and what I still do everything 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.320
 heard with audiobook and I have 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.060
 only 40 minutes 49 seconds left 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.370

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.200
 made and I do not noticed 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.190
