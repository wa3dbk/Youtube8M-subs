only heat over there over here so this

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.880 
only heat over there over here so this
should<00:02:00.719> put<00:02:00.810> out<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:00.990> lot<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.290> heat<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.500> wild

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
should put out a lot of heat and wild

should put out a lot of heat and wild
light<00:02:02.070> too<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.700> it's<00:02:03.240> good<00:02:03.829> just<00:02:04.829> bending<00:02:05.369> the

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
light too so it's good just bending the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.880 
light too so it's good just bending the
wires<00:02:05.729> into<00:02:05.969> little<00:02:06.270> hooks<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.810> then<00:02:07.740> we're

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
wires into little hooks and then we're

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.570 
wires into little hooks and then we're
going<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.039> go<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.340> there<00:02:08.520> screws<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.580> non

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
going to go in there screws so the non

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.290 
going to go in there screws so the non
yellow<00:02:12.330> one

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
yellow one

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.780 
yellow one

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
to this I film that exactly like that

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.290 
to this I film that exactly like that
and<00:02:19.780> then<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.230> other<00:02:20.260> one<00:02:20.410> goes<00:02:20.680> right<00:02:20.920> here

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
and then the other one goes right here

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.630 
and then the other one goes right here
and<00:02:22.300> we<00:02:22.390> tighten<00:02:22.660> them<00:02:22.750> down<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.200> we<00:02:24.190> pull<00:02:24.550> the

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
slack out of this and we see those

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.860 
slack out of this and we see those
little<00:02:26.830> screw<00:02:27.100> holes<00:02:27.310> right<00:02:27.700> there<00:02:28.030> you

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
little screw holes right there you

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.440 
little screw holes right there you
should<00:02:29.200> line<00:02:29.380> up<00:02:29.410> with<00:02:29.560> these<00:02:30.070> if<00:02:30.400> not<00:02:31.210> there's

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
heat lamps I can get eel amps in here

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.879 
heat lamps I can get eel amps in here
and<00:04:17.600> yeah<00:04:18.600> really<00:04:19.519> be<00:04:20.519> nice<00:04:20.669> and<00:04:20.880> warm<00:04:21.889> anyway

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.310 
right here and there's the heat lamps of
course<00:05:37.370> so<00:05:38.370> the<00:05:39.150> lamps<00:05:39.389> were<00:05:39.449> like<00:05:39.690> a<00:05:39.720> five

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
course so the lamps were like a five

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.029 
course so the lamps were like a five
dollars<00:05:40.560> apiece<00:05:40.800> so<00:05:41.340> Turner<00:05:42.090> wats<00:05:42.800> with<00:05:43.800> three

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039

glare from the line 70 so 70 up here
with<00:06:07.770> three<00:06:08.669> heat<00:06:09.000> lamp<00:06:09.270> lights<00:06:09.599> a<00:06:10.280> whole<00:06:11.280> host

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
with three heat lamp lights a whole host

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.649 
with three heat lamp lights a whole host
of<00:06:11.699> computers<00:06:12.270> everywhere<00:06:13.169> yeah<00:06:14.090> well<00:06:15.090> some

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:15.659 
of computers everywhere yeah well some

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:18.200 
of computers everywhere yeah well some
TVs<00:06:15.990> over<00:06:16.229> there<00:06:16.460> with<00:06:17.460> some<00:06:17.490> games<00:06:17.880> on<00:06:18.120> them

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
TVs over there with some games on them

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.540 
TVs over there with some games on them
so<00:06:18.300> I<00:06:18.360> can't<00:06:18.570> show<00:06:18.659> them<00:06:18.950> anyway

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
so I can't show them anyway

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.060 
so I can't show them anyway
so<00:06:21.150> the<00:06:21.600> heat<00:06:21.690> lamp<00:06:22.080> project<00:06:22.560> worked<00:06:22.800> it's

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
so the heat lamp project worked it's

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.110 
so the heat lamp project worked it's
about<00:06:24.170> 4040<00:06:25.170> outside<00:06:25.530> maybe<00:06:25.740> 39<00:06:26.310> right<00:06:26.610> now<00:06:26.760> so

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
about 4040 outside maybe 39 right now so

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.340 
about 4040 outside maybe 39 right now so
you<00:06:27.560> got<00:06:28.560> a<00:06:28.590> good<00:06:28.890> 30<00:06:29.340> degree<00:06:30.180> difference

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:30.350 
you got a good 30 degree difference

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.130 
you got a good 30 degree difference
upstairs<00:06:31.350> and<00:06:32.630> that's<00:06:33.630> gonna<00:06:33.750> be<00:06:33.840> good<00:06:33.990> for

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.140 
upstairs and that's gonna be good for
