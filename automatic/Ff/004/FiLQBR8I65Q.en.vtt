 sing 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.280
 you know I had people who came 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.610
 ask for whom you write this piece 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.490
 it's sensual this label this 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.320
 inheritance is actually it's really 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.140
 the state in which I would like to find myself 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.110
 and maybe when I feel when I 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.840
 am in love and that's it 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.430
 there I think of someone and you see this 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.530
 kind of statements that you make to the 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.150
 no one that weighs it's really in 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.630
 this mindset there I have that this 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.430
 piece 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:41.860
 this is the state in which I would like to 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:45.250
 to find out if I was with someone you 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.170
 grow up you know that's what that's 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.850
 that's what you like to do so who 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.159
 will be 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.680
