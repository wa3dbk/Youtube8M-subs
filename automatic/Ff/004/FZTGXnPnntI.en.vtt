00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
end of the day I would say that I would

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.469 
end of the day I would say that I would
probably<00:01:55.409> have<00:01:55.920> needed<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.399> touch<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.670> up<00:01:56.909> but

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
probably have needed to touch it up but

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.440 
probably have needed to touch it up but
I<00:01:57.509> didn't<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:59.460> me<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.790> still<00:02:00.119> looked

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
I didn't and to me it still looked

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.510 
I didn't and to me it still looked
really<00:02:00.750> really<00:02:01.020> nice<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.979> think<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.490> a

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
really really nice I think that a

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.330 
really really nice I think that a
touch-up<00:02:02.790> would<00:02:03.119> have<00:02:03.240> made<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.600> look<00:02:04.070> if<00:02:05.070> it

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
touch-up would have made it look if it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.800 
touch-up would have made it look if it
would<00:02:05.549> have<00:02:05.640> given<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.090> more<00:02:06.390> flawless

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
would have given it that more flawless

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.050 
would have given it that more flawless
sort<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.409> look<00:02:07.590> but<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.099> still<00:02:08.550> think<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:08.879> it

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
sort of look but I still think that it

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.419 
sort of look but I still think that it
will

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
will

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.280

it<00:04:04.900> honestly<00:04:05.169> has<00:04:05.680> worked<00:04:05.919> really<00:04:06.280> really

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
it honestly has worked really really

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.249 
it honestly has worked really really
well<00:04:06.840> I<00:04:07.919> think<00:04:08.919> that<00:04:09.879> for<00:04:10.180> me<00:04:10.359> this<00:04:10.599> foundation

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:11.259 
well I think that for me this foundation

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:13.559 
well I think that for me this foundation
is<00:04:11.500> about<00:04:12.189> medium<00:04:12.729> to<00:04:12.909> buildable<00:04:13.359> coverage

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
is about medium to buildable coverage

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.360 
is about medium to buildable coverage
but<00:04:13.900> I<00:04:13.959> really<00:04:14.319> think<00:04:14.349> if<00:04:14.620> you<00:04:14.739> wanted<00:04:15.129> sheer

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
but I really think if you wanted sheer

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.659 
but I really think if you wanted sheer
coverage<00:04:15.729> that<00:04:16.000> you<00:04:16.120> could<00:04:16.299> do<00:04:16.509> that<00:04:16.690> as<00:04:16.900> well

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
coverage that you could do that as well

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.399 
coverage that you could do that as well
you<00:04:18.669> honestly<00:04:18.880> for<00:04:19.419> me<00:04:19.479> I<00:04:19.630> don't<00:04:20.109> use<00:04:20.380> that

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:20.409 
you honestly for me I don't use that

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.860 
you honestly for me I don't use that
much

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
much

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.629 
much
probably<00:04:21.320> use<00:04:21.530> a<00:04:21.560> pea-sized<00:04:22.100> amount<00:04:22.130> and<00:04:22.580> that

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
probably use a pea-sized amount and that

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.060 
probably use a pea-sized amount and that
covers<00:04:23.030> my<00:04:23.180> whole<00:04:23.210> face<00:04:23.590> because<00:04:24.590> it's<00:04:24.860> such<00:04:25.040> a

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
covers my whole face because it's such a

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.510 
covers my whole face because it's such a
nice<00:04:25.370> smooth<00:04:25.880> creamy<00:04:26.530> foundation<00:04:27.530> the

have no problems with that it's easy and
it's<00:04:34.880> really<00:04:35.210> fast<00:04:35.690> I<00:04:36.139> feel<00:04:36.770> like<00:04:36.889> I<00:04:37.070> don't

looks like a second skin which I really

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.850 
looks like a second skin which I really
like<00:04:59.600> because<00:04:59.810> you<00:04:59.930> don't<00:05:00.260> get<00:05:00.530> that<00:05:00.680> with<00:05:00.710> a

really<00:05:03.229> hard<00:05:03.500> to<00:05:03.710> find<00:05:03.979> a<00:05:04.100> powder<00:05:04.370> that<00:05:04.520> really

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
really hard to find a powder that really

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.600 
really hard to find a powder that really
helped<00:05:05.630> set<00:05:06.139> the<00:05:06.350> foundation<00:05:06.500> and<00:05:07.100> control

feel like it's really translucent so I

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.370 
feel like it's really translucent so I

color payoff but honestly that probably

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.529 
color payoff but honestly that probably
controls<00:05:42.830> the<00:05:43.010> shine<00:05:43.250> the<00:05:43.820> best<00:05:44.060> out<00:05:44.300> of<00:05:44.360> all

I was sort of experiencing a little bit
of<00:06:02.120> dryness<00:06:02.650> in<00:06:03.650> the<00:06:03.919> start<00:06:04.340> of<00:06:04.460> winter<00:06:04.669> so<00:06:05.180> I

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 
of dryness in the start of winter so I

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:07.390 
of dryness in the start of winter so I
thought<00:06:05.930> that<00:06:05.990> this<00:06:06.229> would<00:06:06.410> help<00:06:06.620> a<00:06:06.889> little

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
thought that this would help a little

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.060 
thought that this would help a little
bit<00:06:07.580> and<00:06:07.820> honestly<00:06:08.630> it<00:06:08.930> really<00:06:08.960> does<00:06:09.620> i<00:06:09.830> find

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
bit and honestly it really does i find

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.270 
bit and honestly it really does i find
it<00:06:10.220> to<00:06:10.310> be<00:06:10.340> really<00:06:10.870> moisturizing<00:06:11.949> so<00:06:12.949> I<00:06:12.979> try

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
it to be really moisturizing so I try

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.400 
it to be really moisturizing so I try
not<00:06:13.430> to<00:06:13.490> apply<00:06:13.820> too<00:06:13.940> much<00:06:14.210> moisturizer<00:06:15.080> when<00:06:15.380> i

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
not to apply too much moisturizer when i

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.270 
not to apply too much moisturizer when i
use<00:06:15.650> this<00:06:15.830> foundation<00:06:17.470> but<00:06:18.470> it<00:06:18.620> really<00:06:18.889> works

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
use this foundation but it really works

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.750 
use this foundation but it really works
really<00:06:19.669> well<00:06:19.820> with<00:06:20.690> my<00:06:20.900> skin<00:06:20.960> at<00:06:21.440> the<00:06:21.470> moment<00:06:21.979> I

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
really well with my skin at the moment I

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.070 
really well with my skin at the moment I
don't<00:06:23.120> know<00:06:23.210> what<00:06:23.389> it's<00:06:23.510> going<00:06:23.630> to<00:06:23.690> be<00:06:23.750> like<00:06:24.020> in

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
don't know what it's going to be like in

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.250 
don't know what it's going to be like in
summer<00:06:24.550> but<00:06:25.550> as<00:06:26.030> I<00:06:26.060> said<00:06:26.270> I<00:06:26.660> really<00:06:26.870> assume

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260 
summer but as I said I really assume

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.750 
summer but as I said I really assume
that<00:06:27.470> it's<00:06:27.620> going<00:06:27.710> to<00:06:27.770> be<00:06:27.949> a<00:06:27.979> big<00:06:28.190> best<00:06:28.460> so<00:06:28.729> I

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760 
that it's going to be a big best so I

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.360 
that it's going to be a big best so I
probably<00:06:29.150> won't<00:06:29.419> be<00:06:29.780> using<00:06:29.990> any

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
probably won't be using any

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.280 
probably won't be using any
the<00:06:30.430> summer<00:06:30.669> but<00:06:30.970> it's<00:06:31.270> really<00:06:31.660> really<00:06:32.110> nice

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:32.290 
the summer but it's really really nice

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.250 
the summer but it's really really nice
if<00:06:32.830> you<00:06:33.040> have<00:06:33.220> oily<00:06:33.460> skin<00:06:33.729> I<00:06:34.150> still<00:06:34.930> think<00:06:34.960> that

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:35.260 
if you have oily skin I still think that

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.830 
if you have oily skin I still think that
you<00:06:35.380> could<00:06:35.590> try<00:06:35.860> it<00:06:35.889> i<00:06:36.190> mean<00:06:36.370> i<00:06:36.520> don't<00:06:36.820> have<00:06:37.060> the

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
you could try it i mean i don't have the

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.189 
you could try it i mean i don't have the
oily<00:06:38.410> skin<00:06:39.190> and<00:06:40.000> maybe<00:06:40.270> mine<00:06:40.540> is<00:06:40.720> a<00:06:40.750> little<00:06:40.840> bit

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 
oily skin and maybe mine is a little bit

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:44.939 
oily skin and maybe mine is a little bit
more<00:06:41.350> oily<00:06:41.770> to<00:06:41.919> combination<00:06:42.210> but<00:06:43.210> i<00:06:43.949> still

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:44.949 
more oily to combination but i still

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:46.409 
more oily to combination but i still
think<00:06:45.100> that<00:06:45.220> you'd<00:06:45.430> be<00:06:45.550> able<00:06:45.580> to<00:06:45.880> try<00:06:46.120> it<00:06:46.180> and

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:46.419 
think that you'd be able to try it and

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:47.879 
think that you'd be able to try it and
you<00:06:46.540> just<00:06:46.750> need<00:06:46.870> to<00:06:46.990> find<00:06:47.110> a<00:06:47.290> powder<00:06:47.560> that

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:47.889 
you just need to find a powder that

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:50.280 
you just need to find a powder that
works<00:06:48.490> really<00:06:48.790> well<00:06:48.940> with<00:06:49.330> the<00:06:49.389> foundation<00:06:50.139> um

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:50.290 
works really well with the foundation um

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.560 
works really well with the foundation um
I<00:06:50.770> wouldn't<00:06:51.220> just<00:06:51.280> pick<00:06:51.610> any<00:06:51.790> powder<00:06:52.210> because

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.570 
I wouldn't just pick any powder because

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.870 
I wouldn't just pick any powder because
that's<00:06:53.320> what<00:06:53.470> I<00:06:53.500> I<00:06:53.889> always<00:06:54.280> just<00:06:54.520> used<00:06:54.760> to

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 
that's what I I always just used to

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.010 
that's what I I always just used to
think<00:06:55.060> you<00:06:55.180> know<00:06:55.210> I<00:06:55.300> can<00:06:55.510> set<00:06:55.720> my<00:06:55.750> foundation

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020 
think you know I can set my foundation

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.990 
think you know I can set my foundation
with<00:06:56.560> any<00:06:56.800> sort<00:06:57.010> of<00:06:57.100> powder<00:06:57.340> and<00:06:57.610> that<00:06:57.820> will

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 
with any sort of powder and that will

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.020 
with any sort of powder and that will
control<00:06:58.330> the<00:06:58.479> shine<00:06:59.070> that<00:07:00.070> obviously<00:07:00.580> was<00:07:00.699> not

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.030 
control the shine that obviously was not

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.960 
control the shine that obviously was not
the<00:07:01.210> case<00:07:01.360> of<00:07:01.600> this<00:07:01.750> foundation<00:07:02.070> but<00:07:03.070> yeah<00:07:03.610> I

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
the case of this foundation but yeah I

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.790 
the case of this foundation but yeah I
also<00:07:04.389> think<00:07:04.690> another<00:07:05.050> thing<00:07:05.199> that<00:07:05.530> played<00:07:05.770> a

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 
also think another thing that played a

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.159 
also think another thing that played a
really<00:07:06.130> big<00:07:06.490> role<00:07:06.760> with<00:07:07.000> his<00:07:07.150> foundation<00:07:07.690> is<00:07:07.900> a

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:08.169 
really big role with his foundation is a

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:10.770 
really big role with his foundation is a
primer<00:07:08.590> I<00:07:08.949> needed<00:07:09.520> a<00:07:09.699> private<00:07:10.120> that<00:07:10.270> would

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:10.780 
primer I needed a private that would

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.460 
primer I needed a private that would
help<00:07:11.490> make<00:07:12.490> it<00:07:12.639> last<00:07:12.850> all<00:07:13.150> day<00:07:13.210> and<00:07:13.720> sort<00:07:14.080> of<00:07:14.229> um

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:14.470 
help make it last all day and sort of um

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:18.420 
help make it last all day and sort of um
help<00:07:15.280> with<00:07:15.490> shine<00:07:16.800> so<00:07:17.800> yeah<00:07:17.979> I<00:07:18.010> think<00:07:18.160> you

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:18.430 
help with shine so yeah I think you

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.370 
help with shine so yeah I think you
would<00:07:18.580> need<00:07:18.789> a<00:07:18.850> really<00:07:19.150> good<00:07:19.270> primer<00:07:19.690> really

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:20.380 
would need a really good primer really

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.370 
would need a really good primer really
good<00:07:20.590> powder<00:07:20.949> and<00:07:21.340> this<00:07:22.270> foundation<00:07:22.900> would

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:23.380 
good powder and this foundation would

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.770 
good powder and this foundation would
work<00:07:23.650> flawlessly<00:07:24.130> as<00:07:24.760> it<00:07:25.000> has<00:07:25.210> been<00:07:25.240> since

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:25.780 
work flawlessly as it has been since

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.090 
work flawlessly as it has been since
I've<00:07:25.960> been<00:07:26.080> using<00:07:26.260> my<00:07:26.500> fingers<00:07:26.830> and<00:07:27.010> I'm

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:27.100 
I've been using my fingers and I'm

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.760 
I've been using my fingers and I'm
really<00:07:27.430> really<00:07:27.610> liking<00:07:28.180> it<00:07:28.300> the<00:07:29.199> only<00:07:29.530> thing

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:29.770 
really really liking it the only thing

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.159 
really really liking it the only thing
that<00:07:29.979> I<00:07:30.010> would<00:07:30.190> honestly<00:07:30.550> say<00:07:30.880> is<00:07:31.330> a<00:07:31.630> bad<00:07:32.139> thing

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:32.169 
that I would honestly say is a bad thing

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:34.650 
that I would honestly say is a bad thing
about<00:07:32.500> this<00:07:32.830> and<00:07:33.130> that's<00:07:33.880> probably<00:07:34.090> a<00:07:34.360> fault

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:34.660 
about this and that's probably a fault

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.779 
about this and that's probably a fault
of<00:07:34.780> my<00:07:34.990> own<00:07:35.020> is<00:07:35.440> that<00:07:35.680> I<00:07:35.860> have<00:07:36.280> to<00:07:36.430> control

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:36.789 
of my own is that I have to control

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:39.089 
of my own is that I have to control
shine<00:07:37.150> but<00:07:37.599> other<00:07:37.840> than<00:07:38.080> that<00:07:38.139> every<00:07:38.950> other

00:07:39.089 --> 00:07:39.099 
shine but other than that every other

00:07:39.099 --> 00:07:42.890 
shine but other than that every other
thing<00:07:39.479> is<00:07:40.620> perfect<00:07:41.620> about<00:07:41.889> this<00:07:42.099> foundation

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:42.900 
thing is perfect about this foundation

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.860 
thing is perfect about this foundation
explaining<00:07:43.900> the<00:07:44.020> fact<00:07:44.260> that<00:07:44.410> it<00:07:44.620> has<00:07:44.770> no<00:07:45.039> pump

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:45.870 
explaining the fact that it has no pump

explaining the fact that it has no pump
nas<00:07:46.870> really<00:07:47.470> need<00:07:47.650> to<00:07:47.770> work<00:07:47.979> on<00:07:48.220> making<00:07:48.639> a

foundation<00:07:49.419> with<00:07:49.450> a<00:07:49.780> pump<00:07:50.080> instead<00:07:50.470> of<00:07:50.590> making

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:51.070 
foundation with a pump instead of making

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.100 
foundation with a pump instead of making
people<00:07:51.190> buy<00:07:51.580> a<00:07:51.610> pump<00:07:52.000> considering<00:07:52.960> how
