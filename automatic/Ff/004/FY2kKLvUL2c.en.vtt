00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.480
you gotta give me some answer.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:11.020
Um, yes no to get to the other side 1.7725 to 45

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.540
I don't wanna know square root of pi is

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.040
You knew that

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.780
How did you know where I was

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.540
I didn't

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.320
Alright

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.240
Wait! Don't leave

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.340
Did you follow me

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.360
I feel very protective of you

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.320
So, you follow me

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.140
I was trying to keep in distance unless you needed my help

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.340
and then  I heard what those lowlives were thinking

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.400
Wait

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.560
You said you heard what they were thinking

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.240
So, what you......you read minds

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.960
I can read every mind in this room

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.180
Apart from you

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.760
money

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.840
sex

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.380
Money

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:20.620
Sex

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.900
Cat

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.500
And then you......nothing

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.760
It's very frustrating

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.860
Is there something wrong with me?

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.960
See, I tell you I can read minds. And you think something wrong with you

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.920
What is it?

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:01.240
I don't have the strength to stay away from you any more

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.780
Then don't
