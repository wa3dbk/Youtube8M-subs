00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
the mix in that area there's a

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.700 
the mix in that area there's a
perception<00:04:59.480> out<00:04:59.810> there<00:04:59.870> the<00:05:00.200> kinders<00:05:00.560> have

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.080 
perception out there the kinders have
gotten<00:05:00.950> significantly<00:05:01.100> better<00:05:01.700> in<00:05:01.880> the

gotten significantly better in the

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.760 
gotten significantly better in the
lakers<00:05:04.480> how<00:05:05.480> does<00:05:05.660> that<00:05:05.810> kind<00:05:05.990> of<00:05:06.110> simply<00:05:06.560> get

lakers how does that kind of simply get

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.510 
lakers how does that kind of simply get
per<00:05:07.610> second<00:05:07.970> no<00:05:08.180> I<00:05:08.590> guess<00:05:09.590> that's<00:05:09.830> what<00:05:10.010> makes

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
per second no I guess that's what makes

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.150 
per second no I guess that's what makes
people<00:05:10.729> pay<00:05:11.030> attention<00:05:11.180> to<00:05:11.479> the<00:05:11.660> NBA<00:05:12.160> people
