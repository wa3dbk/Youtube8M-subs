00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
hour it's probably the slowest vehicle i

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.490 
hour it's probably the slowest vehicle i
own<00:02:30.340> at<00:02:30.550> this<00:02:30.730> point<00:02:31.060> in<00:02:31.180> time<00:02:31.210> but<00:02:31.660> when<00:02:32.350> it

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500
