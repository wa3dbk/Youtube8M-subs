 tickets a piece of stained paper 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:20.140
 represents a figure ten twenty 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.210
 fifty dollars one hundred euros a figure 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.150
 that we change in relation to what 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.759
 we want to acquire a figure that itself 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.349
 they do not have any other value 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.750
 that we want to give the 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.059
 work or the time by which I enter 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.730
 we change the work poses a reflection 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:40.739
 about the meaning and value of 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.739
 money time and people 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:49.010
 in this way the work is cast from 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:51.800
 paper are hand painted and glued 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.910
 one by one the process is a process 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.430
 complex each ticket has 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.640
 detail and you have to do it with a lot 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.640
 need 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.980
 really the most complex teacher 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.830
 is to get that paper that in no 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:18.010
 you will use fire to burn it 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:23.130
 in none of that impression that is 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.130
 called is being consumed I know 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.080
 this work is the result of several 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.350
 works in which a 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.310
 fusion between contemporary art and design 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:46.450
 and all this makes this work a 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.450
 unique and unrepeatable piece
