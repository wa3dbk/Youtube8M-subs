we're<00:01:28.530> going<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.680> move<00:01:28.920> into<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.400> now

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
we're going to move into this now

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.510 
we're going to move into this now

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.429 
to do my flat palm spin on my right hand
which<00:01:35.159> means<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.880> am<00:01:35.909> going<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.479> have<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.750> learn

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
which means I am going to have to learn

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.890 
which means I am going to have to learn
or<00:01:37.829> how<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.189> learn<00:01:38.490> how<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:39.180> feel<00:01:39.600> more

or how to learn how to feel more
comfortable<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.590> familiar<00:01:40.710> doing<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
comfortable and familiar doing the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.910 
comfortable and familiar doing the
behind<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.210> back<00:01:42.299> swing<00:01:42.720> starting<00:01:43.649> with<00:01:43.770> my

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
behind the back swing starting with my

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.800 
behind the back swing starting with my
left<00:01:43.950> hand<00:01:44.310> which<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.759> not<00:01:45.030> my<00:01:45.180> dominant<00:01:45.600> way

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
left hand which is not my dominant way

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.280 
left hand which is not my dominant way

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.740 
a
palm<00:02:13.680> spin<00:02:14.160> now<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.670> could<00:02:15.210> go<00:02:15.390> into<00:02:15.630> a

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
palm spin now I could go into a

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.480 
palm spin now I could go into a
backwards<00:02:16.290> weave<00:02:16.440> if<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:16.770> need<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.040> little<00:02:17.310> bit

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
backwards weave if I need a little bit

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.170 
backwards weave if I need a little bit
of<00:02:17.550> extra<00:02:18.090> time<00:02:18.360> but<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.560> can<00:02:20.220> just<00:02:20.550> go<00:02:20.730> move

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
of extra time but I can just go move

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.600 
of extra time but I can just go move
straight<00:02:21.630> into<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.110> palm<00:02:22.380> spin<00:02:22.710> so<00:02:23.130> let's

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
straight into that palm spin so let's

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.490 
straight into that palm spin so let's
check<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.060> out<00:02:24.240> from<00:02:24.480> behind<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:25.320> then

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
check that out from behind and then

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.590 
check that out from behind and then
we'll<00:02:25.620> do<00:02:25.740> it<00:02:25.860> real<00:02:26.130> mo<00:02:26.340> get<00:02:26.880> some<00:02:27.090> practice

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
we'll do it real mo get some practice

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.780 
we'll do it real mo get some practice
