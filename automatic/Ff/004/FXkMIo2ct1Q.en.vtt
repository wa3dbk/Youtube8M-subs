running and what software overlay the

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.620 
running and what software overlay the
manufacturer<00:04:44.850> might<00:04:45.030> have<00:04:45.120> thrown<00:04:45.270> on<00:04:45.420> there

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
manufacturer might have thrown on there

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.540 
manufacturer might have thrown on there
but<00:04:46.050> for<00:04:46.170> the<00:04:46.230> most<00:04:46.350> part<00:04:46.470> it's<00:04:46.860> gonna<00:04:47.190> be<00:04:47.340> just

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
but for the most part it's gonna be just

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.760 
but for the most part it's gonna be just
about<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:47.820> same<00:04:48.030> so<00:04:48.210> again<00:04:48.450> Wyson<00:04:49.230> networks

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
about the same so again Wyson networks

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.280 
about the same so again Wyson networks
you're<00:04:50.070> gonna<00:04:50.220> hit<00:04:50.490> more<00:04:50.910> tap<00:04:51.900> mobile

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
you're gonna hit more tap mobile

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.650 
you're gonna hit more tap mobile
networks<00:04:52.770> and<00:04:52.980> then<00:04:53.340> access<00:04:54.030> point<00:04:54.270> names<00:04:54.450> or

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
networks and then access point names or

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.430 
networks and then access point names or
APNs

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
APNs

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.980 
APNs
now<00:04:55.950> what<00:04:56.430> you<00:04:56.520> can<00:04:56.640> sometimes<00:04:57.120> do<00:04:57.300> is<00:04:57.570> tap

that overflow button and hit reset to

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.730 
that overflow button and hit reset to
default<00:05:00.300> and<00:05:00.420> sometimes<00:05:01.050> I<00:05:01.170> was<00:05:01.290> just<00:05:01.410> pull<00:05:01.590> in

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.760 
SIM card although in my case that's not
happening<00:05:06.450> so<00:05:06.630> what<00:05:06.990> we<00:05:07.080> would<00:05:07.200> have<00:05:07.290> to<00:05:07.380> do<00:05:07.560> is
