this<00:00:56.850> recipe<00:00:57.149> I'm<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.170> go<00:00:58.260> ahead<00:00:58.410> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
this recipe I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.860 
this recipe I'm going to go ahead and
use<00:00:58.829> chocolate<00:00:59.460> molds<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.690> don't

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
use chocolate molds but if you don't

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.830 
use chocolate molds but if you don't
have<00:01:01.170> candy<00:01:01.920> molds<00:01:02.370> or<00:01:02.489> even<00:01:02.879> ice<00:01:03.149> cube<00:01:03.480> trays

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
have candy molds or even ice cube trays

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.070 
have candy molds or even ice cube trays
then<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:05.189> can<00:01:05.400> make<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.580> bark<00:01:05.970> style<00:01:06.420> chocolate

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
then you can make a bark style chocolate

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.980 
then you can make a bark style chocolate
where<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.500> take<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:08.189> sheet<00:01:08.909> pan<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.750> line

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
where you take a sheet pan and you line

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.870 
where you take a sheet pan and you line
it<00:01:10.140> with<00:01:10.260> either<00:01:10.439> wax<00:01:10.799> paper<00:01:11.159> or<00:01:11.490> parchment

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
it with either wax paper or parchment

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.510 
it with either wax paper or parchment
paper<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.290> pour<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> hot<00:01:13.860> chocolate<00:01:14.130> out

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
paper and you pour the hot chocolate out

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.149 
paper and you pour the hot chocolate out
on<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.450> cool<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.439> refrigerator

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
on that and cool it in the refrigerator

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.700 
on that and cool it in the refrigerator
then<00:01:17.909> when<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:18.420> cold<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.900> break<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.320> up<00:01:19.500> into

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
then when it's cold you break it up into

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.820 
then when it's cold you break it up into
shards<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.810> that's<00:01:21.810> another<00:01:22.110> option<00:01:22.439> if<00:01:22.710> you

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
shards so that's another option if you

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.560 
shards so that's another option if you
don't<00:01:22.860> have<00:01:23.430> chocolate<00:01:23.670> molds<00:01:24.210> but<00:01:24.390> these

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
don't have chocolate molds but these

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.950 
don't have chocolate molds but these

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
to use as much heat to melt it in a

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.850 
to use as much heat to melt it in a
small<00:01:39.060> pan<00:01:40.189> melt<00:01:41.189> your<00:01:41.430> cocoa<00:01:42.710> butter<00:01:43.710> and

a<00:04:37.990> really<00:04:38.380> fine<00:04:38.740> sea<00:04:39.220> salt<00:04:39.690> this<00:04:40.690> is<00:04:40.750> a<00:04:40.930> grey

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
a really fine sea salt this is a grey

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.800 
a really fine sea salt this is a grey
salt<00:04:41.979> but<00:04:42.250> I<00:04:42.400> like<00:04:42.669> the<00:04:42.820> salty<00:04:43.180> bit<00:04:43.390> so<00:04:43.630> I'm

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
salt but I like the salty bit so I'm

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.279 
salt but I like the salty bit so I'm
going<00:04:43.840> to<00:04:43.990> go<00:04:44.080> ahead<00:04:44.200> and<00:04:44.500> add<00:04:44.680> in<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:46.870> flake

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
salt I think that's what makes these

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.440
