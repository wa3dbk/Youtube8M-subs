00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 Today, guys, we'll make a fun game 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.020
 in the kitchen an experiment devised by 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.480
 chef carlo cracco the protagonist of the 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.120
 day will be the yolk to be 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.280
 precise and we will see how they cook without 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.599
 use heat 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.090
 if you remember in the experiments 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.060
 previous molecular we have seen how 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.070
 scrape the egg with alcohol 95 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.460
 degrees and also how to cook it in 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.680
 dishwasher and today we will see how 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.599
 then marinate as you cook the yolk 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.610
 with salt and sugar let's see what 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.770
 it deals with 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:41.190
 to prepare the new marinated I am 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.780
 an egg needed 50 grams of salt 50 g 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.860
 of sugar 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.680
 let's start with this experiment 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.960
 first I tasted a divided place 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.170
 the yolk from the album and in this recipe 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.690
 you'll only need the yolk because 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.270
 the album and we will not go out to sailor 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.340
 here we have sugar and in salt 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:09.260
 now let's mix them inside 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:09.260
 of a small bowl in equal parts 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.180
 we mix well we take here 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.210
 another bowl and pour about half of it 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.130
 or in any case a part based on 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.260
 this bowl 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.830
 the preparation is very simple as 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.830
 law 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.630
 we put in the yolk inside as well 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.600
 trying not to break it right now 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:44.700
 slowly we cover it with the 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:48.040
 marinating we could also put 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.040
 only the salt alone that sugar 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.840
 serves to reduce aggression a little 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.619
 of the taste of the salt it leaves 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.790
 in the final food what happens 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.420
 now in here 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.850
 in practice as it does to cook 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.520
 because in salt the sugar as we know 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.830
 are hygroscopic substances are year a 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.600
 capture water and moisture 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.880
 of the environment around them 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.260
 or in this case also from what 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.590
 around him 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.930
 the yolk is characterized by proteins 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.970
 and water as well as on one side i 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.130
 liquids that the powers are dispersed 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.920
 in the water then salt the sugar which 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.640
 being hygroscopic people they succeed in 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.590
 remove all the water so the proteins 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.320
 they undergo a rearrangement before yes 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.870
 unroll then denaturate and then yes 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.700
 rearrange or coagulate and is 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.239
 just what happens inside 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.440
 of our yolk that we will see 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.620
 solidify so let's plant more 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.820
 long let the egg marinate 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.060
 inside this salt mixture 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:55.060
 more yolk sugar will become hard me 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.580
 I advise you to leave the place to sail 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.010
 about three or four hours to have a 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.140
 soft heart and a little bit coating 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.810
 harder and leave it here so a 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.120
 room temperature for three hours 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.640
 here we are guys after about three hours e 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.430
 half let's see what the conditions are 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.100
 it's the man 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:20.140
 movie has the floor plan Carefully 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:22.270
 marinating you see that sugar and 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.520
 salt got wet means that 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.610
 have removed all the water present in the 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.980
 so turn 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:35.200
 be gentle true 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:38.000
 we remove with a spoon here it is 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.640
 to remove all the sugar in salt 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.520
 in the sense that we have in the water 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.800
 cold 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:49.909
 ok 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:55.879
 always very gently and now it is 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:59.420
 we can dry absolute linen bath e 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:04.760
 this is your marinated three and a half hours 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:08.870
 we have the inside we cut it you see 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:12.079
 that the coating is harder on 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.860
 gelatinous almost not while the inside is 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:19.400
 liquid if you want it a little more compact 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:22.520
 I also did another experiment e 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.580
 or marinated two more yolks for a 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:29.000
 longer period of time 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:35.300
 we are around 5 hours ok see also 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:39.199
 the color is different Italian your sees 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:46.150
 which is even more gelatinous even at 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:46.150
 cut and the heart is no longer death here it is 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.110
 of the series a thousand ways to cook 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.139
 eggs 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.880
 here today I proposed a cooking 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:58.250
 curious and alternative to cook 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.830
 this food so versatile in 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.470
 you will ask yourself now and how it is consumed 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.990
 you can use it as a decoration for 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.910
 prepare croutons or even it 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.710
 you can put inside the 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.039
 salads then as decoration on that 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.039
 pasta
