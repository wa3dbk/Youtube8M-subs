00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
different extensions and I'm here to

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.240 
different extensions and I'm here to
show<00:00:04.080> you<00:00:04.110> how<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.470> put<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.740> horse<00:00:05.040> tail

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.610 
show you how to put a horse tail
extension<00:00:05.790> in<00:00:05.940> with<00:00:06.120> braids<00:00:06.420> strings<00:00:06.810> I<00:00:07.080> just

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
extension in with braids strings I just

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.350 
extension in with braids strings I just
attached<00:00:07.950> two<00:00:08.189> white<00:00:08.400> strings<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.940> this<00:00:09.090> tail

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
attached two white strings to this tail

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.030 
attached two white strings to this tail
so<00:00:09.660> that<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:10.019> would<00:00:10.139> make<00:00:10.290> it<00:00:10.440> easier<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.769> see

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
so that it would make it easier to see

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.240 
so that it would make it easier to see
as<00:00:11.160> we<00:00:11.280> put<00:00:11.490> it<00:00:11.610> into<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.030> brown<00:00:12.240> tail<00:00:13.250> first

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
as we put it into the brown tail first

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.680 
as we put it into the brown tail first
thing<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.549> want<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.790> do<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:15.269> tail<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.660> a

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
thing you want to do and this tail is a

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.210 
thing you want to do and this tail is a
little<00:00:15.960> bit<00:00:16.049> short<00:00:16.320> for<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.650> horse<00:00:16.890> but<00:00:17.100> this

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
little bit short for this horse but this

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.730 
little bit short for this horse but this
is<00:00:17.369> just<00:00:17.580> for<00:00:17.730> demonstration<00:00:17.760> purposes<00:00:18.740> but

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
is just for demonstration purposes but

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.650 
is just for demonstration purposes but
you<00:00:19.859> want<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.130> find<00:00:20.430> where<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:21.090> want<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.449> tail

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
you want to find where you want the tail

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.080 
you want to find where you want the tail
to<00:00:21.990> sit<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.100> it's<00:00:23.279> at<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.430> appropriate

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
to sit so that it's at the appropriate

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.540 
to sit so that it's at the appropriate
length<00:00:24.269> if<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:25.470> was<00:00:25.710> where<00:00:25.949> we<00:00:26.160> wanted<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
length if this was where we wanted the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.230 
length if this was where we wanted the
Telos<00:00:26.910> if<00:00:27.090> we<00:00:27.300> would<00:00:27.449> just<00:00:27.599> separate<00:00:28.080> hair

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
Telos if we would just separate hair

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.880 
Telos if we would just separate hair
then<00:00:30.240> we'd<00:00:30.449> get<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.990> out<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.260> our<00:00:31.349> way<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.590> can

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
then we'd get it out of our way you can

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.799 
then we'd get it out of our way you can

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
use a rubber band get it out of our way

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:47.630 
use a rubber band get it out of our way
today<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.899> just<00:00:46.170> exposes<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.100> middle

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
and bottom layers of the tail the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.729 
and bottom layers of the tail the
tailbone<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.600> right<00:00:51.809> here<00:00:52.289> we're<00:00:52.559> going<00:00:52.680> to

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
tailbone is right here we're going to

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.560 
tailbone is right here we're going to
attach<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.309> tail<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.879> front<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
attach this tail to the front of the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.180 
attach this tail to the front of the
tail<00:00:54.750> bone<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.199> that's<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.559> keep<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.739> horse's

look<00:01:00.329> with<00:01:00.570> your<00:01:00.719> tail<00:01:00.899> extension<00:01:01.340> we're

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
look with your tail extension we're

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.590 
look with your tail extension we're
gonna<00:01:02.460> grab<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> little<00:01:02.910> bit<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.390> hair<00:01:03.570> from

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600

gonna grab a little bit of hair from
each<00:01:04.110> side<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.619> tail<00:01:04.860> bone<00:01:07.369> I'd<00:01:08.369> say<00:01:08.670> about

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
each side of the tail bone I'd say about

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.880 
each side of the tail bone I'd say about
half<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:09.240> pencil<00:01:09.659> width<00:01:09.840> there<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.470> then<00:01:10.680> just

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
half a pencil width there and then just

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.469 
half a pencil width there and then just
a<00:01:10.979> little<00:01:11.010> bit<00:01:11.430> from<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.790> middle<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.299> tail

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.160 
pieces of hair then we're gonna take our
tail<00:01:19.229> extension<00:01:19.680> with<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.220> strings<00:01:21.170> we're

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
tail extension with the strings we're

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.249 
tail extension with the strings we're
gonna<00:01:22.259> put<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.619> below<00:01:22.830> our<00:01:23.250> pieces<00:01:24.259> we're

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
gonna put it below our pieces we're

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.789 
gonna put it below our pieces we're
gonna<00:01:25.350> put<00:01:25.710> each<00:01:26.220> string<00:01:26.880> on<00:01:27.210> one<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.470> each

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
gonna put each string on one on each

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.910 
gonna put each string on one on each
side<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.640> tail<00:01:30.360> here<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.560> can<00:01:31.710> see

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
side of the tail here so you can see

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.710 
side of the tail here so you can see
that<00:01:32.189> we<00:01:32.310> have<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.610> three<00:01:32.820> pieces<00:01:33.060> still<00:01:33.479> in

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
that we have the three pieces still in

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.050 
that we have the three pieces still in
both<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.619> left<00:01:34.860> piece<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> right<00:01:35.790> piece

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
want to make sure that these are pulled

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.520 
want to make sure that these are pulled
up<00:01:44.479> there<00:01:45.479> are<00:01:45.540> several<00:01:45.750> different<00:01:46.170> ways<00:01:46.200> you

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
up there are several different ways you

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.770 
up there are several different ways you
can<00:01:46.680> attach<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.460> tail<00:01:47.729> extension<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.570> is

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
can attach this tail extension this is

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.020 
can attach this tail extension this is
one<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.409> don't<00:01:49.799> braid<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.579> horse's<00:01:51.000> tail
