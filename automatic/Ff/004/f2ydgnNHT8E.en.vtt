the<00:00:38.820> download<00:00:39.239> rate<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.629> one<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.020> one<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.680> an

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
the download rate is one to one so an

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.319 
the download rate is one to one so an

18 tapes with an hour's footage on each

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.119 
18 tapes with an hour's footage on each

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
which means it took 18 hours to get all

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.939
