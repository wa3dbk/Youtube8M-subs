00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.200

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.209
 smart watch came from China is a view 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.909
 ik-6 they came to me from the store 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.980
 Girbest links on products and on 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:23.230
 coupon code for buying it you 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.089
 find in the description of our video clip 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.039
 on youtube 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.869
 let's see what we have in the box on 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.359
 the box itself can be huge 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.000
 the number of characteristics declared 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:38.649
 written in english and chinese 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:44.559
 the languages ​​of the box itself are slow 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:45.879
 opens to the iphone omsk box itself 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.859
 we are waiting for instructions 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.859
 again in chinese and 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.640
 words to the manufacturer in English 

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:59.829
 Well, the first time I will communicate with 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.929
 Chinese smartwatch so far if 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.999
 honestly can not imagine how I will them 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:07.900
 connect with your smartphone like they 

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:12.550
 will be friends and so on beyond that 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:16.240
 here we are waiting for a sleigh clock 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:19.120
 Plenochku body fully matt 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.910
 Silicone quality casting strap 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.590
 principle, in principle, pretty good 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:28.000
 there are some defects inside the hole 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.100
 when stayed after 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.290
 casting molds have disconnected but in 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.270
 In principle, they are not very noticeable wherever I am. 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.130
 I would not say that this is downright 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.550
 lack of overall quality 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.370
 housing at first glance very decent 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.370
 I have no complaints so far 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.830
 the main thing is that this one 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:51.000
 little screen they they even work and even 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.490
 counted 870 that football 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.090
 Apparently while driving in the package here this one 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.289
 the screen is matte and 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.560
 difference from gloss from softbox like us 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.969
 we see he glares very well but on 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.030
 the sun in natural light he 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.280
 it will surely not be so strong 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.790
 as if this one here is plastic 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:20.940
 glossy beyond that in our box 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:22.799
 There is a lace drawstring short and judging by 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.220
 all in silicone braid such 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:31.890
 soft lace apparently considering 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:34.110
 the fact that he is a magnetic connector with 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.910
 two pins so i guess 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.610
 that it is used only for charging 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:45.269
 as you can see we have on our watch 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.010
 port about contact clock 4 itself but i'm so 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.190
 I suspect that they are used for 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:55.349
 firmware remaining 22 extremely for charging 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:58.709
 and in such a way they stick 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:01.230
 to the clock sleep more with us nothing short 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.030
 no ask questions about it 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.880
 device will try to answer them 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.040
 there about knowing autonomy by 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.019
 about the accuracy of the measurements that he 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.660
 holds about the functional and so 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.639
 further we are interested in what you want to know 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.340
 more detail them along with you 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:23.970
 let's talk in the review which will be in 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:26.190
 near foreseeable time and in principle 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.410
 on this I had everything with you dmitry 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.180
