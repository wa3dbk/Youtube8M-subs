00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.939
 hi culeros greets you and tires 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.239
 today in the afternoon I was buying the newspaper when I saw a lady 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.910
 that he was giving Coca-Cola in a bottle to his baby and that his children 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.420
 they were eating some fries running full to my house do this 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.550
 video titled 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.590
 the shit we eat 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.500
 fritters cookies cupcakes refreshments said ice cream cereals gum john cox 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.300
 are some of the junk products that we consume every day although 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.390
 let's not know its true nutritional value 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.750
 you've been thinking about what is the content of all that 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.059
 we have reached the moment when we no longer know what we are 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.390
 getting between chest and back 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.540
 nobody knows what percentage of chemistry we are swallowing when eating a soup 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.660
 instant some junk cupcakes 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.660
 with large transnational and local companies 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.280
 besides the food industry that instead of feeding poison our 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.030
 body with its sophisticated product 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.149
 reflection of it 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.919
 this is the increase in sickness around the world death figures by 

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:32.899
 cancer increase and medical publications surprise us in their writings 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.030
 with his findings of diseases that were not known 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.640
 all this goes through a very simple reason every time we eat worse 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.360
 you knew for example that obesity has become the first problem of 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.440
 health in the united states 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.980
 or that the worst fattening ones are the soft drinks cakes go white 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.229
 box cereals 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.549
 ice cream candies and hamburgers 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.390
 that between the additives substance that is added to any food so that 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.970
 do not get spoiled there are some considered risky as aspartame 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.450
 lactose caffeine orange 2 sodium caseinate among others or that 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.220
 among the additives considered carcinogenic are arsenic 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.760
 saccharin diethylene glycol sodium benzoate benzopyrene used in 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.109
 cigars 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:23.539
 Much of what we eat is literally junk 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.539
 because every day that passes we are poisoned more 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:30.539
 when the canned food was invented all 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.559
 said be it with forgiveness of logic with the technological advance of canning it 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:39.579
 gave rise to the industrialization of food but a new 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.009
 a problem to solve that add to the can so it will not go to waste 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:47.109
 the content if those additives are just the so-called additives 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.849
 that 90% of the additives are safe 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.150
 but that 10% are dangerous because they cause allergies some are 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.730
 carcinogens to burn asthmatics cause ulcers and hemorrhages in the 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.829
 digestive system and cause infants hyperactivity 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.919
 I never bought cans hit with the blows 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:10.739
 the lead that is very dangerous for the health cites data of the organization 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.599
 global health and more information such as the fact that an estimated 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.060
 gringo boy to turn 12 years old has already swallowed more than two kilos of 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:21.149
 innocent dyes 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:24.329
 the shit that we eat GM foods and food 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.329
 industrialized already reached us and although it is facilitating us 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.079
 or to a great extent life above all to the housewives the certain thing is that we do not 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.900
 feed not show the body and far from benefiting us are destroying 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.989
 our to the human being 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.749
 the fast running of life 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:44.109
 stress and overwork have forced us to properly prepare the 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.039
 food and choose to consume fast food than the neighboring northern country 

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:51.059
 We have inherited french fries burgers 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:54.319
 pinchas et cetera aside to the excesses of the culinary culture 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.409
 mexicana sopes tacos in chile fairies 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:58.559
 cakes and so on 

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:02.799
 because every day we hear our grandparents say before the people do not 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.709
 he got sick so soon the diseases were cured with a little 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.069
 herbs because before people consumed food more 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.539
 natural without both conservatives or chemicals that are the main 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:17.539
 causing chronic diseases such as cancer 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.159
 and to show a button what is the new disease that suffers much 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:23.319
 of the population 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:26.949
 because the depression which according to Canadian studies has been shown 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.120
 that to a large extent the mental illnesses come from an anemia or 

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:32.430
 A bad diet 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.500
 which justifies that day to day there are more criminals addicted or 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.570
 schizophrenics 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.870
 and we can think that this is a problem of the big cities but not the 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.630
 indigenous communities are high consumers of junk foods what 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.350
 that causes that recurrently those that suffer more suffer 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.930
 and it is that the marketing itself and the internal struggle of the human being for 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.039
 maintaining a calendar figure is what compels manufacturing companies to 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:02.389
 food to create new products day after day that if they 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.479
 lips that if high in fiber low in sodium 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.250
 but instant rasa 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.300
 in short so many alternatives that we end up consuming food 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.110
 prefabricated saturated with chemicals and as processed as the face of michael 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.360
 jackson 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.030
 the truth does not sin but if it bothers you truthfully and there is no turning of the page we should 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.810
 make aware of what we give our body daily and analyze if 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.780
 canned preserved pasteurized processed and packaged is what most 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.449
 benefit will make us 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.210
 but in the end I am not a nutritionist and the decisions of each one to choose what 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.259
 it is put to the mouth but I do think it is important to pay close attention to what 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:41.979
 that you are going to recommend or worse yet prohibit a child because we can 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:44.979
 start with ourselves by setting a good example 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.770
 more than lead us to lose our appetite 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.589
 this video we can 

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:53.210
 change our eating habits but if after seeing them 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.069
 it is decided to continue the same as the video concludes that with his bread he 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:58.229
 eat 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:05:58.779
 goodbye
