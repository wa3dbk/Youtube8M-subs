00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.170

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.900
 I'm just a few 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.200
 Seconds quiet

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:44.100
 so now you are so slow in concept 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.850
 to be over 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.910

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:21.260
 Let's be honest with the music 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:31.540
 and you call us 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.220
 that we always say if say 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.210
 We really needed a knife 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.100
 in which situation 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.920
 I can anticipate the tension was the same 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.660
 take out there there is nothing nothing 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.180
 Action-packed what I experienced so 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.700
 I'm not a diver I'm not a mountaineer 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.680
 There were no extreme situations where I am 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.470
 really now a knife the ass 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.110
 has saved or so gives but quite 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.000
 little stories where I am super grateful 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.370
 were better to have it with me 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.920
 have and that was mostly mostly 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.600
 at work because there come then 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.160
 such surprising things 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.830
 that was like we did, for example 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.690
 Firmly had at work and had there 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.760
 we have 50 rolls and they all have to 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.470
 be cut open and there was no 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.480
 decent bun knife and the 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.540
 then started the bun too 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.590
 cut with two work colleagues and 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.260
 that took forever 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.120
 So they fought with it and then 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.880
 I had the had just had 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.380
 only started in the cracks the rolls 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.210
 has it apart and I had 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.520
 I mean paramilitary two 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.840
 and so were the rolls 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:38.000
 really wonderful wonderful sharing and 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.710
 50 rolls if you put 50 putin with this 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.460
 knife must cut then then 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.340
 that already with the 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.870
 paramilitary that's wonderful I have 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.100
 the cut open the others have them 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.260
 everything smears well 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.540
 I was really grateful and still 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.220
 another story 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.630
 We also had to work there 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.700
 cut felt 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.130
 that was a big felt matte and the 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.560
 so had to be in a centimeter or 2 cm 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.540
 thick strips are cut and 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.490
 That was with the scissors totally bad 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.530
 just a lousy sharpness against easy 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.270
 not at the front and at the back 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.580
 and then i did the knife 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.260
 simply laid out on the floor once 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.350
 with knives long that was with the with the 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.550
 Unfortunately, I did not have that with me 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.740
 the gentleman like you the hedgehog 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.540
 that's just on the way otherwise I would 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.140
 like to show you i hold 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.870
 just portray that portman 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:29.660
 of masters of defense in the camera 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.210
 simply something chic part 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.440
 yes and then I have that with the with 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.780
 the wonderful long and snowing 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.880
 happy elmar made the bell and that 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.590
 went so wonderful that was such a cramp 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.290
 that was really a lot of fat to cut 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.760
 half an hour 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:47.000
 one has to deal with the one with the medium 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.320
 scissors really truest words Wolf 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.480
 do not cut the front and back 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.590
 with the sword just then had 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.290
 you quickly feel for that 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:57.080
 Distance for cutting pressure or something 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.700
 and zack that was done that was easy 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.060
 a good feeling to have a knife 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.740
 what sharp what was suitable, there went 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.240
 then work quite fast for it too 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.290
 moment where I am very grateful bach 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:13.700

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.120
 very typical especially 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:20.900
 of course the musical entertainment 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:24.170
 You see, you see , no costs 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:27.380
 here once a marching band hired 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:30.160
 for that to come together and do something like that 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.160
 I like for a woman 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:37.100
 I hope that was not too annoying 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.840
 Mucke otherwise I'm sorry and the 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.240

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.300
