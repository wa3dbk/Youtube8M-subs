00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.500
 a big scare in 1850 and what's important 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.300
 that is fine counting first how it was 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:18.250
 the blow and good as this situation 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:20.170
 the truth a regrettable overturn the 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.900
 situation is given how good we all come 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.850
 fighting a position to iu in the turn 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.410
 previous I pass it center and I come 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.960
 calculating what was coming faster I 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.880
 that all those who came forward of me and 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.120
 one the curve that the gap occurs I see 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.940
 that the cndh and is passed in braking is 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.280
 goes out and well I get together 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.409
 with the ideal turning radius that what 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.570
 is doing in the gap grows that the 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:46.210
 hunger gets in I put myself behind him and 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.339
 when I see that the index is coming 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.860
 I try to ride the piano so that 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:54.010
 so as not to go to shock or be shocked 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.040
 nothing preserving the car and not touching 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.960
 they go to me I see that they do not see me and good 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.909
 hit me on the wheel and when it gets worse 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.519
 roll I ride more to the piano still and 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.049
 there the car is locked and good all 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.270
 tumbos that we gave good luckily the 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.219
 safety of the car if it did not come the 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.000
 we would be counting on euros knocked down that 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:12.010
 gave the car 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.580
 all the security we had in the car 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.320
 and we really have to tell the 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.050
 team to my brother to gonzalo villanueva 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.360
 by competition team that 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.700
 they made a very safe car a cage not 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.500
 was not given was just and necessary to the 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.570
 approach for self-serving 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.290
 again if he did not give what he had to 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.630
 give in for how the car was designed and good 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.450
 all this person killed what is anchor 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.729
 that is all that is in place is not 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.460
 gave nothing at times only chaperÃ­o if 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.050
 what it had to be to not cause more 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.090
 damage you could talk to the cndh and the 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.640
 pita situation no no has not spoken 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.740
 the pitcher itself is not either 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.720
 he got up to see you ask but hey 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.530
 let's hope that at some point 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.780
 Think again and come back and ask again 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.660
 apologies for really I'm very 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.390
 hurt by the issue that is not done 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.990
 about one when you lose a job no no 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.729
 we want to collide again and it will be the 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.010
 spoke the category that before running 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.660
 that they were average the situation very 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.350
 very complicated on track after two 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.870
 months 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.850
 we all want to run but not in a 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.920
 lap was beginning race in a 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.840
 return to the regain positions 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.330
 Porfi nothing because it would stay 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.700
 we try to avoid the blow but good 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.930
 he noticed a lot on the track better the both 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.000
 time stopped by all situations 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.710
 that there was good what they said if the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.090
 true that it was not noticed much then 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.060
 elevation of the first batch of 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.490
 workouts already blurred shock to the 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.980
 second there was collision in the third in the 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.710
 classification already there were also shocks and 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.870
 that the lack of competition was noticed 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.680
 during all months two months and something 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.680
 that we were not running
