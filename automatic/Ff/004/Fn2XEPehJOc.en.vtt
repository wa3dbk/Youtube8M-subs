cons<00:01:14.079> straightaway<00:01:14.679> are<00:01:14.920> it's<00:01:15.189> obvious<00:01:16.439> one

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
cons straightaway are it's obvious one

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.349 
cons straightaway are it's obvious one
of<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.710> things<00:01:17.859> is<00:01:18.039> his<00:01:18.219> strength<00:01:18.429> now<00:01:18.820> he<00:01:18.880> is

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:19.359 
of the things is his strength now he is

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:21.690 
of the things is his strength now he is
easily<00:01:19.600> shrugged<00:01:20.079> off<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.409> ball<00:01:20.649> but<00:01:20.979> when

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
easily shrugged off the ball but when

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.099 
easily shrugged off the ball but when
he's<00:01:21.909> like<00:01:22.119> for<00:01:22.270> example<00:01:22.329> like<00:01:22.630> this<00:01:22.689> when

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
he's like for example like this when

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:24.690 
he's like for example like this when
he's<00:01:23.289> in<00:01:23.439> situations<00:01:23.920> where<00:01:24.039> he<00:01:24.100> has<00:01:24.249> space

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
he's in situations where he has space

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.209 
he's in situations where he has space
his<00:01:25.299> ninety<00:01:25.749> dribble<00:01:26.140> dribbling<00:01:26.799> combined

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.219 
his ninety dribble dribbling combined

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.789 
his ninety dribble dribbling combined
with<00:01:27.399> his<00:01:27.520> 84<00:01:28.149> pace<00:01:28.359> just<00:01:29.109> allows<00:01:29.530> him<00:01:29.770> to

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
with his 84 pace just allows him to

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.919 
with his 84 pace just allows him to
we've<00:01:30.249> passed<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.850> defenders<00:01:31.329> and<00:01:31.509> not<00:01:31.719> have

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
we've passed the defenders and not have

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:33.719 
we've passed the defenders and not have
the<00:01:32.049> issue<00:01:32.200> of<00:01:32.560> where<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.920> strength<00:01:33.249> comes<00:01:33.520> in

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
the issue of where the strength comes in

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.209 
the issue of where the strength comes in
because<00:01:34.359> he<00:01:35.109> just<00:01:35.289> he<00:01:35.469> just<00:01:35.499> starts<00:01:36.009> right

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
because he just he just starts right

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:37.620 
because he just he just starts right
through<00:01:36.399> them<00:01:36.579> but<00:01:36.670> now<00:01:36.789> like<00:01:37.119> this<00:01:37.359> in<00:01:37.569> a

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
through them but now like this in a

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.899 
through them but now like this in a
crowded<00:01:37.899> area<00:01:38.170> if<00:01:38.469> the<00:01:38.859> defender<00:01:39.280> gets<00:01:39.520> into<00:01:39.880> a

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
crowded area if the defender gets into a

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.389 
crowded area if the defender gets into a
moment<00:01:40.270> where<00:01:40.359> he<00:01:40.390> can<00:01:40.600> grab<00:01:40.810> onto<00:01:41.109> you<00:01:41.409> it<00:01:42.100> can

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
moment where he can grab onto you it can

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:43.889 
moment where he can grab onto you it can
be<00:01:42.579> a<00:01:42.609> free<00:01:42.850> kick<00:01:43.030> obviously<00:01:43.539> because<00:01:43.689> it's<00:01:43.840> a

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
be a free kick obviously because it's a

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.209 
be a free kick obviously because it's a
lot<00:01:44.020> easier<00:01:44.049> to<00:01:44.350> pull<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.619> player<00:01:44.799> down<00:01:45.009> now

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
lot easier to pull the player down now

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:47.609 
lot easier to pull the player down now
but<00:01:45.810> ninety<00:01:46.810> percent<00:01:46.929> of<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.229> time<00:01:47.409> he's

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
but ninety percent of the time he's

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:48.779 
but ninety percent of the time he's
gonna<00:01:47.710> lose<00:01:48.009> the<00:01:48.130> ball<00:01:48.280> he's<00:01:48.490> gonna<00:01:48.609> get

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
gonna lose the ball he's gonna get

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
was absolutely breathtaking I mean it

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.680

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
like 84 I don't understand and I really

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.700 
like 84 I don't understand and I really
don't<00:02:38.450> think<00:02:38.540> he's<00:02:38.840> gonna<00:02:38.990> drop<00:02:39.290> how<00:02:39.530> much

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
don't think he's gonna drop how much

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.620 
don't think he's gonna drop how much
because<00:02:40.100> I<00:02:40.280> used<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.760> think<00:02:40.910> that<00:02:41.030> legend

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
because I used to think that legend

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.480 
because I used to think that legend
rating<00:02:41.960> even<00:02:42.200> makes<00:02:42.380> a<00:02:42.470> difference<00:02:42.800> but<00:02:42.980> he

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
rating even makes a difference but he

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.340 
rating even makes a difference but he
plays<00:02:43.790> like<00:02:43.970> he's<00:02:44.150> 90<00:02:44.600> something<00:02:44.810> rated<00:02:45.260> I

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
plays like he's 90 something rated I

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.260 
plays like he's 90 something rated I
don't<00:02:45.530> see<00:02:45.680> why<00:02:45.860> he<00:02:45.890> would<00:02:46.070> drop<00:02:46.430> five<00:02:47.030> star

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
don't see why he would drop five star

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.000 
don't see why he would drop five star
skills<00:02:47.600> as<00:02:47.780> well<00:02:47.960> I<00:02:48.230> mean<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.740> only<00:02:48.800> thing<00:02:48.890> I

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.380 
skills as well I mean the only thing I
can<00:02:49.100> think<00:02:49.160> of<00:02:49.400> is<00:02:49.490> his<00:02:49.610> nationality<00:02:50.030> in<00:02:50.300> the

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
can think of is his nationality in the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.080 
can think of is his nationality in the
sense<00:02:50.600> that<00:02:50.660> is<00:02:50.810> hard<00:02:51.020> to<00:02:51.110> make<00:02:51.350> a<00:02:51.530> good<00:02:52.250> team

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
sense that is hard to make a good team

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
which is a really prom and the fact may

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.960 
which is a really prom and the fact may
be<00:03:33.350> that<00:03:33.590> it's<00:03:34.040> really<00:03:34.160> hard<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.550> build<00:03:34.670> a<00:03:34.820> team

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
be that it's really hard to build a team

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.250 
be that it's really hard to build a team
around<00:03:35.000> them<00:03:35.330> unless<00:03:35.570> you<00:03:35.720> have<00:03:35.870> a<00:03:35.900> team<00:03:36.230> of

around them unless you have a team of
Legends<00:03:36.709> that's<00:03:36.950> probably<00:03:37.280> why<00:03:37.430> I<00:03:37.459> given

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
Legends that's probably why I given

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.290

seven<00:03:38.540> point<00:03:38.870> five<00:03:39.050> out<00:03:39.290> of<00:03:39.320> ten<00:03:39.590> maybe<00:03:39.830> but

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
seven point five out of ten maybe but

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.940 
seven point five out of ten maybe but
still<00:03:41.300> a<00:03:41.510> really<00:03:41.959> fun<00:03:42.110> player<00:03:42.350> to<00:03:42.530> use<00:03:42.680> five
