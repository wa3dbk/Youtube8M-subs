do I'm going to take this little it's
called<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.350> shape<00:00:19.650> tool<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.070> I'm<00:00:20.460> gonna<00:00:20.550> click

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
called a shape tool and I'm gonna click

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.920 
called a shape tool and I'm gonna click
on<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:22.109> click<00:00:23.000> double-click<00:00:24.000> using

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
on that and I click double-click using

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.189 
on that and I click double-click using
that<00:00:25.140> tool<00:00:25.439> these<00:00:26.369> are<00:00:26.609> called<00:00:26.880> nodes<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.900> all

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
that tool these are called nodes and all

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.240 
that tool these are called nodes and all
my<00:00:28.439> nodes<00:00:28.830> will<00:00:29.519> come<00:00:29.820> up<00:00:30.119> how<00:00:30.859> and<00:00:31.859> those<00:00:32.130> are

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
my nodes will come up how and those are

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.670 
my nodes will come up how and those are
what<00:00:32.369> I'm<00:00:32.460> going<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.669> use<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.030> edit<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:34.290> I

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
what I'm going to use to edit and I

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.590 
what I'm going to use to edit and I
think<00:00:35.040> it's<00:00:35.219> best<00:00:35.550> maybe<00:00:35.730> if<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.120> just<00:00:36.270> watch

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
think it's best maybe if you just watch

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.900 
think it's best maybe if you just watch
me<00:00:36.989> I'm<00:00:37.230> not<00:00:37.410> sure<00:00:37.739> about<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.160> terminology<00:00:38.610> a

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
me I'm not sure about the terminology a

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.090 
me I'm not sure about the terminology a
lot<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.510> stuff<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.989> just<00:00:40.020> tend<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.710> do<00:00:40.920> it

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
lot of this stuff I just tend to do it

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.369 
lot of this stuff I just tend to do it
so<00:00:41.940> see<00:00:42.180> what<00:00:42.300> happens<00:00:42.600> when<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.750> pull<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.200> node

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
so see what happens when I pull the node

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.440 
so see what happens when I pull the node
this<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.739> actually<00:00:44.190> where<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.730> started<00:00:45.239> that's

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
this is actually where it started that's

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.080 
this is actually where it started that's
the<00:00:45.629> start<00:00:45.930> point<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.649> I'm<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.370> gonna<00:00:47.820> pull

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
the start point and I'm just gonna pull

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.299 
the start point and I'm just gonna pull
the<00:00:48.270> nodes<00:00:48.710> into<00:00:49.710> place

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the nodes into place

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.360 
the nodes into place
remember<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.180> was<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> hand-drawn<00:00:52.170> design<00:00:52.920> so

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
remember this was a hand-drawn design so

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.360 
remember this was a hand-drawn design so
it<00:00:53.610> does<00:00:53.820> not<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.600> be<00:00:54.750> perfect<00:00:55.370> perfectly

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
it does not have to be perfect perfectly

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.369 
it does not have to be perfect perfectly
on<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.820> line<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.329> just<00:00:57.570> want<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.840> get<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.109> shape

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
on the line I just want to get the shape

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.150 
on the line I just want to get the shape
and<00:00:59.300> this<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.480> cut<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:01.020> these<00:01:01.440> are<00:01:01.620> actually

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
and this is cut this these are actually

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.560 
and this is cut this these are actually
when<00:01:02.309> it's<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.579> polyline<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.300> I'm<00:01:03.390> going

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
when it's in a polyline and I'm going

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.119 
when it's in a polyline and I'm going
around<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.840> curve<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.290> actually<00:01:04.710> made<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:04.949> a

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
around a curve it actually made it a

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.399 
around a curve it actually made it a
curve<00:01:05.460> by<00:01:05.790> itself<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.630> order<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.170> edit

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
curve by itself and in order to edit

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.800 
curve by itself and in order to edit
those<00:01:07.710> curves<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.369> just<00:01:08.850> pull<00:01:09.060> out<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> handles

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
those curves I just pull out the handles

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.219 
those curves I just pull out the handles
here's<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.500> node<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.659> can<00:01:12.840> just<00:01:12.990> pull<00:01:13.200> out

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
here's the node and I can just pull out

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.080 
here's the node and I can just pull out
these<00:01:13.560> handles<00:01:14.159> let<00:01:14.430> me<00:01:14.490> go<00:01:14.610> ahead<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.850> click

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
these handles let me go ahead and click

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.999 
these handles let me go ahead and click
that<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.479> can<00:01:15.750> pull<00:01:15.930> out<00:01:15.960> these<00:01:16.350> handles<00:01:16.920> to

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
that I can pull out these handles to

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.289 
that I can pull out these handles to
where<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.700> want<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.210> edit<00:01:18.920> edit<00:01:19.920> them<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.759> can

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
it kind of takes on a rounded effect

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.420 
it kind of takes on a rounded effect
there<00:01:42.270> I'm<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:43.049> zoomed<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.439> up<00:01:43.530> for<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.950> it

takes on a rounded effect and in order

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.969 
takes on a rounded effect and in order
to<00:01:47.399> get<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.329> be<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.509> nice<00:01:48.780> sharp<00:01:49.229> corner<00:01:49.799> I

to get that to be a nice sharp corner I

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.030 
to get that to be a nice sharp corner I
will<00:01:50.520> right<00:01:50.880> click<00:01:50.909> it

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
will right click it

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.520 
will right click it
and<00:01:52.130> I<00:01:52.520> will<00:01:52.820> make<00:01:53.000> it<00:01:53.180> a<00:01:53.270> cusp<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:54.050> what<00:01:54.500> a

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
and I will make it a cusp and what a

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.030 
and I will make it a cusp and what a
cuffs<00:01:54.860> cusp<00:01:55.850> does<00:01:56.360> is<00:01:56.810> watch<00:01:57.680> what<00:01:57.920> it<00:01:58.010> does

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
cuffs cusp does is watch what it does

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.830 
cuffs cusp does is watch what it does
now<00:01:58.370> when<00:01:58.580> I<00:01:58.610> take<00:01:58.850> the<00:01:58.970> handles<00:01:59.390> it's<00:01:59.630> going

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
now when I take the handles it's going

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.220 
now when I take the handles it's going
to<00:01:59.900> sharpen<00:02:00.290> it<00:02:00.560> out<00:02:00.910> instead<00:02:01.910> of<00:02:02.090> making<00:02:02.900> that

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
to sharpen it out instead of making that

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.010 
to sharpen it out instead of making that
a<00:02:03.260> curve<00:02:03.740> it<00:02:04.220> actually<00:02:04.760> stops<00:02:05.270> it<00:02:05.540> at<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.780> node

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
a curve it actually stops it at the node

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.550 
a curve it actually stops it at the node
and<00:02:06.500> it<00:02:07.340> really<00:02:07.610> you<00:02:08.000> know<00:02:08.750> I'm<00:02:08.899> able<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.229> make

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
and it really you know I'm able to make

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.460 
and it really you know I'm able to make
a<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.950> nice<00:02:10.369> sharp<00:02:10.670> point<00:02:10.940> there<00:02:11.270> now<00:02:11.930> if<00:02:12.170> I<00:02:12.290> want

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
a a nice sharp point there now if I want

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.520 
a a nice sharp point there now if I want
to<00:02:12.500> go<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:12.970> do<00:02:13.970> some<00:02:14.330> of<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.750> curves<00:02:15.020> this

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
to go and do some of the curves this

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.590 
to go and do some of the curves this
like<00:02:15.860> look<00:02:16.100> this<00:02:16.340> node<00:02:16.640> is<00:02:16.910> a<00:02:16.940> curve<00:02:17.300> and

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
like look this node is a curve and

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.570 
like look this node is a curve and
sometimes<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:18.050> grab<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.710> handles<00:02:19.100> instead<00:02:19.250> of

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
sometimes I grab the handles instead of

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.030 
sometimes I grab the handles instead of
the<00:02:19.700> node<00:02:19.880> let<00:02:20.510> me<00:02:20.630> zoom<00:02:21.050> this<00:02:21.230> back<00:02:21.500> down<00:02:21.770> I

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
the node let me zoom this back down I

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.580 
the node let me zoom this back down I
want<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.640> bring<00:02:22.790> this<00:02:23.030> down<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.780> get<00:02:24.110> on<00:02:24.320> my

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
want to bring this down to get on my

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.170 
want to bring this down to get on my
line<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:24.830> little<00:02:25.100> bit<00:02:25.220> better<00:02:25.490> but<00:02:25.820> then<00:02:25.940> I<00:02:26.000> want

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
line a little bit better but then I want

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.300 
line a little bit better but then I want
to<00:02:26.240> curve<00:02:26.450> this<00:02:26.660> around<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:27.380> it<00:02:27.500> fits<00:02:27.830> and

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
to curve this around so it fits and

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.900 
to curve this around so it fits and
actually<00:02:29.200> what<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.230> just<00:02:30.500> did<00:02:30.710> there<00:02:30.770> that<00:02:31.760> was

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
actually what I just did there that was

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.790 
actually what I just did there that was
pretty<00:02:32.120> easy<00:02:32.210> I<00:02:32.540> just<00:02:32.690> kind<00:02:33.110> of<00:02:33.200> shaped<00:02:33.530> that

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
pretty easy I just kind of shaped that

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.910 
pretty easy I just kind of shaped that
around<00:02:34.160> without<00:02:34.610> even<00:02:34.880> trying<00:02:35.210> ah<00:02:35.740> let's<00:02:36.740> see

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
around without even trying ah let's see

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.800 
around without even trying ah let's see
some<00:02:37.640> of<00:02:37.760> these<00:02:37.850> if<00:02:38.150> you'll<00:02:38.300> notice<00:02:38.660> now

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
some of these if you'll notice now

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.110 
some of these if you'll notice now
here's<00:02:39.110> here's<00:02:39.830> how<00:02:40.010> this<00:02:40.160> line<00:02:40.430> followed<00:02:41.000> I

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
here's here's how this line followed I

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.270 
here's here's how this line followed I
believe<00:02:41.390> this<00:02:41.570> is<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.870> same<00:02:42.110> line<00:02:42.410> if<00:02:42.860> I

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
believe this is the same line if I

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.310 
believe this is the same line if I
double-click<00:02:43.730> on<00:02:44.120> that<00:02:44.180> line<00:02:44.570> if<00:02:44.810> I<00:02:44.930> don't<00:02:45.140> see

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
double-click on that line if I don't see

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.140 
double-click on that line if I don't see
a<00:02:45.350> note<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:45.920> double-click<00:02:46.430> on<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.670> line<00:02:46.850> I

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
a note and double-click on the line I

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.870 
a note and double-click on the line I
can<00:02:47.540> actually<00:02:47.750> add<00:02:48.110> another<00:02:48.370> another<00:02:49.370> node<00:02:49.670> to

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
can actually add another another node to

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.640 
can actually add another another node to
edit<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.480> that's<00:02:50.750> exactly<00:02:51.020> what<00:02:51.350> I<00:02:51.410> want<00:02:51.560> to

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
edit and that's exactly what I want to

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.890 
edit and that's exactly what I want to
do<00:02:51.800> here<00:02:52.100> and<00:02:52.280> so<00:02:52.459> see<00:02:52.700> I'm<00:02:52.850> just<00:02:52.880> adding<00:02:53.570> them

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
do here and so see I'm just adding them

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.690 
do here and so see I'm just adding them
and<00:02:54.020> pulling<00:02:54.380> in<00:02:54.500> those<00:02:54.680> lines<00:02:54.980> until<00:02:55.580> they're

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
and pulling in those lines until they're

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.870 
and pulling in those lines until they're
on<00:02:55.820> top<00:02:56.060> of<00:02:56.180> each<00:02:56.330> other<00:02:57.400> you'll<00:02:58.400> get<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:58.700> hang

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
on top of each other you'll get the hang

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.540 
on top of each other you'll get the hang
of<00:02:59.030> this<00:02:59.180> once<00:02:59.620> once<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:00.739> actually<00:03:01.010> do<00:03:01.430> it

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
of this once once you actually do it

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.540 
of this once once you actually do it
yourself<00:03:02.090> I<00:03:02.209> know<00:03:02.270> it's<00:03:02.570> looking<00:03:02.720> kind<00:03:03.170> of

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
yourself I know it's looking kind of

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.010 
yourself I know it's looking kind of
confusing<00:03:04.550> right<00:03:04.700> now<00:03:04.760> okay<00:03:05.600> I<00:03:05.630> want<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:05.930> show

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
confusing right now okay I want to show

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.690 
confusing right now okay I want to show
you<00:03:06.080> this<00:03:06.200> area<00:03:06.380> right<00:03:06.620> now<00:03:06.800> here<00:03:07.370> I'm<00:03:07.519> at

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
you this area right now here I'm at

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.460 
you this area right now here I'm at
another<00:03:07.910> point<00:03:08.239> I<00:03:08.480> want<00:03:08.720> that<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:09.019> be<00:03:09.140> sharp

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
another point I want that to be sharp

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.160 
another point I want that to be sharp
and<00:03:09.800> if<00:03:10.370> I<00:03:10.489> left<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:10.910> at<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.030> curve<00:03:11.420> see<00:03:12.019> what

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
and if I left it at the curve see what

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.170 
and if I left it at the curve see what
it's<00:03:12.350> making<00:03:12.709> a<00:03:12.769> curve<00:03:13.070> but<00:03:13.430> if<00:03:13.550> I<00:03:13.640> blow<00:03:13.880> it<00:03:13.910> up

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
it's making a curve but if I blow it up

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.790 
it's making a curve but if I blow it up
it's<00:03:14.420> just<00:03:14.540> not<00:03:14.870> as<00:03:15.050> sharp<00:03:15.320> as<00:03:15.470> it<00:03:15.530> would<00:03:15.769> be

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
it's just not as sharp as it would be

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.380 
it's just not as sharp as it would be
and<00:03:16.070> actually<00:03:16.459> when<00:03:16.580> it<00:03:16.700> stitches<00:03:16.940> out<00:03:17.239> it

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
and actually when it stitches out it

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.020 
and actually when it stitches out it
will<00:03:17.540> it<00:03:18.320> won't<00:03:18.560> be<00:03:18.739> a<00:03:18.769> really<00:03:19.100> sharp<00:03:19.370> point<00:03:19.730> so

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
will it won't be a really sharp point so

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.470 
will it won't be a really sharp point so
I<00:03:20.060> like<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.660> go<00:03:21.410> ahead<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:22.010> take<00:03:22.310> that<00:03:22.480> I'm

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
I like to go ahead and take that I'm

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.390 
I like to go ahead and take that I'm
sorry<00:03:23.750> I'm<00:03:23.959> all<00:03:24.170> over<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.470> place<00:03:24.680> here<00:03:24.950> and

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
sorry I'm all over the place here and

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.030 
sorry I'm all over the place here and
I'm<00:03:25.519> going<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:26.080> right-click<00:03:27.080> that<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:27.920> I'm

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
I'm going to right-click that and I'm

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.890 
I'm going to right-click that and I'm
going<00:03:28.160> to<00:03:28.250> make<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.489> a<00:03:28.550> cusp<00:03:28.820> and<00:03:29.180> this<00:03:29.630> way<00:03:29.870> I

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
going to make it a cusp and this way I

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.810 
going to make it a cusp and this way I
can<00:03:30.260> really<00:03:30.470> sharpen<00:03:31.100> that<00:03:31.280> out<00:03:31.459> I'll<00:03:31.640> bring

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
can really sharpen that out I'll bring

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.430 
can really sharpen that out I'll bring
out<00:03:32.000> those<00:03:32.180> handles<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:32.870> make<00:03:33.050> sure<00:03:33.290> that

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
out those handles to make sure that

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.660 
out those handles to make sure that
they're<00:03:33.590> really<00:03:33.709> sure<00:03:33.980> but<00:03:34.160> now<00:03:34.250> it<00:03:34.310> gives<00:03:34.489> me

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
they're really sure but now it gives me

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.009 
they're really sure but now it gives me
a<00:03:34.700> little<00:03:34.910> bit<00:03:35.030> more<00:03:35.769> freedom<00:03:36.769> to<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:38.510> shape<00:03:38.810> it

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
a little bit more freedom to to shape it

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.420 
a little bit more freedom to to shape it
up<00:03:39.110> a<00:03:39.230> little<00:03:39.410> bit

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
up a little bit

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.250 
up a little bit
so<00:03:41.549> I'm<00:03:41.670> just<00:03:41.849> gonna<00:03:42.000> go<00:03:42.209> ahead<00:03:42.329> and<00:03:42.780> edit<00:03:42.959> and

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
so I'm just gonna go ahead and edit and

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.130 
so I'm just gonna go ahead and edit and
you<00:03:43.319> can<00:03:43.500> watch<00:03:43.739> as<00:03:44.129> I<00:03:44.370> do<00:03:44.430> this<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:45.810> what<00:03:46.019> I'm

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
you can watch as I do this and what I'm

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.750 
you can watch as I do this and what I'm
doing<00:03:46.590> sometimes<00:03:47.099> there's<00:03:47.340> no<00:03:47.489> rhyme<00:03:47.730> or

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
doing sometimes there's no rhyme or

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.720 
doing sometimes there's no rhyme or
reason<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.239> what<00:03:48.390> I'm<00:03:48.540> doing<00:03:48.569> but<00:03:49.430> it<00:03:50.430> seems

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
reason to what I'm doing but it seems

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.720 
reason to what I'm doing but it seems
sometimes<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.599> I<00:03:52.290> learned<00:03:53.159> better<00:03:53.400> by<00:03:53.579> watching

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
sometimes I I learned better by watching

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.699 
sometimes I I learned better by watching
somebody<00:03:54.450> so<00:03:54.689> I'm<00:03:54.810> hoping<00:03:55.079> this<00:03:55.230> video<00:03:55.409> at

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
somebody so I'm hoping this video at

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.089 
somebody so I'm hoping this video at
least<00:03:56.659> helps<00:03:57.659> you<00:03:58.109> know<00:03:58.200> some<00:03:58.439> of<00:03:58.560> some<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:59.040> the

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
least helps you know some of some of the

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:05.690 
least helps you know some of some of the
visual<00:03:59.489> learners<00:03:59.670> out<00:04:00.030> there<00:04:04.280> of<00:04:05.280> course<00:04:05.489> this

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
visual learners out there of course this

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.910 
visual learners out there of course this
video<00:04:06.060> would<00:04:06.209> be<00:04:06.239> very<00:04:06.629> long<00:04:06.870> if<00:04:07.200> I<00:04:08.420> continued

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
video would be very long if I continued

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.259 
video would be very long if I continued
recording<00:04:10.920> while<00:04:11.519> I'm<00:04:11.700> doing<00:04:11.970> this<00:04:12.060> whole

zooming in and out trying to bring bring
the<00:04:26.190> lines<00:04:26.400> just<00:04:26.970> bring<00:04:27.240> them<00:04:27.360> on<00:04:27.449> top<00:04:27.630> of<00:04:27.690> each

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
the lines just bring them on top of each

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.170 
the lines just bring them on top of each
other<00:04:28.199> you<00:04:28.470> know<00:04:28.979> this<00:04:29.250> is<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.550> tedious<00:04:29.789> part

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
other you know this is the tedious part

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.909 
other you know this is the tedious part
some<00:04:30.479> people<00:04:30.720> think<00:04:31.380> that<00:04:31.410> this<00:04:31.620> is<00:04:31.680> the

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
some people think that this is the

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.180 
some people think that this is the
tedious<00:04:32.250> part<00:04:32.460> of<00:04:32.669> digitizing<00:04:33.180> and<00:04:34.070> you<00:04:35.070> know

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
tedious part of digitizing and you know

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.450 
tedious part of digitizing and you know
once<00:04:35.400> you<00:04:35.550> start<00:04:35.580> doing<00:04:36.210> it<00:04:37.010> you<00:04:38.010> know<00:04:38.099> it<00:04:38.310> gets

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
once you start doing it you know it gets

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.219 
once you start doing it you know it gets
easier<00:04:38.910> at<00:04:39.240> first<00:04:39.570> it's<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:39.930> little<00:04:39.960> bit

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
easier at first it's a little bit

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.170 
easier at first it's a little bit
awkward<00:04:40.620> but<00:04:40.800> oh<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.610> more<00:04:41.789> you<00:04:41.880> do<00:04:42.030> it<00:04:42.060> the

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
awkward but oh the more you do it the

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.730 
awkward but oh the more you do it the
more<00:04:42.509> you<00:04:42.750> know<00:04:43.320> you're<00:04:43.470> gonna<00:04:43.560> get

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
more you know you're gonna get

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.560 
more you know you're gonna get
comfortable<00:04:44.130> with<00:04:44.340> it<00:04:44.490> I<00:04:44.669> want<00:04:45.210> to<00:04:45.240> point<00:04:45.389> out

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
comfortable with it I want to point out

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.180 
comfortable with it I want to point out
something<00:04:45.810> right<00:04:46.050> here<00:04:46.289> see<00:04:46.560> how<00:04:46.710> that<00:04:46.949> really

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
something right here see how that really

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.610 
something right here see how that really
isn't<00:04:47.490> on<00:04:47.760> my<00:04:47.880> trace<00:04:48.120> line<00:04:48.389> at<00:04:48.599> all<00:04:48.720> you<00:04:49.470> know<00:04:49.590> I

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
isn't on my trace line at all you know I

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.100 
isn't on my trace line at all you know I
really<00:04:50.190> don't<00:04:50.370> care<00:04:50.460> um<00:04:51.000> maybe<00:04:51.690> I<00:04:51.810> want<00:04:52.050> to

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
really don't care um maybe I want to

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.409 
really don't care um maybe I want to
make<00:04:52.260> it<00:04:52.380> a<00:04:52.410> little<00:04:52.740> bit<00:04:52.919> longer<00:04:53.190> but<00:04:53.760> here

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
make it a little bit longer but here

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.159 
make it a little bit longer but here
again<00:04:54.539> I<00:04:54.930> drew<00:04:55.229> that<00:04:55.260> out<00:04:55.500> and<00:04:56.180> I<00:04:57.180> may<00:04:57.960> want<00:04:58.139> to

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
again I drew that out and I may want to

00:04:58.169 --> 00:04:59.839 
again I drew that out and I may want to
put<00:04:58.349> a<00:04:58.380> little<00:04:58.590> curve<00:04:58.860> you<00:04:59.250> know<00:04:59.340> a<00:04:59.370> couple<00:04:59.729> of

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
put a little curve you know a couple of

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:01.969 
put a little curve you know a couple of
curves<00:05:00.090> in<00:05:00.360> that<00:05:00.570> but<00:05:01.139> I<00:05:01.169> drew<00:05:01.470> that<00:05:01.500> out<00:05:01.830> to

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
curves in that but I drew that out to

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.830 
curves in that but I drew that out to
begin<00:05:02.099> with<00:05:02.250> and<00:05:02.639> it<00:05:02.849> wasn't<00:05:03.090> perfect<00:05:03.630> so<00:05:03.690> I'm

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
begin with and it wasn't perfect so I'm

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.480 
begin with and it wasn't perfect so I'm
not<00:05:04.050> I'm<00:05:04.320> not<00:05:04.560> too<00:05:04.710> concerned<00:05:04.889> about<00:05:05.159> it<00:05:05.370> being

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
not I'm not too concerned about it being

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.490 
not I'm not too concerned about it being
on<00:05:05.610> the<00:05:05.729> line<00:05:05.880> where<00:05:06.570> I<00:05:06.599> do<00:05:06.720> want<00:05:07.080> it<00:05:07.199> to<00:05:07.229> be<00:05:07.320> on

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
on the line where I do want it to be on

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.110 
on the line where I do want it to be on
the<00:05:07.620> line<00:05:07.770> is<00:05:08.039> on<00:05:08.220> my<00:05:08.370> feathers<00:05:08.729> I'm<00:05:08.940> real

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
the line is on my feathers I'm real

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.300 
the line is on my feathers I'm real
particular<00:05:09.389> about<00:05:09.630> my<00:05:09.780> feathers<00:05:10.199> I<00:05:10.380> usually<00:05:11.280> I

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
particular about my feathers I usually I

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.310 
particular about my feathers I usually I
take<00:05:11.520> a<00:05:11.580> lot<00:05:11.849> more<00:05:11.880> time<00:05:12.300> drawing<00:05:12.780> those<00:05:13.080> out

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
take a lot more time drawing those out

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.980 
take a lot more time drawing those out
so<00:05:13.380> that<00:05:13.979> when<00:05:14.130> it<00:05:14.610> makes<00:05:14.820> it<00:05:15.000> easier<00:05:15.389> when<00:05:15.659> I'm

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
so that when it makes it easier when I'm

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.310 
so that when it makes it easier when I'm
editing<00:05:16.740> so<00:05:17.430> that<00:05:17.580> I<00:05:17.610> can<00:05:17.789> find<00:05:18.090> that<00:05:18.330> line<00:05:18.599> to

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
editing so that I can find that line to

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.250 
editing so that I can find that line to
do<00:05:19.470> I'm<00:05:19.650> here<00:05:19.860> again<00:05:20.099> we've<00:05:20.250> got<00:05:20.900> some<00:05:21.900> areas

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
do I'm here again we've got some areas

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.930 
do I'm here again we've got some areas
that<00:05:22.530> we're<00:05:22.949> just<00:05:23.070> gonna<00:05:23.280> kind

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
that we're just gonna kind

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:30.090 
that we're just gonna kind
shape<00:05:24.940> around<00:05:27.930> and<00:05:28.930> this<00:05:29.200> really<00:05:29.560> looks<00:05:29.830> bad<00:05:30.040> I

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
shape around and this really looks bad I

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.950 
shape around and this really looks bad I
told<00:05:30.490> you<00:05:30.640> this<00:05:30.760> really<00:05:31.090> looked<00:05:31.270> bad<00:05:31.480> to<00:05:31.660> begin

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
told you this really looked bad to begin

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:39.900 
told you this really looked bad to begin
with<00:05:32.580> but<00:05:34.680> it<00:05:35.680> will<00:05:38.100> turn<00:05:39.100> out<00:05:39.190> now<00:05:39.580> if<00:05:39.730> you're

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
with but it will turn out now if you're

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.150 
with but it will turn out now if you're
really<00:05:40.090> good<00:05:40.510> at<00:05:40.750> tracing<00:05:41.350> from<00:05:41.830> the<00:05:41.980> get-go

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
really good at tracing from the get-go

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.250 
really good at tracing from the get-go
if<00:05:42.670> you're<00:05:42.970> really<00:05:43.210> good<00:05:43.450> with<00:05:43.480> your<00:05:43.720> mouse<00:05:43.960> or

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
if you're really good with your mouse or

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.200 
if you're really good with your mouse or
your<00:05:44.320> pen<00:05:44.590> or<00:05:44.800> whatever<00:05:45.130> you<00:05:45.640> won't<00:05:45.820> have<00:05:46.000> as

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
your pen or whatever you won't have as

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.440 
your pen or whatever you won't have as
much<00:05:46.360> editing<00:05:46.870> to<00:05:47.050> do<00:05:47.490> but<00:05:48.490> sometimes<00:05:49.060> it

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
much editing to do but sometimes it

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.270 
much editing to do but sometimes it
takes<00:05:49.480> a<00:05:49.750> while<00:05:49.780> to<00:05:49.960> get<00:05:50.290> to<00:05:50.470> that<00:05:50.590> point<00:05:50.830> so<00:05:51.250> I

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
takes a while to get to that point so I

00:05:51.280 --> 00:06:00.469 
takes a while to get to that point so I
think<00:05:51.550> it's<00:05:51.820> important<00:05:52.270> to<00:05:52.360> show<00:05:52.570> people

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.179 

and<00:06:00.809> I'm<00:06:01.050> gonna<00:06:01.199> go<00:06:01.409> ahead<00:06:01.499> and<00:06:01.680> stop<00:06:02.039> this

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:02.189 
and I'm gonna go ahead and stop this

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:05.540 
and I'm gonna go ahead and stop this
video<00:06:02.400> now<00:06:02.580> and<00:06:02.729> trace<00:06:03.360> a<00:06:03.389> little<00:06:03.719> bit<00:06:03.870> more<00:06:04.550> or

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
video now and trace a little bit more or
