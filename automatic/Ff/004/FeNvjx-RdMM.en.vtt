me $75 so at that time I didn't realize
that<00:01:28.140> my<00:01:28.610> heating<00:01:29.610> coil<00:01:29.880> had<00:01:30.090> burned<00:01:30.299> out<00:01:30.479> I've

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
that my heating coil had burned out I've

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.090 
that my heating coil had burned out I've
cinched<00:01:30.990> troubleshooted<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.740> because<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:31.979> was

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
cinched troubleshooted it because I was

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.170 
cinched troubleshooted it because I was
really<00:01:32.280> trying<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.610> see<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.850> know<00:01:32.970> what's

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
really trying to see you know what's

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.490 
really trying to see you know what's
going<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.479> with<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.750> thing<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.110> can<00:01:34.170> figure

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
going on with this thing if I can figure

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.530 
going on with this thing if I can figure
it<00:01:34.650> out<00:01:34.740> myself<00:01:34.950> if<00:01:35.700> that's<00:01:36.000> gonna<00:01:36.150> make<00:01:36.240> any

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
it out myself if that's gonna make any

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.039 
it out myself if that's gonna make any
difference

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
difference

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.810 
difference
so<00:01:37.530> I've<00:01:37.650> realized<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.220> what<00:01:38.369> happened<00:01:38.729> is

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
so I've realized that what happened is

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.249 
so I've realized that what happened is
the<00:01:38.939> heating<00:01:39.210> coil<00:01:39.450> burned<00:01:39.720> out<00:01:41.450> so<00:01:42.450> with<00:01:43.110> that

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
the heating coil burned out so with that

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.859 
the heating coil burned out so with that
being<00:01:43.439> said<00:01:44.090> it's<00:01:45.090> not<00:01:45.329> gonna<00:01:45.420> be<00:01:45.630> worthwhile

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
being said it's not gonna be worthwhile

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.859 
being said it's not gonna be worthwhile
for<00:01:46.079> me<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.560> incur<00:01:47.490> shipping<00:01:47.939> costs<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.540> pay

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
for me to incur shipping costs and pay

there<00:02:04.950> was<00:02:05.040> any<00:02:05.159> tax<00:02:05.460> for<00:02:05.670> me<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.930> would<00:02:07.049> be

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
there was any tax for me so it would be

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.389 
there was any tax for me so it would be
really<00:02:07.350> cheaper<00:02:07.740> for<00:02:07.890> me<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.250> buy

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
really cheaper for me just to buy

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.760 
really cheaper for me just to buy
another<00:02:08.670> unit<00:02:09.149> they<00:02:09.840> also<00:02:10.020> have<00:02:10.289> another<00:02:10.530> unit

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770

that's<00:02:11.039> like<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.690> level<00:02:12.690> up<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.319> think

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
that's like a level up and I think

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.490 
that's like a level up and I think
it's<00:02:13.739> 139<00:02:14.400> on<00:02:14.580> their<00:02:14.730> website<00:02:15.379> but<00:02:17.959> I'm<00:02:18.959> also

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
it's 139 on their website but I'm also

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.259 
it's 139 on their website but I'm also
looking<00:02:19.769> into<00:02:20.250> some<00:02:20.459> other<00:02:20.640> units<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.209> I

found<00:02:21.569> online<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:22.170> are<00:02:22.200> cheaper<00:02:22.709> I<00:02:22.739> found

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
found online that are cheaper I found

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.149 
found online that are cheaper I found
two<00:02:23.400> units<00:02:23.790> one<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.470> $69<00:02:25.470> roughly<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.010> other

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
two units one is $69 roughly the other

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.070 
two units one is $69 roughly the other
one<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.370> like<00:02:26.489> $75<00:02:27.420> from<00:02:27.569> another<00:02:27.840> supplier

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
one is like $75 from another supplier

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.949 
one is like $75 from another supplier

my<00:03:33.389> unit<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:34.769> was<00:03:34.919> one<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.370> few<00:03:35.609> that<00:03:35.819> did

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
my unit it was one of the few that did

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.379 
my unit it was one of the few that did
not<00:03:36.150> require<00:03:36.389> deionized<00:03:37.290> water<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:38.239> it<00:03:39.239> was

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
not require deionized water and it was

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.170 
not require deionized water and it was
cheaper<00:03:39.900> than<00:03:39.930> most<00:03:40.410> and<00:03:40.859> that's<00:03:41.609> the<00:03:41.910> reason

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
cheaper than most and that's the reason

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.150 
cheaper than most and that's the reason
why<00:03:42.269> I<00:03:42.299> selected<00:03:43.199> this<00:03:43.379> one

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
why I selected this one

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.949 
why I selected this one
another<00:03:44.879> thing<00:03:45.150> I've<00:03:45.329> since<00:03:45.599> learned<00:03:45.690> is<00:03:45.930> that

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
another thing I've since learned is that

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.599 
another thing I've since learned is that
there<00:03:46.230> now<00:03:46.440> some<00:03:46.680> units<00:03:46.949> they<00:03:47.040> have<00:03:47.190> a<00:03:47.370> dual

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
there now some units they have a dual

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.210 
there now some units they have a dual
setting<00:03:48.239> whereas<00:03:49.019> it<00:03:49.169> has<00:03:49.379> a<00:03:49.410> lower<00:03:49.739> steam

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
setting whereas it has a lower steam

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.920 
setting whereas it has a lower steam
setting<00:03:50.669> and<00:03:50.790> then<00:03:50.879> a<00:03:50.910> higher<00:03:51.180> steam<00:03:51.569> setting

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
setting and then a higher steam setting

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.270 
setting and then a higher steam setting
that<00:03:52.049> you<00:03:52.199> can<00:03:52.230> add<00:03:52.530> on<00:03:52.650> if<00:03:52.769> you<00:03:52.889> want<00:03:53.099> more

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
that you can add on if you want more

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.640 
that you can add on if you want more
intense<00:03:53.669> steam<00:03:54.030> this<00:03:54.599> unit<00:03:54.959> at<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:55.109> time<00:03:55.410> only

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
intense steam this unit at the time only

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.500 
intense steam this unit at the time only
had<00:03:55.919> a<00:03:55.949> single<00:03:56.340> setting<00:03:56.730> so<00:03:56.910> whatever<00:03:57.209> steam

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
had a single setting so whatever steam

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.140 
had a single setting so whatever steam
you<00:03:57.660> got<00:03:57.840> you<00:03:58.109> got<00:03:58.319> it<00:03:59.220> did<00:03:59.459> have<00:03:59.730> this

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
you got you got it did have this

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.920 
you got you got it did have this
adjustable<00:04:01.139> little<00:04:01.609> vent<00:04:02.609> on<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.060> hood<00:04:03.690> so

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
adjustable little vent on the hood so

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.360 
adjustable little vent on the hood so
you<00:04:04.019> could<00:04:04.169> kind<00:04:04.349> of<00:04:04.410> let<00:04:04.620> some<00:04:04.829> of<00:04:04.949> the<00:04:05.010> excess

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
you could kind of let some of the excess

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.550 
you could kind of let some of the excess
steam<00:04:05.609> out<00:04:05.849> but<00:04:06.150> pretty<00:04:06.959> much<00:04:07.019> you<00:04:07.230> had<00:04:07.349> one

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
steam out but pretty much you had one

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.170 
steam out but pretty much you had one
steam<00:04:07.859> setting<00:04:08.540> so<00:04:10.220> what<00:04:11.220> I<00:04:11.250> will<00:04:11.370> say<00:04:11.760> is<00:04:11.970> like
