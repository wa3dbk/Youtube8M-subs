00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:09.880
 nothing we are here we talked about but 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:13.690
 above all I believe that last year is 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.910
 was an important one for the fc tokyo a 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.609
 make you result that clearly is not 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.090
 what in the end we all wanted but 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:24.039
 for what we have put in place 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.060
 for most of the championship and therefore 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:35.079
 I believe that a careful analysis of 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:37.239
 all that has happened and therefore that 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.870
 you look very rightly no 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.250
 all the statistics and it is clear that 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.310
 going to watch what we 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.280
 we have done 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:50.040
 regarding the defensive aspect 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.420
 as regards the fourteen i 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.930
 consecutive results 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.570
 regarding 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.000
 the inclusion of many young people for the 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.350
 first time players that look 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.900
 for the first time we have light 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.670
 brought so many national players I believe 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.350
 that is the only team that has many 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.110
 national players playing in 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.210
 Japan and this reason for pride for 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.040
 the work that is done and is clear that 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.700
 this is a great base on which 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.250
 we have to build the team 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.610
 It is clear that the team's philosophy 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.780
 and of society is to put 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.490
 many young people also come from 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.440
 we change so many that are grows in the 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.080
 youth sector and who has one 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.380
 goal that this company one 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.210
 vision 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.860
 to build their own players and to 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.979
 make a winning team for this 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.979
 wants 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.930
 great job every day must 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.000
 really have a vision of that 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.800
 where where you want to go 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.310
 I believe last year's result 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.660
 the position has not rewarded us 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.390
 for what we have shown in 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:02.660
 field but this we will have to demonstrate in 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:05.300
 in the coming months we will certainly have many 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.790
 players who have arrived new 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:12.080
 guys with high expectations 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.080
 now we will present them
