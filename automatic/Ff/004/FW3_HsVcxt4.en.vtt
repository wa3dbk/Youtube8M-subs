00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.049
 useful can be not only advice but 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.049
 and indoor plants 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.289
 vegetables fruits and berries from their site 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:18.169
 guaranteed fresh grown without 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.270
 extra chemicals that's great but 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:22.699
 harvest can be collected from the window sill 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.550
 many home plants are capable 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.310
 make us happy with tasty fruits 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.619
 leaves and fragrant flowers take those 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.500
 same lemon and grow one and a half two 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.320
 kilograms of vitamin-rich fruit on 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.809
 one hello to the tree is a feasible task 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.969
 and for a beginner 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.480
 coffee gives us a pleasant aroma of leaves and 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.390
 colors 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.760
 And still tasty fruits and opportunity 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.250
 make a cup of your own bracing 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.140
 drink your coffee is difficult to fry 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.920
 all the rules but it is several times 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.420
 richer than caffeine than shopping 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:01.429
 prefer a cup of morning tea 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.989
 why not the youngest two collect 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:06.470
 three top foxes. 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.110
 twist them into a tube they quickly 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.009
 quickly listen to green tea with us 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.800
 formed 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.740
 not who collect kidney called 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.110
 white tea dry only buds 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.200
 taste of red tea 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.330
 karkade long talk we do not need you 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.050
 I often buy red tea in the store 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.090
 carcade 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.940
 but don't know what it turns out to be 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.539
 petals and buds of the usual hibiscus 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.270
 red hibiscus very often 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.880
 grow houses for beautiful flowers 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.300
 flowers bloom briefly 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.369
 almost daily tea opens 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.310
 this healing has healing 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.450
 contains a lot of properties 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.599
 biologically active substances 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.849
 askorbinki and how about spices forever 

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:54.020
 rosemary for gourmet dishes 

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:56.509
 European cuisine 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.780
 feels fine in a flower 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.330
 potted small shrubs growing on 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.490
 scree 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.830
 so many essential oils therefore 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.810
 used in cooking to impart 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.440
 the flavor of meat dishes usually 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.240
 propagated either by seed or cuttings 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.280
 now and give already finished rosemary 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.250
 shops in general but it is finished 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.950
 cuttings that break through the washed sand 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.620
 under the jar very well rooted and 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.540
 gives home plants 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.670
 sure that your home crop was not 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.370
 only delicious but also useful necessary 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.520
 follow some rules if we 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.610
 the rest of the plants are usually pickled 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.010
 that thing will attack the cobwebs there and 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.840
 back process pesticides then 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.850
 certainly fruit plant from 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.880
 all sorts of pests need 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.720
 process only other plants 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.360
 for example nettle from some pests 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.730
 there is onion garlic infusion that is not to 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.160
 pesticides on these plants 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.590
 if we want to get a quality fruit 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.420
 we have to feed the plants but not so 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.910
 once a month when remembered a 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.580
 a regular plant like us loves 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.010
 eat constantly so feeding 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.530
 better to add to each watering let it 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.209
 there will be a minimum dose of ten times 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.200
 less than recommended 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.010
 but none the less 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.010
 every water
