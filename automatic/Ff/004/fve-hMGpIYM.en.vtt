00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
which is very odd but we see him

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.230 
which is very odd but we see him
interact<00:05:05.020> with<00:05:05.800> sandy<00:05:06.280> and<00:05:06.490> that<00:05:07.060> was

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
interesting to me and we actually get to

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
I really enjoyed the whole aspect of

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.570 
I really enjoyed the whole aspect of
them<00:05:16.300> using<00:05:16.630> spongebob<00:05:17.139> as<00:05:17.289> a<00:05:17.320> test<00:05:17.919> symbol

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
them using spongebob as a test symbol

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.790

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
like for the whole teleporting thing to

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.950 
like for the whole teleporting thing to
transplant<00:05:21.400> them<00:05:21.490> into<00:05:21.610> a<00:05:21.820> huge<00:05:22.180> gas<00:05:22.539> and

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
transplant them into a huge gas and

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.589 
transplant them into a huge gas and
apparently<00:05:23.349> makes<00:05:24.190> the<00:05:24.460> Krusty<00:05:24.970> Krab<00:05:25.000> smell

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.490 
kind of like a fart and that was
actually<00:05:27.639> pretty<00:05:28.120> funny<00:05:28.570> you<00:05:28.780> know<00:05:28.960> normally

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.080 
for the most part the toilet humor with
the<00:05:37.930> whole<00:05:38.139> PU<00:05:38.949> why<00:05:39.220> does<00:05:39.370> it<00:05:39.520> smell

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
do have to say my only problem with

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.779 
do have to say my only problem with
perfect<00:05:45.880> chemistry<00:05:46.720> is<00:05:46.930> that<00:05:47.229> the<00:05:47.800> ending<00:05:48.430> is

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789 
perfect chemistry is that the ending is

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.719 
perfect chemistry is that the ending is
a<00:05:49.180> little<00:05:49.240> bit<00:05:49.780> rushed<00:05:50.050> and<00:05:50.409> I<00:05:51.130> thought<00:05:51.490> the

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:51.729 
a little bit rushed and I thought the

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:54.120 
a little bit rushed and I thought the
toilet<00:05:52.150> humor<00:05:52.630> while<00:05:53.200> funny<00:05:53.590> for<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:53.830> most

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
toilet humor while funny for the most

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.189 
toilet humor while funny for the most
part<00:05:54.520> it<00:05:54.969> does<00:05:55.360> get<00:05:55.719> a<00:05:55.750> letter

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 
part it does get a letter

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.070 
part it does get a letter
tiring<00:05:57.129> after<00:05:57.610> a<00:05:57.639> while<00:05:58.060> but<00:05:58.419> I<00:05:58.479> still<00:05:58.569> think

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
tiring after a while but I still think

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.260 
tiring after a while but I still think
it's<00:05:59.259> funny<00:05:59.590> even<00:05:59.860> when<00:06:00.129> it<00:06:00.340> does<00:06:00.550> get<00:06:00.819> tiring

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
it's funny even when it does get tiring

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.959 
it's funny even when it does get tiring
