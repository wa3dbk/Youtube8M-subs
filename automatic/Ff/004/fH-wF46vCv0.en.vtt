00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.370
 or work that has an excellent day 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:05.990
 thank you very much for watching this 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.490
 video and well I'm going to start 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.620
 applying all over my face 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.900
 this first of citi color that is the 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.719
 photos and that I really like the 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.180
 matte texture that leaves to be able 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.060
 apply to anything and well I'll 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.490
 be occupying this palette of 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.130
 correctors and contour cream 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.830
 citi color here I am showing you what 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.470
 which is an image of what the 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.290
 back palette that is what I 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.960
 basis to make them say what 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.210
 this demonstration together with review the 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.060
 true to start girls this palette 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.780
 I liked it very much because it has a 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.280
 high coverage so how am I the truth 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.640
 I had seen other citi policies 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:54.350
 color I felt very, very feminine 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.960
 the truth but this is the truth I loved it 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:01.250
 I really liked that I had a good 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.129
 coverage that is not not like what 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.229
 He explained as well as that pure but oil 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.250
 compressed and nothing else to the title you 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.380
 you put and you go not no for nothing in fact 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:17.750
 you must apply it quite enough 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:20.090
 So fast because it tends to dry and 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.020
 then it does not let you blur it 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.330
 correctly then for me it's something 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.950
 good because it lasts quite a lot 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.679
 weather 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.289
 are these correctors now as they 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:35.300
 I comment, I 'm based on the 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.630
 label that brings after the palette to 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.590
 put the correctors on how they go 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.149
 probably in the video for example 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.140
 that this is the orange tone that is for 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.700
 dark circles under the eyes do not notice much but 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.110
 actually it did show as I did 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.679
 I put if you noticed 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.840
 I said wow how nice is leaving me 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:55.490
 Well the finishes that I want not here 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.050
 Well, I'm going to give you a little bit of 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.710
 brightness 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.860
 to highlight some parts of my face 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.560
 with the yellow and later I'm going to 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.530
 start doing the outline and with the 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.360
 following tones that are pure 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.640
 coffee that I really liked 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.160
 very much as you know if your color 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.940
 that I also go out here in the palette of 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.850
 outline that is a black palette there will be 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.970
 I do not get tired of using it 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.210
 I am sincere to me they are some shades 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.310
 very very suitable for what is 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.500
 you need what is a contour the truth 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.540
 this is a first impression to which 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.300
 I am occupying this game in 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.560
 cream and with a little bit that I put there in 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.110
 the brush 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.900
 I said too much but I said no 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.910
 I'm going to leave it for you to check 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.760
 this is the pigmentation that is 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.410
 quite pretty good not apart 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.230
 is on the skin pretty enough 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.960
 time was something that I liked very much 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.840
 because the first one helps you but also 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.970
 what these cream concealers 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.920
 they also help you a lot 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.830
 well here I'm putting a 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.500
 little bit down to make an effect 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.090
 optical in question of the double chin because 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.780
 because I have the truth until the removes 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.760
 recorded then well let's go to 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.120
 help a little bit with the effects 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.010
 optics with these materials so that the 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.170
 face looks a little thinner 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.470
 remember it is very important 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:31.090
 please blur each line that you put 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:35.030
 in the face every important line 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.670
 blur the very very well because if not 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.160
 they are going to see fatal girls you have to 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.680
 blur too too well the 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.050
 lines that one puts and well as it is 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.510
 I repeat them again as you are 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.150
 being able to realize I am following 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.340
 step by step like who says the 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.590
 instructions that come in the palette 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.489
 I'm not applying it as usual 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:02.250
 I apply it because no no this is not my 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.530
 style of profiling but I wanted to do it 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.629
 as it comes in the palette so that you 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.709
 realize that then not necessarily 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:13.470
 sometimes then see a tutorial or know no 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.540
 0 him as a makeup practitioner 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.290
 these things because there are times 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.299
 that come very easy to understand and what 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.010
 can one do here I'm occupying 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.870
 girls what is this the sponge 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:29.010
 see and blender I'll start 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.540
 blur the lighter tones first and 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.330
 after I have faded the 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.760
 lighter shades blur the shades more 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.220
 dark and good girls I wanted 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.460
 tell them that I liked the palette 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.919
 very much like first impression then 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.970
 I was surprised the truth because as 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.860
 I'll comment again 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.289
 the color city has other palettes that do not 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.930
 they convince me so much but it is in 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:54.090
 particular yes yes it convinced me very much 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.190
 quite pretty well is how I say 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.870
 even though it charged fast you 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.180
 allows to blur the good and everything is 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.220
 like you do not have a hard time 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:06.090
 be giving the detail to what is a 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.800
 profiled no and well girls like 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.410
 you can tell how it is 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.750
 then it's going to repeat they diffuse quite 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.240
 well the lines now I'm going to use a 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.280
 powder that is also from citi color this 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.639
 I like it a lot because it 's translucent and 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.100
 the truth in particular because it helps me 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.620
 very much to control the fat then 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.070
 It's something that I like a lot because I already 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.630
 I have everything there not everything almost just edited 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.580
 This is the colored girls brush citi 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.440
 that comes individual and this is the palette 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.180
 black reflex control that I give them 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.610
 I was going to take a little bit of 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:42.599
 contour with the bevelled part of what 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:45.020
 is the brush and I'm going to apply it now 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:48.479
 where we previously put the hairline 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.729
 Well, coffee, if it's strong, it's coming 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.770
 being what is the contour and 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.300
 later applied what is the 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.289
 bronze 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:00.389
 and after the illuminator girls is very 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:03.389
 important please all this that I 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:06.389
 I'm putting it also diffuses it 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:08.520
 Take a brush a little looser and 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:12.419
 it also fades so they do not look 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:14.159
 the lines now I do not know yo yo 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.840
 I always emphasize them a lot when 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:18.270
 I put the shadows to take the 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.729
 adequate time to blur since 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.099
 that makes a job more polished really 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:25.289
 and creating what you see a lot but 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:27.000
 much better and good girls in the 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:29.520
 part of the nose please be a 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.650
 a little more meticulous and diffuse what a 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.960
 little bit more if you have to notice but 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:37.229
 do not exaggerate remember that what 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:40.650
 we try to give is an optical effect something 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:44.699
 real to what is a thinner face 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:46.740
 not something exaggerated that looks bad and 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:49.349
 for so long 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.240
 Well, I do not know, they do not know, they never miss 

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:54.539
 someone who follows us there you know that 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:57.690
 You seem clown or I do not know not infinity of 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:07:00.090
 things then let's avoid this this 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.280
 part of self auto trolling the a 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.169
 we ourselves do not know not to apply 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.120
 things after good already apply what 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:07.830
 which is a makeup fixer and good 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.530
 girls like that is our contour 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.509
 honestly I really hope that this 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.880
 review and this demonstration has them 

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:17.130
 helped something take care and we 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:20.490
 we are seeing in a next video already 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:22.080
 They know that if they liked it, like it and 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.250
