00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
one is a little teapot not very

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.600 
one is a little teapot not very
functional<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.620> call<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.069> a<00:02:27.250> biplane<00:02:28.290> jet

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
functional and I call it a biplane jet

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.330 
functional and I call it a biplane jet
teapot<00:02:30.610> with<00:02:31.060> dual<00:02:31.540> exhaust<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.440> wire<00:02:32.739> handle

teapot with dual exhaust and wire handle

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.490 
teapot with dual exhaust and wire handle
from<00:02:34.209> that<00:02:34.329> title<00:02:34.540> you<00:02:34.810> can<00:02:34.959> tell<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.319> it's

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
from that title you can tell that it's

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.970 
from that title you can tell that it's
not<00:02:36.329> meant<00:02:37.329> to<00:02:37.480> be<00:02:37.720> very<00:02:38.290> functional<00:02:38.650> it's

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
not meant to be very functional it's

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.550 
not meant to be very functional it's
more<00:02:39.190> of<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.489> of<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:40.180> spoof<00:02:40.480> on<00:02:40.659> a<00:02:40.720> teapot<00:02:41.200> I<00:02:41.230> guess

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
more of a of a spoof on a teapot I guess

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.380 
more of a of a spoof on a teapot I guess
and<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:41.980> spoof<00:02:42.220> on<00:02:42.370> an<00:02:42.489> airplane<00:02:42.790> as<00:02:43.030> well<00:02:43.209> it

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
and a spoof on an airplane as well it

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.259 
and a spoof on an airplane as well it
doesn't<00:02:43.569> fly<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:43.959> believe<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.379> or<00:02:44.470> not<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.970> it

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
doesn't fly I believe it or not and it

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.449 
doesn't fly I believe it or not and it
barely<00:02:46.629> pours<00:02:47.019> tea<00:02:47.349> but<00:02:47.829> nevertheless<00:02:48.099> it

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
barely pours tea but nevertheless it

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.099 
barely pours tea but nevertheless it
does<00:02:48.640> work<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:51.450> find<00:02:52.450> these<00:02:52.629> kind<00:02:52.840> of<00:02:52.900> things

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
does work I find these kind of things

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:54.330 
does work I find these kind of things
kind<00:02:53.349> of<00:02:53.410> fun<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.739> can<00:02:53.890> see<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.190> dual

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
kind of fun you can see the dual

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.099 
kind of fun you can see the dual
exhausts<00:02:54.940> in<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.180> back<00:02:55.359> here<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:55.959> you<00:02:56.079> can

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
exhausts in the back here and you can

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.610 
exhausts in the back here and you can
see<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.120> two<00:02:58.120> four<00:02:58.599> wings<00:02:58.840> all<00:02:59.079> together<00:02:59.260> and

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
see the two four wings all together and

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.339 
see the two four wings all together and
a<00:02:59.739> little<00:03:00.010> bitty<00:03:00.159> hole<00:03:00.760> in<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.629> spout<00:03:02.019> there

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
a little bitty hole in the spout there

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.880 
a little bitty hole in the spout there
that<00:03:02.980> so<00:03:03.190> it<00:03:03.310> will<00:03:03.459> pour<00:03:03.790> tea<00:03:04.769> there's<00:03:05.769> a

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
that so it will pour tea there's a

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.849 
that so it will pour tea there's a
little<00:03:06.280> build<00:03:06.489> up<00:03:06.670> of<00:03:06.849> the<00:03:06.940> soda<00:03:07.209> around<00:03:07.859> that

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
little build up of the soda around that

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.720 
little build up of the soda around that
you<00:03:08.980> can<00:03:09.159> see<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.640> kind<00:03:10.269> of<00:03:10.329> glassy<00:03:10.750> areas<00:03:11.109> and

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
you can see the kind of glassy areas and

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.099 
you can see the kind of glassy areas and
then<00:03:12.730> as<00:03:12.879> you<00:03:13.000> move<00:03:13.150> down<00:03:13.359> toward<00:03:13.840> those

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
then as you move down toward those

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.890 
then as you move down toward those
orange<00:03:14.950> those<00:03:15.310> more<00:03:15.700> orange<00:03:16.120> areas<00:03:16.480> at<00:03:16.659> some

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
orange those more orange areas at some

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.309 
orange those more orange areas at some
area<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:17.859> didn't<00:03:18.159> get<00:03:18.430> a<00:03:18.819> whole<00:03:19.239> lot<00:03:19.269> of<00:03:19.660> soda

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
area that didn't get a whole lot of soda

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.339 
area that didn't get a whole lot of soda
on<00:03:20.440> it<00:03:20.680> so<00:03:21.489> if<00:03:21.790> they're<00:03:22.120> kind<00:03:22.299> here's<00:03:22.989> another

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
on it so if they're kind here's another

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.120 
on it so if they're kind here's another
one<00:03:23.620> this<00:03:23.889> is<00:03:24.099> a<00:03:24.130> little<00:03:24.489> love<00:03:25.410> tea<00:03:26.410> ball<00:03:26.590> kind

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
one this is a little love tea ball kind

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.039 
one this is a little love tea ball kind
of<00:03:27.310> thing<00:03:27.489> it<00:03:28.000> has<00:03:28.120> sort<00:03:28.480> of<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.660> little<00:03:28.900> bit<00:03:28.989> of

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
of thing it has sort of a little bit of

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.890 
of thing it has sort of a little bit of
undulating<00:03:29.440> rim<00:03:29.950> and<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.310> can<00:03:31.120> see<00:03:31.329> that<00:03:31.569> the

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
undulating rim and you can see that the

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.500 
undulating rim and you can see that the
random<00:03:32.319> effects<00:03:32.680> of<00:03:32.919> the<00:03:33.010> soda<00:03:33.250> soda<00:03:34.000> ash<00:03:34.239> that

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
random effects of the soda soda ash that

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.509 
random effects of the soda soda ash that
I<00:03:34.599> spray<00:03:35.079> into<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.349> kiln<00:03:35.620> a<00:03:35.769> mix<00:03:35.980> of<00:03:36.099> soda<00:03:36.310> ash

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
I spray into the kiln a mix of soda ash

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.460 
I spray into the kiln a mix of soda ash
with<00:03:36.730> water<00:03:37.030> spray<00:03:37.780> it<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:37.989> kill<00:03:38.260> them<00:03:38.410> at

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
with water spray it and kill them at

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.379 
with water spray it and kill them at
about<00:03:38.560> 2,400<00:03:39.459> degrees<00:03:39.579> and<00:03:39.910> it<00:03:40.000> reacts<00:03:40.359> with

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
about 2,400 degrees and it reacts with

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.960 
about 2,400 degrees and it reacts with
the<00:03:40.480> clay<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:40.989> mix<00:03:41.260> makes<00:03:42.040> a<00:03:42.220> glace<00:03:42.459> odium

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
the clay and mix makes a glace odium

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.599 
the clay and mix makes a glace odium

little<00:03:45.849> pitcher<00:03:46.629> is<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:46.840> good<00:03:47.079> example<00:03:47.500> of

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
little pitcher is a good example of

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.569 
little pitcher is a good example of
exactly<00:03:49.480> how<00:03:49.989> that<00:03:50.230> works<00:03:50.500> I'll<00:03:50.919> show<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:51.459> a

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
exactly how that works I'll show you a

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.409 
exactly how that works I'll show you a
little<00:03:52.239> more<00:03:52.449> in<00:03:53.139> more<00:03:53.349> detail<00:03:53.769> see<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.879> soda

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
little more in more detail see the soda

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.710 
little more in more detail see the soda
buildup<00:03:56.019> is<00:03:56.530> more<00:03:57.459> prominent<00:03:57.879> right<00:03:58.180> in<00:03:58.329> here

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
buildup is more prominent right in here

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.050 
buildup is more prominent right in here
and<00:03:59.199> as<00:03:59.349> you<00:03:59.470> turn<00:03:59.650> this<00:03:59.859> piece<00:04:00.069> around<00:04:00.459> you

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
and as you turn this piece around you

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.140 
and as you turn this piece around you
can<00:04:01.209> see<00:04:01.359> there's<00:04:01.569> less<00:04:02.190> glaze<00:04:03.190> on<00:04:03.549> it<00:04:03.579> now

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
can see there's less glaze on it now

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.210 
can see there's less glaze on it now
this<00:04:04.449> what<00:04:04.810> happens<00:04:05.199> is<00:04:05.379> hot<00:04:05.590> right<00:04:05.829> here<00:04:06.069> is

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
this what happens is hot right here is

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.819 
this what happens is hot right here is
another<00:04:06.519> example<00:04:06.790> where<00:04:07.359> there's<00:04:07.540> a<00:04:07.829> little

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
another example where there's a little

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.559 
another example where there's a little
more<00:04:09.040> soda<00:04:09.340> down<00:04:09.579> there<00:04:09.760> in<00:04:09.849> the<00:04:09.910> bottom<00:04:10.090> so<00:04:10.510> to

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
more soda down there in the bottom so to

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.599 
more soda down there in the bottom so to
build<00:04:10.840> up<00:04:11.049> I<00:04:11.260> call<00:04:11.650> it<00:04:11.799> so<00:04:11.980> it's<00:04:12.190> not<00:04:12.310> really

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
build up I call it so it's not really

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.569 
build up I call it so it's not really
sodas<00:04:12.970> so<00:04:13.269> soda<00:04:13.870> sodium<00:04:14.620> silicate<00:04:15.190> that<00:04:15.459> is

the glass and there's a lot of it down
there<00:04:18.010> and<00:04:18.280> less<00:04:18.820> up<00:04:19.060> in<00:04:19.209> here<00:04:19.479> and<00:04:19.660> this<00:04:19.750> is

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
there and less up in here and this is

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.360 
there and less up in here and this is

piece this is a some
fairly<00:04:28.020> large<00:04:28.230> pitcher<00:04:28.680> not<00:04:28.860> huge<00:04:29.520> but<00:04:29.580> fairly

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
fairly large pitcher not huge but fairly

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.970 
fairly large pitcher not huge but fairly
large<00:04:30.960> and<00:04:31.760> this<00:04:32.760> shows<00:04:33.630> you<00:04:33.810> an<00:04:33.930> example<00:04:34.020> of<00:04:34.590> a

large and this shows you an example of a

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.670 
large and this shows you an example of a
glaze<00:04:35.790> this<00:04:36.330> that<00:04:36.870> was<00:04:37.020> actually<00:04:37.350> put<00:04:37.500> on<00:04:37.620> the

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
glaze this that was actually put on the

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.310 
glaze this that was actually put on the
pot<00:04:37.890> first<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:38.610> then<00:04:39.480> put<00:04:39.690> in<00:04:39.810> the<00:04:39.900> kiln<00:04:40.050> so<00:04:40.230> it

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
pot first and then put in the kiln so it

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.960 
pot first and then put in the kiln so it

traditional fire and then this is the

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.060 
traditional fire and then this is the
build<00:04:44.910> up<00:04:45.090> of<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.720> glass<00:04:46.050> from<00:04:46.350> the<00:04:46.380> from<00:04:46.950> the

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070

soda firing down in here this kind of

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.320 
soda firing down in here this kind of
speckled<00:04:49.230> surface<00:04:49.590> so<00:04:49.770> that's<00:04:49.980> it<00:04:50.220> a<00:04:50.400> few<00:04:51.150> more

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
speckled surface so that's it a few more

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.900
