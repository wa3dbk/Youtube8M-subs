I<00:00:23.670> think<00:00:24.390> it's<00:00:24.539> 90s<00:00:25.050> vintage<00:00:26.660> worst<00:00:27.660> problem

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
I think it's 90s vintage worst problem

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.390 
I think it's 90s vintage worst problem
with<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.410> other<00:00:28.680> than<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.920> paint<00:00:29.160> scratches

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
with this other than the paint scratches

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.780 
with this other than the paint scratches
is<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.300> rack<00:00:31.019> gears<00:00:31.349> are<00:00:31.560> cracked<00:00:31.890> so

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
is that the rack gears are cracked so

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.510 
is that the rack gears are cracked so
I'm<00:00:33.120> going<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.770> have<00:00:34.770> some<00:00:34.980> work<00:00:35.100> under<00:00:35.430> the

cabinet on this but the other thing on

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.790 
cabinet on this but the other thing on
the<00:00:40.379> back<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.100> inputs<00:00:41.579> have<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.290> tip<00:00:43.290> as<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
the back the inputs have the tip as the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.770 
the back the inputs have the tip as the
negative<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.670> I'm<00:00:44.910> going<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.149> need<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.360> reverse

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
negative so I'm going to need to reverse

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.920 
negative so I'm going to need to reverse
the<00:00:46.110> tip<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.890> ring<00:00:47.329> to<00:00:48.329> have<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.750> work

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
the tip and the ring to have it work

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.680 
the tip and the ring to have it work
with<00:00:49.110> my<00:00:49.289> EQ<00:00:49.980> properly<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.210> phase<00:00:51.480> with

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
with my EQ properly and be in phase with

with my EQ properly and be in phase with
the<00:00:51.750> subwoofer<00:00:52.140> amp<00:00:52.550> so<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.579> got<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.850> take<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the subwoofer amp so I got to take the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.310 
the subwoofer amp so I got to take the
cover<00:00:54.270> off<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.690> do<00:00:54.809> that

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
cover off to do that

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.049 
cover off to do that
might<00:00:55.590> as<00:00:55.710> well<00:00:55.770> inspect<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.430> while<00:00:56.610> I'm<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:56.910> it

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
might as well inspect it while I'm in it

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.170 
might as well inspect it while I'm in it
and<00:00:58.039> start<00:00:59.039> getting<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.370> cleaned<00:00:59.609> up<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.000> let's

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
and start getting it cleaned up so let's

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.209 
and start getting it cleaned up so let's
see<00:01:00.359> what's<00:01:00.539> inside<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:01.109> 50<00:01:01.500> pound<00:01:01.739> monster

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
see what's inside this 50 pound monster

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.350 
see what's inside this 50 pound monster
I<00:01:03.140> wanted<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.229> sing<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:04.680> damn<00:01:04.920> heavy

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
I wanted to sing so damn heavy

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.210 
I wanted to sing so damn heavy
to<00:01:06.360> separate<00:01:06.750> power<00:01:06.960> transformers<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.950> big

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
to separate power transformers and big

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.880 
to separate power transformers and big
old<00:01:08.430> heat<00:01:08.670> sinks<00:01:09.409> serious<00:01:10.409> dusty<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:10.860> here

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
old heat sinks serious dusty in here

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.190 
old heat sinks serious dusty in here
though<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:12.330> date<00:01:12.510> code<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.960> caps

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
though and the date code on the caps

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.940 
though and the date code on the caps
looks<00:01:13.500> like<00:01:13.909> 1986

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
looks like 1986

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.780 
looks like 1986
so<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.280> late<00:01:17.520> 80s<00:01:17.939> vintage<00:01:19.070> mid<00:01:20.070> mid<00:01:20.430> 80s

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
so it's late 80s vintage mid mid 80s

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.200 
so it's late 80s vintage mid mid 80s

it's<00:02:22.730> GMO<00:02:23.650> see<00:02:24.650> how<00:02:24.709> this<00:02:24.829> thing<00:02:24.890> sounds

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.040 

my<00:02:44.860> god<00:02:45.130> I<00:02:45.160> bottoms<00:02:45.760> out<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.060> speaker's<00:02:46.540> isn't

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
my god I bottoms out the speaker's isn't

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.600 
my god I bottoms out the speaker's isn't
with<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.350> volume<00:02:47.800> just<00:02:47.830> a<00:02:48.190> little<00:02:48.430> higher

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
with the volume just a little higher

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.100 
with the volume just a little higher
than<00:02:48.940> what<00:02:49.120> that<00:02:49.300> was<00:02:51.900> even<00:02:52.900> with<00:02:52.990> these

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
than what that was even with these

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.150 
than what that was even with these
little<00:02:53.410> speakers<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.980> hits<00:02:54.190> me<00:02:54.340> in<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.460> chest

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
little speakers it hits me in the chest

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.280 
little speakers it hits me in the chest
this<00:02:57.160> thing's<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.520> monster<00:03:00.930> yeah<00:03:01.930> I<00:03:01.960> gotta<00:03:02.230> say

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
this thing's a monster yeah I gotta say

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.150 
this thing's a monster yeah I gotta say
that<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:03.900> don't<00:03:04.900> think<00:03:05.050> I've<00:03:05.140> ever<00:03:05.170> heard<00:03:05.770> those

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
that I don't think I've ever heard those

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.640 
that I don't think I've ever heard those
test<00:03:06.550> speakers<00:03:06.970> get<00:03:07.420> that<00:03:07.600> loud<00:03:07.810> ever<00:03:08.200> and

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
test speakers get that loud ever and

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.350 
test speakers get that loud ever and
anything<00:03:09.550> I've<00:03:09.670> ever<00:03:09.790> hooked<00:03:09.940> up<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.240> him<00:03:10.390> and

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
anything I've ever hooked up to him and

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.600 
anything I've ever hooked up to him and
they're<00:03:13.360> also<00:03:13.540> very<00:03:13.990> well<00:03:14.800> controlled<00:03:15.220> too

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
they're also very well controlled too

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.610 
they're also very well controlled too
for<00:03:15.820> how<00:03:15.880> loud<00:03:16.150> they<00:03:16.360> were<00:03:16.420> just<00:03:16.990> analysts

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
for how loud they were just analysts

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.900 
for how loud they were just analysts
have<00:03:17.770> really<00:03:18.190> good

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
have really good

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.840 
have really good
I<00:03:19.080> think<00:03:20.080> the<00:03:20.170> damping<00:03:20.560> factor<00:03:20.740> is<00:03:21.070> over<00:03:21.310> 200

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
I think the damping factor is over 200

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.560 
I think the damping factor is over 200
on<00:03:21.970> this<00:03:22.210> so<00:03:22.810> I<00:03:22.840> know<00:03:23.020> what's<00:03:23.230> up<00:03:23.380> there<00:03:23.590> I

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
on this so I know what's up there I

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.790 
on this so I know what's up there I
think<00:03:25.570> I'm<00:03:25.660> just<00:03:25.720> going<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:25.960> get<00:03:26.440> all<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.620> dust

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
think I'm just going to get all the dust

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.910 
think I'm just going to get all the dust
blown<00:03:27.010> out<00:03:27.310> of<00:03:27.430> this<00:03:27.580> and<00:03:28.560> touch<00:03:29.560> it<00:03:29.710> up<00:03:29.800> a<00:03:29.890> bit

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
blown out of this and touch it up a bit

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.550 
blown out of this and touch it up a bit
and<00:03:30.130> get<00:03:30.370> it<00:03:30.400> installed<00:03:30.760> in<00:03:30.910> my<00:03:31.030> rack

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
and get it installed in my rack

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.380 
and get it installed in my rack
I'm<00:03:32.560> almost<00:03:32.800> considering<00:03:33.520> seeing<00:03:34.030> if<00:03:34.210> it<00:03:34.360> can

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
I'm almost considering seeing if it can

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.050 
I'm almost considering seeing if it can
out<00:03:34.660> kick<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.080> bearing<00:03:35.470> or<00:03:35.590> EPX<00:03:36.100> 3000<00:03:36.910> that's

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
out kick the bearing or EPX 3000 that's

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.740 
out kick the bearing or EPX 3000 that's
driving<00:03:37.390> my<00:03:37.510> subs<00:03:37.810> right<00:03:38.080> now<00:03:38.820> I<00:03:39.820> know<00:03:40.570> it's

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
driving my subs right now I know it's

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.420 
driving my subs right now I know it's
rated<00:03:40.990> for<00:03:41.020> less<00:03:41.260> wattage<00:03:41.530> but<00:03:41.950> I<00:03:41.980> think<00:03:42.250> this

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
rated for less wattage but I think this

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.070 
rated for less wattage but I think this
might<00:03:42.580> have<00:03:42.760> more<00:03:43.000> clean<00:03:43.330> wattage<00:03:43.750> than<00:03:43.959> the

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
might have more clean wattage than the

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.660 
might have more clean wattage than the
bearing<00:03:44.380> or<00:03:44.500> does<00:03:46.320> but<00:03:47.320> I<00:03:47.620> really<00:03:48.160> got<00:03:48.340> it<00:03:48.520> to

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
bearing or does but I really got it to

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.690 
bearing or does but I really got it to
drive<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.270> sermon<00:03:49.840> Vagos<00:03:50.550> that<00:03:51.550> are

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
drive the sermon Vagos that are

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.630 
drive the sermon Vagos that are
currently<00:03:52.030> being<00:03:52.120> driven<00:03:52.630> by<00:03:52.930> a<00:03:53.310> 100<00:03:54.310> watt<00:03:54.400> per

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
currently being driven by a 100 watt per

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
currently being driven by a 100 watt per
channel<00:03:54.910> kind<00:03:55.660> of<00:03:55.780> generic<00:03:56.170> amplifier<00:03:56.770> and<00:03:57.660> I

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
channel kind of generic amplifier and I

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.040 
channel kind of generic amplifier and I
think<00:03:59.050> this<00:03:59.200> will<00:03:59.350> more<00:03:59.560> than<00:03:59.590> do<00:04:00.100> the<00:04:00.220> job<00:04:00.489> of

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
think this will more than do the job of

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.750 
think this will more than do the job of
that<00:04:02.050> because<00:04:03.010> I<00:04:03.040> won't<00:04:03.280> even<00:04:03.340> have<00:04:03.459> to<00:04:03.640> do

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
that because I won't even have to do

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.880 
that because I won't even have to do
base<00:04:04.000> duty<00:04:04.390> it'll<00:04:04.570> only<00:04:04.690> be<00:04:04.959> like<00:04:05.140> 60<00:04:05.709> Hertz

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
base duty it'll only be like 60 Hertz

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.920 
base duty it'll only be like 60 Hertz
and<00:04:06.070> up<00:04:06.190> or<00:04:06.459> 100<00:04:07.120> Hertz<00:04:07.270> and<00:04:07.420> up<00:04:07.540> or<00:04:07.690> something

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
and up or 100 Hertz and up or something

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.970 
and up or 100 Hertz and up or something
like<00:04:07.959> that<00:04:08.550> so<00:04:10.260> sheesh

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
like that so sheesh

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.180 
like that so sheesh
if<00:04:12.940> I<00:04:13.060> can<00:04:13.300> get<00:04:14.140> everything<00:04:14.350> fixed<00:04:14.860> up<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.070> way

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
if I can get everything fixed up the way

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.400 
if I can get everything fixed up the way
I<00:04:15.220> need<00:04:15.459> it<00:04:15.610> maybe<00:04:16.540> I'll<00:04:16.810> give<00:04:17.020> it<00:04:17.109> a<00:04:17.169> try<00:04:17.380> on

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
I need it maybe I'll give it a try on

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.960 
I need it maybe I'll give it a try on
the<00:04:17.620> subwoofers<00:04:18.190> and<00:04:18.220> see<00:04:18.489> what<00:04:18.609> it<00:04:18.700> can<00:04:18.820> do

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
the subwoofers and see what it can do

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.449 
the subwoofers and see what it can do
but<00:04:19.900> for<00:04:20.140> now<00:04:20.260> I'm<00:04:20.590> just<00:04:20.650> going<00:04:20.859> to<00:04:20.950> put<00:04:21.370> it

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
but for now I'm just going to put it

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.340 
but for now I'm just going to put it
back<00:04:21.609> together<00:04:21.760> and<00:04:22.270> set<00:04:22.570> it<00:04:22.690> aside<00:04:22.780> because<00:04:23.169> I

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
back together and set it aside because I

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.190 
back together and set it aside because I
have<00:04:23.470> other<00:04:23.620> projects
