 of reforms and I am interista 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.420
 Now I will explain how to make 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:20.360
 a sink look bigger this 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:23.060
 space is the bathroom space is worth 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.620
 we have divided it into three pieces and the 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.030
 Once we have communicated with the 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:32.419
 rooms here we would have the area of 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.610
 sink in the cav years and the shower and now 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.489
 we are going to show you what is the area of 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.520
 toilet that as you can see also the 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.920
 we have closed because I know it is the area 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.470
 most intimate of the entire bathroom and we have 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.280
 also applied the same system 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:52.309
 of tiled clay pottery and 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.880
 giving him this point that we had already said 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:59.250
 very economical and very modern, and now 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.570
 let's explain the main area of 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.290
 bathroom that is where it is in 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.290
 handwash 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.960
 in this wall we have done we have placed 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.300
 this mirror crystals forgiveness to give 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.660
 are you to this feeling that we talked about 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:17.320
 agreement and we've loved static for 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:20.140
 give also this feeling of more 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.940
 space in the bathroom and now we're going 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.380
 to explain what is the central area of 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.290
 bathroom that is where the 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.820
 hands of the application that we have done 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.000
 in this wall that would also be the wall 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.330
 main we have resisted very well 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.119
 the wall with a mirror to talk about this 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.130
 amplitude of agreement and then also 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.060
 to give a touch of color link in 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.189
 this zone 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.560
 It is in what area 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.470
 the doors before the door of the 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.800
 shower screen and on the strings of 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.440
 access to the rooms 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.570
 that if you can fix you are doors and 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.690
 voters 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.030
 and with this system we can eliminate what 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.670
 than on the traditional framework of all 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.670
 life giving it a touch in a moment 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.750
