00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.160
Trained in the martial arts

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.040
And can't stop

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.040
From being the best

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.720
And the champion

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.500
And the strongest man

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.300
In the tournament.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.160
Ryu's the name

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.000
Don't test my strength

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.640
Less you wanna take a helicopter kick to the face

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.140
Vortex throw, fly across the place

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.680

Either way I got to get to Sagat today.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.760
Criminals want to use my assets.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.260
But I will not give in to the dark intent

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.220
My enemies are never gonna be as fast

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.180

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.320
Going up against the Illuminati

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.080
Shadaloo group, no peace offering

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.480

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.480
Dropping bosses very often

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.160
Dragon punch to the esophagus

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.800
If you gotta ask, "what game do you call that?"

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.360
Walk away and go play Mortal Kombat.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.920

Man, Sagat just ran out of luck

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.240
'cause I'm the second barefoot black belt to step up

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.600
Ryu and Ken put the R K in Arcade 
and I'll cave in your face with Karate

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.600
Now you wonder why
You've got no chance

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.680

Ken Masters, That's the
Harder Better Faster
Strongest one that you will ever have to react to

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.240
I strive for strength
both physical and 
lyrical and

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.080
No way I will ever pull a punch, I'll just pull Chun Li

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.440
Then this Ken is gonna get a Tai Chi Barbie

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.360

When Guile is mad and that's a fact

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.520
Your skills are shocking like Blanka's Back, bitch
I beat cheap fetal tactic fanatics

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.560
