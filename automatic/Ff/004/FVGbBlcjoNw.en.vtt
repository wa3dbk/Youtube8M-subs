00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
dark room or in my head my signature

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.750 
dark room or in my head my signature
move<00:01:11.930> that<00:01:12.930> would<00:01:13.020> be<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.890> move<00:01:14.100> i<00:01:14.220> did<00:01:14.430> at<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
move that would be the move i did at the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.480 
move that would be the move i did at the
end<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:15.150> hip<00:01:15.540> hop<00:01:15.689> international<00:01:15.960> 2005<00:01:16.950> where

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
end of hip hop international 2005 where

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.580 
end of hip hop international 2005 where
I'm<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> handstand<00:01:18.140> more<00:01:19.140> lean<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
I'm in the handstand more lean to the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.450 
I'm in the handstand more lean to the
side<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:21.210> greatly<00:01:21.390> injured<00:01:21.810> me<00:01:22.250> I'd<00:01:23.250> say

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
side and it greatly injured me I'd say

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.620 
side and it greatly injured me I'd say
that<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.670> think<00:01:23.759> that's<00:01:24.090> my<00:01:24.150> signature<00:01:24.509> move

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630
