00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.080 
some specific insights into these things
that<00:02:08.509> we<00:02:08.629> think<00:02:09.049> connect<00:02:09.709> us<00:02:09.860> as<00:02:10.099> runners<00:02:10.310> the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
that we think connect us as runners the

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.470 
that we think connect us as runners the
real<00:02:11.299> heart<00:02:11.690> of<00:02:11.930> this<00:02:11.989> film<00:02:12.200> is<00:02:12.860> going<00:02:13.489> to<00:02:13.640> be

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
real heart of this film is going to be

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.130 
real heart of this film is going to be
interviews<00:02:14.989> with<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.560> at<00:02:16.250> events<00:02:16.879> on<00:02:17.690> the

trail at your run Club because the

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.920 
trail at your run Club because the
reality<00:02:21.590> is<00:02:21.830> it's<00:02:22.549> the<00:02:22.819> rich<00:02:23.030> tapestry<00:02:23.840> of

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
reality is it's the rich tapestry of

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.920 
reality is it's the rich tapestry of
stories<00:02:24.349> that<00:02:24.830> you<00:02:25.220> have<00:02:25.489> that<00:02:26.269> underpins

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
stories that you have that underpins

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.390 
stories that you have that underpins
everything<00:02:27.319> that<00:02:28.069> we're<00:02:28.220> doing<00:02:30.160> we<00:02:31.160> really

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
everything that we're doing we really

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.729 
everything that we're doing we really
can't<00:02:31.670> tell<00:02:31.849> a<00:02:31.910> story<00:02:32.299> about<00:02:32.420> runners<00:02:32.780> without

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
can't tell a story about runners without

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.770 
can't tell a story about runners without
going<00:02:34.069> to<00:02:34.250> where<00:02:34.430> runners<00:02:34.760> are<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.360> they're

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
going to where runners are and they're

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.130 
going to where runners are and they're
all<00:02:36.019> over<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.560> world<00:02:37.360> so<00:02:38.360> what<00:02:38.540> that<00:02:38.660> means<00:02:38.930> is

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
all over the world so what that means is

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.020 
all over the world so what that means is
that<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.410> biggest<00:02:39.739> chunk<00:02:39.920> of<00:02:40.099> our<00:02:40.220> budget<00:02:40.610> is

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
that the biggest chunk of our budget is

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.930 
that the biggest chunk of our budget is
travel<00:02:41.720> another<00:02:42.200> big<00:02:42.379> expense<00:02:42.799> for<00:02:42.980> us<00:02:43.129> is<00:02:43.400> the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
travel another big expense for us is the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.460 
travel another big expense for us is the
equipment<00:02:44.360> you've<00:02:44.690> seen<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.019> majestic

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
equipment you've seen the majestic

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.869 
equipment you've seen the majestic
aerial<00:02:45.799> shots<00:02:46.040> that<00:02:46.250> we've<00:02:46.340> captured<00:02:46.579> with

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
aerial shots that we've captured with

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.280 
aerial shots that we've captured with
just<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.150> little<00:02:47.269> GoPro<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:47.989> a<00:02:48.079> little

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
just a little GoPro and a little

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.289 
just a little GoPro and a little
quadcopter<00:02:49.010> but<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.670> know<00:02:49.760> we<00:02:49.879> want<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.090> take

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
quadcopter but you know we want to take

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:51.970 
quadcopter but you know we want to take
that<00:02:50.480> we<00:02:50.599> want<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:50.780> Ratchet<00:02:51.200> it<00:02:51.290> up<00:02:51.410> so<00:02:51.709> we<00:02:51.799> can

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
that we want to Ratchet it up so we can

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.490 
that we want to Ratchet it up so we can
carry<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.609> larger<00:02:53.329> camera<00:02:53.810> with<00:02:54.230> better

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
carry a larger camera with better

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.710 
carry a larger camera with better
dynamic<00:02:55.010> range<00:02:55.069> and<00:02:55.609> what<00:02:56.180> that<00:02:56.299> will<00:02:56.480> do<00:02:56.690> is

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
dynamic range and what that will do is

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.420 
dynamic range and what that will do is
it'll<00:02:57.049> give<00:02:57.230> us<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.379> same<00:02:57.709> production<00:02:58.040> value

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
it'll give us the same production value

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.650 
it'll give us the same production value
we're<00:02:58.579> getting<00:02:58.670> with<00:02:58.940> our<00:02:58.970> ground<00:02:59.329> level

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
we're getting with our ground level

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.349 
we're getting with our ground level
shots<00:02:59.959> with<00:03:00.560> our<00:03:00.709> aerial<00:03:01.040> shots<00:03:01.310> plus<00:03:02.030> flying

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
shots with our aerial shots plus flying

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.509 
shots with our aerial shots plus flying
times<00:03:02.720> a<00:03:02.870> big<00:03:03.049> issue<00:03:03.230> of<00:03:03.440> for<00:03:03.650> us<00:03:03.769> currently<00:03:04.430> we

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
times a big issue of for us currently we

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.369 
times a big issue of for us currently we
can<00:03:04.549> only<00:03:04.760> fly<00:03:05.030> for<00:03:05.299> about<00:03:05.480> four<00:03:05.810> minutes<00:03:06.200> at<00:03:06.349> a

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
can only fly for about four minutes at a

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.729 
can only fly for about four minutes at a
time<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:07.060> that's<00:03:08.060> just<00:03:08.269> not<00:03:08.450> realistic<00:03:09.049> when

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
time and that's just not realistic when

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.440 
time and that's just not realistic when
you're<00:03:09.859> making<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.190> movie<00:03:10.519> we<00:03:11.030> need<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:11.239> be<00:03:11.359> able

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
you're making a movie we need to be able

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.199 
you're making a movie we need to be able
to<00:03:11.569> fly<00:03:11.840> 20<00:03:12.709> minutes<00:03:13.069> at<00:03:13.220> a<00:03:13.250> time<00:03:13.459> we<00:03:14.030> need<00:03:14.180> a

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
to fly 20 minutes at a time we need a

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.479 
to fly 20 minutes at a time we need a
second<00:03:14.599> camera<00:03:14.840> because<00:03:15.709> there's<00:03:16.010> a<00:03:16.099> lot<00:03:16.310> to

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
second camera because there's a lot to

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.789 
second camera because there's a lot to

cover during these races our window for

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.740 
cover during these races our window for
production<00:03:19.250> is<00:03:19.370> pretty<00:03:19.819> short<00:03:20.090> right<00:03:20.540> we've
