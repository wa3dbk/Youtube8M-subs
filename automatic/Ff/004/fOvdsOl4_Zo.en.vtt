what extraordinaire out it is the

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.829 
what extraordinaire out it is the
interior<00:00:21.560> must<00:00:21.919> be<00:00:22.130> hollow<00:00:22.339> to<00:00:22.759> allow<00:00:23.029> space

interior must be hollow to allow space
for<00:00:24.380> the<00:00:24.439> light<00:00:24.619> so<00:00:24.980> I<00:00:25.189> turn<00:00:25.489> it<00:00:25.609> off<00:00:25.759> I<00:00:26.029> can

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
for the light so I turn it off I can

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.269 
for the light so I turn it off I can
show<00:00:26.960> that<00:00:27.079> it<00:00:27.230> really<00:00:27.470> is<00:00:27.589> a<00:00:27.619> working<00:00:28.039> Rubik

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
show that it really is a working Rubik

extraordinary I came across recently was

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.990 
extraordinary I came across recently was
a<00:00:38.780> clock<00:00:39.079> which<00:00:40.070> is<00:00:40.250> a<00:00:40.280> kind<00:00:40.579> of<00:00:40.760> a

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
a clock which is a kind of a

a clock which is a kind of a
battery-powered<00:00:41.629> one<00:00:42.280> it's<00:00:43.280> got<00:00:43.579> some<00:00:43.989> some

battery-powered one it's got some some

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.869 
battery-powered one it's got some some
movement<00:00:45.320> to<00:00:45.440> it<00:00:45.559> which<00:00:45.859> is<00:00:46.070> starting<00:00:46.820> off

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
movement to it which is starting off

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.849 
movement to it which is starting off
immediately<00:00:47.329> the<00:00:48.289> whole<00:00:48.440> of<00:00:48.589> the<00:00:48.649> clock<00:00:48.829> face

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
immediately the whole of the clock face

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.250 
immediately the whole of the clock face
turns<00:00:49.429> out<00:00:49.579> to<00:00:49.730> be<00:00:49.760> the<00:00:50.149> pendulum<00:00:50.629> our<00:00:50.929> very

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
turns out to be the pendulum our very

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.459 
turns out to be the pendulum our very
still<00:00:52.329> the<00:00:53.329> entire<00:00:53.600> clock<00:00:53.839> face<00:00:54.050> goes<00:00:54.260> back

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
still the entire clock face goes back

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.560 
still the entire clock face goes back
and<00:00:54.620> forward<00:00:54.890> that's<00:00:55.070> sitting<00:00:55.339> on<00:00:55.429> my<00:00:55.640> living

compartment heavy weight at the bottom

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.530 
compartment heavy weight at the bottom
which<00:01:08.090> gives<00:01:08.300> it<00:01:08.390> a<00:01:08.480> bit<00:01:08.600> of<00:01:08.660> inertia<00:01:09.650> and<00:01:10.540> then

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
which gives it a bit of inertia and then

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.540 
which gives it a bit of inertia and then
a<00:01:11.660> nice<00:01:11.870> little<00:01:12.130> hanging<00:01:13.130> point<00:01:13.370> to<00:01:13.640> hold<00:01:13.850> the

a nice little hanging point to hold the
whole<00:01:16.550> thing<00:01:16.730> upright<00:01:16.880> it's<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.360> very<00:01:17.960> nice

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
whole thing upright it's a very nice

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.930 
whole thing upright it's a very nice
construction<00:01:18.530> for<00:01:19.010> a<00:01:19.040> clock<00:01:19.280> and<00:01:19.550> the<00:01:19.610> hands

well you just have to imagine from that
what<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.830> time<00:01:22.010> is<00:01:22.040> it's<00:01:22.580> easy<00:01:22.730> enough<00:01:22.880> to

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
what the time is it's easy enough to

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.340 
what the time is it's easy enough to
work<00:01:23.240> it<00:01:23.330> out<00:01:23.860> and<00:01:24.860> another<00:01:25.130> recent<00:01:26.200> thing<00:01:27.200> for
