00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:09.019
 I bring the special 100 videos and then 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.019
 of 4 years uploading youtube videos 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.400
 so I will make good setup where you 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.799
 I'm going to teach here a little what I have 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.450
 this is the corner where I have the 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:22.750
 computer and everything and well let's start 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.710
 the first thing is this some speakers 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.930
 normalito sloggi that are not a big deal 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.670
 then the computer with the background 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.820
 desktop that you used for the tutorials 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.590
 that some of you will already know keyboard 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.580
 everything is to make the computer here I have 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.140
 also the ctv came all that day have been 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.130
 bought not even a different mouse 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.520
 because I do well everything so 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.860
 I do not have against a version 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.060
 that's from the speakers and well there 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.280
 down is the big all subwoofer there 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.700
 these are the helmets put to play 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.620
 Sometimes that micro does not use to comment 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.940
 because the truth is that it is not very good 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.000
 only use for skype so are some 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.229
 steelseries iberia I think some are 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.080
 pretty good we have them two years ago 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.830
 years and not all perfect any problem 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.700

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.539

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.520
 a good microsoft usb all with the 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.829
 cable out there that is to control the 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.540
 command of xbox with the game and this is 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:31.150
 a sound card 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.390
 so that you have two cards 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.300
 sound at the same time on computers 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.390
 that I use it for this for the table 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.130
 mixes to puncture the once in a while 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.260
 do sessions 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.960
 I'm not a professional to say but 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.090
 well I do my little things and good I have 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.820
 another channel with which I have been for a while 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.500
 uploading some videos and that's it 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.080
 here if you want to spend any if you 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.979
 music interests and all that after 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.450
 Well here I have some good games 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.110
 this is the command of xbox with which 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:09.190
 game I took it for my birthday that I 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.500
 they gave money to buy it and let's say 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.110
 it's perfect or it 's like it's a command 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.610
 normal xbox and clear current that I have 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.240

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.019
 phone tree east 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.319
 before you start the colors type this 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:20.319

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.700

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.989
 rubik that you see is undone but 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.209
 I'm going to show you how 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.219
 I do it because to see you 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.139
 doing it is fine for what is 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:35.349

 good good 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:03.769

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.769
 now we start 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.800
 but what will happen to fast camera 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.800

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:35.260
 well I'm finishing what 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:37.720
 and back 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.680
 Well, it would not have taken more than one 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.030
 maybe it's not good for him 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.030
 we saw winners 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:53.749
 and everything else good 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:56.659
 well, well this is a printer 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:57.379
 that the truth has no mystery and 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:00.759

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:13.969
 you will know what is the zinc 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:17.449
 the truth is pretty good and I use it 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:20.770
 here in bilbao I have a bike ride and 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.770
 well and the truth is very good 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:29.069
 nothing because this is the area of ​​the 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:32.689
 computer the area of ​​the play is in the 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:34.789
 saloon and good now he got there 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:38.089
 Well, here we are in the area of 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:41.809
 play you can see this is the TV of the 

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:45.390
 living room a sony bravia of this had 40 

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:47.400
 inches or 41 something like that 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.060
 and good here is with the games for 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.060
 that you see first 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:06:00.750
 call of duty 4 the first world war 2 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:03.620
 black ops and modern warfare 3 all 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:07.100
 the call of duty is from the call of duty 4 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:12.350
 then this is to register the brotherhood 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:14.960
 fifa 10 and 2009 well I took it to sell 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.580
 a year ago they gave me about one euro and 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.890
 I preferred to stay well to the game 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:23.330
 true because for a commercial euro but 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:25.430
 well here below is the playstation no 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.840
 I think this 80 GB does not give him 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.770
 Play 2 games was the first one that 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:33.000
 it came out because we'll go the two controls 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:37.500
 normal controls 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.450
 and here at the bottom is in the micro 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.540
 the wireless hatcher this I think that 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:44.780
 sony flame 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:47.330
 and good normal goes well also from 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:50.240
 long ago we have it 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:53.449
 and here is the catcher I do not know if it 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:57.229

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:01.849

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:06.560

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:10.060
 you can see when they pass two let 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.070
 xerez and nothing then 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.270
 the truth I think there's not much else 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.520
 here 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.770
