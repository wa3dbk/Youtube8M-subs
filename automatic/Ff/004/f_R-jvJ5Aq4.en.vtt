00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.240
 so this is a part that I like 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.210
 to say that it will be very important for us 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.590
 know how to analyze is the image that the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.720
 people pass the table 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.790
 You know that 2010 was the year with 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.070
 mtt appeared there I showed those who do not 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.059
 At that time I was very 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.460
 questioned in many forums both 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:48.120
 national and international levels is precisely 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.180
 by the style of play by how I 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.199
 stec stewards mainly in the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.229
 aesthetics 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.260
 especially in this part is I always 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:02.220
 I was extremely asked if this 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.199
 play if this strategy was really 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.500
 effective or not 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.740
 and because the black fabric I have had this 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.330
 very big media on top of my name 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.020
 precisely because of this style of 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.850
 game is I came to be very analyzed 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.280
 I came to be very much in evidence 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.030
 Everyone started to study what I 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:28.859
 did as I did then we go 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.920
 review my game in 2010 2011 2012 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:33.960
 are totally different game styles 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.929
 We have to learn from our lesson. 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.030
 in this with the important is the image that the 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.939
 people pass on to other players 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.420
 what is the possible reaction of the player 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:49.079
 who is playing sitting before him 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.450
 same style of play he will play and 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.530
 I'll do what he's thinking 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.740
 that he is going to do what I'm going to do 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.369
 I always know that very well. 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.880
 the situation of this scenario the situation 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.950
 analysis of your image, this is 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.420
 extremely important for you to take 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.100
 their decisions 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:19.380
 so I said 2010 2011 and 2012 are the 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.730
 mandatory evolution of all 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.880
 world that aims to be a player 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.370
 recognized professional is you know 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.720
 deal with this study 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:35.159
 Sended your game and you know how to handle it. 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.290
 You know how to enjoy everything that 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:42.390
 galera is analyzing everything the 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:45.120
 This is annoying, you know how to deal with 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.489
 this image you know the consequence 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.310
 that you know why things are not 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.890
 to know why what he is going to do 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:58.110
 this analysis is extremely 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:01.290
 important is we are a sport 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.090
 individual and from the moment they 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.049
 someone starts to stand out somebody 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.989
 start doing more 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.390
 I could say do not do one more and if 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.099
 even start making numbers 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.680
 expressive 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:20.609
 you happen to be in evidence you 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.859
 become extremely studied and this is 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:27.000
 sometimes for many people can 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:29.280
 complicate it because there's a lot of too much 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.250
 player who has not 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.849
 can deal with this pressure situation 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.780
 Why did the base fail? 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.910
 missed the work missed the brick by 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.709
 Brick because when you get to that 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.359
 Moment is the moment that you're gone. 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.579
 wait for the moment you will be 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.030
 prepared in front of everything you've ever 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.030
 did 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:06.319
 then these three years 2010 2011 and this 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:09.140
 year is I learned a lot in that sense 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.030
 that he has, however, to understand 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.300
 the image that I pass from other people 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:17.000
 and their reaction to it and I go 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.720
 to work precisely in front of this 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.720
 reaction of people
