wilted and dead it's not that nutritious
on<00:00:39.640> your<00:00:39.940> plate<00:00:40.180> so<00:00:40.510> it<00:00:40.809> is<00:00:40.930> really<00:00:41.140> important

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.089 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:47.969 

organic<00:00:46.089> tastes<00:00:46.420> better<00:00:46.540> often<00:00:46.870> because<00:00:47.379> the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:47.979 
organic tastes better often because the

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:50.579 
organic tastes better often because the
the<00:00:48.250> human<00:00:48.699> palate<00:00:49.120> can<00:00:49.570> taste<00:00:49.900> the<00:00:50.110> pesticide

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
the human palate can taste the pesticide

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:52.799 
the human palate can taste the pesticide
residue<00:00:51.010> it<00:00:51.370> comes<00:00:51.610> across<00:00:51.850> as<00:00:51.940> a<00:00:52.120> bit<00:00:52.330> soapy

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
residue it comes across as a bit soapy

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.450 
residue it comes across as a bit soapy
have<00:00:52.930> you<00:00:53.049> ever<00:00:53.170> had<00:00:53.409> those<00:00:53.589> soapy<00:00:54.040> carrots

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
have you ever had those soapy carrots

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.979 
have you ever had those soapy carrots
and<00:00:54.640> you're<00:00:54.760> like<00:00:54.909> oh<00:00:55.150> it's<00:00:55.390> just<00:00:55.570> a<00:00:55.780> it

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
and you're like oh it's just a it

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.079 
and you're like oh it's just a it
doesn't<00:00:56.260> appeal<00:00:56.559> where<00:00:57.159> organic<00:00:57.430> produce<00:00:57.820> is

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
doesn't appeal where organic produce is

00:00:58.089 --> 00:00:59.700 
doesn't appeal where organic produce is
very<00:00:58.269> sweet<00:00:58.659> that's<00:00:59.049> often<00:00:59.290> because<00:00:59.589> the

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
very sweet that's often because the

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.110 
very sweet that's often because the
sugars<00:01:00.040> have<00:01:00.190> had<00:01:00.370> a<00:01:00.400> chance<00:01:00.760> to<00:01:00.970> develop

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
sugars have had a chance to develop

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.020 
sugars have had a chance to develop
because<00:01:02.049> we<00:01:02.379> pick<00:01:02.620> organic<00:01:03.070> produce<00:01:03.280> closer

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
because we pick organic produce closer

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.149 
because we pick organic produce closer
to<00:01:04.420> its<00:01:04.570> ripeness<00:01:04.839> stage<00:01:05.260> if<00:01:05.799> you<00:01:05.860> pick

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
to its ripeness stage if you pick

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.160 
to its ripeness stage if you pick
something<00:01:06.190> before<00:01:07.030> it's<00:01:07.330> really<00:01:07.659> ready<00:01:07.900> like

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
something before it's really ready like

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.620 
something before it's really ready like
those<00:01:08.350> wooden<00:01:08.830> awful<00:01:09.340> grayish<00:01:10.270> looking

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
those wooden awful grayish looking

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.289 
those wooden awful grayish looking
Tomatoes<00:01:11.170> that<00:01:12.159> are<00:01:12.280> often<00:01:12.610> picked<00:01:12.880> then

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
Tomatoes that are often picked then

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.390 
Tomatoes that are often picked then
that's<00:01:13.510> why<00:01:13.780> it<00:01:13.840> loses<00:01:14.260> its<00:01:14.350> flavor<00:01:14.530> Organic

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
that's why it loses its flavor Organic

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.429 
that's why it loses its flavor Organic
being<00:01:15.640> really<00:01:16.030> close<00:01:16.299> to<00:01:16.570> ripeness<00:01:16.780> factor

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
being really close to ripeness factor

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.230 
being really close to ripeness factor
means<00:01:18.039> that<00:01:18.280> that<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.490> sugars<00:01:19.000> have

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
means that that the sugars have

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.029 
means that that the sugars have
developed<00:01:19.659> in<00:01:19.780> so<00:01:20.109> much<00:01:20.289> sweeter<00:01:20.649> and<00:01:20.829> more

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
developed in so much sweeter and more

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.700 
developed in so much sweeter and more
delicious<00:01:21.159> the<00:01:21.969> mineral<00:01:22.390> content<00:01:22.630> also<00:01:23.200> adds

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
delicious the mineral content also adds

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.649 
delicious the mineral content also adds
a<00:01:23.890> huge<00:01:24.070> difference<00:01:24.609> because<00:01:25.060> there's<00:01:25.479> more

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
a huge difference because there's more

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.410 
a huge difference because there's more
minerals<00:01:26.049> in<00:01:26.200> organic<00:01:26.649> food<00:01:26.920> because<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:28.030> the

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
minerals in organic food because the the

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.630 
minerals in organic food because the the
Trichoderma<00:01:29.079> bacteria<00:01:29.560> help<00:01:29.890> to<00:01:30.070> chelate

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
Trichoderma bacteria help to chelate

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.690 
Trichoderma bacteria help to chelate
extra<00:01:31.149> minerals<00:01:31.329> into<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:32.020> plant<00:01:32.590> that<00:01:33.250> often

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
extra minerals into the plant that often

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.910 
extra minerals into the plant that often
embarks<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.179> sweetness<00:01:34.570> too<00:01:34.810> so<00:01:35.109> yes<00:01:35.380> organic

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
embarks the sweetness too so yes organic

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.300 
embarks the sweetness too so yes organic
produce<00:01:36.100> tastes<00:01:36.609> so<00:01:36.820> much<00:01:36.880> better<00:01:37.240> than

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
produce tastes so much better than

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.039 
produce tastes so much better than
how<00:01:40.310> is<00:01:40.549> red-meat<00:01:41.150> organic<00:01:41.600> what<00:01:41.840> makes

grain<00:01:59.479> so<00:02:00.050> that's<00:02:00.259> what's<00:02:00.530> really<00:02:00.920> making<00:02:01.040> the

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
grain so that's what's really making the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.800 
grain so that's what's really making the
difference<00:02:01.670> in<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:01.880> price<00:02:02.090> of<00:02:02.119> organic<00:02:02.630> meat

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
difference in the price of organic meat

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.920 
difference in the price of organic meat
versus<00:02:03.229> conventional<00:02:03.890> either<00:02:04.460> also<00:02:04.940> ensuring

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
versus conventional either also ensuring

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.780 
versus conventional either also ensuring
that<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.170> animal<00:02:06.500> is<00:02:06.649> not<00:02:06.979> injected<00:02:07.580> with

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
that the animal is not injected with

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.660 
that the animal is not injected with
antibiotics<00:02:08.830> antibiotics<00:02:09.830> helped<00:02:10.369> to<00:02:10.489> put

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
antibiotics antibiotics helped to put

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.220 
antibiotics antibiotics helped to put
weight<00:02:10.880> on<00:02:10.940> so<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.510> lot<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.750> conventional

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
weight on so a lot of conventional

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.930 
weight on so a lot of conventional
farmers<00:02:12.530> like<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.800> use<00:02:12.950> antibiotics<00:02:13.310> even<00:02:13.820> if

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
farmers like to use antibiotics even if

farmers like to use antibiotics even if
the<00:02:14.060> animal<00:02:14.420> isn't<00:02:14.750> sick<00:02:15.019> and<00:02:15.920> also<00:02:16.370> they<00:02:16.610> love

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
the animal isn't sick and also they love

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.330 
the animal isn't sick and also they love
to<00:02:17.120> often<00:02:17.750> use<00:02:18.080> things<00:02:18.350> like<00:02:18.560> growth<00:02:18.830> hormones

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
to often use things like growth hormones

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.240 
to often use things like growth hormones
to<00:02:19.790> potentiate<00:02:20.300> growth<00:02:20.780> as<00:02:21.019> well<00:02:21.290> so<00:02:21.769> organic

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
to potentiate growth as well so organic

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.520 
to potentiate growth as well so organic
farmers<00:02:22.760> do<00:02:23.030> not<00:02:23.060> use<00:02:23.480> any<00:02:23.750> growth<00:02:24.080> hormones

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530

it<00:02:25.220> looks<00:02:25.430> for<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.760> seal<00:02:26.030> because<00:02:26.480> they<00:02:26.600> have

system<00:02:40.819> is<00:02:40.940> kept<00:02:41.209> so<00:02:41.390> much<00:02:41.510> higher<00:02:41.780> when

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
system is kept so much higher when

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.750 
system is kept so much higher when
they're<00:02:42.500> able<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.769> peck<00:02:43.070> around<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.519> yard

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.590 
when they're able to eat a natural diet
we've<00:02:46.250> really<00:02:46.579> seen<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.030> difference<00:02:47.390> when

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
we've really seen the difference when

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.569 
we've really seen the difference when
they're<00:02:47.750> caged<00:02:48.079> up<00:02:48.350> in<00:02:48.500> tight<00:02:48.769> containers<00:02:49.340> so

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
they're caged up in tight containers so

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.190 
they're caged up in tight containers so
that's<00:02:49.760> a<00:02:49.910> big<00:02:50.060> thing<00:02:50.299> the<00:02:50.540> certified<00:02:50.959> organic

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
that's a big thing the certified organic

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.620 
that's a big thing the certified organic
is<00:02:51.590> that<00:02:52.010> they're<00:02:52.370> living<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:52.850> more<00:02:53.090> natural

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
is that they're living a more natural

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.660 
is that they're living a more natural
environment<00:02:53.780> like<00:02:54.440> they<00:02:54.590> did<00:02:54.769> 50<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.310> 100

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
stress enough the importance of organic

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.900 
stress enough the importance of organic
dairy<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:03.710> reason<00:03:04.040> why<00:03:04.160> is<00:03:04.220> because<00:03:04.400> the

dairy and reason why is because the

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.090 
dairy and reason why is because the

translates into the milk much more

translates into the milk much more

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
readily and that's where you eat a piece

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.830 
readily and that's where you eat a piece
of<00:03:30.380> cheese<00:03:33.730> cheese<00:03:34.730> this<00:03:35.180> is<00:03:35.330> a<00:03:35.480> highly

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
of cheese cheese this is a highly

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.720 
of cheese cheese this is a highly
concentrated<00:03:36.140> thing<00:03:36.740> that's<00:03:37.310> why<00:03:37.460> I<00:03:37.490> say<00:03:37.670> if

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
concentrated thing that's why I say if

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.400 
concentrated thing that's why I say if
you're<00:03:37.940> gonna<00:03:38.060> buy<00:03:38.330> anything<00:03:38.660> organic<00:03:39.260> food

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.350 
you're gonna buy anything organic food
it's<00:03:39.620> most<00:03:39.890> critical<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.460> buy<00:03:40.580> dairy<00:03:41.060> and

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
it's most critical to buy dairy and

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.240 
it's most critical to buy dairy and
meats<00:03:41.690> organically<00:03:42.470> because<00:03:42.860> it's<00:03:43.010> at<00:03:43.130> the
