00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.010
Oh hey there.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.650
You want to get a side swept hairstyle?

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.660
That's great because I'm going to show you
how to do this side swept pixie right now.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.619
Let's get started.

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.180
Alright as you know, I love to and encourage
you all to prime your hair before you use

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.660
any type hot tools.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.210
Today, I'm using Head Rush from Bed Head and
this is basically like a very light weight

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.970
shine spray so this is an alternative to using
a gloss or a serum.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.769
I'm just going to spray it on my ends just
to kind of add a little bit of shine and also

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.910
protect my hair from the hot flat iron.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.950
You want to avoid the roots guys because you
don't want your roots to get all glossy and

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.089
greasy.

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.080
Don't hit your roots with this shine spray.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.559
Now that I've primed my hair with some protective
shine spray, I can flat iron.

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.900
This is the most none invasive style you guys
so I want to preface that.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.190
Do not over think this.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.010
You don't want to curl every hair.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.410
You don't want it to be neat and orderly or
your hair's going to look too symmetrical

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.080
and uniform and that is like the opposite
of what this hairstyle is.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.570
So I'm just going to dive right in and start
curling and twisting different sections of

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.350
hair, all different directions, and there
is no rhyme or reason to it so don't try and

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.350
make sense of it.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.350
Just go with it.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.040
So I'm mainly going to focus on curling just
in this Mohawk section and I'll worry about

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.980
adding any type of wave or curls to the rest
of it later so like I said, no rhyme or reason,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.990
just go for it, but to kind of create that
height and volume, always over direct so I'm

00:01:50.990 --> 00:02:02.670
going to pull this way if I'm having it lay
the other way.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:18.420
So as you can see, I just kind of went with
it so instead of few curls going this way,

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.530
a few that way, change the direction that
you're holding your flat iron or your curling

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.530
iron.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.200
And that's going to add a lot of like conflicting
layers and shapes.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.480
And that's what kind of gives it that like
really tousled, messy, swept hair look so

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.480
there you have it.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.180
Like basically, no rules, don't overthink
it.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.389
I just curled my hair all different directions.

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.790
You've got some pieces going this way, some
going that way.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.029
They're not even perfectly curled.

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:53.110
They're kind of straight on the ends and that's
what gives it that like effortless like crazy,

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.529
chaotic, tousled look, like the more you over
think it, the more symmetrical and uniform

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:03.290
it's going to look, which is not going to
achieve the tousled.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.939
This little Mohawk section is obviously where
you want to spend your most attention and

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:13.680
effort, but once you're done with that area,
you can do a few little layers along the top.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.730
You don't want to like curl all of this because
your hair will poof up and kind of get like

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.769
a helmet so just do like a few little areas
and twist them and curl them in alternating

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:25.769
ways.

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.739
So I'm going to go this way, I'm going to
go that way.

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.519
Just like a little bit so it looks like you
kind of have it consistent wave going throughout

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:35.519
your whole head.

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.299
So yes, I mean really, you don't want to overthink
it.

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:45.989
I can't say that enough, but you can see some
body and some shape in there.

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.980
And then leave it alone and we're going to
finish it off with some products so shocker,

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.059
spray wax.

00:03:53.059 --> 00:04:00.250
I'm going to finish this on my ends only and
then you can kind of mess until you get it

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.230
to shape and lay the way that you want.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.000
So sometimes your hair isn't very cooperative
and that's when you can bring in back up like

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.469
a comb.

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:14.060
So I'll take a mirror and kind of look and
spot check to see if there's any gaps or holes

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.060
or flat spots.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.340
Then you can use a comb to backcomb those
areas.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.531
Usually my flat spot is right in here so I
will backcomb a few areas, but sometimes you

00:04:24.531 --> 00:04:25.531
don't even need that.

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:30.690
Like I said, just this is the style that you
just let it do its own thing and you run with

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.690
it.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.980
And sometimes it looks different every single
time and that's okay, but at the end of it,

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.600
you'll have a very nice, fun, and playful
side swept hairstyle.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.090
And I hope that I explained it well enough
