00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809

which finally stronger and then I'll
kind<00:01:56.560> of<00:01:56.650> decide<00:01:56.950> you<00:01:57.520> know<00:01:57.640> that<00:01:57.880> now<00:01:58.090> is<00:01:58.240> the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
kind of decide you know that now is the

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.330 
kind of decide you know that now is the
time<00:01:58.360> to<00:01:58.540> start<00:01:58.780> like<00:01:58.930> bouncing<00:01:59.380> something<00:01:59.740> so

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
time to start like bouncing something so

I see the is-8 has gotten himself into a
rest<00:02:02.620> position<00:02:02.850> early<00:02:03.850> on<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:04.300> I<00:02:05.080> just<00:02:05.620> go<00:02:05.800> in

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
rest position early on and I just go in

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.490 
rest position early on and I just go in
fact<00:02:06.400> in<00:02:06.610> many<00:02:06.700> ways<00:02:07.060> because<00:02:07.540> you<00:02:07.960> know<00:02:08.110> I

damage between me and I know that in my

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.960 
damage between me and I know that in my
fire<00:02:23.349> rate<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.709> so<00:02:23.950> fast<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.400> I<00:02:24.519> can<00:02:24.700> put<00:02:24.819> two

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
fire rate is so fast that I can put two

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.320 
fire rate is so fast that I can put two
shots<00:02:25.209> where<00:02:25.390> we<00:02:25.510> transition<00:02:26.049> to<00:02:26.080> me<00:02:26.290> once<00:02:26.500> and

shots where we transition to me once and

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.300 
shots where we transition to me once and
now<00:02:28.330> I'm<00:02:28.510> not<00:02:28.720> so<00:02:28.989> excited<00:02:29.799> about<00:02:29.860> taking<00:02:30.099> a

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
now I'm not so excited about taking a

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.910 
now I'm not so excited about taking a
cock<00:02:30.489> from<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.819> ISA<00:02:31.390> because<00:02:32.079> the<00:02:32.590> object

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
cock from the ISA because the object

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.710 
cock from the ISA because the object
140s<00:02:33.280> armor<00:02:33.549> is<00:02:33.670> good<00:02:33.879> but<00:02:34.269> since<00:02:34.480> I<00:02:34.569> actually

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
140s armor is good but since I actually

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.479 
140s armor is good but since I actually
do<00:02:34.989> not<00:02:35.140> know<00:02:35.319> whether<00:02:35.470> he's<00:02:35.650> fine<00:02:35.860> ap<00:02:36.280> or<00:02:36.459> a

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
PCR I don't want to risk the chance of

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.830 
PCR I don't want to risk the chance of
him<00:02:39.159> after<00:02:39.280> shooting<00:02:39.670> me<00:02:39.790> one<00:02:39.940> more<00:02:40.120> time<00:02:40.269> so

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
something else now I see this conquer is

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.349 
something else now I see this conquer is
being<00:02:46.420> really<00:02:46.900> aggressive<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:49.060> know<00:02:49.150> coming

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
being really aggressive you know coming

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.199 
being really aggressive you know coming
on<00:02:49.599> from<00:02:50.349> the<00:02:50.799> east<00:02:51.040> side<00:02:51.310> I<00:02:51.579> get<00:02:51.849> shot<00:02:52.060> in<00:02:52.180> the

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
on from the east side I get shot in the

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.479 
on from the east side I get shot in the
baggage<00:02:52.450> but<00:02:52.660> I<00:02:52.720> know<00:02:52.810> that<00:02:52.989> you<00:02:53.680> know<00:02:53.829> it<00:02:54.190> can

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
baggage but I know that you know it can

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.020 
baggage but I know that you know it can
take<00:02:54.670> maybe<00:02:55.180> another<00:02:55.510> shot<00:02:56.670> if<00:02:57.670> I<00:02:57.790> run<00:02:58.000> into

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
take maybe another shot if I run into

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.509 
take maybe another shot if I run into
cover<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:59.530> know<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.829> mini-map<00:03:00.310> it

cover and you know the mini-map it

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:01.979 
cover and you know the mini-map it
wasn't<00:03:00.819> an<00:03:00.909> autoloader<00:03:01.359> so<00:03:01.599> I<00:03:01.659> was<00:03:01.780> kind<00:03:01.900> of

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
wasn't an autoloader so I was kind of

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.530 
wasn't an autoloader so I was kind of
happy<00:03:02.170> and<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:03.640> conversation<00:03:04.060> driving

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
happy and the conversation driving

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.830 
happy and the conversation driving
without<00:03:04.690> giving

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
without giving

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.199 
without giving
no<00:03:07.780> perhaps<00:03:08.780> about<00:03:09.019> like<00:03:09.410> who's<00:03:09.620> shooting<00:03:09.920> him

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
and I keep putting the building in

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.590 
and I keep putting the building in
between

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
between

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.750 
between
me<00:03:13.720> and<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.680> template<00:03:15.070> was<00:03:15.160> shooting<00:03:15.430> me<00:03:15.580> so

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
even now he's oblivious and gets taken

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.120 
even now he's oblivious and gets taken
out<00:03:20.200> there<00:03:20.860> quickly<00:03:22.170> now<00:03:23.170> I<00:03:23.500> see<00:03:23.770> the<00:03:23.890> leopard

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
out there quickly now I see the leopard
