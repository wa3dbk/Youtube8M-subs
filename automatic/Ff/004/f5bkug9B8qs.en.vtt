00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 Hi everyone , how are you? I'm going to talk to you today. 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.910
 5 foods that can help 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.910
 in your weight loss 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.960
 Have you heard of food? 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.990
 thermogenic foods are foods that have 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.970
 an auxiliary power property in the 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.199
 increase in our metabolism 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.410
 then as you ingest 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.090
 foods they can help in your 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.170
 weight loss process as you 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.149
 they will make your body 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.829
 spend more energy 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.230
 Let's the first food that cinnamon 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.730
 you can find in the pop form 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.129
 also that in her in stick 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.059
 you can use either one or 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.590
 other 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.149
 there was also paulo was one of the people 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.910
 used to make tea 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.440
 so you can use this 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.149
 cinnamon powder 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.980
 you can for example any 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.680
 preparation you make 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.300
 in the end i can give you a graffiti 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.770
 I like cinnamon 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.229
 so if you do this with the 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.270
 Frequency, this is going to be nice. 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.060
 the second element is the pepper you can 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.260
 use either the pepper itself or a 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.420
 pepper sauce 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.170
 even the mole can already be found 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.450
 the organic version that will be better 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.880
 still for your health and although it is 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.009
 more expensive but you can not afford one 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.450
 bank, no problem, you can play the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:30.299
 common is you can use it in the saline adi 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.810
 lunch there on top of the meat salad that 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.530
 will give a whole different flavor to that 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.180
 food 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.920
 the third food is nowadays and 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.600
 You 've certainly heard of it. 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.600
 You can use the ginger zest 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.970
 that the tea was not to make a south 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.490
 a tip of juice that I give is the juice of 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.200
 pineapple with a few until then and also a 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.750
 little ginger and it was very 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.250
 refreshment is the tip 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:02:00.090
 the food is coffee because it has caffeine 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.829
 this drink will also help 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.130
 in the largest energy expenditure by our 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.990
 body and the fifth substance is green tea 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.099
 basically by the same mechanism of coffee 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.080
 caffeine will then help in the greatest burning 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.090
 of energy through the body but until the end 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.760
 that I said because it is the most common but 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.340
 nothing in the cafe for example there are others 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.900
 compounds is not just caffeine that will be 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.269
 responsible for this mechanism 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.840
 Thermogenesis loves important here in 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:31.330
 coffee and green tea case you make it 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.090
 consumption of this beverage without 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.269
 sugar whats so easy you subscribe 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.010
 with me you drink like this 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.650
 you have an effect stated cheney but 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.680
 you put sugar means that you will 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.660
 hinder the process will void the 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.760
 positive effect that they could cause 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.250
 a single organism without sugar is 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.470
 It is important for you to use them 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.750
 only of any other substances of 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.060
 sand can be fed with 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.700
 supervision of a nutritionist because 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.920
 it's not all that can be learned good 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.660
 For everyone, it may not be 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.970
 interesting for you so I'll quote 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.980
 here are some contraindications for 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.010
 people who have pressure problems 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.690
 high and already the medicines and potentimos 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.239
 ie drugs that popular in 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.040
 pressure control to lower it is not 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.410
 indicated for example you use the 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.390
 ginger because you can intensify 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.790
 even more to be done on the agenda in 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.709
 Sinimbu and the person is beating the cultural 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.140
 low pressure 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.329
 coffee and green tea because it has 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.190
 although it also helps to increase the 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.340
 pressure for those who have 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.590
 High pressure is not indicated and the show see 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.690
 it should not be used 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.390
 by pregnant women because there have been studies 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.420
 that there is a relation of consumption already 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.450
 is called to report problems 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.510
 Neurological the party can not yet 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.450
 distance can not consume products 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.040
 that have the queue for example the coffee and 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.230
 tea time like I already said 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.690
 because in large numbers in the case of 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.900
 coffee in that in the people consume up can 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.569
 but have the quantity is controlled 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.709
 excess can not not not recommended 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.840
 then I see that there are some 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.269
 contraindications to cetec examples of 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.690
 hypertensive people of the pregnant woman because 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.709
 are more common cases but it is important 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.109
 warn 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.840
 and as there contraindications can 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.460
 be other you actually to 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.210
 instead benefit from the use of 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.849
 foods 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.160
 you can end up hurting yourself then 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:33.250
 if you are a member or pregnant or 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.550
 any other situation which requires 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.380
 professional care only uses 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.169
 these foods if you have had the 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.630
 okay now, not enough you 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.550
 consume a few zest of two ginger 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.009
 times a week and thought you would 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.780
 look leaner but not around 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.389
 It is important that you maintain a 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.160

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.570

 it will not be in this way to maintain a 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.840
 regularity you go both
