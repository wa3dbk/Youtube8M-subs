00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
that I'm going to be creating this time

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.499 
that I'm going to be creating this time
it's<00:00:10.320> going<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.530> be<00:00:10.620> in<00:00:10.710> terms<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.509> actually

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
it's going to be in terms of actually

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.990 
it's going to be in terms of actually
creating<00:00:12.630> an<00:00:12.960> airline<00:00:13.320> as<00:00:13.700> you<00:00:14.700> do<00:00:14.849> know

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
creating an airline as you do know

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.090 
creating an airline as you do know
there's<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.420> lot<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.990> space<00:00:18.710> space<00:00:19.710> programs

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
there's a lot of space space programs

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.859 
there's a lot of space space programs
out<00:00:20.279> there<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.520> mean<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.210> price<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
out there that mean the price of the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.929 
out there that mean the price of the
actual<00:00:22.260> space<00:00:22.769> programs<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.400> flight<00:00:23.580> space

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
actual space programs the flight space

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.200 
actual space programs the flight space
is<00:00:24.150> very<00:00:24.359> cheap<00:00:24.630> or<00:00:24.990> kerbal<00:00:25.470> kind

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
is very cheap or kerbal kind

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.689 
is very cheap or kerbal kind
unfortunately<00:00:27.210> they<00:00:27.390> don't<00:00:27.510> have<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.960> same

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
unfortunately they don't have the same

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.070 
unfortunately they don't have the same
luxury<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.789> being<00:00:30.000> able<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.330> travel<00:00:30.660> within

kerbal ironically enough the kerbals

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.350 
kerbal ironically enough the kerbals
were<00:00:33.600> getting<00:00:33.899> pretty<00:00:33.989> pissed<00:00:34.260> off<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:35.360> they

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
were getting pretty pissed off so they

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.940 
were getting pretty pissed off so they
have<00:00:36.540> created<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.020> challenge<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.469> course<00:00:37.680> to

plane has to be able to take off and

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.569 
plane has to be able to take off and
land<00:01:00.050> plenty<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.140> times<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:02.190> a

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
land plenty of times you can have a

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.460 
land plenty of times you can have a
solid<00:01:03.090> rocket<00:01:03.510> boosters<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.960> help<00:01:04.170> people

solid rocket boosters to help people

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.679 
solid rocket boosters to help people
stop<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.860> take<00:01:05.040> off<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.909> can't<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:06.360> any<00:01:06.600> of

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
stop and take off you can't have any of

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.390 
stop and take off you can't have any of
that<00:01:06.869> stuff<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.409> plane<00:01:07.619> literally<00:01:08.010> has<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.310> be

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
that stuff the plane literally has to be

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.520 
that stuff the plane literally has to be
able<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.610> take<00:01:08.760> off<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:08.970> land<00:01:09.330> as<00:01:09.540> many<00:01:10.229> times

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
able to take off and land as many times

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.710 
able to take off and land as many times
as<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.830> has<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.220> do<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:12.119> course<00:01:12.150> finally

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
as it has to do and of course finally

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.750 
as it has to do and of course finally
the<00:01:12.810> plane<00:01:13.049> obviously<00:01:13.560> needs<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.549> have<00:01:14.729> a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
the plane obviously needs to have a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.090 
the plane obviously needs to have a
docking<00:01:15.360> port<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:16.049> be<00:01:16.200> able<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.680> refuel<00:01:17.310> now

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
docking port to be able to refuel now

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.310 
docking port to be able to refuel now
once<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.580> do<00:01:20.759> have<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.720> capability<00:01:21.750> of

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
once you do have the capability of

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.560 
once you do have the capability of
refueling<00:01:22.890> for<00:01:23.549> example<00:01:23.939> I'll<00:01:24.030> show<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.270> mine

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
refueling for example I'll show you mine

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.440 
refueling for example I'll show you mine
here<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.930> mine<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.710> then<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.250> do<00:01:26.400> have<00:01:26.700> you

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
here is mine and then you do have you

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.880 
here is mine and then you do have you
can<00:01:27.630> say<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> permitted<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.590> plane<00:01:28.860> that

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
can say a permitted the plane that

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.560 
can say a permitted the plane that
actually<00:01:29.490> gets<00:01:29.579> accepted<00:01:29.970> into<00:01:30.479> this

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
actually gets accepted into this

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.539 
actually gets accepted into this
challenge<00:01:30.869> now<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.740> really<00:01:31.890> depends<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.430> your

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
challenge now it really depends on your

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.340 
challenge now it really depends on your
design<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.119> how<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.570> what<00:01:33.689> type<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:33.960> class

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
design and how and what type of class

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.020 
design and how and what type of class
you'd<00:01:35.009> want<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.340> design<00:01:35.579> your<00:01:35.640> plane<00:01:36.000> I

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
you'd want to design your plane I

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.300 
you'd want to design your plane I
decided<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.689> make<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.900> into<00:01:37.200> separate<00:01:38.100> classes

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
decided to make it into separate classes

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.830 
decided to make it into separate classes
so<00:01:38.640> you're<00:01:38.790> not<00:01:38.939> pretty<00:01:39.150> much<00:01:39.329> limited<00:01:39.720> in

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
so you're not pretty much limited in

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.660 
so you're not pretty much limited in
terms<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.170> how<00:01:40.320> strong<00:01:40.619> your<00:01:40.770> computer<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.430> of

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
terms of how strong your computer is of

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.740 
terms of how strong your computer is of
course<00:01:42.210> there's<00:01:42.450> going<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.630> be<00:01:42.659> a

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
course there's going to be a

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.139 
course there's going to be a
prerequisite<00:01:43.619> criteria<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.579> terms<00:01:44.759> of

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
prerequisite criteria in terms of

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.490 
prerequisite criteria in terms of
different<00:01:45.479> classes<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.960> higher<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.320> class

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
different classes the higher the class

end the flight at the moment your fuel
at<00:03:09.849> the<00:03:10.030> moment<00:03:10.360> your<00:03:10.480> airplane<00:03:10.959> runs<00:03:11.260> out<00:03:11.470> of

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
at the moment your airplane runs out of

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.979 
at the moment your airplane runs out of
fuel<00:03:11.830> so<00:03:12.489> once<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:13.060> run<00:03:13.390> out<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.599> fuel<00:03:13.810> you're

going to hit em flight and you're going

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.910 
going to hit em flight and you're going
to<00:03:15.310> have<00:03:15.519> to<00:03:15.730> at<00:03:15.849> least<00:03:15.880> post<00:03:16.420> or<00:03:16.799> put<00:03:17.799> the

flight so of course points are going to

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.150 
flight so of course points are going to
be<00:03:22.480> given<00:03:22.720> on<00:03:22.900> at<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.230> actual<00:03:23.500> total<00:03:23.709> distance

also post in your actual highscore post

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.289 
also post in your actual highscore post
your<00:03:53.410> actual<00:03:53.859> link<00:03:54.100> to<00:03:54.340> your<00:03:54.459> plane<00:03:54.760> itself<00:03:55.090> so

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
your actual link to your plane itself so

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.509 
your actual link to your plane itself so
other<00:03:55.480> people<00:03:55.510> can<00:03:55.810> download<00:03:55.989> it<00:03:56.319> and<00:03:56.410> test<00:03:57.370> it

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
other people can download it and test it

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.229 
other people can download it and test it
out<00:03:57.639> for<00:03:57.970> themselves<00:03:58.530> this<00:03:59.530> way<00:03:59.769> in<00:04:00.250> case<00:04:00.609> the

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
out for themselves this way in case the

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.000 
out for themselves this way in case the
actual<00:04:02.010> results<00:04:03.010> may<00:04:03.430> not<00:04:03.639> be<00:04:04.859> people<00:04:05.859> will

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
actual results may not be people will

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.470 
actual results may not be people will
think<00:04:06.190> that<00:04:06.430> it's<00:04:06.670> actually<00:04:07.030> a<00:04:07.060> true<00:04:07.299> result

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
think that it's actually a true result

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.240 
think that it's actually a true result
then<00:04:07.900> they<00:04:07.989> can<00:04:08.109> test<00:04:08.290> it<00:04:08.410> out<00:04:08.470> themselves<00:04:08.650> and

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
then they can test it out themselves and

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.000 
then they can test it out themselves and
see<00:04:09.670> for<00:04:09.850> themselves<00:04:09.910> how<00:04:10.420> that<00:04:11.350> is<00:04:11.590> going<00:04:11.650> to

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
see for themselves how that is going to

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.590 
see for themselves how that is going to
run<00:04:12.190> so<00:04:12.459> I<00:04:12.489> pretty<00:04:12.760> much<00:04:12.880> hit<00:04:13.180> my<00:04:13.329> altitude

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
run so I pretty much hit my altitude

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.720 
run so I pretty much hit my altitude
here<00:04:13.959> i<00:04:14.019> am<00:04:14.260> going<00:04:14.440> to<00:04:14.530> be<00:04:14.650> breaking<00:04:15.040> down<00:04:15.069> I

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
here i am going to be breaking down I

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.750 
here i am going to be breaking down I
don't

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
don't

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.400 
don't
burn<00:04:18.280> burn<00:04:19.280> up<00:04:19.520> so<00:04:19.940> we<00:04:20.930> are<00:04:21.050> going<00:04:21.230> to<00:04:21.320> be

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
burn burn up so we are going to be

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.600 
burn burn up so we are going to be
decreasing<00:04:21.830> altitude<00:04:22.460> for<00:04:22.670> a<00:04:22.730> bit<00:04:22.940> now<00:04:24.610> there

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
decreasing altitude for a bit now there

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.780 
decreasing altitude for a bit now there
we<00:04:25.820> go<00:04:25.940> altitudes<00:04:26.690> coming<00:04:27.020> down<00:04:27.280> we<00:04:28.280> have<00:04:28.460> just

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
we go altitudes coming down we have just

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.910 
we go altitudes coming down we have just
saved<00:04:29.180> our<00:04:29.480> actual<00:04:29.840> engines<00:04:30.200> so<00:04:30.440> that's<00:04:30.620> right

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
saved our actual engines so that's right

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.840 
saved our actual engines so that's right
and<00:04:32.980> we<00:04:33.980> are<00:04:34.070> going<00:04:34.190> to<00:04:34.280> be<00:04:34.400> leveling<00:04:34.700> out

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
and we are going to be leveling out

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.810 
and we are going to be leveling out
around<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.360> 15<00:04:35.780> thousand<00:04:36.170> meter<00:04:36.350> mark<00:04:36.650> I<00:04:37.010> did

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
around the 15 thousand meter mark I did

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.850 
around the 15 thousand meter mark I did
go<00:04:37.970> a<00:04:38.000> little<00:04:38.150> bit<00:04:38.330> high<00:04:38.510> top<00:04:39.320> speed<00:04:39.590> of<00:04:39.650> this

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
go a little bit high top speed of this

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.440 
go a little bit high top speed of this
is<00:04:40.070> round<00:04:40.630> 660<00:04:41.740> 625<00:04:42.740> to<00:04:42.950> 660<00:04:43.820> really<00:04:44.000> depending

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
is round 660 625 to 660 really depending

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.690 
is round 660 625 to 660 really depending
on<00:04:44.540> how<00:04:44.660> you<00:04:44.870> are<00:04:45.020> in<00:04:45.050> the<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:46.100> ascending<00:04:46.520> or<00:04:46.670> a

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
on how you are in the the ascending or a

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.620 
on how you are in the the ascending or a
descending<00:04:47.450> part<00:04:47.750> of<00:04:48.020> your<00:04:48.380> actual<00:04:49.630> flight

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
descending part of your actual flight

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.620 
descending part of your actual flight
path<00:04:50.930> so<00:04:51.920> that's<00:04:52.160> pretty<00:04:52.610> much<00:04:52.700> it<00:04:53.120> now<00:04:53.450> we're

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
path so that's pretty much it now we're

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.560 
path so that's pretty much it now we're
going<00:04:53.720> to<00:04:53.780> be<00:04:54.190> trying<00:04:55.190> to<00:04:55.280> break<00:04:55.550> our<00:04:58.570> actual

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
going to be trying to break our actual

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.490 
going to be trying to break our actual
or<00:04:59.870> get<00:05:00.080> a<00:05:00.110> little<00:05:00.350> bit<00:05:00.440> too<00:05:00.620> long<00:05:02.650> okay<00:05:03.650> and

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
or get a little bit too long okay and

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.920 
or get a little bit too long okay and
we're<00:05:06.500> nearly<00:05:06.650> there<00:05:06.770> were<00:05:07.090> 381<00:05:08.090> fuel<00:05:08.540> units

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
we're nearly there were 381 fuel units

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:29.129 
we're nearly there were 381 fuel units
so<00:05:09.490> still<00:05:10.490> got<00:05:10.700> quite<00:05:10.880> a<00:05:10.940> bit<00:05:11.060> to<00:05:11.120> go

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:31.619 

and<00:05:29.740> all<00:05:30.159> the<00:05:30.340> engines<00:05:30.669> are<00:05:30.819> still<00:05:31.120> going<00:05:31.360> so

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:31.629 
and all the engines are still going so

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:34.230 
and all the engines are still going so
that's<00:05:31.810> good<00:05:32.400> everything<00:05:33.400> is<00:05:33.520> fine<00:05:33.550> we<00:05:34.120> do

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
that's good everything is fine we do

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.439 
that's good everything is fine we do
have<00:05:34.419> 370<00:05:35.379> units<00:05:35.650> of<00:05:35.800> fuel<00:05:36.099> so<00:05:36.879> it's<00:05:37.150> good<00:05:37.300> and

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:37.449 
have 370 units of fuel so it's good and

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:39.239 
have 370 units of fuel so it's good and
I'll<00:05:37.569> see<00:05:37.749> you<00:05:37.840> guys<00:05:37.900> in<00:05:38.199> a<00:05:38.259> bit<00:05:38.349> this<00:05:38.680> is<00:05:38.919> a<00:05:38.949> my
