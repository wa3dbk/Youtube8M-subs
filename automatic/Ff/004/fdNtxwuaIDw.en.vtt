00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:11.539
 Hi everyone, I 'm here one more tip 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.690
 for easter 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:17.240
 I brought you a super cute card. 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.340
 card name it's slider 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.789
 because when you pull the two rabbits 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.369
 are and gives a kiss I found 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.279
 very cool here 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.710
 I want to be together with you when 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.830
 You pull the two of you give a kiss and 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.410
 Come on, I love you, let's go step by step. 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:40.010
 good first of all you will need 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.489
 in the mold indicated he recalls these 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.860
 two molds for you to see is easy, I'll go 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:50.269
 let the eye out for you on the blog 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.549
 after trimming I made it a day to 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:55.909
 not stay to give a better finish 

00:00:52.549 --> 00:01:01.909
 I used the bunnies on a piece of 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:04.699
 Sponge and the stamp that caring read me 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:08.289
 a little bit on the sponge and 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.460
 around the bunny to stay because 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:13.670
 this shadow 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.729
 it gets better finished this role than 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.859
 I used a pink does not give much to 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.880
 to see 

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:26.229
 but they get much cuter 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.789
 the second part is to cut two papers 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:32.030
 squares of the same size 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:34.429
 they will serve on the front and 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.799
 behind your card 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.810
 the first thing to do that draw a 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.859
 rectangle on the underside of my 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.039
 square 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:45.039
 I'm going to cut with rectangular stilettos 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.539
 ready the part that we will use the 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:58.479
 card is that 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:02.229
 this will be from behind and this from the 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:08.579
 front you will need to make 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:08.579
 people will paste pass the double sided tape 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.340
 the sides of your frame 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.010
 after passing the tape remove two 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:43.780
 parts you will stick on the side that goes 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.780
 stay behind your card 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:54.290
 this part will note that this 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:56.480
 part here was left with nothing that people 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.510
 going to do is going to need to cut a 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.310
 rectangle larger than your square 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.769
 that he's going to have to spend a bit of 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:09.700
 your card to enter this craft 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:13.129
 We'll stick ours with him later. 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.419
 in this part here on the card 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.419
 this entry is not 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:26.269
 one of the bunnies will be on this side the 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.780
 The other you 're going to thread, vetoing you. 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:32.269
 cut to fit right into your 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.370
 card 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.199
 after fitting you will see where it is 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.790
 that you will have to glue your other with 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:42.879
 He on the bottom card will get his 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.859
 Bunny 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:50.030
 so when you pull the card and the 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:53.319
 two will meet here you can 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.319
 write what you want 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:06.680
 I wrote to want to be close to you. 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:15.910
 Finally I'll stick a little heart. 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:15.910

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.379
