00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
fatsia japonica so this is native to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.679 
fatsia japonica so this is native to
japan<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.439> species<00:01:25.950> they<00:01:26.460> will<00:01:26.670> grow<00:01:26.880> over<00:01:26.939> 15

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
japan the species they will grow over 15

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.600 
japan the species they will grow over 15
foot<00:01:27.990> tall<00:01:28.229> my<00:01:28.470> tallest<00:01:28.710> are<00:01:29.009> probably<00:01:29.369> that

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
foot tall my tallest are probably that

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.060 
foot tall my tallest are probably that
easily<00:01:30.119> up<00:01:30.240> past<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.600> second-story<00:01:31.110> windows

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
easily up past the second-story windows

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.700 
easily up past the second-story windows
of<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.280> house<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.960> they<00:01:34.140> can<00:01:34.320> be<00:01:34.350> chopped

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
of the house and they can be chopped

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.560 
of the house and they can be chopped
back<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:35.310> you're<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.549> chainsaw<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:36.240> plant

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
back so if you're to chainsaw this plant

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.800 
back so if you're to chainsaw this plant
down<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:37.380> will<00:01:37.650> regrow<00:01:38.070> again<00:01:38.369> from<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.810> from

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
down it will regrow again from the from

a base of a stump I've seen that happen

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.330 
a base of a stump I've seen that happen
many<00:01:42.060> times<00:01:42.210> where<00:01:42.689> people<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:43.259> know<00:01:43.380> didn't

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
want them as big as where they were

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.910 
want them as big as where they were
growing<00:01:45.720> beside<00:01:45.960> their<00:01:46.259> house<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.530> they<00:01:46.560> chain

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
growing beside their house so they chain
