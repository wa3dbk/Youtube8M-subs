let's<00:00:02.790> learn<00:00:03.090> about<00:00:03.149> muscle<00:00:04.110> tissue<00:00:05.930> there

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
let's learn about muscle tissue there

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.190 
let's learn about muscle tissue there
are<00:00:07.049> three<00:00:07.410> types<00:00:07.770> of<00:00:07.950> muscle<00:00:08.370> tissue

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 
are three types of muscle tissue

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:29.620 
are three types of muscle tissue
skeletal<00:00:10.200> cardiac<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.639> smooth

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.970 

skeletal<00:00:30.630> muscle<00:00:30.989> tissue<00:00:31.019> has<00:00:31.559> a<00:00:31.590> definitive

skeletal muscle tissue has a definitive

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.689 
skeletal muscle tissue has a definitive
structure

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.119 

it<00:00:35.699> contains<00:00:36.269> long<00:00:36.659> red<00:00:36.989> cells<00:00:37.379> containing

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
it contains long red cells containing

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:48.349 
it contains long red cells containing
myoglobin<00:00:38.699> and<00:00:39.150> a<00:00:39.780> multiple<00:00:40.260> nuclei

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:48.359 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:51.450 

skeletal<00:00:49.359> muscle<00:00:49.719> also<00:00:50.199> contains<00:00:50.649> striations

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
skeletal muscle also contains striations

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:59.940 
skeletal muscle also contains striations
giving<00:00:52.329> it<00:00:52.449> a<00:00:52.539> striped<00:00:52.870> appearance

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.710 

the<00:01:00.950> striations<00:01:01.640> are<00:01:01.880> produced<00:01:02.300> by

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
the striations are produced by

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:10.630 
the striations are produced by
overlapping<00:01:03.290> protein<00:01:04.040> filaments

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
filaments called actin the filaments are

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.980 
filaments called actin the filaments are
arranged<00:01:26.930> in<00:01:27.200> an<00:01:27.380> overlapping<00:01:27.580> structure
