00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
the procedure of what I went through

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.230 
the procedure of what I went through
it's<00:01:55.170> kind<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.530> like<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.770> light<00:01:56.240> rejuvenation

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
it's kind of a like a light rejuvenation

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.789 
it's kind of a like a light rejuvenation
thing<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:59.630> brings<00:02:00.630> out<00:02:00.810> any<00:02:00.990> spots<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.619> it

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
thing and it brings out any spots and it

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.649 
thing and it brings out any spots and it
also<00:02:02.960> makes<00:02:03.960> lines<00:02:04.350> less<00:02:04.820> obviously<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:06.090> reckon

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
also makes lines less obviously I reckon

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.900 
also makes lines less obviously I reckon
that's<00:02:06.810> worked<00:02:07.049> here<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.649> maybe<00:02:08.250> these<00:02:08.520> lands

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
that's worked here and maybe these lands

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.940 
that's worked here and maybe these lands
here<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.239> i<00:02:09.539> think<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.840> skin<00:02:10.229> has<00:02:10.470> tightened

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
here and i think the skin has tightened

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.110 
here and i think the skin has tightened

Lydia said bad um it's similar to IPO

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.470 
Lydia said bad um it's similar to IPO
but<00:02:59.579> it's<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.760> little<00:02:59.940> bit<00:03:00.030> more<00:03:00.239> advanced

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
but it's a little bit more advanced

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.449 
but it's a little bit more advanced
because<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.930> can<00:03:01.049> do<00:03:01.170> all<00:03:01.200> skin<00:03:01.680> types<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.250> all

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
because it can do all skin types and all

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.009 
because it can do all skin types and all
hair<00:03:02.700> types<00:03:02.730> as<00:03:03.209> in<00:03:03.329> a<00:03:03.420> permanent<00:03:03.659> hair

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
hair types as in a permanent hair

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.699 
hair types as in a permanent hair
removal<00:03:04.489> IPL<00:03:05.489> can't<00:03:05.790> do<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.180> skin<00:03:06.709> tightening

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
removal IPL can't do the skin tightening

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.740 
removal IPL can't do the skin tightening
it<00:03:07.859> can<00:03:07.980> do<00:03:08.099> the<00:03:08.190> skin<00:03:08.400> rejuvenation<00:03:08.879> but<00:03:09.629> it

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
it can do the skin rejuvenation but it

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.390 
it can do the skin rejuvenation but it
can't<00:03:09.959> do<00:03:10.109> the<00:03:10.230> skin<00:03:10.440> tightening<00:03:10.890> so<00:03:11.129> it's<00:03:11.310> our

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
can't do the skin tightening so it's our

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.190 
can't do the skin tightening so it's our
life<00:03:11.549> sister<00:03:11.849> skin<00:03:12.030> tightening<00:03:12.480> yeah<00:03:12.900> that's

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
life sister skin tightening yeah that's

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.839 
life sister skin tightening yeah that's
the<00:03:13.349> difference<00:03:13.530> everyone<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:14.250> think<00:03:14.609> just

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
the difference everyone I think just

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.819 
the difference everyone I think just
under<00:03:15.150> there<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.750> tighter<00:03:16.109> that<00:03:16.560> so<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:16.739> think

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
under there is tighter that so I think

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.280 
under there is tighter that so I think
and<00:03:17.549> I<00:03:17.609> think<00:03:17.639> these<00:03:17.940> lines<00:03:18.239> here<00:03:18.419> are<00:03:18.810> not<00:03:19.079> as

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
and I think these lines here are not as

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.440 
and I think these lines here are not as
prominent<00:03:19.739> this<00:03:20.220> is<00:03:20.310> what<00:03:20.459> I'm<00:03:20.549> finding<00:03:20.910> Lydia

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
prominent this is what I'm finding Lydia

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.930 
prominent this is what I'm finding Lydia
thought<00:03:21.660> perhaps<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.349> same<00:03:22.590> thing<00:03:22.889> and<00:03:23.130> so

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
thought perhaps the same thing and so

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.370 
thought perhaps the same thing and so
here<00:03:24.269> we<00:03:24.329> go<00:03:24.359> again<00:03:24.599> we're<00:03:24.780> having<00:03:24.959> another<00:03:25.049> go

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
here we go again we're having another go

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.860 
here we go again we're having another go
and<00:03:25.880> what<00:03:26.880> else<00:03:26.970> was<00:03:27.150> going<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.419> ask<00:03:27.510> you<00:03:27.690> there

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
and what else was going to ask you there

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.059 
and what else was going to ask you there
was<00:03:27.959> something<00:03:28.230> else<00:03:28.319> I<00:03:28.470> have<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.709> think<00:03:28.829> I'll

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
was something else I have to think I'll

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.430 
was something else I have to think I'll
ask<00:03:29.220> as<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.519> go

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.920 

but<00:03:32.620> concentrating<00:03:33.310> on<00:03:33.430> these<00:03:33.610> lines<00:03:34.090> around

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
but concentrating on these lines around

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.410 
but concentrating on these lines around
the<00:03:35.110> mouth<00:03:35.200> today<00:03:36.070> our<00:03:36.100> babies<00:03:36.610> Lydia<00:03:36.970> yes

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
the mouth today our babies Lydia yes

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.940 
the mouth today our babies Lydia yes
because<00:03:37.660> that's<00:03:37.810> where<00:03:38.050> the<00:03:38.080> face<00:03:38.470> tends<00:03:38.740> to

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
because that's where the face tends to

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.400 
because that's where the face tends to
drop<00:03:39.130> quite<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.430> bit<00:03:39.640> so<00:03:39.940> if<00:03:40.390> it<00:03:40.570> does<00:03:40.780> that's

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
drop quite a bit so if it does that's

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.310 
drop quite a bit so if it does that's
what<00:03:41.590> we're<00:03:41.740> going<00:03:41.830> to<00:03:41.920> work<00:03:42.040> on<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:42.400> yet<00:03:42.670> again

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
what we're going to work on to yet again

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.600 
what we're going to work on to yet again
so<00:03:44.320> that's<00:03:44.560> what's<00:03:44.740> happening<00:03:45.070> and<00:03:45.220> it<00:03:45.370> feels

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
so that's what's happening and it feels

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.190 
so that's what's happening and it feels
shorter<00:03:46.030> today<00:03:46.270> but<00:03:46.480> Lydia<00:03:46.720> said<00:03:46.900> that's<00:03:47.080> just

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
shorter today but Lydia said that's just

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.000 
shorter today but Lydia said that's just
because<00:03:47.380> I'm<00:03:47.620> um

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
because I'm um

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.530 
because I'm um
going<00:03:49.670> to<00:03:49.819> hear<00:03:50.000> not<00:03:50.180> paying<00:03:50.390> as<00:03:50.510> much

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
going to hear not paying as much

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.210 
going to hear not paying as much
attention<00:03:50.689> because<00:03:51.140> I've<00:03:51.500> done<00:03:51.950> it<00:03:52.069> once

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
attention because I've done it once

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.160 
attention because I've done it once
before<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.700> it's<00:03:52.819> not<00:03:53.000> as<00:03:53.150> much<00:03:53.540> of<00:03:53.720> novelty

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
before and it's not as much of novelty

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.710 
before and it's not as much of novelty
and<00:03:54.680> i<00:03:55.250> also<00:03:55.489> just<00:03:55.760> asked<00:03:56.120> Olivia<00:03:56.329> what<00:03:56.599> would

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
and i also just asked Olivia what would

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.390 
and i also just asked Olivia what would
happen<00:03:56.900> if<00:03:57.019> someone<00:03:57.680> came<00:03:57.950> in<00:03:58.099> into<00:03:58.220> this

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
happen if someone came in into this

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.069 
happen if someone came in into this
every<00:03:58.670> week<00:03:58.879> and<00:03:59.120> you<00:03:59.480> know<00:03:59.569> what<00:03:59.689> she<00:03:59.750> said

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
every week and you know what she said

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.130 
every week and you know what she said
everyone<00:04:00.379> that<00:04:01.250> it<00:04:02.180> would<00:04:02.360> be<00:04:02.510> overuse<00:04:03.110> and

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
everyone that it would be overuse and

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.899 
everyone that it would be overuse and
you<00:04:03.379> don't<00:04:03.560> need<00:04:03.829> to<00:04:04.099> do<00:04:04.220> it<00:04:04.370> that<00:04:04.519> often<00:04:04.670> you

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 
you don't need to do it that often you

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:06.729 
you don't need to do it that often you
really<00:04:05.180> only<00:04:05.329> need<00:04:05.450> to<00:04:05.659> do<00:04:05.750> like<00:04:06.290> a<00:04:06.319> couple<00:04:06.590> of

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
really only need to do like a couple of

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.170 
really only need to do like a couple of
times<00:04:06.860> the<00:04:07.069> beginning<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:07.519> then<00:04:07.640> maybe<00:04:07.849> every

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
times the beginning and then maybe every

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.839 
times the beginning and then maybe every
six<00:04:08.269> months<00:04:08.780> yep<00:04:09.019> yes<00:04:09.680> so<00:04:10.310> that's<00:04:10.489> good<00:04:10.700> isn't

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
six months yep yes so that's good isn't

six months yep yes so that's good isn't
it<00:04:11.079> so<00:04:12.079> I<00:04:12.470> think<00:04:12.650> it's<00:04:13.010> working<00:04:13.250> I<00:04:13.579> definitely
