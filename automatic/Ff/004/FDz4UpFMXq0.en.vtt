lot of questions I'd like to answer one
of<00:00:15.960> those<00:00:16.139> questions<00:00:16.199> today<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.820> about

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
of those questions today it is about

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.580 
of those questions today it is about
people<00:00:18.359> ring<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.779> up<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.109> saying<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.439> their

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
people ring it up and saying that their

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.790 
people ring it up and saying that their
oven<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.039> actually<00:00:20.490> dead<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:21.320> lot<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.529> time

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
oven is actually dead a lot of the time

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.920 
oven is actually dead a lot of the time
it's<00:00:23.250> not<00:00:23.670> because<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.119> an<00:00:24.210> electrical<00:00:24.390> fault

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
it's not because of an electrical fault

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.220 
it's not because of an electrical fault
it's<00:00:25.140> simply<00:00:25.619> because<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.460> clock<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:27.029> not<00:00:27.930> set

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
it's simply because the clock is not set

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.250 
it's simply because the clock is not set
properly<00:00:29.060> and<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.179> way<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.420> test<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:31.019> is

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
properly and a way to test this is

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.220 
properly and a way to test this is
typically<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:32.189> would<00:00:32.430> set<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.880> oven<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.329> as<00:00:33.570> if

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
typically I would set the oven on as if

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.840 
typically I would set the oven on as if
you're<00:00:34.559> going<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.800> use<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.190> put<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.670> round

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
you're going to use it so put it round

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.209 
you're going to use it so put it round

to fan mode set the thermostat if you've

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.740 
to fan mode set the thermostat if you've
got<00:00:38.370> two<00:00:38.520> knobs<00:00:38.730> or<00:00:38.940> if<00:00:39.000> it's<00:00:39.120> one<00:00:39.180> knob<00:00:39.510> just

it's stable by pressing these two at the
same<00:01:17.880> time<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.689> one<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.049> these<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.770> go<00:01:19.920> up

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100

and down so it doesn't matter what it
says<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:22.170> what<00:01:22.409> should<00:01:22.770> happen<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.340> if<00:01:23.580> once

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
says but what should happen is if once

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.810
