00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
that movie sent us all back 50 years so

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.950 
that movie sent us all back 50 years so
I<00:01:45.840> think<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.380> problem<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.479> that<00:01:48.479> was

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
I think the problem is this is that was

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.679 
I think the problem is this is that was
Superman<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:50.759> outfit<00:01:51.180> was<00:01:51.329> at<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.509> hundred

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
Superman the outfit was at a hundred

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.030 
Superman the outfit was at a hundred
percent<00:01:51.899> fateful<00:01:52.409> know<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.740> was<00:01:52.829> pretty

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
percent fateful know it was pretty

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.499 
percent fateful know it was pretty
faithful<00:01:53.490> though<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.640> know<00:01:54.030> for<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> man<00:01:54.360> who's

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
faithful though you know for a man who's

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.609 
faithful though you know for a man who's
feel<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.689> little<00:01:54.960> pretty<00:01:55.140> things<00:01:55.320> but<00:01:55.439> let's

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
feel a little pretty things but let's

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.319 
feel a little pretty things but let's
well<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.799> think<00:01:55.950> dude<00:01:56.250> outfits<00:01:56.939> have<00:01:57.060> never

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
well I think dude outfits have never

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.780 
well I think dude outfits have never
been<00:01:57.570> 100%<00:01:57.780> faithful<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.979> superhero<00:01:59.490> movies

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
been 100% faithful and superhero movies

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.280 
been 100% faithful and superhero movies
yeah<00:02:00.030> but<00:02:00.420> they've<00:02:00.570> been<00:02:00.689> getting<00:02:00.810> closer<00:02:01.140> and

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
yeah but they've been getting closer and

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.389 
yeah but they've been getting closer and
closer<00:02:01.500> but<00:02:01.680> they've<00:02:01.860> been<00:02:02.009> getting<00:02:02.100> closer

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
closer but they've been getting closer

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.399 
closer but they've been getting closer
and<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.180> stylized<00:02:03.719> approach<00:02:04.140> has<00:02:04.320> always

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
and the stylized approach has always

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.170 
and the stylized approach has always
been<00:02:04.560> fairly<00:02:04.920> decent<00:02:05.340> Batman<00:02:05.729> always<00:02:05.909> looks
