00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 the beach is synonymous with sun and 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.890
 of sea 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.150
 it's the time of year when it's 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.429
 normal to wear clothes that do not 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.170
 hides that 17% of your body and that's 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.490
 also the time of year that will kill the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.070
 less super I can not reach my towel 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.720
 at super sand they burn super g of 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.250
 sand in the stop but it's mostly the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.199
 perfect time when you can review your 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.029
 course of ce2 to not forget the acquired 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.680
 of the past year but no I disagree 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.180
 it is especially the moment when you can 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.250
 take care of yourself is the gentle flow 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.080
 so here's how to make the most of 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:38.850
 your beach vacation and outsmart 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:41.070
 the little hassles with salt water is 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.320
 super it gives a dechilted hair effect 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.370
 after nonchalant sex at all 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.899
 haircuts but your hair in 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.289
 drooled during the year and you do not know 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.289
 too much why 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.640
 protect your hair before 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.079
 sun exposure to the sea or chlorine 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.089
 nothing more simple it is enough for you to have 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.219
 coconut oil in general only 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.100
 in trade in solid form but 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.570
 like life and 45 Â° roughly it melted 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.979
 trouble soon point your roots 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.080
 were hair will see him very 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.369
 quickly and be hydrate very quickly and 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.689
 especially even it is very easy to find 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.700
 it's the same island that's used for 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:17.060
 cooking in addition to protecting 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:20.390
 you will be gentlemen 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.770
 not bad even delicious I find and if 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.869
 you want indeed sun but at 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.880
 natural you can put lemon juice 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.140
 on your hair attention but especially 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.539
 not on your skin because it's 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.619
 photosensitive so that can inherit website 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.030
 in May on your hair in less than one 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.619
 half an hour in the sun you will find yourself 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.060
 with much lighter locks 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.899
 it's a lot cheaper than what you 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.659
 found in commerce 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.039
 and especially it's less abrasive ben it's 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.270
 not all busy with your hair must 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.530
 also take care of this skin yes 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.220
 especially that of your legs it looks like 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.530
 a cheese grater 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.520
 already because of empty space never and 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.990
 then because it's time to 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.429
 the year you show them the most so to 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.750
 do as much as you take pleasure in 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.159
 watch them to make you a little 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.030
 homemade scrub and have more legs 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.130
 sweet that you are 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.069
 you need or minimum solar oil 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.580
 50 or sunscreen minimum 50 and 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:03.560
 sand but does not start a little cream 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.880
 solar and a little bit of sand and 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.880
 rub everything on your legs 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.910
 the cream will moisturize and protect and the 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.420
 sand will gently remove the hides 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.030
 dead put on the backburner or a brown bone 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.450
 the young cdh gillot who's going to be 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.830
 jealous 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.239
 Well, it's not all about taking care of your 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.530
 hair your skin but protect you 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.030
 eyes who thought because the eyes 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.380
 it's important not just to see 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.970
 but also because you look stupid 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.140
 spent the whole day with the hand 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.500
 above the eyes as if you are looking at the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.769
 horizon 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.209
 even if I confess it has style to have 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.370
 a pair of unique sunglasses 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.720
 and terribly style and you need some 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.190
 nail polish the cotton buds and 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.780
 Kurds have a little bit of aluminum a 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.400
 pair of Scotch scissors and 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.530
 promotional glasses or pay a 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.090
 very low starts by protecting the greens 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.500
 with tape and the parts you 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.480
 do not want to lose my little advice 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.190
 never takes under glass like 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.450
 that you can at least hold it by me 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.549
 I chose Scotch furniture a 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.260
 little paper I can take masking 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.010
 tape of normal tape or chatterton 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.010
 this bone x 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.910
 once you've protected green tea 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.010
 deposit small drops of wernicke 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.270
 on aluminum be careful you have to go 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.290
 quite fast when to put the drops 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.730
 because otherwise it's dry 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.010
 once you have everything is small varnish 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.350
 near especially stencil takes in cotton stalk 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.000
 effect of different size weights of 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.350
 different circumference wherever you 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.640
 want to paint the advantage of the cotton stalk 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.890
 is that as it is a matter a little 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.870
 porous let's say you'll have some 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.100
 circles that looks a little bit like 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.020
 flowers to do as it is that the 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.270
 paintings to impressionists I do 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.890
 the same thing on the branches and 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.200
 look I covered the mark in 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.700
 whole you will mark the center of 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.410
 each of your flowers with a small 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.550
 black polish point that you will do 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.080
 with a toothpick 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.430
 so obviously I did not take the 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.989
 black varnish you neither do you have any 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.030
 black polish and toothpicks you can 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.739
 use a marker so you make a 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.270
 point in the center of every little rock 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.709
 cotton coffee stem to give 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.870
 the illusion that this is the center of the 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.400
 flower in a slightly fuzzy effect 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.050
 artistic liberty 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.150
 so you can make flowers of 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.220
 peas or beats stripes and to 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.720
 Dexterity allows you to do that 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.790
 exactly like nail art except that the 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.530
 surface to be painted is even smaller 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.209
 and next week I will 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.100
 will learn to do the same thing on a 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.320
 grain of rice once it is finished 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.269
 you can cover everything with a top coat 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.580
 transparent or website has no respect for 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.320
 your motive does not cover so you do 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.250
 as you want and arm roof of patience and 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:17.019
 drying up there and here's a pair 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.720
 extremely sunglasses 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.280
 original that no one will have here I do not 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.479
 wink at you where you have not 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.610
 seen because I have sunglasses 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.650
 but the beach is also and sometimes 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.490
 some galleys for example when you 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.090
 have to leave business without 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.370
 oversight 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.110
 ok that's where you keep the 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.850

 come back and this is yours 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.680
 having to do watch tours for 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.960
 watch the business have sand 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.310
 in art is a name by cons I 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.139
 no tutorial to remove the sand from 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.510
 the arena is proved by the m Haiti has 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.500
 nothing to do to avoid panicking 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.330
 when you leave business on the 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.530
 beach when you go to paddle uses the 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.970
 plastic of a sanitary napkin 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.820
 to store your important papers

 money that suits him is graffiti 210 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.639
 valentino already that will avoid the eventual 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.229
 splash of water but more 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:06.190
 will deter bad people 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.190
 to poke something 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.500
 I had twelve thousand euros in small 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.060
 cuts in there to protect 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.550
 larger personal effects like 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.140

 guide and a prince cutter has it well and 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:30.550

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.980
 flasks and this down to the bottom and who can 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:41.020
 Now put everything you want 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:42.730
 especially since it comes back and that's it 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.190
