 Statistical there is here as what is 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.850
 its purpose for downloading windows 10 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.330
 enterprise and want to evaluate the product 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.670

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.900
 operating system running 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.220
 currently 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.620
 so I can put 8.127 here until 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.280
 even windows 10 or windows 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.549
 8 point an update then down here I 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.560
 I have the option to choose conversion with 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.780
 the edition I'm going to download from windows 10 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.360
 enterprise I have two windows options 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.620
 must have prize lsb o windows 10 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:51.739
 enterprise 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:54.410
 yes this option of lts b what would this 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:57.950
 this version is from tsb it's a 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:01.130
 short for long term serve yes toast 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.220
 then it has to differ in 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:07.790
 relation to the non- tsb version 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.970
 this version even lts it has a period 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.480
 greater than the version 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:17.479
 normal is that we use or 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.720
 this version she is only receiving 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.970
 windows security updates she 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.979
 does not receive new features new 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.900
 resources is then a version that 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.690
 receive only security updates 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.070
 within a long period in the then you 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.900
 so there will not be updates 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.690
 frequent as we have in the version 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.820
 with this version here is to whom 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.169
 suddenly do not want to test new features 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.289
 what it is to install new features 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:46.219
 is a longer refresh interval for 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:49.159
 the operating system already summarizing 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:50.939
 This is the purpose of this version. 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:53.669
 lts b 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:57.710
 I'll select here the normal version is 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:05:01.499
 which we use frequently 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:05.729
 then he asks which version of the software 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:07.499
 c 32 or 64 bits selects the 64 bits 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.999
 as we go clicking it it goes 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:14.550
 loading here you should wait for him 

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:17.069
 finish in that piece to the part where it 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.270
 Neon carries the option that you are 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:21.509
 selecting here 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.339
