as to whether holding a car fob to your

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.650 
as to whether holding a car fob to your
head<00:00:27.559> actually<00:00:28.130> increases<00:00:28.820> the<00:00:28.970> range<00:00:29.180> by

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
head actually increases the range by

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.109 
head actually increases the range by
which<00:00:29.809> you<00:00:29.960> can<00:00:29.989> lock<00:00:30.380> and<00:00:30.619> unlock<00:00:30.710> the<00:00:31.070> car<00:00:31.340> so

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
which you can lock and unlock the car so

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.990 
which you can lock and unlock the car so

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
Andy you ready what distance are you at

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:48.759 
Andy you ready what distance are you at
now<00:00:39.879> 15<00:00:40.879> meters<00:00:45.460> so<00:00:46.460> big<00:00:46.699> thumbs<00:00:46.940> up<00:00:47.149> Jem<00:00:47.769> big

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
now 15 meters so big thumbs up Jem big

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.790 
now 15 meters so big thumbs up Jem big
thumbs<00:00:48.980> up<00:00:49.129> 15<00:00:49.519> metres<00:00:49.879> works<00:00:50.649> what's<00:00:51.649> the

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
thumbs up 15 metres works what's the

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.990 
thumbs up 15 metres works what's the
next<00:00:51.949> distance<00:00:52.749> 20<00:00:53.749> metres

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:08.470 

20<00:00:58.780> meters<00:00:59.050> works

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.190 

yeah<00:01:09.140> 25<00:01:09.770> meters<00:01:10.190> works<00:01:10.460> very<00:01:11.420> scientific

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
yeah 25 meters works very scientific

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.990 
yeah 25 meters works very scientific
method<00:01:12.620> here<00:01:12.980> we've<00:01:13.160> actually<00:01:13.340> measured<00:01:13.850> out

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
method here we've actually measured out

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.620 
method here we've actually measured out
the<00:01:14.210> distances<00:01:14.810> in<00:01:15.020> advance<00:01:15.440> and<00:01:16.930> final<00:01:17.930> one

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.550 

all<00:01:23.630> right<00:01:23.750> 30<00:01:24.440> meters<00:01:24.920> still<00:01:25.190> working<00:01:26.560> and

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
all right 30 meters still working and

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:36.190 
all right 30 meters still working and
again<00:01:31.690> is<00:01:32.690> it<00:01:32.900> working<00:01:33.080> chamber<00:01:34.720> no<00:01:35.720> it's<00:01:36.050> not

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
again is it working chamber no it's not

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.580 
again is it working chamber no it's not
working<00:01:36.680> so<00:01:37.160> 30<00:01:37.760> between<00:01:38.210> 30<00:01:38.480> and<00:01:38.630> 35<00:01:38.840> meters

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
working so 30 between 30 and 35 meters

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.120 
working so 30 between 30 and 35 meters
is<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.760> limit<00:01:41.120> for<00:01:41.480> how<00:01:41.840> your<00:01:42.500> remote<00:01:42.770> control

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
is the limit for how your remote control

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.320 
is the limit for how your remote control

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.210 

yeah<00:02:24.370> 20<00:02:24.970> meters<00:02:25.330> has<00:02:25.450> worked<00:02:25.660> yep<00:02:26.230> 25<00:02:26.770> meters

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
yeah 20 meters has worked yep 25 meters

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:36.200 
yeah 20 meters has worked yep 25 meters
hey<00:02:28.230> 30<00:02:29.230> meters<00:02:29.740> so<00:02:29.920> this<00:02:30.070> is<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.340> one<00:02:32.370> true<00:02:34.320> oh

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
hey 30 meters so this is the one true oh

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.120 
hey 30 meters so this is the one true oh
it's<00:02:37.210> worse<00:02:37.420> from<00:02:37.660> 40<00:02:38.050> meters<00:02:38.440> keep<00:02:38.890> going

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
it's worse from 40 meters keep going

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:52.940 
it's worse from 40 meters keep going
back<00:02:39.450> how<00:02:40.450> far<00:02:40.870> can<00:02:41.020> we<00:02:41.170> push<00:02:41.200> it<00:02:46.830> 45<00:02:47.830> meters

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.370 

it's<00:02:53.950> worked<00:02:54.370> for<00:02:54.460> 45<00:02:55.120> meters<00:02:55.630> keep<00:02:55.870> going

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
it's worked for 45 meters keep going

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.440 
it's worked for 45 meters keep going
let's<00:02:57.070> see<00:02:57.250> if<00:02:57.310> we<00:02:57.400> can<00:02:57.490> get<00:02:57.550> ruining<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.210> car

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
let's see if we can get ruining the car

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:08.730 
let's see if we can get ruining the car
park

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.130 

so<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.550> big<00:03:09.820> thumbs<00:03:10.060> down<00:03:10.330> there<00:03:10.540> from<00:03:10.720> jimbo

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
so a big thumbs down there from jimbo

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.170 
so a big thumbs down there from jimbo
which<00:03:11.350> means<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:12.070> actual<00:03:12.490> range<00:03:12.760> is<00:03:13.120> between

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
which means the actual range is between

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.630 
which means the actual range is between
45<00:03:13.990> and<00:03:14.020> 50<00:03:14.410> meters<00:03:14.890> with<00:03:15.040> Andy<00:03:15.280> holding<00:03:15.580> the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
45 and 50 meters with Andy holding the

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.360 
45 and 50 meters with Andy holding the
car<00:03:15.850> fob<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.360> his<00:03:16.480> head<00:03:16.690> trouncing<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.950> normal

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
car fob to his head trouncing the normal

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.210 
car fob to his head trouncing the normal
signal<00:03:18.730> range<00:03:18.970> now<00:03:19.600> one<00:03:20.050> reason<00:03:20.560> this<00:03:20.830> could

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
signal range now one reason this could

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.550 
signal range now one reason this could
be<00:03:21.430> is<00:03:21.970> bigger<00:03:22.450> than<00:03:22.660> D<00:03:22.840> holding<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.200> key<00:03:23.350> fob

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
be is bigger than D holding the key fob

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.730 
be is bigger than D holding the key fob
higher<00:03:24.070> than<00:03:24.790> normal<00:03:25.090> so<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:26.170> test<00:03:26.440> this<00:03:26.560> out

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
higher than normal so to test this out

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:36.840 
higher than normal so to test this out
we've<00:03:27.130> actually<00:03:27.310> elevated<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.950> at<00:03:36.130> 35

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
we've actually elevated and and at 35

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.580 
we've actually elevated and and at 35
meters<00:03:37.390> that's<00:03:37.660> actually<00:03:37.960> working<00:03:38.470> which

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
meters that's actually working which

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.170 
meters that's actually working which
goes<00:03:38.800> to<00:03:38.980> show<00:03:39.160> there<00:03:39.370> may<00:03:39.550> be<00:03:39.580> something<00:03:39.970> to

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
goes to show there may be something to
