00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.599
 for gary pool to buy clothes shoes or 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.910
 electronic accessories online is 

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:09.889
 a regular activity ensures that 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.530
 he prefers to wait several weeks for his 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:21.859
 purchase to pay up to three times more for 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:23.330
 an article 95 on average spends 80 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.970
 dollars that with taxes already 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.339
 in force plus the shipping border the 100 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.589
 dollars however now Gary will think 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.270
 twice if you keep your pace of purchase 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:35.240
 and is that the foreign trade committee 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.950
 set a new tax of $ 42 to 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.340
 purchases abroad that are 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.290
 perform under the 4x4 system ie 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.030
 the $ 80 of the initial purchase is 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.640
 adds the value of the shipment within the 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.920
 country of origin plus 5 percent to the 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.040
 capital outflow plus shipping to 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.560
 our country plus the 42 dollars of 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.310
 Comex to the end for your purchase of 80 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.510
 dollars would end up paying at least 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:04.989
 $ 156 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.909
 that's why I tried to stop my purchases 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.680
 a tax that for the president of the 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.259
 Chamber of Commerce of Guayaquil Pablo 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.630
 arosemena would mean a reduction of 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.130
 the activity we think not 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.380
 there should be a fee but in the case that 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.780
 you define a rate that is the same for 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.729
 all of that seems to us to be the most 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.409
 sensible towards things according to data from 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.810
 central bank of ecuador from January to 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.210
 May of this year purchases by traffic 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.330
 international postcard and fast mail 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.189
 exceeded 100 million dollars 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.380
 so the government seeks to reduce the 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.149
 micro-smuggling and thus protect the 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.399
 local industry to ask 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.920
 protection when we can compete not 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:44.319
 let's have the competition but to our 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.840
 own incompetence in addition to the tax 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:49.450
 of $ 42 buyers will have a 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.759
 annual quota of $ 1200 so far 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.929
 the comex has not made the new official 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.700
 resolution 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.700
