00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
fight the second fight was really close

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.930 
fight the second fight was really close
but<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.200> guess<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.220> give<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.700> champ

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
but I guess you give it to the champ

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.000 
but I guess you give it to the champ
right<00:02:12.180> but<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.810> thought<00:02:12.990> b-hop<00:02:13.410> won<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.800> first

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
right but I thought b-hop won the first

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.940 
right but I thought b-hop won the first
fight<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.550> also<00:02:15.000> thought<00:02:15.330> Taylor<00:02:15.870> lost<00:02:16.320> to

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950
