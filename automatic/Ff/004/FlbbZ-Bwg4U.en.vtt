00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
playing back that's the one downside of

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.850 
playing back that's the one downside of
watching<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.990> deep<00:02:43.170> ball<00:02:43.320> is<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.650> have<00:02:43.770> to

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
watching the deep ball is you have to

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.370 
watching the deep ball is you have to
account<00:02:44.130> for<00:02:44.250> everything<00:02:44.760> is<00:02:45.180> we<00:02:45.960> we<00:02:46.350> just

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
account for everything is we we just

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.350 
account for everything is we we just
don't<00:02:46.860> catch<00:02:47.160> interceptions<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.000> don't<00:02:48.240> know

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
what the deal is is I think that's

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.560 
what the deal is is I think that's
golden<00:02:50.010> tate<00:02:50.190> with<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:50.520> reception<00:02:51.060> third

killa kam chancellor or but i'm positive

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.500 
killa kam chancellor or but i'm positive
that<00:05:29.500> Thomas<00:05:30.310> Davis<00:05:30.550> comes<00:05:31.000> away<00:05:31.150> with<00:05:31.240> that

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
that Thomas Davis comes away with that

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.030 
that Thomas Davis comes away with that
interception<00:05:32.020> as<00:05:32.260> we<00:05:32.380> pick<00:05:32.530> up<00:05:32.680> the<00:05:32.710> sack

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
interception as we pick up the sack

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.110 
interception as we pick up the sack
second<00:05:33.580> and<00:05:33.700> 14<00:05:34.570> he<00:05:35.440> goes<00:05:35.800> through<00:05:36.550> his<00:05:36.760> tight

second and 14 he goes through his tight

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.779 
second and 14 he goes through his tight
end<00:05:37.360> i<00:05:37.600> believe<00:05:38.020> so<00:05:38.740> that<00:05:38.950> brings<00:05:39.100> up<00:05:39.310> a<00:05:39.430> third

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:39.789 
end i believe so that brings up a third

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:42.510 
end i believe so that brings up a third
and<00:05:40.090> six<00:05:40.479> and<00:05:40.780> for<00:05:41.410> whatever<00:05:41.590> reason<00:05:41.919> my
