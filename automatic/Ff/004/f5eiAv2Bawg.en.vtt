00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.690
 what is important is that right now 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.690
 we are seeing Ebola for putting a 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.500
 example the eclipse of November 3 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:16.049
 of the year 2013 from last year he dealt 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.060
 it happened darkened it came through the atlantic 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.400
 and concentrated in the north-center area 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.720
 the Africa where it has just exploded 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:28.199
 Ebola and the new outbreak of 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.900
 the epidemic in December 2013 and 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.489
 we estimate that the influence 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.930
 will extend up to 13 means four 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.210
 years because it is the time that always 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.610
 the eclipses last and will reach 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.469
 this area of ​​the world to Peru can reach 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.540
 to the ball we trust that no 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.370
 global alert because we already 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.770
 making us ready for 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.469
 agreement but if next year there is a 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.690
 eclipse of the sun that will occur in the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.010
 area that we know from the point of 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.850
 view of the zoo as the toilets 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.530
 or the health areas of Peru 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.300
 clear that our viewers have 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.250
 to know that everything is done from 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.469
 the presidential oath then 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.900
 the analysis tells us that there may be 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.840
 let's say some kind of epidemic there 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.659
 what to avoid next year 2015 like this is 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.600
 that is what eclipses do the reason 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.799
 why they exist is to predict what 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.020
 what is going to happen 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.640
 in different places of the world not only 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.590
 where you can visualize if not where 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.659
 it can be a kind of projection like that 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.759
 already then with this what will happen the 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.950
 October 23 we returned because we are 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.520
 a few days that awaits us 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.890
 in which we live in this part of the 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.659
 American continent to which we are 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.700
 specifically in Peru not only 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:42.610
 in Lima that is coming for but I say that 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:46.140
 comes for Peru let's say the need for 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.930
 worry about health 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.340
 for preventing epidemics from coming 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.340
 some kind of health crisis 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.830
 in 96 homes closed either 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.720
 several days that you can not advance or 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.239
 fumigate and they are becoming 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.010
 creators of this vector and 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.650
 distributors selling more housing 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:27.290
 and confirmed by laboratory we have 72 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.670
 and 40 to 72 forgive batangrande and 40 in 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.110
 look for it we keep strengthening the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.300
 on all the control measures and the 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.400
 and the reduction in us is different 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.230
 we are with the activation and in the rest 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.090
 of districts that was not qualifying 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.200
 that is not on yellow alert is all 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.200
 the region is on green alert
