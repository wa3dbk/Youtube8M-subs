there's too much work to be done so

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.910 
there's too much work to be done so
there<00:01:44.490> lies<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.119> dilemma<00:01:45.299> will<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.380> or<00:01:46.560> won't

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920

it<00:01:47.100> fortunately<00:01:47.670> for<00:01:47.880> us<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.329> very<00:01:48.630> fist

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
it fortunately for us the very fist

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.960 
it fortunately for us the very fist
should<00:01:49.259> be<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.560> day<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.920> videos<00:01:50.280> uploaded

so<00:01:51.509> we<00:01:51.689> should<00:01:51.840> already<00:01:52.079> know<00:01:52.320> or<00:01:52.799> we'll<00:01:53.100> know

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
so we should already know or we'll know

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.950 
so we should already know or we'll know
