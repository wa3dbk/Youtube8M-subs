00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:51.529 
already have both of those the diablo 3

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:52.779 
already have both of those the diablo 3
soundtrack<00:06:51.770> that's<00:06:52.370> something<00:06:52.550> actually

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:52.789 
soundtrack that's something actually

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:56.709 
soundtrack that's something actually
quite<00:06:53.779> looked<00:06:53.960> forward<00:06:54.169> to<00:06:54.349> from<00:06:54.529> this<00:06:55.719> and

00:06:56.709 --> 00:06:56.719 
quite looked forward to from this and

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:58.480 
quite looked forward to from this and
that's<00:06:56.870> it<00:06:57.080> I<00:06:57.110> guess<00:06:57.319> the<00:06:57.620> game<00:06:57.770> DVD<00:06:58.069> itself

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.490 
that's it I guess the game DVD itself

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.369 
that's it I guess the game DVD itself
must<00:06:58.639> had<00:06:58.819> the<00:06:58.909> key<00:06:59.089> to<00:06:59.240> unlock<00:06:59.539> the<00:06:59.749> end<00:07:00.199> game

00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:00.379 
must had the key to unlock the end game
