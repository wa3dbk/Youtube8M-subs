00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.370 
that that are all landing at different
places<00:02:07.940> and<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:08.600> can<00:02:08.720> see<00:02:08.869> I<00:02:08.899> got<00:02:09.110> them<00:02:09.259> all

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
places and you can see I got them all

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.290 
places and you can see I got them all
going<00:02:09.740> right<00:02:09.920> now<00:02:10.130> but<00:02:10.520> there's<00:02:10.940> always<00:02:11.150> a

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
going right now but there's always a

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.900 
going right now but there's always a
little<00:02:11.480> bit<00:02:11.750> of<00:02:11.900> fine-tuning<00:02:12.730> towards<00:02:13.730> the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
little bit of fine-tuning towards the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.240 
little bit of fine-tuning towards the
time<00:02:14.180> that<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:14.630> get<00:02:15.050> them<00:02:15.200> in<00:02:15.380> there<00:02:15.530> and<00:02:16.100> they

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
time that you get them in there and they

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.830 
time that you get them in there and they
keep<00:02:16.430> pouring<00:02:16.760> stuff<00:02:17.000> on<00:02:17.210> you<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.510> keep<00:02:17.660> it

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
keep pouring stuff on you to keep it

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.040 
keep pouring stuff on you to keep it
interesting<00:02:18.190> so<00:02:19.190> as<00:02:20.090> you<00:02:20.270> can<00:02:20.390> see<00:02:20.570> I<00:02:20.600> got<00:02:20.870> some

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
interesting so as you can see I got some

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.840 
interesting so as you can see I got some
issues<00:02:21.200> right<00:02:21.560> now<00:02:21.770> but<00:02:22.310> it<00:02:22.400> looks<00:02:22.550> like<00:02:22.700> it

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
issues right now but it looks like it

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.480 
issues right now but it looks like it
may<00:02:23.000> work<00:02:23.210> itself<00:02:23.600> out<00:02:24.190> this<00:02:25.190> one<00:02:25.400> is

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
may work itself out this one is

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.450 
may work itself out this one is
definitely<00:02:25.640> going<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.060> have<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.300> get<00:02:26.450> rerouted

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
definitely going to have to get rerouted

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:36.820 
definitely going to have to get rerouted
so<00:02:28.460> I<00:02:28.490> have<00:02:28.700> two<00:02:28.820> rear<00:02:29.000> out<00:02:29.210> him<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:35.830> then

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
so I have two rear out him and then

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.240 
so I have two rear out him and then
rewrite<00:02:37.220> them<00:02:37.370> throughout<00:02:38.270> this<00:02:38.510> guy<00:02:38.750> too

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
rewrite them throughout this guy too

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.860 
rewrite them throughout this guy too
that's<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.400> way<00:02:40.520> it<00:02:40.640> works<00:02:40.850> it's<00:02:41.150> it's<00:02:41.660> not

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
that's the way it works it's it's not

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.420 
that's the way it works it's it's not
the<00:02:42.140> hardest<00:02:42.470> but<00:02:42.890> it<00:02:43.010> is<00:02:43.160> definitely<00:02:44.110> oops

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
the hardest but it is definitely oops

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.290 
the hardest but it is definitely oops
nope<00:02:46.430> that's<00:02:46.790> not<00:02:46.970> right<00:02:48.490> so<00:02:49.490> actually<00:02:49.880> I've

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
nope that's not right so actually I've

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.020 
nope that's not right so actually I've
got<00:02:50.510> three<00:02:50.810> helicopters<00:02:51.260> on<00:02:51.680> top<00:02:51.920> of<00:02:52.220> on<00:02:52.760> top

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
got three helicopters on top of on top

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.420 
got three helicopters on top of on top
of<00:02:53.270> the<00:02:53.450> four<00:02:53.690> planes<00:02:54.020> so<00:02:54.350> seven<00:02:55.280> different

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
of the four planes so seven different

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.050 
of the four planes so seven different
things<00:02:55.880> that<00:02:56.030> I<00:02:56.150> got<00:02:56.330> to<00:02:56.420> keep<00:02:56.540> track<00:02:56.840> of<00:02:56.900> and

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
things that I got to keep track of and

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.340 
things that I got to keep track of and
some<00:02:59.060> of<00:02:59.090> these<00:02:59.239> things<00:02:59.480> don't<00:02:59.750> move<00:03:00.050> very

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
some of these things don't move very

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.790 
some of these things don't move very
quickly<00:03:01.250> so<00:03:02.239> and<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:02.930> can<00:03:03.080> see<00:03:03.260> I<00:03:03.290> got<00:03:03.590> like<00:03:03.770> a

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
quickly so and you can see I got like a

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.350 
quickly so and you can see I got like a
little<00:03:03.920> traffic<00:03:04.310> thing<00:03:04.700> going<00:03:04.970> on<00:03:05.060> here<00:03:05.120> I'm

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360

little traffic thing going on here I'm
not<00:03:05.480> even<00:03:05.660> sure<00:03:05.690> what's<00:03:05.930> coming<00:03:06.050> out<00:03:06.260> of<00:03:06.290> the

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
not even sure what's coming out of the

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.699 
not even sure what's coming out of the
corner<00:03:06.739> there<00:03:07.330> so<00:03:08.330> that's<00:03:09.110> going<00:03:09.410> to<00:03:09.470> have<00:03:09.680> to

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
corner there so that's going to have to

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:18.130
