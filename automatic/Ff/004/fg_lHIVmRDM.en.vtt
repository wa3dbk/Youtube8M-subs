00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
against then we've got two passers now

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.530 
against then we've got two passers now
the<00:00:32.160> pastures<00:00:32.669> are<00:00:32.790> pretty<00:00:33.030> they<00:00:33.329> play<00:00:33.510> a

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
the pastures are pretty they play a

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.479 
the pastures are pretty they play a
pretty<00:00:33.719> important<00:00:34.140> role<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.739> drill<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.460> I

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
pretty important role in this drill so I

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.190 
pretty important role in this drill so I
probably<00:00:35.790> recommend<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.450> these<00:00:36.570> passers<00:00:36.989> be

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
probably recommend that these passers be

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.170 
probably recommend that these passers be
coaches<00:00:37.739> at<00:00:37.920> least<00:00:38.219> until<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.670> drills<00:00:38.910> kind

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
coaches at least until the drills kind

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.970 
coaches at least until the drills kind
of<00:00:39.270> up<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.719> running<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.559> here's<00:00:40.829> how<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980

of up and running so here's how the
drill<00:00:41.250> looks<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:42.420> start<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.809> drill<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
drill looks to start the drill the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.080 
drill looks to start the drill the
forward<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.399> corner<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.730> going<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.910> take<00:00:45.059> a

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
couple steps out with the puck and then

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.229

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.569 
late of a start this defenseman gets
making<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.170> control<00:01:43.590> what<00:01:44.399> type

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
making it so that you control what type

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.859 
making it so that you control what type
of<00:01:44.700> angle<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.060> defense<00:01:45.390> was<00:01:45.540> going<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.720> need

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
of angle that defense was going to need

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.230 
of angle that defense was going to need
to<00:01:45.960> take<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.950> forward<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.549> keep<00:01:47.759> him<00:01:48.000> wide

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
to take on this forward to keep him wide

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.749 
to take on this forward to keep him wide
so<00:01:49.020> after<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.680> passes<00:01:50.040> made<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.369> defenseman

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
so after the passes made the defenseman

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.749 
so after the passes made the defenseman
goes<00:01:51.509> out<00:01:51.810> cuts<00:01:52.320> down<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.710> angle<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.189> then

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
goes out cuts down the angle and then

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.870 
goes out cuts down the angle and then
drives<00:01:54.450> back<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.259> net<00:01:55.549> trying<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.729> keep

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
drives back to the net trying to keep

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.660 
drives back to the net trying to keep
that<00:01:57.060> forward<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.750> outside<00:01:58.189> so<00:01:59.189> that's

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
that forward to the outside so that's

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.249 
that forward to the outside so that's
where<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.119> angling<00:02:00.450> portion<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:00.990> comes

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
where the angling portion of this comes

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.120 
where the angling portion of this comes
in

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
in

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.069 
in
if<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.549> defenseman<00:02:02.820> plays<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.390> right<00:02:03.600> he

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
if the defenseman plays it right he

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.410 
if the defenseman plays it right he
should<00:02:04.259> be<00:02:04.350> able<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.619> keep<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.790> forward

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
should be able to keep that that forward

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.910 
should be able to keep that that forward
to<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.840> outside<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.590> perimeter

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
to the outside to the perimeter

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.279 
to the outside to the perimeter
basically<00:02:08.550> cutting<00:02:09.239> down<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.690> angle<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.080> the

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
basically cutting down that angle to the

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.760 
basically cutting down that angle to the
post<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.860> not<00:02:11.069> at<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.220> forward

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
post and not at the forward

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.110 
post and not at the forward
to<00:02:11.890> cross<00:02:12.160> in<00:02:12.340> front<00:02:12.370> of<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.670> net<00:02:12.820> and<00:02:12.940> take

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
to cross in front of the net and take

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.410 
to cross in front of the net and take
that<00:02:13.270> shot<00:02:13.570> so<00:02:14.380> that's<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.520> drive<00:02:15.790> drill<00:02:16.150> race

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
that shot so that's the drive drill race

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.900 
that shot so that's the drive drill race
and<00:02:16.750> very<00:02:17.530> good<00:02:17.710> drill<00:02:17.920> really<00:02:18.370> simple<00:02:18.790> but

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
and very good drill really simple but

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.310 
and very good drill really simple but
effective<00:02:19.120> obviously<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.930> same<00:02:20.140> things

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
effective obviously the same things

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.230 
effective obviously the same things
going<00:02:20.560> on<00:02:20.620> on<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.890> other<00:02:20.920> side<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.550> as<00:02:22.090> soon

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
going on on the other side and as soon

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.330 
going on on the other side and as soon
as<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.510> players<00:02:23.260> finish<00:02:23.590> they<00:02:23.800> just<00:02:24.010> line<00:02:24.190> up

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
as the players finish they just line up

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.130 
as the players finish they just line up
in<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:24.520> other<00:02:24.640> corner<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.750> drill<00:02:25.930> keeps

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
in the other corner and the drill keeps

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.380 
in the other corner and the drill keeps
going
