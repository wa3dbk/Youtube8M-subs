his stats aren't that great guys to be

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.530 
his stats aren't that great guys to be
honest<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.880> didn't<00:01:15.119> think<00:01:15.150> they<00:01:15.420> were<00:01:15.509> that

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
honest I didn't think they were that

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.080 
honest I didn't think they were that
great<00:01:15.840> um<00:01:16.259> they're<00:01:17.130> just<00:01:17.340> above<00:01:17.759> average

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
great um they're just above average

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.609 
great um they're just above average
which<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.930> guess<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.500> makes<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:20.150> like<00:01:21.150> he's

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
which I guess that makes you like he's

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.350 
which I guess that makes you like he's
11th<00:01:22.619> prestige<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:23.159> think<00:01:23.310> he's<00:01:23.430> like<00:01:23.549> 14<00:01:24.060> now

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
11th prestige I think he's like 14 now

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.340 
11th prestige I think he's like 14 now
but<00:01:24.750> he's<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.880> more<00:01:26.880> like<00:01:27.210> not<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> serious<00:01:28.080> gamer

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
but he's a more like not a serious gamer

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.350 
but he's a more like not a serious gamer
i'm<00:01:28.680> assuming<00:01:29.009> like<00:01:29.310> he<00:01:29.520> doesn't<00:01:29.970> quite<00:01:30.119> often

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
i'm assuming like he doesn't quite often

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.149 
i'm assuming like he doesn't quite often
but<00:01:30.750> he's<00:01:31.290> not<00:01:31.409> like<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.650> wings<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.070> redemption

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
but he's not like a wings of redemption

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.410 
but he's not like a wings of redemption
