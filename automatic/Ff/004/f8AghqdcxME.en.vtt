00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.920 
yes then we're going to talk about our
slows<00:03:32.010> which<00:03:32.610> would<00:03:32.910> be<00:03:34.519> 3/5<00:03:35.519> so<00:03:36.450> that<00:03:36.660> would

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
slows which would be 3/5 so that would

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.119 
slows which would be 3/5 so that would
be<00:03:37.230> 2<00:03:37.860> meets<00:03:38.220> per<00:03:38.640> weight<00:03:38.849> change<00:03:39.239> very<00:03:39.780> good

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
be 2 meets per weight change very good

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.789 
be 2 meets per weight change very good
you<00:03:41.129> can<00:03:41.280> see<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.640> mathematician<00:03:42.560> if<00:03:43.560> you

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
you can see the mathematician if you
