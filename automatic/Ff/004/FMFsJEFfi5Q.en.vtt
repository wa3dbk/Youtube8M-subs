00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:11.340
 first 2,000 kilometers we remind you 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:14.880
 the motor of our immense the 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.980
 parts are very tight and that's why 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.439
 that in the first 2,000 kilometers 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.640
 all these internal moving parts of the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.599
 engine 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.730
 let's say they are coupling to each other 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:30.169
 allowing the internal movement 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.169
 be much more fluid 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.149
 in the kilometers of travel the oil 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.829
 of the 500 kilometers 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.780
 they also do your lubrication work 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:52.760
 is also doing a function of 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.760
 filters to find much more oil 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.690
 we must always ride the motorcycle 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.479
 preferably in strength changes of 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.229
 Speed important never leave 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:08.350
 ride the third motorcycle in a cato 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.479
 overloaded on we struggled though it is 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.950
 normal can be barbecuer does not have 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.210
 no inconvenience is advisable not 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.509
 overload the motorcycle when you 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:23.140
 They are overloaded weights above 200 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:26.100
 250 kilograms that in some cases 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:30.130
 we see that people put him in the way 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.399
 third in the revolutions regime is 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.220
 very important not to leave motorcycles at low 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.950
 revolutions and have it to the fullest 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.740
 revs go and angels motorcycles and cent 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.670
 feel comfortable and hear yourself more comfortable or 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.319
 less between 3,500 and 6,000 revolutions 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.720
 trying not to always walk at the same 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:53.410
 rpm 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:02:02.890
 and let's say it's basically like 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:02:05.700
 the takeoff and take-off of their bikes and 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.700
 that abide
