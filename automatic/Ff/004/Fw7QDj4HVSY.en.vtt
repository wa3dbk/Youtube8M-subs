 teach how to plant tomatoes good what 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.069
 first thing we're going to need is 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.070
 for fruits 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:21.349
 or for fruits I have is with chile 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.910
 natural organic a pot with a unique 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.529
 down here 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.989
 because you have forums below is what 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:33.170
 important and water and gravel good maybe 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:35.899
 you have to put in the background as you can 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.059
 do so there is the hole there 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.489
 put a stone that more or less than 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.489
 space that water can drain 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.489
 quietly 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.110
 three centimeters 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.489
 and we miss your translator 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.300
 yes 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:12.969
 and organic fertilizer 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.400
 it is important 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.380
 other part 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.130
 and here I have my plant what I have most 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.950
 grown up pretty 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.600
 since it has more or less 17 centimeters 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.600
 that can be planted quietly 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.020
 carefully extract so that the roots 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.229
 daniele bathed 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.219
 the woman to get out and be able 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.219
 leave more easily 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.180
 here I am going to add another plant 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.910
 because this plant in a variety of 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.600
 tomato that is called my level the first 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.600
 Once I try 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.640
 planting this variety tells me that it will 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:46.920
 grow a lot that's why I 'm going to plant 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.920
 here were two attacked 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.740
 we plant we proceed to add the 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.650
 and nothing yes no 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.390
 that's all other thing to be remembered 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.370
 that if the template grows enough 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.370
 remember that we have to enter the 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.240
 the little cane 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.790
 of this size because it does not grow much 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:33.830
 this area and if you want a plant more 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.830
 big tomato the biggest 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.340
 well that 's all 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.860
 Any comment or question to the 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.860
 professional
