have two heat exchangers one the one
that<00:00:32.739> we're<00:00:32.890> looking<00:00:32.920> at<00:00:33.250> right<00:00:33.430> here<00:00:33.670> that<00:00:33.820> is

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
that we're looking at right here that is

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.869 
that we're looking at right here that is
not<00:00:34.150> insulated<00:00:34.870> looks<00:00:35.440> just<00:00:35.830> like<00:00:36.160> the<00:00:36.670> one

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
not insulated looks just like the one

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:38.610 
not insulated looks just like the one
over<00:00:36.910> here<00:00:37.390> that's<00:00:37.570> insulated<00:00:37.989> that<00:00:38.379> is

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
over here that's insulated that is

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.330 
over here that's insulated that is
actually<00:00:39.160> the<00:00:40.059> evaporator<00:00:40.860> but<00:00:41.860> let<00:00:41.980> me<00:00:42.100> start

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
actually the evaporator but let me start

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.650 
actually the evaporator but let me start
off<00:00:42.520> by<00:00:42.700> explaining<00:00:42.850> a<00:00:43.180> little<00:00:43.270> bit<00:00:43.420> about

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
off by explaining a little bit about

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
off by explaining a little bit about
this<00:00:43.840> heat<00:00:44.079> exchanger

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
this heat exchanger

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.049 
this heat exchanger
it's<00:00:45.190> a<00:00:45.370> plate<00:00:45.730> style<00:00:46.120> heat<00:00:46.450> exchanger<00:00:48.059> really

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
it's a plate style heat exchanger really

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.090 
it's a plate style heat exchanger really
got<00:00:49.239> its<00:00:49.420> nickname<00:00:49.570> from<00:00:49.989> Alfa<00:00:50.410> Laval<00:00:50.440> plate

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
got its nickname from Alfa Laval plate

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.740 
got its nickname from Alfa Laval plate
heat<00:00:51.280> exchangers<00:00:51.850> which<00:00:51.879> we're<00:00:52.390> kind<00:00:52.660> of

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
heat exchangers which we're kind of

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.270 
heat exchangers which we're kind of
bolted<00:00:53.079> together<00:00:53.199> you<00:00:53.530> could<00:00:53.649> disassemble

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
bolted together you could disassemble

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.240 
bolted together you could disassemble
them<00:00:54.370> a<00:00:54.430> pressure<00:00:54.699> wash<00:00:55.000> them<00:00:55.649> basically<00:00:56.649> in

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
them a pressure wash them basically in

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.459 
them a pressure wash them basically in
this<00:00:57.520> air<00:00:58.149> to<00:00:58.390> air<00:00:58.510> heat<00:00:58.539> exchanger<00:00:59.260> you

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
this air to air heat exchanger you

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:00.930 
this air to air heat exchanger you
one-side<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.010> plates<00:01:00.250> compressed<00:01:00.670> air<00:01:00.910> or

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
one-side the plates compressed air or

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.250 
one-side the plates compressed air or
the<00:01:01.149> other<00:01:01.300> side<00:01:01.539> of<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:01.660> plates<00:01:01.870> compressed

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
the other side of the plates compressed

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.139 
the other side of the plates compressed
air<00:01:02.500> it's<00:01:03.010> a<00:01:03.070> little<00:01:03.280> bit<00:01:03.370> hard<00:01:03.550> to<00:01:03.670> understand

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
air it's a little bit hard to understand

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:05.760 
air it's a little bit hard to understand
but<00:01:04.360> if<00:01:04.539> I<00:01:04.629> get<00:01:04.809> over<00:01:04.839> to<00:01:05.140> the<00:01:05.229> evaporator

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
but if I get over to the evaporator

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:06.990 
but if I get over to the evaporator
it'll<00:01:06.100> be<00:01:06.160> a<00:01:06.190> little<00:01:06.460> bit<00:01:06.610> easier<00:01:06.640> to

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
it'll be a little bit easier to

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.870 
it'll be a little bit easier to
understand<00:01:07.420> so<00:01:07.600> here's<00:01:07.840> the<00:01:08.020> evaporator

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
understand so here's the evaporator

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.550 
understand so here's the evaporator
insulated<00:01:09.880> in<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.090> foam<00:01:10.300> obviously<00:01:10.959> because

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
insulated in the foam obviously because

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.380 
insulated in the foam obviously because
it<00:01:11.709> gets<00:01:11.890> about<00:01:12.220> 35<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.240> 40<00:01:13.509> degrees<00:01:14.340> and

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
it gets about 35 to 40 degrees and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.029 
it gets about 35 to 40 degrees and
basically<00:01:16.390> like<00:01:17.349> I<00:01:17.470> was<00:01:17.590> saying<00:01:17.800> with<00:01:17.890> the

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
basically like I was saying with the

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:20.480 
basically like I was saying with the
other<00:01:18.190> heat<00:01:18.429> exchanger<00:01:19.030> you<00:01:19.179> basically<00:01:19.630> have

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
other heat exchanger you basically have

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.249 
other heat exchanger you basically have
refrigerant<00:01:21.490> on<00:01:21.640> one<00:01:22.209> part<00:01:22.509> of<00:01:22.569> the<00:01:22.720> plate<00:01:23.050> and

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
refrigerant on one part of the plate and

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:24.830 
refrigerant on one part of the plate and
compressed<00:01:23.950> air<00:01:24.130> on<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.369> other<00:01:24.399> side

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
compressed air on the other side

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.089 
compressed air on the other side
refrigerant<00:01:25.840> compressed<00:01:26.319> air<00:01:26.500> refrigerant

00:01:27.089 --> 00:01:27.099 
refrigerant compressed air refrigerant

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:28.800 
refrigerant compressed air refrigerant
compressed<00:01:27.399> air<00:01:27.550> so<00:01:27.759> on<00:01:27.940> and<00:01:28.090> so<00:01:28.240> forth<00:01:28.539> and

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
compressed air so on and so forth and

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.910 
compressed air so on and so forth and
that's<00:01:29.349> what<00:01:29.560> it<00:01:29.619> would<00:01:29.709> look<00:01:29.860> like

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
that's what it would look like

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.660 
that's what it would look like
underneath<00:01:30.399> this<00:01:30.640> insulated<00:01:32.429> piece<00:01:33.429> right

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
underneath this insulated piece right

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.309 
underneath this insulated piece right
here<00:01:33.729> it's<00:01:34.149> actually<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.630> evaporator<00:01:35.110> looks

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:35.319 
here it's actually the evaporator looks

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:36.870 
here it's actually the evaporator looks
the<00:01:35.440> same<00:01:35.590> only<00:01:35.860> has<00:01:36.009> different<00:01:36.429> connections

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
the same only has different connections

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.529 
the same only has different connections
on<00:01:37.060> it<00:01:37.209> okay<00:01:37.929> so<00:01:37.989> it's<00:01:38.349> refrigerant<00:01:39.039> to<00:01:39.190> air

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
on it okay so it's refrigerant to air

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.690 
on it okay so it's refrigerant to air
heat<00:01:40.539> exchanger<00:01:41.020> and<00:01:41.050> that's<00:01:41.319> where<00:01:41.649> all<00:01:42.069> the

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
heat exchanger and that's where all the

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.699 
heat exchanger and that's where all the
cooling<00:01:43.060> is<00:01:43.149> being<00:01:43.420> so<00:01:43.660> it<00:01:43.810> basically<00:01:43.929> happens

00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:44.709 
cooling is being so it basically happens

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:47.520 
cooling is being so it basically happens
here<00:01:44.979> is<00:01:45.250> water<00:01:46.209> latent<00:01:46.780> compressed<00:01:47.229> air

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
here is water latent compressed air

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.370 
here is water latent compressed air
enters<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.340> dryer<00:01:48.729> at<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.660> top<00:01:49.869> connection

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
enters the dryer at the top connection

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.229 
enters the dryer at the top connection
here<00:01:50.560> it<00:01:50.770> goes<00:01:51.069> through<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.520> pre<00:01:51.819> cooler

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:52.239 
here it goes through the pre cooler

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:52.889 
here it goes through the pre cooler
reheater

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
reheater

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.550 
reheater
comes<00:01:53.830> out<00:01:54.039> of<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.190> pre<00:01:54.459> cooler<00:01:54.789> reheater

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
comes out of the pre cooler reheater

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.830 
comes out of the pre cooler reheater
into<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.800> evaporator<00:01:57.069> okay<00:01:57.610> out<00:01:58.599> of<00:01:58.660> the

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
into the evaporator okay out of the

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.290 
into the evaporator okay out of the
evaporator<00:01:59.380> at<00:02:00.130> this<00:02:00.369> point<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.940> temperature

evaporator at this point the temperature
of<00:02:01.660> the<00:02:01.750> air<00:02:01.780> is<00:02:01.989> about<00:02:02.259> 35<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:02.920> 40<00:02:03.190> degrees<00:02:03.459> if

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
of the air is about 35 to 40 degrees if

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.969 
of the air is about 35 to 40 degrees if
everything<00:02:03.970> is<00:02:04.030> working<00:02:04.179> correctly<00:02:04.770> we<00:02:05.770> come

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
everything is working correctly we come

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.979 
everything is working correctly we come
out<00:02:06.009> of<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.489> evaporator<00:02:07.119> into<00:02:07.479> a<00:02:07.509> moisture

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:07.989 
out of the evaporator into a moisture

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:10.770 
out of the evaporator into a moisture
separator<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:10.060> that's<00:02:10.209> where<00:02:10.390> all<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.629> water

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
separator and that's where all the water

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.380 
separator and that's where all the water
is<00:02:10.959> rained<00:02:11.290> out<00:02:11.500> of<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.890> compressed<00:02:12.520> air<00:02:12.700> it's

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
is rained out of the compressed air it's

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.450 
is rained out of the compressed air it's
kind<00:02:13.599> of<00:02:13.629> like<00:02:13.840> what<00:02:14.470> goes<00:02:14.680> on<00:02:14.860> inside<00:02:15.250> the

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
kind of like what goes on inside the

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.460 
kind of like what goes on inside the
evaporator<00:02:15.670> in<00:02:16.480> relationship<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.260> the

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
evaporator in relationship to the

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.960 
evaporator in relationship to the
compressed<00:02:17.830> air<00:02:18.010> is<00:02:18.160> kind<00:02:18.400> of<00:02:18.430> like<00:02:18.610> if<00:02:18.820> you

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
compressed air is kind of like if you

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.070 
compressed air is kind of like if you
have<00:02:19.150> a

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
have a

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.020 
have a
old<00:02:20.200> beverage<00:02:20.650> in<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:20.920> can<00:02:21.160> or<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.460> glass<00:02:21.670> and

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
old beverage in a can or a glass and

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.880 
old beverage in a can or a glass and
it's<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.180> hot<00:02:22.330> humid<00:02:22.540> day<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:23.110> all<00:02:23.770> the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
it's a hot humid day and all the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.680 
it's a hot humid day and all the
condensation<00:02:24.580> that<00:02:24.610> keeps<00:02:24.880> dripping<00:02:25.390> around

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
condensation that keeps dripping around

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.300 
condensation that keeps dripping around
your<00:02:26.140> glass<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.740> know<00:02:26.830> it's<00:02:26.980> why<00:02:27.040> they<00:02:27.160> put<00:02:27.280> a

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
your glass you know it's why they put a

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.800 
your glass you know it's why they put a
coaster<00:02:27.790> on<00:02:27.850> your<00:02:28.060> glass<00:02:28.270> when<00:02:28.570> you<00:02:28.630> go<00:02:28.720> to

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
coaster on your glass when you go to

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.780 
coaster on your glass when you go to
fancy<00:02:29.170> places<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:29.680> whatnot<00:02:29.980> so<00:02:30.220> put<00:02:30.460> any<00:02:30.580> rate

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
fancy places and whatnot so put any rate

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.910 
fancy places and whatnot so put any rate
so<00:02:31.570> we<00:02:31.750> go<00:02:31.900> through<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.170> moisture<00:02:32.320> separator

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
so we go through the moisture separator

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.260 
so we go through the moisture separator
that's<00:02:33.130> where<00:02:33.250> all<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.430> water's<00:02:33.760> being<00:02:33.910> taken

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
that's where all the water's being taken

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.820 
that's where all the water's being taken
out<00:02:34.330> of<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.450> drier<00:02:34.690> at<00:02:34.900> that<00:02:35.050> point<00:02:35.380> we<00:02:35.650> go

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
out of the drier at that point we go

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.310 
out of the drier at that point we go
back<00:02:36.130> into<00:02:36.460> the<00:02:37.060> pre<00:02:37.270> cooler<00:02:37.600> reheater<00:02:38.020> and

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
back into the pre cooler reheater and

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.590 
back into the pre cooler reheater and
then<00:02:38.830> back<00:02:39.070> out<00:02:39.310> on<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.820> bottom<00:02:40.120> connection

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
then back out on the bottom connection

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.940 
then back out on the bottom connection
the<00:02:41.260> pre<00:02:41.590> cooler<00:02:41.920> reheater<00:02:42.370> is<00:02:42.730> there<00:02:43.120> for

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
the pre cooler reheater is there for

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.160 
the pre cooler reheater is there for
basically<00:02:44.950> two<00:02:45.160> reasons<00:02:45.570> one<00:02:46.570> it<00:02:46.810> makes<00:02:46.990> the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
basically two reasons one it makes the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.120 
basically two reasons one it makes the
drier<00:02:47.440> handle<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.250> higher<00:02:48.670> Inlet<00:02:49.270> temperature

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
drier handle a higher Inlet temperature

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.760 
drier handle a higher Inlet temperature
as<00:02:51.660> basically<00:02:52.660> because<00:02:52.960> the<00:02:53.380> air<00:02:53.560> that's

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
as basically because the air that's

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.560 
as basically because the air that's
going<00:02:54.100> in<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.490> meeting<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:54.940> cold<00:02:55.150> air<00:02:55.300> coming

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
going in is meeting the cold air coming

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.540 
going in is meeting the cold air coming
out<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.710> once<00:02:56.950> you<00:02:57.070> cool<00:02:57.250> it<00:02:57.370> down<00:02:57.490> it

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
out so and once you cool it down it

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.160 
out so and once you cool it down it
doesn't<00:02:57.910> matter<00:02:58.030> what<00:02:58.240> you<00:02:58.360> reheat<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.840> up<00:02:58.959> to

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
doesn't matter what you reheat it up to

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.260 
doesn't matter what you reheat it up to
you<00:02:59.740> can<00:02:59.920> read<00:03:00.130> it<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.310> 300<00:03:00.850> degrees<00:03:01.090> it

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
you can read it to 300 degrees it

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.000 
you can read it to 300 degrees it
doesn't<00:03:01.570> matter<00:03:01.720> once<00:03:02.020> you've<00:03:02.260> got<00:03:02.620> a<00:03:02.650> dew

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
doesn't matter once you've got a dew

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.100 
doesn't matter once you've got a dew
player<00:03:03.280> you're<00:03:03.459> set<00:03:03.670> dew<00:03:03.850> point<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.870> doesn't

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
player you're set dew point it doesn't

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.480 
player you're set dew point it doesn't
matter<00:03:05.440> what<00:03:05.590> you<00:03:05.740> do<00:03:05.860> with<00:03:06.010> it<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.340> other

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
matter what you do with it and the other

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.900 
matter what you do with it and the other
reason<00:03:06.940> is<00:03:07.090> so<00:03:07.800> basically<00:03:08.800> if<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:09.459> didn't<00:03:09.790> have

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
reason is so basically if it didn't have

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.180 
reason is so basically if it didn't have
this<00:03:10.120> on<00:03:10.360> here<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:11.290> line<00:03:11.500> coming<00:03:11.800> out<00:03:11.950> of<00:03:12.070> here

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
this on here the line coming out of here

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.430 
this on here the line coming out of here
would<00:03:12.280> be<00:03:12.370> at<00:03:12.490> you<00:03:12.640> know<00:03:12.700> 40<00:03:13.120> degrees<00:03:13.450> 35<00:03:14.110> to<00:03:14.260> 40

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
would be at you know 40 degrees 35 to 40

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.750 
would be at you know 40 degrees 35 to 40
degrees<00:03:14.650> we'll<00:03:14.770> be<00:03:14.860> sweating<00:03:15.340> all<00:03:15.459> over<00:03:15.670> the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
degrees we'll be sweating all over the

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.740 
degrees we'll be sweating all over the
customers<00:03:16.180> plant<00:03:16.480> so<00:03:17.290> that's<00:03:17.850> basically<00:03:18.850> how

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
customers plant so that's basically how

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.310 
customers plant so that's basically how
a<00:03:20.430> non-cycling<00:03:21.990> refrigerated<00:03:22.990> compressed

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
a non-cycling refrigerated compressed

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.790 
a non-cycling refrigerated compressed
air<00:03:23.500> dryer<00:03:23.770> works<00:03:24.070> a<00:03:24.810> cycling<00:03:25.810> compressed<00:03:26.590> air

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
air dryer works a cycling compressed air

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.759 
air dryer works a cycling compressed air
dryer<00:03:27.930> basically<00:03:28.930> has<00:03:29.080> a<00:03:29.110> vat<00:03:29.500> of<00:03:30.239> glycol<00:03:31.239> and

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
dryer basically has a vat of glycol and

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.650 
dryer basically has a vat of glycol and
it<00:03:32.769> tries<00:03:33.100> to<00:03:33.130> cool<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.670> glycol<00:03:34.150> that<00:03:34.180> down

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
it tries to cool the glycol that down

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.990 
it tries to cool the glycol that down
and<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.019> compressed<00:03:35.980> air<00:03:36.130> lines<00:03:36.430> are<00:03:36.640> inside

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
and the compressed air lines are inside

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.780 
and the compressed air lines are inside
the<00:03:37.180> glycol<00:03:37.690> VAT<00:03:37.989> and<00:03:38.290> they<00:03:38.980> just<00:03:39.190> cycle<00:03:39.700> the

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
the glycol VAT and they just cycle the

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.090 
the glycol VAT and they just cycle the
dryer<00:03:40.090> on<00:03:40.630> and<00:03:40.930> off<00:03:41.019> like<00:03:41.260> your<00:03:41.440> refrigerator

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
dryer on and off like your refrigerator

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.310 
dryer on and off like your refrigerator
would<00:03:42.310> so<00:03:42.820> getting<00:03:43.209> to<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:43.510> refrigerant

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
would so getting to the refrigerant

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.140 
would so getting to the refrigerant
cycle<00:03:44.769> of<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:44.980> refrigerant<00:03:45.550> side<00:03:45.910> of<00:03:46.090> the

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
cycle of the refrigerant side of the

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
cycle of the refrigerant side of the
whole<00:03:46.330> thing

otherwise known as a hot gas valve and
like<00:04:12.820> I<00:04:12.970> told<00:04:13.180> you<00:04:13.330> before<00:04:13.420> this<00:04:13.780> is<00:04:13.840> a

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
like I told you before this is a

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.849 
like I told you before this is a
non-cycling<00:04:15.730> dryer<00:04:16.209> so<00:04:16.600> we're<00:04:17.140> not<00:04:17.260> trying<00:04:17.530> to

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
non-cycling dryer so we're not trying to

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.039 
non-cycling dryer so we're not trying to
achieve<00:04:18.729> a<00:04:18.760> certain<00:04:19.209> temperature<00:04:19.600> shut<00:04:19.930> the

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
achieve a certain temperature shut the

achieve a certain temperature shut the
system<00:04:20.229> off<00:04:20.560> or<00:04:20.890> we're<00:04:21.640> basically<00:04:21.910> using<00:04:22.060> the

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
system off or we're basically using the

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.370 
system off or we're basically using the
hot<00:04:23.050> gas<00:04:23.380> valve<00:04:23.770> to<00:04:24.930> falsely<00:04:25.930> load<00:04:26.200> the

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
hot gas valve to falsely load the

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.360 
hot gas valve to falsely load the
evaporator<00:04:26.950> so<00:04:27.430> under<00:04:27.669> low<00:04:27.850> low

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
evaporator so under low low

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.230 
evaporator so under low low
it's<00:04:28.490> and<00:04:29.449> to<00:04:29.990> keep<00:04:30.139> it<00:04:30.290> for<00:04:30.440> freezing<00:04:30.889> up

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
it's and to keep it for freezing up

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.050 
it's and to keep it for freezing up
that's<00:04:33.080> our<00:04:33.320> capacity<00:04:33.889> control<00:04:34.100> along<00:04:34.729> with

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
that's our capacity control along with

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.219 
that's our capacity control along with
our<00:04:35.360> low<00:04:35.930> ambient<00:04:36.169> control<00:04:36.860> which<00:04:37.699> is<00:04:37.880> also

known as the fan cycling switch so as

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.879 
known as the fan cycling switch so as
you'll<00:04:41.030> note<00:04:41.270> here<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.750> hot<00:04:42.020> gas<00:04:42.350> discharge

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
you'll note here the hot gas discharge

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.040 
you'll note here the hot gas discharge
bypass<00:04:43.610> valve<00:04:43.880> is<00:04:44.090> literally<00:04:44.330> teed<00:04:44.630> right<00:04:44.930> in

excuse<00:04:51.590> me<00:04:51.740> the<00:04:51.830> evaporator<00:04:52.340> and<00:04:52.880> out<00:04:53.150> of<00:04:53.240> the

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
excuse me the evaporator and out of the

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.570 
excuse me the evaporator and out of the
evaporator<00:04:53.830> it<00:04:54.830> turns<00:04:55.010> back<00:04:55.250> into<00:04:55.280> the

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
evaporator it turns back into the

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.360 
evaporator it turns back into the
suction<00:04:55.820> line<00:04:56.000> and<00:04:56.650> out<00:04:57.650> of<00:04:57.740> the<00:04:57.830> suction<00:04:58.220> line

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
suction line and out of the suction line

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.300 
suction line and out of the suction line
we<00:04:58.460> go<00:04:58.610> back<00:04:58.910> to<00:04:59.180> a<00:04:59.320> suction<00:05:00.320> line<00:05:00.620> accumulator

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
we go back to a suction line accumulator

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.029 
we go back to a suction line accumulator
and<00:05:02.060> back<00:05:02.449> to<00:05:02.630> our<00:05:02.660> compressor<00:05:03.320> and<00:05:03.530> then

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
and back to our compressor and then

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:05.860 
and back to our compressor and then
obviously<00:05:04.280> out<00:05:04.699> of<00:05:04.729> the<00:05:04.820> compressor<00:05:05.300> into<00:05:05.600> the

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
obviously out of the compressor into the

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.790 
obviously out of the compressor into the
condenser<00:05:06.169> out<00:05:06.620> of<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:06.800> condenser<00:05:07.130> into<00:05:07.820> the

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
condenser out of the condenser into the

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.640 
condenser out of the condenser into the
liquid<00:05:09.800> accumulator<00:05:10.669> and<00:05:10.960> that's<00:05:11.960> basically

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
liquid accumulator and that's basically

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.870 
liquid accumulator and that's basically
that<00:05:13.389> thanks<00:05:14.389> for<00:05:14.539> watching
