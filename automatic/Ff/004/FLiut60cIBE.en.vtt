but here it is this is actually the kuma
attacker<00:00:34.380> II<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.489> first<00:00:36.149> version<00:00:36.630> was<00:00:36.840> a

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
attacker II to the first version was a

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.040 
attacker II to the first version was a
little<00:00:38.850> bit<00:00:38.940> different<00:00:39.210> from<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.809> terms

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
little bit different from this in terms

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.530 
little bit different from this in terms
with<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.320> handle<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.340> first<00:00:42.000> version<00:00:42.390> just

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
with a handle the the first version just

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.569 
with a handle the the first version just
had<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> strip<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.170> micarta<00:00:43.739> right<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
had a strip of micarta right in the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.520 
had a strip of micarta right in the
center<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.600> reason<00:00:45.899> for<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.110> was<00:00:46.500> a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
center and the reason for that was a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.190 
center and the reason for that was a
weight<00:00:47.010> reduction<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.570> know<00:00:48.690> free<00:00:48.989> when

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
weight reduction so you know free when

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.540 
weight reduction so you know free when
he<00:00:49.230> use<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:49.680> fighting<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.250> want<00:00:50.370> as

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
he use this for fighting you want as

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.369 
he use this for fighting you want as
light<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:50.910> as<00:00:50.969> fast<00:00:51.210> as<00:00:51.329> possible<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.870> that

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
light and as fast as possible and that

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.729 
light and as fast as possible and that
was<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:53.460> know<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> good<00:00:53.789> way<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.969> do<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.180> and

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
was you know a good way to do it and

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.049 
was you know a good way to do it and
yeah<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.129> it

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
yeah so this is it

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.569 
yeah so this is it
ku<00:00:57.539> Crees<00:00:57.780> were<00:00:58.050> traditionally<00:00:59.010> used<00:00:59.070> by<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
ku Crees were traditionally used by the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.840 
ku Crees were traditionally used by the
Gurkhas<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.510> nepal<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.280> kept<00:01:02.280> kind<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.699> in

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
Gurkhas in nepal and kept kind of in

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.149 
Gurkhas in nepal and kept kind of in
recent<00:01:03.239> years<00:01:03.420> spread<00:01:03.780> around<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.769> military

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
recent years spread around the military

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.760 
recent years spread around the military
market<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.720> so<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.170> pretty<00:01:07.470> much<00:01:07.710> a

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
market and so this is pretty much a

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.190 
market and so this is pretty much a
tactical<00:01:08.310> spin<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.810> think<00:01:10.080> they

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
tactical spin on that and I think they

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.130 
tactical spin on that and I think they
did<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> really<00:01:10.619> good<00:01:10.920> job<00:01:11.119> you<00:01:12.119> know<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.720> keeps

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
did a really good job you know it keeps

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.499 
did a really good job you know it keeps
the<00:01:13.380> traditional<00:01:13.979> blade<00:01:14.610> shape<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.119> more<00:01:15.420> of

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
the traditional blade shape of more of

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.590

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
like the western type kukris but the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.280 
like the western type kukris but the
handle<00:01:19.049> has<00:01:19.470> been<00:01:19.740> completely<00:01:20.040> changed<00:01:20.520> and

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
handle has been completely changed and

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.240

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
handle a lot of traditional handles in

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.980 
handle a lot of traditional handles in
this<00:01:25.680> handle<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.330> traditional

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
this handle is that the traditional

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.630 
this handle is that the traditional

sharpening this knife also comes with
the<00:03:19.980> few<00:03:20.549> sessions<00:03:20.820> right<00:03:21.120> here<00:03:21.390> you<00:03:22.019> know

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
the few sessions right here you know

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.229 
the few sessions right here you know
we'll<00:03:22.290> see<00:03:22.530> how<00:03:22.769> well<00:03:22.950> this<00:03:23.160> does<00:03:23.400> in<00:03:23.730> the

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
we'll see how well this does in the

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.720 
we'll see how well this does in the
woods<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.810> think<00:03:25.470> it'd<00:03:25.620> be<00:03:25.650> alright<00:03:25.920> the

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
woods I think it'd be alright the

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.930 
woods I think it'd be alright the
serrations<00:03:27.630> are<00:03:28.080> kind<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.130> unique<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.730> Topps

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
serrations are kind of unique to Topps

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.570 
serrations are kind of unique to Topps
knives<00:03:30.239> and<00:03:30.950> so<00:03:31.950> that<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.160> only<00:03:32.310> have<00:03:32.489> to

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
knives and so that you only have to

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.400 
knives and so that you only have to
sharp<00:03:32.760> on<00:03:32.880> one<00:03:32.910> side<00:03:33.209> in<00:03:33.510> order<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.810> take<00:03:34.230> care

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
sharp on one side in order to take care

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.020 
sharp on one side in order to take care
of<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.560> serrations<00:03:34.830> which<00:03:35.190> is<00:03:35.340> pretty<00:03:35.820> cool

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
of the serrations which is pretty cool

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.390 
of the serrations which is pretty cool
because<00:03:36.269> usually<00:03:36.709> serrations<00:03:37.709> are<00:03:37.860> really<00:03:38.220> a

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
because usually serrations are really a

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.090 
because usually serrations are really a

Makara<00:03:43.590> as<00:03:43.769> I<00:03:43.890> mentioned<00:03:44.280> earlier<00:03:45.170> and<00:03:46.170> it

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
Makara as I mentioned earlier and it

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.250 
Makara as I mentioned earlier and it
doesn't<00:03:47.190> cover<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.670> entire<00:03:48.090> blade<00:03:48.390> it<00:03:48.930> still

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
doesn't cover the entire blade it still

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.680 
doesn't cover the entire blade it still
has<00:03:49.470> some<00:03:49.500> remnants<00:03:50.130> of<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:51.000> Akuma<00:03:51.450> attack

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
has some remnants of the Akuma attack

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.430 
has some remnants of the Akuma attack
reading<00:03:51.959> number<00:03:52.170> one<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.709> that<00:03:53.340> was<00:03:53.580> the

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
reading number one and that was the

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.270 
reading number one and that was the
handle<00:03:55.440> material<00:03:55.530> sticking<00:03:56.010> out<00:03:56.100> a<00:03:56.130> little

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
handle material sticking out a little

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.699 
handle material sticking out a little
bit<00:03:56.489> so<00:03:57.030> you<00:03:57.120> have<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.510> nice<00:03:57.840> secondary<00:03:58.500> bevel

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
bit so you have a nice secondary bevel

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.229 
bit so you have a nice secondary bevel
right<00:03:58.860> here<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.430> it<00:03:59.670> actually<00:03:59.760> doesn't<00:04:00.209> feel

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
right here and it actually doesn't feel

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.850 
right here and it actually doesn't feel
too<00:04:00.480> bad<00:04:00.630> in<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.780> hand<00:04:00.959> feels<00:04:01.680> pretty

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
too bad in the hand feels pretty

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.759 
too bad in the hand feels pretty
comfortable<00:04:02.150> I<00:04:03.150> like<00:04:03.540> this<00:04:03.810> finger<00:04:04.530> groove

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
comfortable I like this finger groove

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.949 
comfortable I like this finger groove
right<00:04:04.890> here<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.760> fact<00:04:06.030> that<00:04:06.120> it<00:04:06.269> is<00:04:06.390> so<00:04:06.630> steep

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
right here the fact that it is so steep

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.569 
right here the fact that it is so steep
it<00:04:07.470> actually<00:04:08.600> serves<00:04:09.600> as<00:04:09.780> a<00:04:09.810> nice<00:04:09.989> handguard

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
it actually serves as a nice handguard

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.250 
it actually serves as a nice handguard

this<00:04:50.020> one's<00:04:50.229> a<00:04:50.289> little<00:04:50.440> bit<00:04:50.530> angled<00:04:50.830> so<00:04:51.100> it<00:04:51.130> can

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
this one's a little bit angled so it can

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.850

also<00:04:51.639> be<00:04:51.820> used<00:04:52.090> as<00:04:52.449> you<00:04:53.199> know<00:04:53.289> something<00:04:53.740> to

woodsman handles and what that basically

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.870 
woodsman handles and what that basically
means<00:05:19.270> is<00:05:19.570> that<00:05:19.630> it<00:05:19.870> has<00:05:20.050> a<00:05:20.520> spindle<00:05:21.520> socket

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.080 
knife I dig it a lot the liners are also
a<00:05:43.900> good<00:05:44.139> little<00:05:44.500> addition<00:05:45.220> to<00:05:45.370> the<00:05:45.699> aesthetics

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
a good little addition to the aesthetics

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.790 
a good little addition to the aesthetics
of<00:05:46.180> it<00:05:46.300> as<00:05:46.419> well<00:05:47.130> moving<00:05:48.130> on<00:05:48.250> to<00:05:48.400> the<00:05:48.490> sheath

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
of it as well moving on to the sheath

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.020 
of it as well moving on to the sheath
it's<00:05:50.800> a<00:05:51.099> little<00:05:51.460> bit<00:05:51.550> different<00:05:51.729> from<00:05:51.909> the

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
it's a little bit different from the

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.879 
it's a little bit different from the
other<00:05:52.240> tops<00:05:52.449> masteries<00:05:52.840> and<00:05:53.080> that's<00:05:53.560> pretty

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
other tops masteries and that's pretty

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:57.029 
other tops masteries and that's pretty
much<00:05:54.099> because<00:05:54.430> the<00:05:54.970> blade<00:05:55.240> is<00:05:55.539> so<00:05:55.810> wide<00:05:56.080> you

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 
much because the blade is so wide you

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:58.529 
much because the blade is so wide you
really<00:05:57.310> needed<00:05:57.550> to<00:05:57.580> get<00:05:57.789> a<00:05:57.849> little<00:05:58.000> bit<00:05:58.389> more

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
really needed to get a little bit more

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:01.200 
really needed to get a little bit more
real<00:05:58.720> estate<00:05:58.840> in<00:05:59.229> order<00:05:59.620> to<00:05:59.979> house<00:06:00.820> the<00:06:01.030> whole
