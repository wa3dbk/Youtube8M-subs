 Hello, good afternoon, the authorities 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.010
 they strongly handle a hypothesis and it is 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.560
 that these animals would have died in 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.090
 hands of illegal hunters who use 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.310
 the reptile skins for 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.500
 market them and that is that several of the 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.870
