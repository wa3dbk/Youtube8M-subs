hi<00:00:00.510> my<00:00:00.690> name<00:00:00.840> is<00:00:00.900> Chris<00:00:01.110> I'm<00:00:01.260> from<00:00:01.439> spy<00:00:01.620> cameras

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
hi my name is Chris I'm from spy cameras

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.730 
hi my name is Chris I'm from spy cameras
ect<00:00:02.399> and<00:00:02.669> today<00:00:03.000> we're<00:00:03.149> going<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.300> look<00:00:03.419> at<00:00:03.540> our

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:03.740 
ect and today we're going to look at our

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.800 
ect and today we're going to look at our
transmitter<00:00:04.740> kits<00:00:05.009> our<00:00:05.370> analog<00:00:06.029> and<00:00:06.330> our

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
transmitter kits our analog and our

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.549 
transmitter kits our analog and our
digital<00:00:07.200> packs<00:00:07.760> differences<00:00:08.760> between<00:00:08.910> them

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
digital packs differences between them

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.709 
digital packs differences between them
how<00:00:10.559> they<00:00:10.710> go<00:00:10.830> together<00:00:11.010> roughly<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.849> also

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
how they go together roughly and also

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:13.549 
how they go together roughly and also
what<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:12.960> get<00:00:13.080> in<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.230> box

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
what you get in the box

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.020 
what you get in the box
so<00:00:13.950> if<00:00:14.040> you're<00:00:14.250> interested<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.910> keep

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
so if you're interested in that and keep

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:23.779 
so if you're interested in that and keep
watching<00:00:21.529> so<00:00:22.529> we<00:00:22.650> use<00:00:22.769> these<00:00:23.010> transmitters

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
watching so we use these transmitters

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.420 
watching so we use these transmitters
and<00:00:24.119> receivers<00:00:25.039> basically<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.130> lots<00:00:26.340> of

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
and receivers basically in lots of

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.339 
and receivers basically in lots of
different<00:00:26.490> locations<00:00:27.119> where<00:00:27.689> it's<00:00:27.990> really

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
different locations where it's really

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.310 
different locations where it's really
difficult<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.949> run<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> cable<00:00:30.140> even<00:00:31.140> though<00:00:31.199> we

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
difficult to run a cable even though we

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.930 
difficult to run a cable even though we
sell<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> lot<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.830> wireless<00:00:32.070> equipment<00:00:32.520> we

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
sell a lot of wireless equipment we

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.819 
sell a lot of wireless equipment we
would<00:00:33.090> always<00:00:33.360> recommend<00:00:33.870> where<00:00:34.320> possible<00:00:34.710> to

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
would always recommend where possible to

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.920 
would always recommend where possible to
run<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> cable<00:00:35.309> however<00:00:36.270> when<00:00:36.510> it's<00:00:36.690> not

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
run a cable however when it's not

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.750 
run a cable however when it's not
possible<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.410> run<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> cable<00:00:37.800> these<00:00:38.399> little

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
possible to run a cable these little

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.090 
possible to run a cable these little
things<00:00:38.940> come<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.270> really<00:00:39.540> useful<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.980> we've

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
things come in really useful so we've

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.830 
things come in really useful so we've
got<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.219> variety<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.730> different<00:00:41.969> transmitters

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
got a variety of different transmitters

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.220 
got a variety of different transmitters
and<00:00:42.960> receivers<00:00:44.329> we<00:00:45.329> normally<00:00:45.629> sell<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.780> lot<00:00:45.989> to

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
and receivers we normally sell a lot to

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.139 
and receivers we normally sell a lot to
the<00:00:46.469> sort<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.739> farming<00:00:47.070> community<00:00:47.489> sort<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.850> on

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
the sort of farming community sort of on

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.610 
the sort of farming community sort of on
farms<00:00:48.510> you've<00:00:48.660> got<00:00:48.840> cameras<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.289> need<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.530> go

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
farms you've got cameras that need to go

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.250 
farms you've got cameras that need to go
in<00:00:49.710> barns<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.190> bridge<00:00:50.460> quite<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> distance

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
in barns and bridge quite a distance

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.500 
in barns and bridge quite a distance
they're<00:00:52.260> quite<00:00:52.469> good<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:53.340> big<00:00:53.640> factories<00:00:54.120> big

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
we've got first of all got analog

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.780 
we've got first of all got analog
transmitter<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.260> receiver<00:01:04.500> I'll<00:01:05.430> go<00:01:05.610> through

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
transmitter and receiver I'll go through

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.789 
transmitter and receiver I'll go through
those<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.119> moment<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:07.290> then<00:01:07.470> we've<00:01:07.650> got<00:01:07.770> our

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
those in a moment and then we've got our

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.250 
those in a moment and then we've got our
Trent<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.430> digital<00:01:09.049> transmitter<00:01:10.049> and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
Trent the digital transmitter and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.539 
Trent the digital transmitter and
receiver<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.770> again<00:01:11.070> I'll<00:01:11.189> tell<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
receiver and again I'll tell you the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.120 
receiver and again I'll tell you the
differences<00:01:12.030> between<00:01:12.090> those<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.869> minute

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.700 

so<00:01:15.430> these<00:01:15.549> come<00:01:15.760> out<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:15.970> books<00:01:16.180> also<00:01:16.900> is<00:01:17.560> the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
so these come out the books also is the

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.109 
so these come out the books also is the
same<00:01:17.950> immediate<00:01:18.280> everything's<00:01:18.760> that<00:01:18.940> pretty

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
same immediate everything's that pretty

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.250 
same immediate everything's that pretty
much<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.390> same<00:01:19.540> with<00:01:19.659> these<00:01:19.810> you<00:01:19.930> get<00:01:19.990> a<00:01:20.049> set

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
much the same with these you get a set

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.640 
much the same with these you get a set
of<00:01:20.380> instructions<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.810> get<00:01:22.930> a<00:01:22.960> power<00:01:23.200> adapter

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
of instructions you get a power adapter

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.890 
of instructions you get a power adapter
for<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.729> transmitter<00:01:25.180> power<00:01:25.420> adapter<00:01:25.810> for

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
for the transmitter power adapter for

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.600 
for the transmitter power adapter for
the<00:01:25.960> receiver<00:01:26.409> again<00:01:26.770> it's<00:01:26.920> same<00:01:27.159> for<00:01:27.190> all<00:01:27.460> of

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
the receiver again it's same for all of

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.640 
the receiver again it's same for all of
the<00:01:27.700> packs<00:01:27.909> that<00:01:28.030> I'm<00:01:28.119> about<00:01:28.270> to<00:01:28.330> show<00:01:28.540> you<00:01:28.650> and

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
the packs that I'm about to show you and

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.850 
the packs that I'm about to show you and
you<00:01:29.799> also<00:01:29.920> get<00:01:30.280> a<00:01:30.630> an<00:01:31.630> AV<00:01:31.960> cable<00:01:32.170> if<00:01:32.619> you<00:01:32.680> can

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
you also get a an AV cable if you can

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.630 
you also get a an AV cable if you can
see<00:01:32.979> that<00:01:33.130> there

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
see that there

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.980 
see that there
these<00:01:34.090> will<00:01:34.390> send<00:01:34.750> audio<00:01:35.470> video<00:01:36.070> and<00:01:36.990> also

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
these will send audio video and also

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.630 
these will send audio video and also
audio<00:01:38.200> in<00:01:38.440> stereo<00:01:38.860> so<00:01:38.950> you've<00:01:39.100> got<00:01:39.190> left<00:01:39.430> and

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
audio in stereo so you've got left and

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.600 
audio in stereo so you've got left and
right<00:01:39.790> audio<00:01:40.659> and<00:01:41.140> video<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.460> we

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
right audio and video and we

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.130 
right audio and video and we
predominantly<00:01:43.180> use<00:01:43.270> them<00:01:43.450> for<00:01:43.570> the<00:01:43.659> video<00:01:43.899> and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
predominantly use them for the video and

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.139 
predominantly use them for the video and
you'll<00:01:44.500> get<00:01:44.619> an<00:01:44.799> adapter<00:01:45.220> so<00:01:45.790> that<00:01:45.909> you<00:01:46.000> can

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
you'll get an adapter so that you can

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.520 
you'll get an adapter so that you can
connect<00:01:46.420> it<00:01:46.539> to<00:01:46.570> your<00:01:46.720> recorder<00:01:47.170> okay<00:01:47.470> so

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
connect it to your recorder okay so

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.609 
connect it to your recorder okay so
that's<00:01:47.710> your<00:01:47.800> cable<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:48.780> finally<00:01:49.780> you<00:01:50.470> also

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
that's your cable and finally you also

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.499 
that's your cable and finally you also
get<00:01:50.890> a<00:01:50.920> little<00:01:51.070> aerial<00:01:51.460> with<00:01:51.610> this<00:01:51.789> okay<00:01:52.420> and

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
get a little aerial with this okay and

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:53.880 
get a little aerial with this okay and
that<00:01:52.630> helps<00:01:52.840> you<00:01:52.929> to<00:01:52.990> connect<00:01:53.380> those<00:01:53.500> there

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
that helps you to connect those there

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.740 
that helps you to connect those there
helps<00:01:54.130> to<00:01:54.220> get<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.369> power<00:01:54.640> on<00:01:54.700> those<00:01:54.940> and<00:01:55.179> for

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
helps to get the power on those and for

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.609 
helps to get the power on those and for
the<00:01:55.810> distance<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.470> wireless<00:01:56.740> distance<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:59.200> so

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
the distance the wireless distance so so

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.710 
the distance the wireless distance so so
as<00:01:59.830> I<00:01:59.950> say<00:02:00.100> that<00:02:00.280> you<00:02:00.640> generally<00:02:01.300> get<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.450> same

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
as I say that you generally get the same

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.809 
as I say that you generally get the same
sort<00:02:01.899> of<00:02:02.020> equipment<00:02:02.229> in<00:02:02.470> both<00:02:02.679> where<00:02:03.490> we<00:02:03.640> would

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
sort of equipment in both where we would

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.260 
sort of equipment in both where we would
recommend<00:02:04.149> these<00:02:04.450> these<00:02:04.869> analog<00:02:05.259> ones<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
recommend these these analog ones the

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.150 
recommend these these analog ones the
technology<00:02:07.750> is<00:02:07.810> now<00:02:07.899> moved<00:02:08.200> on<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.649> digital

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
technology is now moved on to digital

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.940 
technology is now moved on to digital
but<00:02:09.459> we<00:02:09.610> still<00:02:09.850> stock<00:02:10.209> these<00:02:10.450> analog<00:02:11.350> systems

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
but we still stock these analog systems

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.390 
but we still stock these analog systems
because<00:02:13.170> they're<00:02:14.170> not<00:02:14.290> quite<00:02:14.500> as<00:02:14.620> powerful<00:02:14.830> so

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
because they're not quite as powerful so

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.280 
because they're not quite as powerful so
they<00:02:15.550> will<00:02:15.700> send<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.060> signal<00:02:16.420> up<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.569> about<00:02:16.810> 70

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
they will send the signal up to about 70

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.830 
they will send the signal up to about 70
meters<00:02:17.610> with<00:02:18.610> their<00:02:18.790> standard<00:02:19.299> area<00:02:19.450> which<00:02:19.690> is

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
meters with their standard area which is

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.970 
meters with their standard area which is
this<00:02:19.989> one<00:02:20.459> or<00:02:21.459> if<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:22.000> take<00:02:22.840> one<00:02:23.049> of<00:02:23.140> our<00:02:23.290> high

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
this one or if you take one of our high

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.069 
this one or if you take one of our high
gain<00:02:24.220> aerials<00:02:24.640> if<00:02:24.880> you<00:02:25.540> can<00:02:25.690> see<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:25.959> on

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
gain aerials if you can see that on

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.170 
gain aerials if you can see that on
there<00:02:26.260> that's<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:27.100> screw<00:02:27.340> straight<00:02:27.640> on<00:02:27.790> instead

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
there that's a screw straight on instead

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.150 
there that's a screw straight on instead
and<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:28.780> gives<00:02:28.989> you<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.140> bit<00:02:29.380> more<00:02:29.410> gain<00:02:29.769> or

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
and that gives you a bit more gain or

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.940 
and that gives you a bit more gain or
send<00:02:30.459> you<00:02:30.579> up<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.850> about<00:02:30.970> 150<00:02:31.870> meters<00:02:32.200> okay<00:02:32.890> so

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
send you up to about 150 meters okay so

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.390 
send you up to about 150 meters okay so
you<00:02:33.100> get<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.280> bit<00:02:33.459> more<00:02:33.610> out<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:33.910> them<00:02:34.000> with<00:02:34.120> that

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
you get a bit more out of them with that

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.500 
you get a bit more out of them with that
but<00:02:36.400> basically<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.730> reason<00:02:36.820> we've<00:02:37.239> kept

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
but basically the reason we've kept

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.690 
but basically the reason we've kept
these<00:02:37.600> on<00:02:37.840> is

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
these on is

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.020 
these on is
the<00:02:40.270> transmitter<00:02:40.900> can<00:02:41.590> be<00:02:41.740> received<00:02:42.220> by

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
the transmitter can be received by

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.360 
the transmitter can be received by
multiple<00:02:43.660> receivers<00:02:44.020> so<00:02:44.800> you<00:02:44.860> could<00:02:45.190> have

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
multiple receivers so you could have

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.820 
multiple receivers so you could have
three<00:02:45.790> receivers<00:02:46.450> receiving<00:02:47.020> the<00:02:47.260> one<00:02:47.590> image

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
three receivers receiving the one image

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.300 
three receivers receiving the one image
from<00:02:48.069> the<00:02:48.250> transmitter<00:02:49.860> they<00:02:50.860> come<00:02:51.099> with<00:02:51.280> a

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
from the transmitter they come with a

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.729 
from the transmitter they come with a
number<00:02:51.760> of<00:02:51.849> channels<00:02:52.239> will<00:02:53.140> actually<00:02:53.440> take<00:02:53.620> up

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
number of channels will actually take up

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:54.960 
number of channels will actually take up
to<00:02:53.800> eight<00:02:54.069> channels<00:02:54.459> although<00:02:54.610> we<00:02:54.819> don't

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
to eight channels although we don't

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.180 
to eight channels although we don't
recommend<00:02:55.420> using<00:02:55.569> more<00:02:55.870> than<00:02:56.020> four<00:02:56.410> of<00:02:56.830> those

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
recommend using more than four of those

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.120 
recommend using more than four of those
channels<00:02:57.459> otherwise<00:02:57.819> you<00:02:58.000> get<00:02:58.150> crossover<00:02:59.130> but

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
channels otherwise you get crossover but

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.370 
channels otherwise you get crossover but
what<00:03:00.340> these<00:03:00.520> are<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:01.390> main<00:03:01.930> differences

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
what these are the main differences

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.250 
what these are the main differences
these<00:03:02.560> are<00:03:02.770> susceptible<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.489> interference<00:03:04.260> if

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
these are susceptible to interference if

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.850 
these are susceptible to interference if
there<00:03:05.590> is<00:03:05.769> lots<00:03:06.160> of<00:03:06.340> Wi-Fi<00:03:07.030> in<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.300> area<00:03:07.630> so<00:03:08.260> if

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
there is lots of Wi-Fi in the area so if

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.880 
there is lots of Wi-Fi in the area so if
you<00:03:09.040> are<00:03:09.190> in<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.400> high<00:03:09.610> Wi-Fi<00:03:10.360> area<00:03:10.769> lots<00:03:11.769> of

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
you are in a high Wi-Fi area lots of

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.740 
you are in a high Wi-Fi area lots of
wireless<00:03:12.190> internet<00:03:12.580> then<00:03:12.760> you<00:03:12.790> know<00:03:13.420> you'll

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
wireless internet then you know you'll

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.059 
wireless internet then you know you'll
find<00:03:14.019> that<00:03:14.110> one<00:03:14.260> or<00:03:14.380> two<00:03:14.560> of<00:03:14.680> these<00:03:14.769> will<00:03:14.950> work

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
find that one or two of these will work

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.040 
find that one or two of these will work
once<00:03:15.400> you<00:03:15.489> start<00:03:15.760> putting<00:03:15.910> more<00:03:16.239> in<00:03:16.420> you're

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
once you start putting more in you're

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.259 
once you start putting more in you're
more<00:03:17.380> susceptible<00:03:17.709> to<00:03:18.010> interference<00:03:18.269> which

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
more susceptible to interference which

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.300 
more susceptible to interference which
brings<00:03:19.540> it<00:03:19.630> on<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.930> next<00:03:20.200> ones<00:03:20.380> these

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
brings it on to the next ones these

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.000 
brings it on to the next ones these
digital<00:03:21.910> ones<00:03:22.120> are<00:03:22.420> less<00:03:23.380> susceptible<00:03:23.950> to

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
digital ones are less susceptible to

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.550 
digital ones are less susceptible to
that<00:03:24.250> issue<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.819> these<00:03:25.690> actually<00:03:25.900> pair<00:03:26.350> up

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
that issue and these actually pair up

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.870 
that issue and these actually pair up
they're<00:03:26.739> very<00:03:26.920> much<00:03:27.010> like<00:03:27.069> your<00:03:27.430> Wi-Fi<00:03:27.819> router

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
they're very much like your Wi-Fi router

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.960 
they're very much like your Wi-Fi router
they<00:03:28.780> will<00:03:28.989> pair<00:03:29.319> with<00:03:29.530> each<00:03:29.709> other<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.190> so

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
they will pair with each other and so

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.240 
they will pair with each other and so
once<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:31.420> fix<00:03:31.720> them<00:03:31.989> they<00:03:32.500> will<00:03:32.650> only<00:03:32.830> receive

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
once you fix them they will only receive

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.500 
once you fix them they will only receive
the<00:03:33.280> image<00:03:33.549> from<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.110> transmitter<00:03:36.510> then

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
the image from the transmitter then

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.030 
the image from the transmitter then
that's<00:03:37.720> an<00:03:37.840> advantage<00:03:38.140> it's<00:03:38.380> also<00:03:38.500> encoded

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
that's an advantage it's also encoded

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.070 
that's an advantage it's also encoded
it's<00:03:39.370> encrypted<00:03:39.910> so<00:03:40.150> no<00:03:40.330> one<00:03:40.480> can<00:03:40.660> hack<00:03:40.870> into

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
it's encrypted so no one can hack into

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.080 
it's encrypted so no one can hack into
that<00:03:41.350> signal<00:03:41.739> so<00:03:42.190> once<00:03:42.400> you've<00:03:42.580> got<00:03:42.760> that<00:03:42.910> it's

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
that signal so once you've got that it's

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.289 
that signal so once you've got that it's
a<00:03:43.209> secure<00:03:43.600> line<00:03:43.950> these<00:03:44.950> will<00:03:45.160> also<00:03:45.310> do<00:03:45.579> 150

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
a secure line these will also do 150

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:47.849 
a secure line these will also do 150
metres<00:03:46.600> on<00:03:46.810> their<00:03:47.019> own<00:03:47.170> with<00:03:47.320> the<00:03:47.440> standard

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
metres on their own with the standard

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.789 
metres on their own with the standard
aerial<00:03:48.299> you<00:03:49.299> stick<00:03:49.540> on<00:03:49.630> a<00:03:49.690> second<00:03:50.200> area<00:03:50.410> you'll

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
aerial you stick on a second area you'll

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.880 
aerial you stick on a second area you'll
get<00:03:50.950> about<00:03:51.070> 300<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.209> if<00:03:52.810> you<00:03:52.959> pop<00:03:53.500> on<00:03:53.590> a<00:03:53.650> third

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
get about 300 and if you pop on a third

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.020 
get about 300 and if you pop on a third
when<00:03:54.070> you<00:03:54.160> can't<00:03:54.370> get<00:03:54.430> a<00:03:54.489> bit<00:03:54.640> more<00:03:54.790> out<00:03:54.820> of

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
when you can't get a bit more out of

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.870 
when you can't get a bit more out of
them<00:03:55.150> so<00:03:56.040> these<00:03:57.040> are<00:03:57.160> great<00:03:57.370> for<00:03:57.400> slightly

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
them so these are great for slightly

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.199 
them so these are great for slightly
longer<00:03:58.060> distances<00:03:59.640> apart<00:04:00.640> from<00:04:00.790> that<00:04:00.970> we've

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
longer distances apart from that we've

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.690 
longer distances apart from that we've
also<00:04:01.390> got<00:04:01.750> one<00:04:02.049> really<00:04:02.799> helpful<00:04:03.220> feature<00:04:03.459> on

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
also got one really helpful feature on

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.770 
also got one really helpful feature on
here<00:04:03.970> is<00:04:04.150> an<00:04:04.989> infrared<00:04:05.470> sender<00:04:06.450> now<00:04:07.450> what<00:04:07.630> that

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
here is an infrared sender now what that

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.910 
here is an infrared sender now what that
allows<00:04:08.019> you<00:04:08.200> to<00:04:08.320> do<00:04:08.440> and<00:04:08.530> I<00:04:08.620> just<00:04:08.799> show<00:04:08.890> you

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
allows you to do and I just show you

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.319 
allows you to do and I just show you
that<00:04:09.100> that's<00:04:09.250> I'm<00:04:09.700> not<00:04:09.730> going<00:04:09.970> to<00:04:10.030> take<00:04:10.120> it<00:04:10.180> out

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
that that's I'm not going to take it out

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.479 
that that's I'm not going to take it out
the<00:04:10.420> bag<00:04:10.600> but<00:04:10.780> basically<00:04:11.170> you<00:04:11.320> get<00:04:11.530> you<00:04:12.280> can

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
the bag but basically you get you can

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.660 
the bag but basically you get you can
point<00:04:12.700> your<00:04:12.880> remote<00:04:13.209> control<00:04:13.660> for<00:04:14.410> the

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
point your remote control for the

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.670 
point your remote control for the
recorder<00:04:15.670> at<00:04:16.479> this<00:04:16.780> that<00:04:16.959> will<00:04:17.049> send<00:04:17.260> it<00:04:17.500> and

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
recorder at this that will send it and

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.060 
recorder at this that will send it and
it<00:04:18.430> will<00:04:18.519> send<00:04:18.820> it<00:04:18.940> between<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:19.390> two<00:04:20.070> receiver

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
it will send it between the two receiver

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.400 
it will send it between the two receiver
and<00:04:21.250> transmitter<00:04:21.280> pack<00:04:21.850> so<00:04:22.150> if<00:04:22.419> you<00:04:22.930> wanted<00:04:23.289> to

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
and transmitter pack so if you wanted to

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.800 
and transmitter pack so if you wanted to
have<00:04:23.560> a<00:04:23.590> recorder<00:04:24.220> at<00:04:24.400> a<00:04:24.460> distance<00:04:25.060> of<00:04:25.270> 150

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
have a recorder at a distance of 150

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.250 
have a recorder at a distance of 150
meters<00:04:26.080> away<00:04:26.380> you<00:04:27.039> could<00:04:27.220> sit<00:04:27.490> next<00:04:27.700> to<00:04:27.880> your

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
meters away you could sit next to your

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.630 
meters away you could sit next to your
receiver<00:04:29.260> and<00:04:29.590> you<00:04:29.950> can<00:04:30.130> control<00:04:30.490> the

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
receiver and you can control the

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.840 
receiver and you can control the
recorder<00:04:31.090> that<00:04:31.240> is<00:04:31.419> 150<00:04:32.169> meters<00:04:32.289> away<00:04:32.590> and<00:04:32.950> so

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
recorder that is 150 meters away and so

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.610 
recorder that is 150 meters away and so
if<00:04:33.970> you're<00:04:34.090> a<00:04:34.510> television<00:04:34.990> or<00:04:35.229> anything<00:04:35.440> like

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
if you're a television or anything like

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.529 
if you're a television or anything like
that<00:04:35.680> you<00:04:35.979> can<00:04:36.010> you<00:04:36.340> can<00:04:36.520> control<00:04:36.910> it<00:04:37.090> so<00:04:37.419> it's

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
that you can you can control it so it's

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.390 
that you can you can control it so it's
a<00:04:37.600> really<00:04:37.840> useful<00:04:38.139> additional<00:04:38.800> function<00:04:39.190> to

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
a really useful additional function to

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.090 
a really useful additional function to
these<00:04:39.520> transmitters

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
these transmitters

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.860 
these transmitters
apart<00:04:41.700> from<00:04:41.760> that<00:04:41.850> they<00:04:42.090> say<00:04:42.630> they're<00:04:42.840> the

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
apart from that they say they're the

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.330 
apart from that they say they're the
same<00:04:43.080> but<00:04:43.140> we<00:04:43.350> sell<00:04:43.770> a<00:04:43.800> lot<00:04:44.010> more<00:04:44.040> of<00:04:44.250> these

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
same but we sell a lot more of these

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.080 
same but we sell a lot more of these
because<00:04:44.550> of<00:04:44.820> the<00:04:46.370> reduction<00:04:47.370> in<00:04:47.490> interference

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
because of the reduction in interference

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.180 
because of the reduction in interference
that<00:04:48.240> we<00:04:48.330> get<00:04:48.510> I<00:04:48.840> was<00:04:49.740> going<00:04:49.890> to<00:04:49.950> show<00:04:50.070> you<00:04:50.130> a

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
that we get I was going to show you a

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.620 
that we get I was going to show you a
couple<00:04:50.340> more<00:04:50.580> because<00:04:50.760> we<00:04:50.880> do<00:04:51.030> have<00:04:51.210> one<00:04:51.450> more

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
couple more because we do have one more

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.160 
couple more because we do have one more
slightly<00:04:52.590> more<00:04:52.770> advanced<00:04:53.220> model<00:04:53.790> and<00:04:54.170> we're

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
slightly more advanced model and we're

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.910 
slightly more advanced model and we're
going<00:04:55.350> to<00:04:55.440> do<00:04:55.560> one<00:04:57.170> and<00:04:58.170> we<00:04:58.380> also<00:04:58.500> have<00:04:58.800> one

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
going to do one and we also have one

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.680 
going to do one and we also have one
that<00:04:59.100> will<00:04:59.340> control<00:04:59.730> a<00:04:59.790> pen<00:05:00.090> tilt<00:05:00.390> zoom<00:05:00.480> camera

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
that will control a pen tilt zoom camera

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.460 
that will control a pen tilt zoom camera
I<00:05:02.300> won't<00:05:03.300> show<00:05:03.480> you<00:05:03.540> everything<00:05:03.900> in<00:05:04.110> here<00:05:04.290> but

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
I won't show you everything in here but

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.880 
I won't show you everything in here but
in<00:05:05.070> addition<00:05:05.990> you've<00:05:06.990> got<00:05:07.170> an<00:05:07.260> an<00:05:08.570> rs-485

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
in addition you've got an an rs-485

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.770 
in addition you've got an an rs-485
connection<00:05:10.890> for<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:11.820> controls<00:05:12.330> for<00:05:12.480> a<00:05:12.570> pan

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
connection for the controls for a pan

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.710 
connection for the controls for a pan
tilt<00:05:13.020> zoom<00:05:13.080> camera<00:05:13.340> so<00:05:14.360> again<00:05:15.360> if<00:05:15.480> you've<00:05:15.600> got

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
tilt zoom camera so again if you've got

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.170 
tilt zoom camera so again if you've got
a<00:05:15.750> wires<00:05:15.990> you've<00:05:16.800> got<00:05:16.890> a<00:05:16.920> pan<00:05:17.070> tilt<00:05:17.250> zoom<00:05:17.310> a<00:05:17.580> 150

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
a wires you've got a pan tilt zoom a 150

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.710 
a wires you've got a pan tilt zoom a 150
meters<00:05:18.510> you<00:05:18.990> can<00:05:19.020> run<00:05:19.380> the<00:05:19.710> telemetry<00:05:20.720> the

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
meters you can run the telemetry the

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.560 
meters you can run the telemetry the
video<00:05:21.990> and<00:05:22.890> audio<00:05:23.040> if<00:05:23.340> you've<00:05:23.460> got<00:05:23.640> it<00:05:23.820> ok<00:05:24.510> so

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
video and audio if you've got it ok so

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.690 
video and audio if you've got it ok so
that's<00:05:24.930> how<00:05:25.020> that<00:05:25.200> one<00:05:25.440> works<00:05:25.590> again<00:05:26.400> same

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
that's how that one works again same

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.550 
that's how that one works again same
digital<00:05:27.180> technology<00:05:27.720> so<00:05:27.930> that<00:05:27.960> they<00:05:28.170> pair<00:05:28.530> up

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
digital technology so that they pair up

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.400 
digital technology so that they pair up
together<00:05:28.890> and<00:05:29.480> you<00:05:30.480> know<00:05:30.570> very<00:05:30.870> very<00:05:30.930> little

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
together and you know very very little

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.930 
together and you know very very little
problems<00:05:31.950> with<00:05:32.010> interference<00:05:32.520> and<00:05:32.670> that<00:05:32.700> sort

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
problems with interference and that sort
