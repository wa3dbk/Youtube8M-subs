simple<00:00:31.080> at<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.349> point<00:00:31.759> let's<00:00:32.759> take<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.940> look

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
simple at this point let's take a look

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.180 
simple at this point let's take a look
here<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.170> known<00:00:34.350> as<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.620> black<00:00:34.890> wheel

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
here it is known as the black wheel

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.130 
here it is known as the black wheel
Terrance<00:00:35.640> because<00:00:35.969> Terrance's<00:00:36.540> these<00:00:36.870> days

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
Terrance because Terrance's these days

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.080 
Terrance because Terrance's these days
have<00:00:37.860> orange<00:00:38.160> wheels<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.670> Terrance<00:00:38.940> has

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
have orange wheels and this Terrance has

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.360 
have orange wheels and this Terrance has
black<00:00:39.360> wheels<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.469> Terrance<00:00:40.860> honestly

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
black wheels so this Terrance honestly

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.380 
black wheels so this Terrance honestly
looks<00:00:41.610> nothing<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:43.430> even<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.640> TV<00:00:44.879> circuit<00:00:45.210> I

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
looks nothing like even the TV circuit I

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.119 
looks nothing like even the TV circuit I
think<00:00:45.600> this<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.840> one<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.140> far<00:00:46.440> off<00:00:46.620> models

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
think this is one of the far off models

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.430 
think this is one of the far off models
that<00:00:47.309> have<00:00:47.399> seen<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.910> know<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.750> shot<00:00:49.020> kind<00:00:49.320> of

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
that have seen I know this shot kind of

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.160 
that have seen I know this shot kind of
makes<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.829> look<00:00:50.180> well<00:00:51.180> okay<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.600> does<00:00:51.840> make<00:00:52.050> it

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
makes it look well okay it does make it

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.100 
makes it look well okay it does make it
look<00:00:52.289> orange<00:00:52.590> but<00:00:52.770> it's<00:00:52.890> not<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.340> orange

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
look orange but it's not that orange

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.490 
look orange but it's not that orange
it's<00:00:55.110> actually<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.410> pretty<00:00:55.680> light<00:00:55.920> orange<00:00:57.500> I'm

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
it's actually a pretty light orange I'm

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.130

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
just plain and simple I think they

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.690 
just plain and simple I think they
didn't<00:01:03.600> really<00:01:03.780> do<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> lot<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.700> investigating

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
didn't really do a lot of investigating

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.250 
didn't really do a lot of investigating
on<00:01:05.850> how<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.299> make<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.600> turns<00:01:06.840> better<00:01:07.049> at

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
on how we can make this turns better at

on how we can make this turns better at
the<00:01:07.380> time<00:01:07.530> it's<00:01:07.740> just<00:01:07.799> very<00:01:08.400> very<00:01:08.729> plain

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710

the black wheels versus the big orange
with<00:01:50.939> caterpillars<00:01:51.740> obviously<00:01:52.740> this

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
with caterpillars obviously this

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.620 
with caterpillars obviously this
Terrance<00:01:53.280> does<00:01:53.579> not<00:01:53.759> have<00:01:53.909> any<00:01:54.060> cow<00:01:54.210> pillars

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
Terrance does not have any cow pillars

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.830 
Terrance does not have any cow pillars
I've<00:01:54.899> seen<00:01:55.790> Terrance's<00:01:56.790> like<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:57.600> aren't

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
I've seen Terrance's like this aren't

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.330 
I've seen Terrance's like this aren't
intending<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.469> have<00:01:58.560> cow<00:01:58.740> pillars<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.189> I

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
intending to that have cow pillars so I

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.069 
intending to that have cow pillars so I
think<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.119> maybe<00:02:00.299> at<00:02:00.420> one<00:02:00.630> point<00:02:00.840> this

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
think that maybe at one point this

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.620 
think that maybe at one point this
Terrance<00:02:01.409> did<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> caterpillar<00:02:02.540> did<00:02:03.540> have

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
Terrance did have a caterpillar did have

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.840 
Terrance did have a caterpillar did have
caterpillars<00:02:04.229> but<00:02:04.799> maybe<00:02:05.040> they<00:02:05.219> fell<00:02:05.460> off<00:02:05.610> and

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
caterpillars but maybe they fell off and

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.730 
caterpillars but maybe they fell off and
when<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:05.969> bought<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.360> off<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.600> ebay<00:02:06.780> for<00:02:07.140> like<00:02:07.290> 10

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
when I bought it off of ebay for like 10

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.029 
when I bought it off of ebay for like 10
bucks<00:02:07.950> or<00:02:08.129> whatever<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:09.360> was<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.690> day<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
bucks or whatever it was a day the

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.980 
bucks or whatever it was a day the
seller<00:02:11.220> didn't<00:02:11.489> have<00:02:11.580> them<00:02:11.730> and

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
seller didn't have them and

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.690 
seller didn't have them and
decide<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.470> include<00:02:12.650> them<00:02:15.340> let's<00:02:16.340> turn<00:02:16.580> them

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
decide to include them let's turn them

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.180 
decide to include them let's turn them
sideways<00:02:16.880> here<00:02:17.390> look<00:02:17.510> at<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.690> faces<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:18.380> think

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
sideways here look at the faces I think

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.560 
sideways here look at the faces I think
the<00:02:19.310> turns<00:02:19.520> on<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.760> right<00:02:19.910> is<00:02:20.000> pretty<00:02:20.270> darn
