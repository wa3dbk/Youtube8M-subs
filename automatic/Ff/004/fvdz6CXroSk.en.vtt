00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
we've got a real real live engine we've

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.840 
we've got a real real live engine we've
got<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.339> offer<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.699> up<00:00:41.819> to<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.210> car<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.699> it's<00:00:44.699> a

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
got to offer it up to the car and it's a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.540 
got to offer it up to the car and it's a
lovely<00:00:45.059> piece<00:00:45.359> but<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.109> should<00:00:46.319> just<00:00:46.499> nest<00:00:47.339> in

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
lovely piece but it should just nest in

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.309 
lovely piece but it should just nest in
the<00:00:47.670> back<00:00:47.819> of<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:47.999> car<00:00:48.269> and<00:00:48.510> that's<00:00:48.749> just<00:00:49.139> make

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:49.319 
the back of the car and that's just make

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:52.910 
the back of the car and that's just make
sure<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:50.089> CAD<00:00:51.089> and<00:00:51.329> reality<00:00:51.929> will<00:00:52.109> meet<00:00:52.379> all

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
sure that CAD and reality will meet all

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.400 
sure that CAD and reality will meet all
righty

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410

the engine is the heart of the car has

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.539 
the engine is the heart of the car has
to<00:01:02.350> be<00:01:02.379> light

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.359 

the<00:01:08.149> whole<00:01:08.359> car<00:01:08.689> was<00:01:09.049> conceived<00:01:09.649> around<00:01:10.070> a

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
the whole car was conceived around a

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.419 
the whole car was conceived around a
very<00:01:10.609> small<00:01:11.149> lightweight<00:01:11.929> low<00:01:12.590> displacement

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:13.429 
very small lightweight low displacement

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:17.590 
very small lightweight low displacement
engine<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:15.280> this<00:01:16.280> is<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.700> perfect<00:01:16.939> engine<00:01:17.390> oh

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
engine and this is the perfect engine oh

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.050 
engine and this is the perfect engine oh
yes

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.380 

the<00:01:23.060> engine<00:01:23.420> in<00:01:23.689> the<00:01:23.869> DeltaWing<00:01:24.380> is<00:01:24.590> a<00:01:24.619> nissan

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
the engine in the DeltaWing is a nissan

1.6 di GT turbo very similar in
structure<00:01:29.450> to<00:01:29.689> the<00:01:30.259> engines<00:01:30.590> that<00:01:30.740> we've<00:01:30.860> got

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
structure to the engines that we've got

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.120 
structure to the engines that we've got
in<00:01:31.369> our<00:01:31.459> duty<00:01:31.850> products<00:01:32.799> it's<00:01:33.799> a<00:01:33.890> four

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
in our duty products it's a four

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.699 
in our duty products it's a four
cylinder<00:01:34.520> it's<00:01:34.850> a<00:01:34.939> 1.6<00:01:35.780> liter<00:01:36.110> it's

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:36.709 
cylinder it's a 1.6 liter it's

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:38.770 
cylinder it's a 1.6 liter it's
turbocharged<00:01:37.579> to<00:01:37.819> give<00:01:37.969> us<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.240> power<00:01:38.450> and

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
turbocharged to give us the power and

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.569 
turbocharged to give us the power and
very<00:01:38.990> high<00:01:39.200> efficiency<00:01:39.829> it<00:01:40.009> has<00:01:40.189> direct

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
very high efficiency it has direct

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.490 
very high efficiency it has direct
injection<00:01:41.179> which<00:01:41.360> gives<00:01:41.630> us<00:01:41.750> a<00:01:41.929> very<00:01:42.380> good

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
injection which gives us a very good

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.710 
injection which gives us a very good
boost<00:01:42.950> in<00:01:43.159> efficiency<00:01:43.759> and<00:01:46.420> it's<00:01:47.420> only<00:01:47.539> going

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
boost in efficiency and it's only going

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.880 
boost in efficiency and it's only going
to<00:01:47.780> Rev<00:01:47.989> to<00:01:48.200> around<00:01:48.380> seven<00:01:48.739> and<00:01:48.829> a<00:01:48.860> half

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
to Rev to around seven and a half

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.919 
to Rev to around seven and a half
thousand<00:01:49.369> rpm<00:01:49.459> so<00:01:50.000> just<00:01:50.239> like<00:01:50.390> a<00:01:50.420> road<00:01:50.689> engine

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
thousand rpm so just like a road engine

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.319 
thousand rpm so just like a road engine
today<00:01:51.380> so<00:01:52.039> we<00:01:52.189> can<00:01:52.340> get<00:01:52.459> away<00:01:52.670> with<00:01:52.849> that<00:01:52.970> tiny

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
today so we can get away with that tiny

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.229 
today so we can get away with that tiny
little<00:01:53.479> fuel<00:01:53.959> cell<00:01:54.259> doing<00:01:55.039> really<00:01:55.970> a<00:01:56.060> hundred

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:56.239 
little fuel cell doing really a hundred

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:59.199 
little fuel cell doing really a hundred
and<00:01:56.569> ten<00:01:57.200> miles<00:01:57.470> around<00:01:57.979> them<00:01:58.189> all<00:01:58.310> so<00:01:58.729> that's

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209 
and ten miles around them all so that's

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:03.690 
and ten miles around them all so that's
so<00:01:59.420> exciting

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.100 

first<00:02:04.700> real<00:02:04.939> honest<00:02:05.329> day<00:02:05.479> of<00:02:05.659> engine

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
first real honest day of engine

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.350 
first real honest day of engine
installation<00:02:06.459> sort<00:02:07.459> of<00:02:07.520> problem-solving

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
installation sort of problem-solving

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.259 
installation sort of problem-solving
I<00:02:08.479> think<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:09.049> satisfaction<00:02:09.679> will<00:02:09.829> come<00:02:10.269> when

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
I think the satisfaction will come when

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:24.360 
I think the satisfaction will come when
we<00:02:11.390> fire<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.870> engine<00:02:12.109> for<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.290> first<00:02:12.470> time

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370
