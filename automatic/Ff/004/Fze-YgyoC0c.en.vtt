00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello friends and youtube subscribers in 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.120
 this video will teach you how to make a 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.509
 origami pine like this well let's 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.429
 see how it is done to elaborate this 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.300
 pine that measures approximately 13 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.630
 centimeters we will need 3 squares of 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.650
 green paper 1 of 20 centimeters and 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.740
 another one of 18 and 116 and a square of color 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.510
 16 centimeters coffee remember that 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.480
 you can draw your pine 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.070
 size that you want respecting the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.470
 relationship between the squares 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.390
 the procedure will be the same for all 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.559
 the squares will first double 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.559
 by the diagonals 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.570
 we unfold 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.910
 well and then we'll double by the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.810
 halves 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.810
 on this side 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:07.500
 and on the other we unfold and turn around 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.500
 taking the four points to the center 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.670
 in this way getting this figure 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:23.810
 well next we will take these two 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:27.910
 ends of the sides and we will push these 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.910
 folds in such a way 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:38.190
 press and raise 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:43.290
 the other tips 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:46.020
 thus obtaining this figure we can 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.040
 observe that between each point we have a 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.900
 small triangle what we will do with that 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.900
 triangle is to bend it 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.690
 in this way and taking it to the side 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:01.830
 left 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.170
 we push 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.570
 and we can see that we have one 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.420
 small triangle below this 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.560
 triangle we will double it by putting it 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.110
 in this way and we will have this 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.800
 figure well we will do the same with the 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.910
 others 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.830
 we double 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.340
 thus 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.050
 and we put 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.570
 this triangle inside 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.570
 well we continue with the third 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:41.130
 we press so we turn to the side 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:46.740
 left and this triangle 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:49.000
 we will put it inside and finally the 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.720
 latest 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.720
 we double 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:03:01.749
 until the left side we press and 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.749
 we will put this triangle inside 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.130
 this way in the end we will get this 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.620
 figure 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.800
 well we will perform the same procedure 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.680
 with the other squares finally and 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.450
 we have finished the four squares and 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.570
 what we will do is to first take 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:25.590
 our our brown figure e 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.920
 insert the largest square of this 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.920
 shape 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.239
 well we will insert the square that follows 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.660
 and finally 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.210
 the last smallest figure 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.240
 and we will get our pine 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.790
 good friends, I hope you liked it 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:51.580
