feature<00:02:07.210> is<00:02:07.600> we've<00:02:08.319> integrated<00:02:08.619> a<00:02:09.009> boa<00:02:09.220> system

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
feature is we've integrated a boa system

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.039 
feature is we've integrated a boa system
on<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:09.909> back<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.360> we<00:02:10.420> can<00:02:10.539> take<00:02:10.659> a<00:02:10.720> closer

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
on the back and we can take a closer
