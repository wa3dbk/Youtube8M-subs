00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 this makeup is one of my proposals 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.560
 for the New Year's look, although you can 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.480
 use indistinctly in another era 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.160
 of the year since in the end it is a makeup 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.770
 Elegant with glamor and with a very touch 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.010
 retro marked in the 60s so I hope 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.010
 that you like 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.269
 since it's going to be a pretty makeup 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.460
 graphic and clean let's prepare 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.059
 our eyelid you can use some 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.600
 corrector or any of the 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:43.350
 bases that you use that is of a tone 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.620
 uniform process once our eyelid 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.649
 clean let's apply a beige shade 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.110
 that can be both matte and something 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.720
 of brightness but not excessively 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.239
 frosty so it does not compete as it is 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.180
 a very graphic makeup we are going to 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.600
 Apply all over the mobile eyelid 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.600
 above 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.700
 actually this step is simply 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:12.479
 as to finish perfecting as 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.049
 what is going to be our canvas we are going to 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.619
 catch some shade with a brown tone 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.990
 grayish and we're going to apply it on the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.640
 eye socket will do the same 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.640
 protocol in the other eye 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.180
 next we are going to delineate the eye 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:42.350
 I in this case I will use a cream 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:46.390
 in gel let's delineate what is the ras 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.710
 of the eyelashes without a thin line 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.690
 according to the eyeliner you are doing and 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.630
 remember that if you want it as more 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.570
 we're going to be redondito 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:02.369
 turning our eye much more circular 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:05.080
 if we do it much thinner and more 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.740
 closed to the eyelashes we are going to lengthen 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.330
 the eye 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.660
 once the eye is outlined 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.960
 we are going to launch a line following a 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.100
 little direction 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.470
 what brand as 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.470
 the end of our eye 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:33.260
 and we will start to connect it 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.260
 with the outline we have made 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.950
 and remember that when we have made one 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.350
 from our sides look at us again 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.870
 from front in a mirror and check 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.480
 that the symmetry of both is pretty much 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.200
 couple then 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.060
 and we finish we know how high in that 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.630
 pending and has to face 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:04.460
 highlighted one of the high line 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:07.250
 we could leave the look like this we could 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:10.040
 add some of the brightness that is how I'm going to 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.390
 add I'm going to put something like powder 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.510
 diamond in the center 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.100
 and then what I'm going to add is another 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.590
 outlined which will connect 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.660
 with this line that we see here apart from 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:28.240
 have delineated a tip above is 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:31.860
 lift have a little bit of the eyelid and 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:36.020
 helped from a mirror that we have down 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.020
 will begin to fill inside 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:50.090
 in this way it will be totally black 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:54.790
 because we will not see as the piece as 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.790
 Cilla meat that looks not from the eye itself 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.370
 and we will repeat the same with the other eye and 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.890
 I recommend you as we have here already 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.159
 glitter shade better try as 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.640
 throw a bit like the eyelid and let's look 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.640
 down 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.859
 let's delineate below the flush of the 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.859
 tabs 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.039
 and we will connect it with the rest of the 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:25.250
 makeup and we will do the same in the other 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.250
 side 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:45.289
 let's apply a little bit of concealer or 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.180
 on 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.669
 about dad 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.150
 we would apply a little mask of 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.150
 tabs 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.370
 and on the lower lashes 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:11.060
 use a matte bronzer to 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.060
 sculpt our cheekbone a little 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.850
 and we'll take it up in the 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.850
 temples 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.720
 and we will apply a rouge in shades 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:34.169
 peach bronze to two with something of 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.169
 Golden 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:42.000
 over the center of our cheeks 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:45.300
 let's now use an eyeliner 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.630
 red because our lip is in a 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.490
 red this time I'm going to apply the 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.310
 via de crema 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.940
 From the center 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.940
 out 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:05.030
 being the natural way of our 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.030
 lips 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:19.010
 finally I'm going to apply some of 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.010
 illuminator on the cheeks 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.600
 this then would be our look 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.550
 finished and I think it would be ideal for 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.770
 New Year's Eve if you liked it please 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:40.090
 I like to see you in the 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.090
 next video thanks
