design was designed almost five years

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.770 
design was designed almost five years
ago<00:00:42.160> before<00:00:42.309> some<00:00:42.700> you<00:00:42.850> could<00:00:43.000> even<00:00:43.150> hold<00:00:43.480> Lego

the<00:00:51.610> new<00:00:51.730> design<00:00:51.940> here<00:00:52.600> we'll<00:00:53.140> just<00:00:53.170> get<00:00:53.500> to

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
the new design here we'll just get to

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.560 
the new design here we'll just get to
that<00:00:53.769> one<00:00:53.920> we<00:00:54.040> get<00:00:54.129> this<00:00:54.280> guide<00:00:54.460> of<00:00:54.550> the<00:00:54.640> way<00:00:54.790> he

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
that one we get this guide of the way he

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.200 
that one we get this guide of the way he
can<00:00:55.750> also<00:00:55.989> hold<00:00:56.290> the<00:00:56.980> trailers<00:00:57.430> of<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.970> same

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210

can also hold the trailers of the same
the<00:00:58.420> old<00:00:58.629> design<00:00:58.989> you<00:00:59.769> can<00:00:59.920> see<00:01:00.070> here<00:01:00.250> could

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
the old design you can see here could

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.470 
the old design you can see here could
bring<00:01:00.519> in<00:01:00.610> one<00:01:00.730> of<00:01:00.790> the<00:01:00.850> trailer<00:01:01.150> then<00:01:01.330> he'll

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
bring in one of the trailer then he'll

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.799 
bring in one of the trailer then he'll
hitch<00:01:01.720> up<00:01:01.930> no<00:01:02.379> problem<00:01:03.330> so<00:01:04.330> to<00:01:04.420> get<00:01:04.690> the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
hitch up no problem so to get the

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.890 
hitch up no problem so to get the
transformation<00:01:05.260> within<00:01:05.710> a<00:01:05.890> second<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.720> let's

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
transformation within a second so let's

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.440 
transformation within a second so let's
get<00:01:08.080> right<00:01:08.800> now<00:01:08.979> like<00:01:09.520> most<00:01:09.700> Optimus<00:01:10.120> Prime's

of like the masterpiece toy and we
ratchet<00:02:22.090> those<00:02:22.420> up<00:02:22.570> like<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:23.020> of<00:02:23.290> course<00:02:24.250> now

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
ratchet those up like that of course now

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.149 
ratchet those up like that of course now
we<00:02:24.580> have<00:02:24.849> to<00:02:24.970> turn<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.360> whole<00:02:25.569> body<00:02:26.159> 180

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
we have to turn the whole body 180

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.309 
we have to turn the whole body 180
degrees<00:02:27.519> around

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
degrees around

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.890 
degrees around
and<00:02:29.439> I<00:02:29.999> got<00:02:30.999> to<00:02:31.090> make<00:02:31.180> sure<00:02:31.239> everything's<00:02:31.629> out

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:36.999 
that so we get it around and we can move

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:38.729 
that so we get it around and we can move
now<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.239> hands<00:02:37.840> or<00:02:38.049> the<00:02:38.139> arms<00:02:38.409> into<00:02:38.560> the

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
separating the legs folding down this

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.009 
separating the legs folding down this
turntable<00:03:20.199> piece<00:03:20.680> piece<00:03:21.069> like<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:21.340> and<00:03:22.019> let's

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
turntable piece piece like so and let's

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.479 
turntable piece piece like so and let's
get<00:03:23.790> our<00:03:24.790> 2014<00:03:25.659> Optimus<00:03:26.139> Prime<00:03:26.469> standing<00:03:27.370> and

get our 2014 Optimus Prime standing and
ready<00:03:27.669> for<00:03:27.760> battle<00:03:31.169> so<00:03:32.169> you<00:03:32.230> can<00:03:32.349> see<00:03:32.500> him

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
ready for battle so you can see him

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.039 
ready for battle so you can see him
there<00:03:32.650> he<00:03:33.519> is<00:03:33.549> very<00:03:34.239> very<00:03:34.959> much<00:03:36.870> looking<00:03:37.870> like

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
there he is very very much looking like

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.649 
there he is very very much looking like
the<00:03:38.169> cartoon<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:38.859> was<00:03:39.519> my<00:03:39.819> plan<00:03:40.060> here<00:03:40.419> hide

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659 
the cartoon that was my plan here hide

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:42.390 
the cartoon that was my plan here hide
the<00:03:40.689> wheels<00:03:41.109> so<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.590> wheels<00:03:41.769> here<00:03:42.040> you<00:03:42.159> can't

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
the wheels so the wheels here you can't

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.159 
the wheels so the wheels here you can't
see<00:03:42.609> them<00:03:42.759> and<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.150> wheels<00:03:43.329> on<00:03:43.569> the<00:03:43.900> upper

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
see them and the wheels on the upper

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:45.749 
see them and the wheels on the upper
body<00:03:44.319> you<00:03:44.500> can't<00:03:44.739> see<00:03:44.919> them<00:03:45.069> so<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:45.459> gives<00:03:45.639> a

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:45.759 
body you can't see them so it gives a

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:50.339 
body you can't see them so it gives a
very<00:03:45.909> nice<00:03:46.180> robot<00:03:47.049> mode<00:03:47.379> so<00:03:47.979> we<00:03:48.099> can<00:03:48.250> see<00:03:49.349> he's

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
very nice robot mode so we can see he's

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.890 
very nice robot mode so we can see he's
very<00:03:50.620> chunky<00:03:50.949> but<00:03:51.639> he's<00:03:51.819> very<00:03:52.269> reminiscent<00:03:52.629> of

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
very chunky but he's very reminiscent of

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.530 
very chunky but he's very reminiscent of
the<00:03:53.019> g1<00:03:53.349> cartoon<00:03:53.609> so<00:03:54.609> if<00:03:54.939> you're<00:03:55.329> interested
