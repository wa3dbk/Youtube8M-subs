00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.469
 but 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.199
 Dr 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.100
 the quieter ball 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.519
 I wanted you once 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:25.240
 his 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.339
 put into relationship show how to clean up 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:31.569
 The Briton sat down against bankruptcy 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:34.860
 that goes with a different window name m 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.350
 eponym 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.640
 Król will 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.640
 you click on your internet 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.160
 and since i could become independent i just have 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.150
 But I also stand everything in the description we all of mine 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.090
 Adults went to the Bundeswehr 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.090
 then on okay 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.940
 best on your the top 10 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.630
 new controls 12 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.270
 why and 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.450
 to open the seal so it's not that stands here the pace 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.040
 he needs her an endpoint program with me it's winter was there too 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.740
 still others will 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.740
 Percent is also dwindling in the video description 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.550
 and then simply double-click on it 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.280
 and then he sees red looking out of it 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.650
 Figel folder and stuff 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.060
 Vienna you have to later in a folder pull a folder and best 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.690
 again, now times 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.910
 the folder should 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.250
 Edit latest 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.250
 and then he pulls everything would be a break 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.909
 the folder for this point by point everything else 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.580
 everyone will pull 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.580
 Bayer drag in court at more than 2 percent 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.040
 so you have to wait a bit 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.140
 so then it could be a tasty and delicious and that you can delete it again 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.250
 who clicks I have the former stretches new works on mine 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.250
 Parents who tick below are still merchants 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.119
 This could include being on the way 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:20.799
 and then Borken places anyway because bru no 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.639
 Moritz 2 you can tell 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.419
 then on pander 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:28.899
 So with me Pandora is called the world 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:31.569
 then on foreign data 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.919
 Percent, but unfortunately not on multiplayer I just wanted to go 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:36.429
 say 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:39.039
 sound 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:42.069
 I will not show you this 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.989
 Per cent of the Inter there are a few things there is not like here 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.829
 Example of the torso 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.179
 but 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:52.479
 to create the salvation of the soul 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:54.389
 I could only do that 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.839
 percent 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:59.039
 Captain Uwe Möhrle wonderful 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:02.259
 I just say that to the squint 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:05.259
 here must give one how much he wanted from 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.219
 SG until 245 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:12.070
 but sadly so much Bocholt 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.879
 at least 23 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.839
 then on Happy to Select 

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:20.909
 and if you then did everything he wanted then just tap the wallet 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.879
 above 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.869
 then you can close the thing again 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:28.869
 and then I went to Mycroft 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.359
 give under Denter 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:36.389
 Percent are clear now 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.119
 Single player 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:39.969
 both world 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:42.109
 because I'll show you full screen 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:43.729
 where not 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:44.989
 percent 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.989
 The Citigroup are not as good as the heavyweight 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.539
 and 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:53.539
 Year are the cacti 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.299
 and 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.359
 That was it 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.879
 I left the game again 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.779
 that's a star Stampa the program 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:11.549
 Percent I hope I could help you if not then just write one 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.499
