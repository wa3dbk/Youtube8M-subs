00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.449
 the conceptually ambush is a technique 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.250
 very simple and intuitive is that which 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.289
 most predators use to 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.880
 catch a prey and consists of 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.950
 being able to approach without being 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.989
 noticed up to a sufficient distance 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.969
 to be able to launch a good attack 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.399
 probability of success 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.719
 obviously this simplicity 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.390
 conceptual does not correspond then one 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.890
 actual simplicity in execution 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.960
 also because unlike most 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.820
 part of predators apnea fishermen 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.539
 we have to do everything underwater which is not 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.730
 our environment 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.500
 moreover holding the breath in 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.510
 every case doing things right and 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.039
 applying the techniques correctly with 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.000
 the ambush some nice fish you can 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.000
 take it very often 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.040
 the best circumstances to practice 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.899
 the ambush are those in which the fish in 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.420
 movement and in particular those in 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.430
 who is busy looking for food that 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.710
 they tend to reduce their state of attention 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.070
 and the ability to perceive the fisherman 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.000
 approaching therefore theoretically le 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.490
 better conditions 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.070
 are the sunrise and sunset times 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.509
 the undertow phases 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.490
 although it is possible to practice the 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.070
 I look at all his depths 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.929
 election ground especially for those 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.300
 has yet to create a baggage of 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.590
 experience and certainly the low background 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.229
 near the coast 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.179
 the areas most indicated are those that 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.830
 have rock walls with rises 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:45.119
 important even if in reality it is 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.520
 possible to practice ambush 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.690
 practically everywhere even in areas 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.690
 predominantly flat 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.280
 the movements of the ambush are not alone 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.280
 a fishing technique but a way of being 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.109
 constantly pay attention to the water 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.000
 in concealing as much as possible the 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:06.310
 own presence and in maintaining a 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.990
 very low profile should be the 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.289
 daily bread of any good 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.289
 fisherman 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.769
 the key principle of stalking 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.689
 and fish hiding during 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.640
 shifts obtained especially with 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:22.430
 adhesion to the seabed or wall 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.709
 rocky crawling literally on the 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.390
 background at reduced speed and using 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.129
 the fins as little as possible looking 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.260
 instead of exploiting the hand you don't 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:33.170
 hold the gun to pull yourself forward 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.329
 the fisherman can move by looking 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.500
 of the sighting posts 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:39.349
 privileged from which he can observe 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.239
 without being noticed and undertaken 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:45.010
 direct approach routes to 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.010
 the fish eventually sighted
