00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
together as a team last year the reason

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.770 
together as a team last year the reason
we<00:01:43.100> won<00:01:43.310> was<00:01:43.580> mostly<00:01:44.030> because<00:01:44.210> that<00:01:44.660> we

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
we won was mostly because that we

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.680 
we won was mostly because that we
connect<00:01:45.440> and<00:01:45.590> we<00:01:45.680> had<00:01:45.830> a<00:01:46.100> lot<00:01:47.090> a<00:01:47.360> lot<00:01:47.540> of

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
connect and we had a lot a lot of

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.840 
connect and we had a lot a lot of
chemistry<00:01:47.960> that<00:01:48.680> brought<00:01:48.980> us<00:01:49.010> together<00:01:49.220> and

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
chemistry that brought us together and

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.450 
chemistry that brought us together and
helped<00:01:50.450> us<00:01:50.510> win<00:01:50.750> our<00:01:51.050> biggest<00:01:51.920> games<00:01:52.130> and

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
helped us win our biggest games and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:16.020 
helped us win our biggest games and
we're<00:01:53.240> trying<00:01:53.330> to<00:01:53.510> get<00:01:53.600> back<00:01:53.690> to<00:01:53.840> that

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.300 

this<00:02:16.660> year<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:16.900> think<00:02:16.990> we're<00:02:17.770> a<00:02:17.800> little<00:02:17.920> older

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
this year I think we're a little older

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.490 
this year I think we're a little older
more<00:02:18.970> experienced<00:02:19.480> last<00:02:19.720> year<00:02:19.959> we<00:02:20.110> had<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.290> lot

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
more experienced last year we had a lot

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.980 
more experienced last year we had a lot
of<00:02:20.530> underclassmen<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.520> lot<00:02:22.480> of<00:02:22.600> guys<00:02:22.720> who<00:02:22.870> had

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
of underclassmen a lot of guys who had

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.300 
of underclassmen a lot of guys who had
never<00:02:23.110> played<00:02:23.380> at<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.650> varsity<00:02:23.800> level<00:02:23.950> before

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
never played at the varsity level before

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.130 
never played at the varsity level before
so<00:02:24.819> this<00:02:25.300> year<00:02:25.450> I<00:02:25.510> think<00:02:25.750> we're<00:02:25.840> going<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.020> be<00:02:26.110> a

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
so this year I think we're going to be a

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.510 
so this year I think we're going to be a
little<00:02:26.380> more<00:02:26.500> experience<00:02:26.770> I'm<00:02:27.310> pretty

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
little more experience I'm pretty

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.790 
little more experience I'm pretty
confident<00:02:27.940> that<00:02:28.150> we<00:02:28.300> can<00:02:28.480> do<00:02:29.410> what<00:02:29.530> we<00:02:29.560> did

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
confident that we can do what we did

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.920 
confident that we can do what we did
last<00:02:29.830> year<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.550> all<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.090> ways<00:02:31.360> of<00:02:31.540> channel

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
last year and all the ways of channel

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.490 
last year and all the ways of channel
surf<00:02:32.140> in<00:02:32.500> another<00:02:32.739> ring<00:02:33.090> um<00:02:34.090> pretty<00:02:34.959> pretty

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
surf in another ring um pretty pretty

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.470 
surf in another ring um pretty pretty
deep<00:02:35.770> offensively<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:36.580> even<00:02:36.910> sleep<00:02:37.150> so<00:02:37.420> I

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
deep offensively and even sleep so I

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.440 
deep offensively and even sleep so I
think

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.020 

won't<00:02:43.690> you<00:02:43.870> let<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.379> line

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
won't you let the line

00:02:45.030 --> 00:03:09.670 
won't you let the line
Oh

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.500 

last<00:03:10.310> year<00:03:10.549> we<00:03:10.700> lost<00:03:10.879> a<00:03:11.060> couple<00:03:11.239> of<00:03:11.390> key

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
last year we lost a couple of key

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.000 
last year we lost a couple of key
players<00:03:11.750> like<00:03:11.959> one<00:03:12.140> case<00:03:12.349> where<00:03:12.379> I<00:03:12.560> about<00:03:12.829> the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.649 
players like one case where I about the
midfield<00:03:13.400> but<00:03:13.640> we're<00:03:14.120> definitely<00:03:14.269> a<00:03:14.480> few

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.659 
midfield but we're definitely a few

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:15.819 
midfield but we're definitely a few
players<00:03:14.870> that<00:03:15.109> are<00:03:15.170> going<00:03:15.260> to<00:03:15.349> step<00:03:15.500> up<00:03:15.680> and

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
players that are going to step up and

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.890

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.660 
fill those roles and this year I feel
confident<00:03:18.379> that<00:03:18.620> we're<00:03:19.219> going<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.370> be<00:03:19.459> able<00:03:19.519> to
