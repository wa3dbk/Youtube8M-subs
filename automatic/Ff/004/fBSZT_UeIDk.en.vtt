00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
supposedly 1 plus week and I was working

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.279 
supposedly 1 plus week and I was working
four<00:00:26.070> hundred<00:00:26.369> twenty<00:00:26.460> kilos<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.720> managed<00:00:28.260> to

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
four hundred twenty kilos I managed to

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.589 
four hundred twenty kilos I managed to
get<00:00:28.470> six<00:00:28.859> reps<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.460> after<00:00:30.179> they<00:00:30.300> said<00:00:30.510> they

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
get six reps and after they said they

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.420 
get six reps and after they said they
said<00:00:30.630> let's<00:00:30.840> do<00:00:31.019> some<00:00:31.199> Joker<00:00:31.590> sets<00:00:31.830> but<00:00:32.219> what<00:00:32.399> I

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
said let's do some Joker sets but what I

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.420 
said let's do some Joker sets but what I
was<00:00:32.610> using<00:00:32.790> with<00:00:33.059> my<00:00:33.210> high<00:00:33.480> box<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.430> basically

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
was using with my high box and basically

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.830 
was using with my high box and basically
the<00:00:35.610> reason<00:00:35.820> for<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.149> obviously<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.630> high

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
the reason for this is obviously a high

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.350 
the reason for this is obviously a high
box<00:00:37.170> it's<00:00:37.770> less<00:00:38.040> range<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.399> motion<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.000> it's

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
box it's less range of motion so it's

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.290 
box it's less range of motion so it's
the<00:00:39.570> technically<00:00:39.989> easier<00:00:40.460> I'm<00:00:41.460> doing<00:00:42.120> this

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
the technically easier I'm doing this

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.180 
the technically easier I'm doing this
mainly<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.930> get<00:00:43.079> myself<00:00:43.230> used<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.739> holding

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
mainly to get myself used to holding

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.799 
mainly to get myself used to holding
heavier<00:00:44.489> weights<00:00:44.730> because<00:00:45.090> part<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
heavier weights because part of the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.850 
heavier weights because part of the
battle<00:00:46.020> with<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> squat<00:00:46.860> for<00:00:47.399> my<00:00:47.430> situation<00:00:48.300> is

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
battle with a squat for my situation is

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.110 
battle with a squat for my situation is
not<00:00:49.860> being<00:00:50.070> used<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.460> holding<00:00:50.820> watch

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
not being used to holding watch

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.610 
not being used to holding watch
everywhere<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.660> your<00:00:51.690> back<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:51.989> then<00:00:52.320> put<00:00:52.530> it

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
everywhere on your back and then put it

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.990 
everywhere on your back and then put it
this<00:00:52.680> way<00:00:52.860> if<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.100> can't<00:00:53.370> hold<00:00:53.550> heavy<00:00:53.730> where

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
this way if you can't hold heavy where

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.029 
this way if you can't hold heavy where
you<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.690> be<00:00:54.809> able<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.020> Squire<00:00:55.230> no<00:00:55.590> matter<00:00:55.829> what

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
you can be able to Squire no matter what

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.279 
you can be able to Squire no matter what
does<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.090> matter<00:00:57.210> how<00:00:57.360> powerful<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.899> exact

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
does it matter how powerful the exact

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.020 
does it matter how powerful the exact
you<00:00:58.530> can't<00:00:58.770> keep<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.070> upright<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.730> ain't

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
you can't keep it upright you ain't

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:17.460 
you can't keep it upright you ain't
going<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.300> doing

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.650
