00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
a trick that I learned that I really

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.439 
a trick that I learned that I really
never<00:00:50.160> noticed<00:00:50.610> until<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.910> actually<00:00:51.030> got<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
never noticed until I actually got the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.889 
never noticed until I actually got the
alley<00:00:51.600> down<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.140> when<00:00:52.710> you're<00:00:52.829> ollieing<00:00:53.899> keep

alley down is when you're ollieing keep

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.750 
alley down is when you're ollieing keep
your<00:00:55.110> foot<00:00:55.289> parallel<00:00:55.710> with<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.070> ground<00:00:56.160> so

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
your foot parallel with the ground so

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.049 
your foot parallel with the ground so
that's<00:00:56.940> easier<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.480> grind<00:00:57.989> up<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.910> tell

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
that's easier to grind up and you tell

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.270 
that's easier to grind up and you tell
you<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.239> truth<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.410> be

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
you the truth this is going to be

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.179

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.570 
completely torn up on the side lacing
all<00:01:09.390> ripped<00:01:09.659> out<00:01:09.810> everything<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:11.070> also<00:01:11.340> it's

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
all ripped out everything and also it's

all ripped out everything and also it's
going<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.820> do<00:01:11.909> 50s<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.869> bottom<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.260> your

do you're going to do a rolling ollie

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.099 
do you're going to do a rolling ollie
actually<00:02:34.370> let<00:02:34.909> me<00:02:34.939> get<00:02:35.150> into<00:02:35.390> how<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.599> practice

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:36.109 
actually let me get into how to practice

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:39.069 
actually let me get into how to practice
the<00:02:36.230> ollie<00:02:36.379> first<00:02:36.790> if<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:38.299> have<00:02:38.480> really<00:02:38.780> steep

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
the ollie first if you have really steep

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.780 
the ollie first if you have really steep
slopes<00:02:39.379> near<00:02:39.799> your<00:02:40.010> neighborhoods<00:02:40.430> like<00:02:40.549> on

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
slopes near your neighborhoods like on

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.190 
slopes near your neighborhoods like on
pavement<00:02:41.450> it's<00:02:41.569> really<00:02:41.780> hard<00:02:41.959> to<00:02:42.049> do<00:02:42.170> a

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
pavement it's really hard to do a

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.860 
pavement it's really hard to do a
standstill<00:02:42.950> ollie<00:02:43.220> so<00:02:44.030> what<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.269> do<00:02:44.480> is<00:02:44.510> find

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
standstill ollie so what you do is find

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.240 
standstill ollie so what you do is find
a<00:02:44.989> really<00:02:45.290> of<00:02:45.709> any<00:02:46.400> kind<00:02:46.730> of<00:02:46.849> grass<00:02:48.099> you<00:02:49.099> can

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
a really of any kind of grass you can

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.929 
a really of any kind of grass you can
practice<00:02:49.609> on<00:02:50.019> just<00:02:51.019> practice<00:02:51.319> your<00:02:51.470> ollie<00:02:51.939> and

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:52.939 
practice on just practice your ollie and

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.640 
practice on just practice your ollie and
when<00:02:53.329> you<00:02:53.420> get<00:02:53.540> ready<00:02:53.720> or<00:02:54.019> you<00:02:54.109> find<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.379> flat

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
when you get ready or you find a flat

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.170 
when you get ready or you find a flat
piece<00:02:54.829> of<00:02:54.889> grass<00:02:55.189> or<00:02:56.090> I<00:02:56.120> mean<00:02:56.450> put<00:02:56.629> pavement

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
piece of grass or I mean put pavement

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.520 
piece of grass or I mean put pavement
I'm<00:02:59.180> actually<00:02:59.450> really<00:02:59.689> ollie<00:02:59.959> but<00:03:00.230> my

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
I'm actually really ollie but my

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.009 
I'm actually really ollie but my
backyard<00:03:00.920> is<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.040> minute<00:03:01.280> laptop<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:02.359> then

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
backyard is a minute laptop and then

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.690 
backyard is a minute laptop and then
there's<00:03:03.470> another<00:03:03.680> type<00:03:03.889> of<00:03:03.919> so<00:03:04.340> as<00:03:04.519> we're

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
there's another type of so as we're

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.429 
there's another type of so as we're
moving<00:03:04.819> on<00:03:05.120> this<00:03:05.720> is<00:03:05.840> what<00:03:05.989> you<00:03:06.079> need<00:03:06.230> to<00:03:06.290> do<00:03:06.409> to

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:06.439 
moving on this is what you need to do to

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:20.360 
moving on this is what you need to do to
get<00:03:06.680> most<00:03:06.950> trick<00:03:07.280> I<00:03:09.909> really<00:03:10.909> screwed<00:03:11.060> that<00:03:11.209> up

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.580 

and<00:03:21.370> that<00:03:22.329> tell<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:22.629> a<00:03:22.659> blog<00:03:22.900> practice<00:03:23.319> it<00:03:23.469> is

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
and that tell you a blog practice it is

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.259 
and that tell you a blog practice it is
going<00:03:23.859> into<00:03:24.159> brass<00:03:26.849> you're<00:03:27.849> going<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.120> ollie

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
going into brass you're going to ollie

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.800 
going into brass you're going to ollie
into<00:03:28.599> the<00:03:28.810> grass<00:03:29.049> and<00:03:30.180> it<00:03:31.180> would<00:03:31.329> be<00:03:31.359> easier

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
into the grass and it would be easier

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:44.489 
into the grass and it would be easier
because<00:03:32.430> that's<00:03:33.430> how<00:03:33.549> you<00:03:33.640> would<00:03:33.730> practice

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:44.499 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:53.819 

but<00:03:45.730> watch<00:03:51.489> how<00:03:52.489> this<00:03:52.670> ollie<00:03:52.909> is<00:03:53.120> different<00:03:53.540> is

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
but watch how this ollie is different is

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.149 
but watch how this ollie is different is
actually<00:03:54.939> while<00:03:55.939> you're<00:03:56.120> moving<00:03:56.269> I<00:03:57.159> don't

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
actually while you're moving I don't

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:59.229 
actually while you're moving I don't
want<00:03:58.310> to<00:03:58.370> take<00:03:58.459> my<00:03:58.549> shoes<00:03:58.730> off<00:03:58.849> because<00:03:59.120> it's

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
want to take my shoes off because it's

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.530 
want to take my shoes off because it's
easier<00:03:59.450> demonstrate<00:04:01.180> while<00:04:02.180> you're<00:04:02.389> moving

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
easier demonstrate while you're moving

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.539 
easier demonstrate while you're moving
you're<00:04:03.500> going<00:04:03.680> to<00:04:03.799> want<00:04:03.920> to<00:04:04.040> be<00:04:04.069> leaning

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
you're going to want to be leaning

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:05.740 
you're going to want to be leaning
forward<00:04:04.909> a<00:04:05.000> little<00:04:05.150> bit<00:04:05.299> so<00:04:05.540> that<00:04:05.569> the

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
forward a little bit so that the

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.270 
forward a little bit so that the
momentum<00:04:06.230> will<00:04:06.439> take<00:04:06.620> you<00:04:06.739> with<00:04:06.919> the<00:04:07.069> board

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
momentum will take you with the board

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.110 
momentum will take you with the board
and<00:04:07.780> watch<00:04:09.400> you'll<00:04:10.400> have<00:04:10.579> to<00:04:10.730> be<00:04:10.819> leaning

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
and watch you'll have to be leaning

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.550 
and watch you'll have to be leaning
forward<00:04:11.359> for<00:04:11.510> when<00:04:11.629> you<00:04:11.719> win<00:04:11.930> while<00:04:12.379> you're

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
forward for when you win while you're

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.020 
forward for when you win while you're
practicing<00:04:12.709> it<00:04:13.069> like<00:04:13.189> this<00:04:13.400> just<00:04:13.790> getting

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
practicing it like this just getting

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.870 
practicing it like this just getting
used<00:04:14.150> to<00:04:14.239> the<00:04:14.299> movie<00:04:14.919> you<00:04:15.919> can<00:04:16.070> you<00:04:16.489> can<00:04:16.669> lean

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
used to the movie you can you can lean

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.189 
used to the movie you can you can lean
however<00:04:17.180> you<00:04:17.299> want<00:04:17.509> like<00:04:17.720> you<00:04:17.840> want<00:04:18.019> to<00:04:18.079> get

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
however you want like you want to get

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.979 
however you want like you want to get
used<00:04:18.380> to<00:04:18.530> leaning<00:04:18.949> back<00:04:19.130> forward<00:04:19.780> so<00:04:20.780> when<00:04:20.930> you

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
used to leaning back forward so when you

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.760 
used to leaning back forward so when you
actually<00:04:21.169> land<00:04:21.560> it<00:04:21.739> pavement<00:04:22.580> you<00:04:22.820> go<00:04:26.620> this<00:04:27.620> is

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
actually land it pavement you go this is

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.339 
actually land it pavement you go this is
what<00:04:27.919> will<00:04:28.070> happen<00:04:28.370> if<00:04:28.460> you<00:04:28.550> don't<00:04:29.349> lean

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
what will happen if you don't lean

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:32.170 
what will happen if you don't lean
forward<00:04:30.520> board<00:04:31.520> will<00:04:31.639> climb<00:04:31.820> underneath

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
forward board will climb underneath

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:39.310 
forward board will climb underneath
you're<00:04:32.840> screwed<00:04:33.820> so<00:04:34.820> what<00:04:34.970> happened

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.379 

planned<00:04:40.320> it<00:04:40.440> perfectly<00:04:41.000> see<00:04:44.180> another<00:04:45.180> thing

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
planned it perfectly see another thing

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.540 
planned it perfectly see another thing
you<00:04:45.480> want<00:04:45.630> to<00:04:45.660> do<00:04:45.750> with<00:04:45.870> moving<00:04:46.169> ollie<00:04:46.550> get

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
you want to do with moving ollie get

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.500 
you want to do with moving ollie get
comfortable<00:04:47.790> with<00:04:48.000> your<00:04:48.090> board

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
comfortable with your board

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.050 
comfortable with your board
seriously<00:04:48.780> I<00:04:49.260> think<00:04:50.040> people<00:04:50.160> go<00:04:50.430> straight

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
seriously I think people go straight

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.230 
seriously I think people go straight
from<00:04:51.240> riding<00:04:51.750> down<00:04:51.990> a<00:04:52.020> hill<00:04:52.350> for<00:04:52.560> one<00:04:52.770> second

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
from riding down a hill for one second

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.219 
from riding down a hill for one second
turn<00:04:54.240> out<00:04:54.510> move<00:04:55.260> it<00:04:56.570> you<00:04:57.570> know<00:04:57.660> what<00:04:57.780> I<00:04:57.840> end<00:04:58.139> up

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
turn out move it you know what I end up

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.629 
turn out move it you know what I end up
doing<00:04:59.570> back<00:05:01.040> you<00:05:02.040> know<00:05:02.100> what<00:05:02.190> I<00:05:02.250> wanted<00:05:02.460> you<00:05:02.610> to

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
doing back you know what I wanted you to

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:11.719 
doing back you know what I wanted you to
them<00:05:02.990> back<00:05:08.120> so<00:05:09.120> it'll<00:05:09.449> be<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:11.250> easier<00:05:11.610> to

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
them back so it'll be the easier to

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.200 
them back so it'll be the easier to
practice<00:05:12.090> and<00:05:12.180> grass<00:05:12.360> and<00:05:12.389> also<00:05:14.000> your<00:05:15.000> legs

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
practice and grass and also your legs

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.080 
practice and grass and also your legs
will<00:05:15.330> get<00:05:15.479> really<00:05:15.690> cut<00:05:15.870> up

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.820 

oh<00:05:21.150> crap<00:05:23.330> and<00:05:24.330> then<00:05:24.810> there's<00:05:25.410> pretty<00:05:25.590> much<00:05:25.620> the

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
oh crap and then there's pretty much the

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.540 
oh crap and then there's pretty much the
ollie<00:05:26.300> figured<00:05:27.300> it<00:05:27.419> out
