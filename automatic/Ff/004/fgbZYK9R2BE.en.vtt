what<00:00:10.540> is<00:00:10.660> up<00:00:10.780> everybody<00:00:11.020> today<00:00:11.440> we<00:00:11.830> are<00:00:12.010> back

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.340 
what is up everybody today we are back

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.400 
what is up everybody today we are back
on<00:00:12.550> minecraft<00:00:13.090> for<00:00:13.270> the<00:00:13.300> PC<00:00:13.719> and<00:00:13.930> we<00:00:14.050> are<00:00:14.170> here

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.410 
on minecraft for the PC and we are here

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.560 
on minecraft for the PC and we are here
today<00:00:14.590> so<00:00:14.740> I<00:00:14.920> can<00:00:15.100> showcase<00:00:15.460> to<00:00:15.850> you<00:00:15.969> an<00:00:16.090> item<00:00:16.420> I

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
today so I can showcase to you an item I

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.750 
today so I can showcase to you an item I
think<00:00:16.930> we<00:00:17.020> will<00:00:17.140> be<00:00:17.290> seeing<00:00:17.560> into<00:00:17.950> you<00:00:18.070> 14<00:00:18.550> and

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 
think we will be seeing into you 14 and

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.570 
think we will be seeing into you 14 and
that<00:00:19.360> is<00:00:19.510> the<00:00:19.689> redstone<00:00:20.200> comparator<00:00:20.439> now<00:00:21.400> i'd

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
that is the redstone comparator now i'd

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.950 
that is the redstone comparator now i'd
like<00:00:21.610> to<00:00:21.910> go<00:00:22.029> ahead<00:00:22.060> and<00:00:22.450> stress<00:00:22.720> that<00:00:22.900> this

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
like to go ahead and stress that this

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.050 
like to go ahead and stress that this
item<00:00:23.320> has<00:00:23.619> not<00:00:23.920> been<00:00:24.099> confirmed<00:00:24.250> i<00:00:24.700> don't<00:00:24.939> want

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
item has not been confirmed i don't want

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.179 
item has not been confirmed i don't want
to<00:00:25.119> lead<00:00:25.239> anybody<00:00:25.450> down<00:00:25.750> that<00:00:25.930> path<00:00:26.200> however<00:00:27.099> i

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
to lead anybody down that path however i

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.159 
to lead anybody down that path however i
would<00:00:27.669> guess<00:00:27.970> that<00:00:28.000> we<00:00:28.360> will<00:00:28.540> be<00:00:28.689> seeing<00:00:28.960> it<00:00:29.079> in

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:29.169 
would guess that we will be seeing it in

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.109 
would guess that we will be seeing it in
the<00:00:29.230> next<00:00:29.470> coming<00:00:29.619> update<00:00:30.099> now<00:00:30.730> let<00:00:30.939> me<00:00:30.970> go

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
the next coming update now let me go

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.760 
the next coming update now let me go
ahead<00:00:31.270> and<00:00:31.360> explain<00:00:31.720> why<00:00:31.930> that<00:00:32.169> is<00:00:32.410> and<00:00:32.439> i

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
ahead and explain why that is and i

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.900 
ahead and explain why that is and i
think<00:00:33.010> we<00:00:33.070> are<00:00:33.100> going<00:00:33.340> to<00:00:33.460> be<00:00:33.550> seeing<00:00:33.820> it

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
think we are going to be seeing it

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.760 
think we are going to be seeing it
because<00:00:34.210> the<00:00:34.329> only<00:00:34.510> item<00:00:34.989> we<00:00:35.110> currently<00:00:35.470> need

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
because the only item we currently need

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.490 
because the only item we currently need
to<00:00:36.340> craft<00:00:36.640> this<00:00:36.940> redstone<00:00:37.329> comparator<00:00:37.600> is<00:00:38.110> the

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
to craft this redstone comparator is the

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.930 
to craft this redstone comparator is the
nether<00:00:38.739> quartz<00:00:39.040> which<00:00:39.309> is<00:00:39.430> this<00:00:39.550> item<00:00:39.850> right

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
nether quartz which is this item right

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.120 
nether quartz which is this item right
here<00:00:40.000> in<00:00:40.210> the<00:00:40.270> middle<00:00:40.329> so<00:00:41.079> we<00:00:41.110> do<00:00:41.530> know<00:00:41.740> for<00:00:42.070> a

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
here in the middle so we do know for a

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.500 
here in the middle so we do know for a
fact<00:00:42.430> that<00:00:42.580> we<00:00:42.760> will<00:00:42.940> be<00:00:43.060> seeing<00:00:43.270> nether

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
fact that we will be seeing nether

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.440 
fact that we will be seeing nether
quartz<00:00:43.810> in<00:00:44.080> tu14<00:00:44.710> and<00:00:45.160> since<00:00:45.760> we<00:00:45.880> know<00:00:45.910> that<00:00:46.090> it

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
quartz in tu14 and since we know that it

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.700 
quartz in tu14 and since we know that it
only<00:00:46.630> would<00:00:46.840> make<00:00:46.990> sense<00:00:47.170> at<00:00:47.350> least<00:00:47.380> in<00:00:47.590> my

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
only would make sense at least in my

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.680 
only would make sense at least in my
mind<00:00:47.740> that<00:00:48.220> we<00:00:48.610> would<00:00:48.730> also<00:00:48.910> unlock<00:00:49.450> all<00:00:49.630> of

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
mind that we would also unlock all of

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.060 
mind that we would also unlock all of
the<00:00:49.840> things<00:00:50.050> that<00:00:50.230> you<00:00:50.290> can<00:00:50.440> craft<00:00:50.680> with<00:00:50.920> it

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
the things that you can craft with it

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.560 
the things that you can craft with it
and<00:00:51.220> thus<00:00:51.670> we<00:00:51.820> would<00:00:51.970> be<00:00:52.060> getting<00:00:52.360> the

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
and thus we would be getting the

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.440 
and thus we would be getting the
redstone<00:00:53.080> comparator<00:00:53.700> so<00:00:54.700> now<00:00:55.090> let's<00:00:55.330> go

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
redstone comparator so now let's go

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.000 
redstone comparator so now let's go
ahead<00:00:55.750> and<00:00:55.900> talk<00:00:56.050> about<00:00:56.230> what<00:00:56.470> exactly<00:00:56.920> the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
ahead and talk about what exactly the

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.100 
ahead and talk about what exactly the
redstone<00:00:57.400> comparator<00:00:57.520> does<00:00:58.060> and<00:00:58.390> you<00:00:58.810> then<00:00:58.990> we

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
redstone comparator does and you then we

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.450 
redstone comparator does and you then we
can<00:00:59.260> talk<00:00:59.410> a<00:00:59.440> little<00:00:59.680> bit<00:00:59.860> about<00:01:00.040> some<00:01:00.280> of<00:01:00.340> the

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
can talk a little bit about some of the

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.970 
can talk a little bit about some of the
uses<00:01:00.640> maybe<00:01:01.030> you<00:01:01.180> can<00:01:01.329> do<00:01:01.450> with<00:01:01.600> it<00:01:01.770> now<00:01:02.770> before

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
uses maybe you can do with it now before

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.710 
uses maybe you can do with it now before
I<00:01:03.160> actually<00:01:03.370> explain<00:01:03.910> what<00:01:04.150> it<00:01:04.239> does<00:01:04.420> let<00:01:04.629> me

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
I actually explain what it does let me

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.230 
I actually explain what it does let me
go<00:01:04.839> ahead<00:01:04.960> and<00:01:05.140> say<00:01:05.470> that<00:01:06.009> I<00:01:06.040> am<00:01:06.159> by<00:01:06.460> no<00:01:06.520> means<00:01:06.759> a

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
go ahead and say that I am by no means a

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.670 
go ahead and say that I am by no means a
redstone<00:01:07.570> expert<00:01:08.079> and<00:01:08.229> what<00:01:08.350> I'm<00:01:08.439> about<00:01:08.560> to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
redstone expert and what I'm about to

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.370 
redstone expert and what I'm about to
tell<00:01:08.829> you<00:01:08.979> is<00:01:09.159> the<00:01:09.490> very<00:01:10.000> mere<00:01:10.479> basics<00:01:11.020> of<00:01:11.170> what

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
tell you is the very mere basics of what

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.559 
tell you is the very mere basics of what
a<00:01:11.439> redstone<00:01:11.740> comparator<00:01:11.950> does<00:01:12.460> this<00:01:13.149> thing<00:01:13.420> is

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:13.569 
a redstone comparator does this thing is

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:15.539 
a redstone comparator does this thing is
highly<00:01:14.020> complicated<00:01:14.409> and<00:01:14.829> as<00:01:14.979> are<00:01:15.219> a<00:01:15.249> lot<00:01:15.520> of

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
highly complicated and as are a lot of

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.399 
highly complicated and as are a lot of
things<00:01:15.789> you<00:01:15.999> can<00:01:16.119> use<00:01:16.179> with<00:01:16.539> it<00:01:16.719> so<00:01:17.109> you<00:01:17.170> have

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
things you can use with it so you have

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:18.989 
things you can use with it so you have
to<00:01:17.530> be<00:01:17.560> like<00:01:17.829> an<00:01:17.950> electrical<00:01:18.399> engineer<00:01:18.549> to

00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:18.999 
to be like an electrical engineer to

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:20.669 
to be like an electrical engineer to
know<00:01:19.090> exactly<00:01:19.719> all<00:01:19.749> the<00:01:20.079> uses<00:01:20.259> and<00:01:20.439> how<00:01:20.619> you

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
know exactly all the uses and how you

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:22.109 
know exactly all the uses and how you
could<00:01:20.920> use<00:01:21.039> is<00:01:21.189> in<00:01:21.310> every<00:01:21.549> way<00:01:21.670> shape<00:01:21.700> and<00:01:21.969> form

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
could use is in every way shape and form

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.450 
could use is in every way shape and form
and<00:01:22.509> FYI<00:01:23.259> i'm<00:01:23.649> not<00:01:23.829> an<00:01:23.950> electrical<00:01:24.369> engineer

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
and FYI i'm not an electrical engineer

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.450 
and FYI i'm not an electrical engineer
so<00:01:25.090> with<00:01:25.719> that<00:01:25.869> said<00:01:26.139> let's<00:01:26.649> go<00:01:26.829> ahead<00:01:26.979> and<00:01:27.189> get

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
so with that said let's go ahead and get

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.489 
so with that said let's go ahead and get
on<00:01:27.639> into<00:01:28.149> what<00:01:28.389> exactly<00:01:28.960> a<00:01:28.990> redstone

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:29.499 
on into what exactly a redstone

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:31.859 
on into what exactly a redstone
comparator<00:01:29.710> does<00:01:30.219> so<00:01:30.999> to<00:01:31.060> start<00:01:31.479> let's<00:01:31.749> go

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
comparator does so to start let's go

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.480 
comparator does so to start let's go
ahead<00:01:32.020> and<00:01:32.229> note<00:01:32.499> that<00:01:32.679> there<00:01:32.829> are<00:01:32.859> two<00:01:33.249> modes

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
ahead and note that there are two modes

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.709 
ahead and note that there are two modes
that<00:01:33.700> you<00:01:33.789> can<00:01:33.999> use<00:01:34.119> at<00:01:34.270> redstone<00:01:34.600> comparator

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:34.719 
that you can use at redstone comparator

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.139 
that you can use at redstone comparator
in<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.770> first<00:01:36.069> of<00:01:36.280> which<00:01:36.429> is<00:01:36.490> subtraction

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
in the first of which is subtraction

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:38.910 
in the first of which is subtraction
mode<00:01:37.479> which<00:01:37.689> is<00:01:37.840> denoted<00:01:37.990> by<00:01:38.319> this<00:01:38.469> little

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
mode which is denoted by this little

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.319 
mode which is denoted by this little
front<00:01:39.159> light<00:01:39.310> being<00:01:39.549> on<00:01:39.670> here<00:01:39.939> you<00:01:40.060> can<00:01:40.179> see

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
front light being on here you can see

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:41.999 
front light being on here you can see
the<00:01:40.359> front<00:01:40.659> redstone<00:01:41.049> torch<00:01:41.319> is<00:01:41.469> on<00:01:41.709> and

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
the front redstone torch is on and

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.249 
the front redstone torch is on and
there's<00:01:42.579> also<00:01:42.850> comparison<00:01:43.509> mode<00:01:43.810> which<00:01:44.049> by

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
there's also comparison mode which by

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:45.510 
there's also comparison mode which by
right<00:01:44.499> clicking<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:45.009> redstone<00:01:45.399> comparator

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
right clicking the redstone comparator

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.819 
right clicking the redstone comparator
there<00:01:45.999> I<00:01:46.030> can<00:01:46.299> turn<00:01:46.420> it<00:01:46.569> off<00:01:46.689> and<00:01:46.990> now<00:01:47.590> we<00:01:47.649> are

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
there I can turn it off and now we are

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.289 
there I can turn it off and now we are
in<00:01:48.009> comparison<00:01:48.549> mode<00:01:48.670> which<00:01:48.850> is<00:01:48.999> obviously

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
in comparison mode which is obviously

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.599 
in comparison mode which is obviously
denoted<00:01:49.689> by<00:01:49.719> the<00:01:49.869> light<00:01:50.139> being<00:01:50.409> off<00:01:50.619> so<00:01:51.429> let's

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:51.609 
denoted by the light being off so let's

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:53.429 
denoted by the light being off so let's
go<00:01:51.759> ahead<00:01:51.789> and<00:01:52.060> start<00:01:52.450> off<00:01:52.539> in<00:01:52.779> subtraction

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
go ahead and start off in subtraction

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.109 
go ahead and start off in subtraction
mode<00:01:53.829> and<00:01:54.069> before<00:01:54.340> we<00:01:54.369> go<00:01:54.459> ahead<00:01:54.579> and<00:01:54.789> get<00:01:54.999> into

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
mode and before we go ahead and get into

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.429 
mode and before we go ahead and get into
this<00:01:55.270> let<00:01:55.479> me<00:01:55.539> just<00:01:55.719> go<00:01:55.810> ahead<00:01:55.929> and<00:01:56.139> give<00:01:56.350> you

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
this let me just go ahead and give you

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.050 
this let me just go ahead and give you
guys<00:01:56.499> some<00:01:56.829> very<00:01:57.039> very<00:01:57.279> simple<00:01:57.579> redstone

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
guys some very very simple redstone

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.999 
guys some very very simple redstone
basics<00:01:58.479> that<00:01:58.630> I'm<00:01:59.079> sure<00:01:59.289> all<00:01:59.439> of<00:01:59.469> you<00:01:59.679> already

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
basics that I'm sure all of you already

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.139 
basics that I'm sure all of you already
know<00:02:00.130> but<00:02:00.459> I'm<00:02:00.579> going<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:00.759> tell<00:02:00.909> you<00:02:00.939> really

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
know but I'm going to tell you really

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.209 
know but I'm going to tell you really
quick<00:02:01.389> anyway<00:02:01.719> so<00:02:02.350> essentially<00:02:02.889> how<00:02:03.009> red

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
quick anyway so essentially how red

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.370 
quick anyway so essentially how red
stone<00:02:03.429> works<00:02:03.700> is<00:02:03.909> that<00:02:03.939> over<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:04.509> distance<00:02:04.959> it

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
stone works is that over a distance it

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.499 
stone works is that over a distance it
will<00:02:05.649> lose<00:02:05.859> its<00:02:05.889> amount<00:02:06.369> of<00:02:06.549> signal<00:02:06.969> so<00:02:07.450> you

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
will lose its amount of signal so you

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.150 
will lose its amount of signal so you
can<00:02:07.689> see<00:02:07.899> right<00:02:07.929> here<00:02:08.410> this<00:02:08.590> redstone<00:02:09.009> is

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
can see right here this redstone is

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160 
can see right here this redstone is
obviously<00:02:09.729> substantially<00:02:10.360> less<00:02:10.569> bright<00:02:10.899> red

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
obviously substantially less bright red

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.020 
obviously substantially less bright red
than<00:02:11.709> it<00:02:11.830> is<00:02:11.980> right<00:02:12.010> here<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:12.640> that's<00:02:12.910> just

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
than it is right here and that's just

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.760 
than it is right here and that's just
because<00:02:13.209> over<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.750> distance<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.349> redstone

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
because over a distance a redstone

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.340 
because over a distance a redstone
current<00:02:15.280> loses<00:02:15.670> its<00:02:15.819> power<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:16.360> thus<00:02:17.110> will

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
current loses its power and thus will

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.060 
current loses its power and thus will
have<00:02:17.650> less<00:02:18.100> um<00:02:18.400> if<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:19.060> will<00:02:19.240> mmm<00:02:19.900> no<00:02:20.890> we're

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
have less um if you will mmm no we're

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.530 
have less um if you will mmm no we're
not<00:02:21.130> having<00:02:21.460> never<00:02:21.670> mind

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
not having never mind

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.869 
not having never mind
it<00:02:22.750> has<00:02:23.019> less<00:02:23.200> impaired<00:02:23.680> at<00:02:23.769> the<00:02:23.890> end<00:02:24.040> then<00:02:24.430> say

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
it has less impaired at the end then say

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.729 
it has less impaired at the end then say
this<00:02:24.909> one<00:02:25.239> would<00:02:25.390> hear<00:02:25.629> closer<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.379> the<00:02:26.500> torch

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
this one would hear closer to the torch

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.020 
this one would hear closer to the torch
I'm<00:02:26.980> sure<00:02:27.129> you<00:02:27.219> already<00:02:27.340> know<00:02:27.549> how<00:02:27.670> that<00:02:27.819> works

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
I'm sure you already know how that works

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.670 
I'm sure you already know how that works
but<00:02:28.599> that's<00:02:28.959> just<00:02:29.049> an<00:02:29.200> important<00:02:29.530> thing<00:02:29.560> to

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
but that's just an important thing to

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.399 
but that's just an important thing to
note<00:02:29.920> because<00:02:30.159> in<00:02:30.849> subtraction<00:02:31.780> mode<00:02:32.170> what

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
note because in subtraction mode what

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.500 
note because in subtraction mode what
essentially<00:02:32.859> happens<00:02:32.890> is<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:34.000> signal<00:02:34.390> that

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
essentially happens is the signal that

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.690 
essentially happens is the signal that
comes<00:02:34.689> in<00:02:34.930> from<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.200> side<00:02:35.469> or<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:36.010> non<00:02:36.250> back

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
comes in from the side or the non back

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.869 
comes in from the side or the non back
part<00:02:37.060> of<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.329> redstone<00:02:37.870> comparator<00:02:38.019> is

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
part of the redstone comparator is

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.009 
part of the redstone comparator is
subtracted<00:02:39.879> from<00:02:39.909> the<00:02:40.150> signal<00:02:40.599> in<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.810> back

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
subtracted from the signal in the back

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.410 
subtracted from the signal in the back
so<00:02:41.769> this<00:02:42.040> signal<00:02:42.340> back<00:02:42.489> here<00:02:42.760> is<00:02:42.909> obviously

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
so this signal back here is obviously

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.599 
so this signal back here is obviously
substantially<00:02:44.109> stronger<00:02:44.409> than<00:02:44.920> this<00:02:45.220> signal

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:45.609 
substantially stronger than this signal

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:47.729 
substantially stronger than this signal
and<00:02:45.819> if<00:02:46.299> we<00:02:46.420> go<00:02:46.569> ahead<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:46.900> we<00:02:47.049> assume<00:02:47.439> for

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
and if we go ahead and we assume for

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.619 
and if we go ahead and we assume for
instance<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.129> this<00:02:48.280> thing<00:02:48.459> has<00:02:48.609> a<00:02:48.639> signal

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
instance that this thing has a signal

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.959 
instance that this thing has a signal
strength<00:02:49.989> of<00:02:50.170> 10<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.709> this<00:02:51.220> one<00:02:51.400> has<00:02:51.549> a<00:02:51.579> signal

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:51.969 
strength of 10 and this one has a signal

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.149 
strength of 10 and this one has a signal
strength<00:02:52.209> of<00:02:52.389> one<00:02:52.689> in<00:02:52.959> subtraction<00:02:53.769> mode

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
strength of one in subtraction mode

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.649 
strength of one in subtraction mode
essentially<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:54.909> will<00:02:55.030> take<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.329> signal

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:55.659 
essentially it will take the signal

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.809 
essentially it will take the signal
strength<00:02:55.780> of<00:02:55.989> 10<00:02:56.139> here<00:02:56.500> subtract<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:57.519> from<00:02:57.549> the

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
strength of 10 here subtract it from the

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.000 
strength of 10 here subtract it from the
one<00:02:58.000> over<00:02:58.209> here<00:02:58.659> and<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:59.260> will<00:02:59.439> be<00:02:59.530> an<00:02:59.620> output

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
one over here and this will be an output

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.009 
one over here and this will be an output
of<00:03:00.069> 9<00:03:00.459> which<00:03:00.879> is<00:03:00.909> enough<00:03:01.329> to<00:03:01.359> light<00:03:01.750> up<00:03:01.900> this

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
of 9 which is enough to light up this

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.110 
of 9 which is enough to light up this
redstone<00:03:02.379> lamp<00:03:02.739> now<00:03:03.430> in<00:03:03.609> order<00:03:03.760> to<00:03:03.879> best

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
redstone lamp now in order to best

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.520 
redstone lamp now in order to best
demonstrate<00:03:04.629> this<00:03:04.750> what<00:03:04.930> I'm<00:03:05.019> going<00:03:05.169> to<00:03:05.200> do<00:03:05.379> is

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
demonstrate this what I'm going to do is

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.869 
demonstrate this what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:03:05.650> just<00:03:05.739> going<00:03:05.859> to<00:03:06.010> slowly<00:03:06.340> make<00:03:06.700> this

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
I'm just going to slowly make this

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.119 
I'm just going to slowly make this
signal<00:03:07.299> stronger<00:03:07.840> so<00:03:08.349> it<00:03:08.500> will<00:03:08.620> thus<00:03:08.829> make

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
signal stronger so it will thus make

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:10.979 
signal stronger so it will thus make
this<00:03:09.310> signal<00:03:09.790> weaker<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.329> the<00:03:10.569> output

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
this signal weaker and the output

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.390 
this signal weaker and the output
because<00:03:11.260> it<00:03:11.349> will<00:03:11.439> be<00:03:11.530> subtracting<00:03:12.069> more<00:03:12.250> from

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
because it will be subtracting more from

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.309 
because it will be subtracting more from
this<00:03:12.549> side<00:03:12.760> now<00:03:13.450> I<00:03:13.480> realize<00:03:13.930> this<00:03:14.079> might<00:03:14.200> be

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
this side now I realize this might be

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.509 
this side now I realize this might be
kind<00:03:14.560> of<00:03:14.620> confusing<00:03:14.709> but<00:03:15.159> I<00:03:15.220> hope<00:03:15.400> the

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
kind of confusing but I hope the

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.280 
kind of confusing but I hope the
demonstration<00:03:16.030> will<00:03:16.150> help<00:03:16.359> so<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:16.870> can<00:03:17.109> see

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
demonstration will help so you can see

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.750 
demonstration will help so you can see
here<00:03:17.500> it's<00:03:17.620> obviously<00:03:17.980> still<00:03:18.250> on<00:03:18.459> because

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
here it's obviously still on because

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.159 
here it's obviously still on because
it's<00:03:18.790> not<00:03:19.060> being<00:03:19.239> subtracted<00:03:19.419> by<00:03:19.720> anything

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
it's not being subtracted by anything

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:21.839 
it's not being subtracted by anything
now<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.560> if<00:03:20.919> I<00:03:21.010> go<00:03:21.159> ahead<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.549> move<00:03:21.730> this

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
now and if I go ahead and I move this

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.819 
now and if I go ahead and I move this
redstone<00:03:22.120> torch<00:03:22.419> closer<00:03:22.720> we<00:03:23.409> can<00:03:23.560> see<00:03:23.620> that

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
redstone torch closer we can see that

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.129 
redstone torch closer we can see that
the<00:03:23.889> signal<00:03:24.280> is<00:03:24.400> stronger<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:25.060> thus<00:03:25.659> more<00:03:25.989> is

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
the signal is stronger and thus more is

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.629 
the signal is stronger and thus more is
being<00:03:26.349> subtracted<00:03:26.560> from<00:03:26.919> the<00:03:27.159> original

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
being subtracted from the original

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:28.649 
being subtracted from the original
output<00:03:27.790> which<00:03:28.060> is<00:03:28.090> coming<00:03:28.419> in<00:03:28.510> through<00:03:28.629> the

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:28.659 
output which is coming in through the

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:30.809 
output which is coming in through the
back<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.049> thus<00:03:29.829> the<00:03:30.010> signal<00:03:30.310> here<00:03:30.459> is<00:03:30.579> strong

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
back and thus the signal here is strong

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.240 
back and thus the signal here is strong
or<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.000> weaker<00:03:31.379> so<00:03:32.379> we<00:03:32.530> go<00:03:32.650> ahead<00:03:32.769> and<00:03:32.949> we<00:03:33.069> just

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
or a weaker so we go ahead and we just

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.159 
or a weaker so we go ahead and we just
keep<00:03:33.370> moving<00:03:33.609> the<00:03:33.669> redstone<00:03:34.030> torch<00:03:34.239> up<00:03:34.449> we<00:03:35.019> can

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
keep moving the redstone torch up we can

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.409 
keep moving the redstone torch up we can
see<00:03:35.349> eventually<00:03:36.010> that<00:03:36.609> the<00:03:36.790> redstone<00:03:37.180> lamp

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419 
see eventually that the redstone lamp

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.990 
see eventually that the redstone lamp
boom<00:03:37.690> there<00:03:38.019> it<00:03:38.049> goes<00:03:38.319> off<00:03:38.590> because<00:03:39.040> now<00:03:39.280> this

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
boom there it goes off because now this

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.930 
boom there it goes off because now this
signal<00:03:40.479> is<00:03:40.599> strong<00:03:41.019> enough<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:42.220> be<00:03:42.400> subtracted

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
signal is strong enough to be subtracted

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.909 
signal is strong enough to be subtracted
from<00:03:42.970> this<00:03:43.239> one<00:03:43.449> so<00:03:44.019> that<00:03:44.169> the<00:03:44.290> output<00:03:44.319> isn't

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
from this one so that the output isn't

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:46.349 
from this one so that the output isn't
even<00:03:45.220> strong<00:03:45.459> enough<00:03:45.489> to<00:03:45.699> turn<00:03:45.940> on<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.090> lamp

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
even strong enough to turn on the lamp

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.360 
even strong enough to turn on the lamp
now<00:03:46.989> I<00:03:47.019> realize<00:03:47.590> that<00:03:47.769> was<00:03:47.859> probably<00:03:48.040> highly

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
now I realize that was probably highly

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.879 
now I realize that was probably highly
confusing<00:03:48.909> and<00:03:49.060> I<00:03:49.120> apologize<00:03:49.569> for<00:03:49.599> that<00:03:49.889> but

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
confusing and I apologize for that but

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.409 
confusing and I apologize for that but
that's<00:03:51.069> probably<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.489> simplest<00:03:51.849> I'm<00:03:52.150> going

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
that's probably the simplest I'm going

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:53.789 
that's probably the simplest I'm going
to<00:03:52.510> be<00:03:52.629> able<00:03:52.720> to<00:03:52.900> explain<00:03:53.229> it<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:53.560> now<00:03:53.650> you

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
to be able to explain it and now you

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.830 
to be able to explain it and now you
probably<00:03:54.099> all<00:03:54.310> understand<00:03:54.729> why<00:03:54.909> Electrical

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
probably all understand why Electrical

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.689 
probably all understand why Electrical
Engineering<00:03:56.229> is<00:03:56.470> a<00:03:56.500> good<00:03:56.769> degree<00:03:56.949> for<00:03:57.430> people

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699 
Engineering is a good degree for people

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.939 
Engineering is a good degree for people
out<00:03:57.819> there<00:03:58.000> to<00:03:58.150> have<00:03:58.389> so<00:03:58.900> anyway<00:03:59.739> with<00:03:59.919> that

00:03:59.939 --> 00:03:59.949 
out there to have so anyway with that

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:01.500 
out there to have so anyway with that
said<00:04:00.250> let's<00:04:00.400> go<00:04:00.489> ahead<00:04:00.609> and<00:04:00.760> talk<00:04:01.090> about<00:04:01.269> the

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
said let's go ahead and talk about the

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.119 
said let's go ahead and talk about the
second<00:04:02.019> feature<00:04:02.169> of<00:04:02.530> a<00:04:02.620> redstone<00:04:02.919> comparator

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
second feature of a redstone comparator

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.640 
second feature of a redstone comparator
and<00:04:03.609> that<00:04:04.090> is<00:04:04.269> actually<00:04:04.659> the<00:04:04.780> comparison<00:04:05.470> mode

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
and that is actually the comparison mode

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.770 
and that is actually the comparison mode
so<00:04:06.310> essentially<00:04:06.909> in<00:04:07.000> this<00:04:07.120> mode<00:04:07.329> which<00:04:07.479> again

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
so essentially in this mode which again

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.780 
so essentially in this mode which again
is<00:04:07.840> determined<00:04:08.709> by<00:04:08.889> the<00:04:08.949> light<00:04:09.220> being<00:04:09.430> off<00:04:09.609> in

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
is determined by the light being off in

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.509 
is determined by the light being off in
front<00:04:09.970> is<00:04:10.209> when<00:04:10.959> the<00:04:11.260> signal<00:04:11.560> in<00:04:11.859> the<00:04:12.010> back<00:04:12.280> is

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
front is when the signal in the back is

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.610 
front is when the signal in the back is
either<00:04:12.909> equal<00:04:13.209> to<00:04:13.659> or<00:04:13.870> stronger<00:04:14.379> than<00:04:14.500> the

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
either equal to or stronger than the

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.800 
either equal to or stronger than the
signal<00:04:14.949> on<00:04:15.069> the<00:04:15.189> side<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:16.150> signal<00:04:16.570> in<00:04:16.690> the

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
signal on the side the signal in the

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.810 
signal on the side the signal in the
back<00:04:17.019> will<00:04:17.409> be<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.739> one<00:04:17.919> that<00:04:18.159> is<00:04:18.280> outputted

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
back will be the one that is outputted

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.909 
back will be the one that is outputted
so<00:04:19.389> obviously<00:04:19.930> hear<00:04:20.229> this<00:04:20.349> signal<00:04:20.590> in<00:04:20.829> the

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
so obviously hear this signal in the

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.070 
so obviously hear this signal in the
back<00:04:21.099> is<00:04:21.310> stronger<00:04:21.909> than<00:04:22.180> the<00:04:22.330> one<00:04:22.479> over<00:04:22.750> here

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
back is stronger than the one over here

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.140 
back is stronger than the one over here
and<00:04:23.229> thus<00:04:23.470> it<00:04:23.590> is<00:04:23.650> being<00:04:23.889> outputted<00:04:24.280> however

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
and thus it is being outputted however

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.570 
and thus it is being outputted however
if<00:04:25.389> I<00:04:25.509> make<00:04:25.750> this<00:04:25.870> signal<00:04:26.320> equal<00:04:26.800> which<00:04:27.460> i

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
if I make this signal equal which i

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.550 
if I make this signal equal which i
think<00:04:27.759> it<00:04:27.849> is<00:04:27.880> now<00:04:28.060> right<00:04:28.300> one<00:04:28.509> two<00:04:28.810> three<00:04:29.289> four

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
think it is now right one two three four

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.459 
think it is now right one two three four
five<00:04:29.860> one<00:04:30.490> two<00:04:30.520> three<00:04:30.820> four<00:04:31.240> five<00:04:31.659> yep<00:04:32.200> so<00:04:32.380> if

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:32.469 
five one two three four five yep so if

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:34.260 
five one two three four five yep so if
the<00:04:32.560> signal<00:04:32.860> is<00:04:32.950> still<00:04:33.159> equal<00:04:33.430> you<00:04:33.909> can<00:04:34.090> see

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
the signal is still equal you can see

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.730 
the signal is still equal you can see
here<00:04:34.539> that<00:04:34.570> the<00:04:34.810> original<00:04:34.990> output<00:04:35.349> which

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
here that the original output which

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.480 
here that the original output which
again<00:04:36.039> comes

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
again comes

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.850 
again comes
from<00:04:36.669> the<00:04:36.789> back<00:04:37.030> is<00:04:37.270> being<00:04:37.870> outputted<00:04:38.289> however

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
from the back is being outputted however

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.939 
from the back is being outputted however
the<00:04:39.520> second<00:04:39.940> I<00:04:40.090> make<00:04:40.330> this<00:04:40.569> one<00:04:40.870> stronger<00:04:41.620> than

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
the second I make this one stronger than

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.920 
the second I make this one stronger than
the<00:04:42.099> one<00:04:42.250> in<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.490> back<00:04:42.669> it<00:04:43.060> will<00:04:43.509> then<00:04:43.690> turn

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
the one in the back it will then turn

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.020 
the one in the back it will then turn
off<00:04:43.990> the<00:04:44.169> light<00:04:44.500> boom<00:04:44.889> there<00:04:45.220> you<00:04:45.370> can<00:04:45.520> see<00:04:45.699> it

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
off the light boom there you can see it

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.420 
off the light boom there you can see it
no<00:04:46.300> longer<00:04:46.479> it<00:04:46.720> lights<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:47.020> lamp<00:04:47.430> so

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
no longer it lights the lamp so

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.469 
no longer it lights the lamp so
obviously<00:04:48.759> it's<00:04:48.910> nighttime<00:04:49.090> so<00:04:49.330> I'm<00:04:49.389> just

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
obviously it's nighttime so I'm just

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.120 
obviously it's nighttime so I'm just
going<00:04:49.599> to<00:04:49.660> go<00:04:49.780> ahead<00:04:49.840> and<00:04:49.990> quickly<00:04:50.229> make<00:04:50.979> the

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
going to go ahead and quickly make the

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.290 
going to go ahead and quickly make the
time<00:04:51.340> day<00:04:53.430> so<00:04:54.430> we<00:04:54.550> can<00:04:54.699> see<00:04:54.880> a<00:04:54.910> little<00:04:55.180> bit

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
time day so we can see a little bit

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.029 
time day so we can see a little bit
better<00:04:55.479> there<00:04:55.660> we<00:04:55.780> are<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:56.080> now<00:04:56.620> we<00:04:56.680> can<00:04:56.919> go

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
better there we are and now we can go

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:58.499 
better there we are and now we can go
ahead<00:04:57.160> and<00:04:57.310> continue<00:04:57.580> on<00:04:57.880> with<00:04:58.060> really<00:04:58.389> the

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:58.509 
ahead and continue on with really the

00:04:58.509 --> 00:04:59.999 
ahead and continue on with really the
last<00:04:58.780> main<00:04:59.169> feature<00:04:59.470> of<00:04:59.560> a<00:04:59.710> redstone

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
last main feature of a redstone

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.430 
last main feature of a redstone
comparator<00:05:00.220> and<00:05:00.759> that<00:05:01.330> is<00:05:01.569> essentially<00:05:02.410> what

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
comparator and that is essentially what

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.159 
comparator and that is essentially what
it<00:05:02.680> has<00:05:02.979> to<00:05:03.009> do<00:05:03.250> with<00:05:03.370> chest<00:05:03.699> so<00:05:04.479> the<00:05:04.780> last<00:05:04.930> real

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
it has to do with chest so the last real

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:06.689 
it has to do with chest so the last real
main<00:05:05.349> feature<00:05:05.590> that<00:05:05.800> this<00:05:05.919> thing<00:05:06.099> does<00:05:06.280> is<00:05:06.550> it

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:06.699 
main feature that this thing does is it

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:08.969 
main feature that this thing does is it
will<00:05:06.789> allow<00:05:07.090> you<00:05:07.150> to<00:05:07.449> determine<00:05:07.599> based<00:05:08.560> off<00:05:08.949> of

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
will allow you to determine based off of

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.370 
will allow you to determine based off of
how<00:05:09.159> strong<00:05:09.610> the<00:05:09.759> redstone<00:05:10.150> signal<00:05:10.360> is<00:05:10.720> how

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
how strong the redstone signal is how

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.589 
how strong the redstone signal is how
much<00:05:11.560> stuff<00:05:11.860> is<00:05:11.919> in<00:05:12.069> a<00:05:12.159> chest<00:05:12.490> so<00:05:13.180> essentially

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
much stuff is in a chest so essentially

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.270 
much stuff is in a chest so essentially
the<00:05:13.810> strength<00:05:14.080> of<00:05:14.199> the<00:05:14.289> signal<00:05:14.530> relates<00:05:15.069> to

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
the strength of the signal relates to

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.589 
the strength of the signal relates to
the<00:05:15.400> fullness<00:05:15.610> of<00:05:15.729> the<00:05:15.909> chest<00:05:16.150> so<00:05:16.240> you<00:05:16.270> can<00:05:16.449> see

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
the fullness of the chest so you can see

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:18.659 
the fullness of the chest so you can see
here<00:05:16.900> the<00:05:17.380> redstone<00:05:17.770> signal<00:05:18.009> is<00:05:18.340> pretty

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
here the redstone signal is pretty

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.040 
here the redstone signal is pretty
strong<00:05:18.940> coming<00:05:19.150> out<00:05:19.389> of<00:05:19.419> this<00:05:19.539> thing<00:05:19.750> and<00:05:19.810> that

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
strong coming out of this thing and that

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.589 
strong coming out of this thing and that
is<00:05:20.199> because<00:05:20.430> voila<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:21.909> chest<00:05:22.210> is<00:05:22.360> full

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:22.599 
is because voila the chest is full

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:24.749 
is because voila the chest is full
however<00:05:23.530> as<00:05:23.830> I<00:05:24.009> take<00:05:24.159> things<00:05:24.400> out<00:05:24.550> of<00:05:24.610> the

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 
however as I take things out of the

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:26.189 
however as I take things out of the
chest<00:05:25.030> if<00:05:25.180> you<00:05:25.240> can<00:05:25.389> see<00:05:25.509> the<00:05:25.630> red<00:05:25.780> stone<00:05:25.960> or

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
chest if you can see the red stone or

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:28.439 
chest if you can see the red stone or
the<00:05:26.740> redstone<00:05:27.099> lamp<00:05:27.310> there<00:05:27.460> on<00:05:27.550> the<00:05:27.669> side<00:05:27.880> you

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
the redstone lamp there on the side you

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:29.999 
the redstone lamp there on the side you
can<00:05:28.599> see<00:05:28.630> as<00:05:28.900> I<00:05:29.110> take<00:05:29.319> things<00:05:29.530> out<00:05:29.770> of<00:05:29.830> the

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
can see as I take things out of the

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:32.460 
can see as I take things out of the
chest<00:05:30.340> eventually<00:05:31.060> at<00:05:31.180> a<00:05:31.210> certain<00:05:31.509> point<00:05:31.810> the

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
chest eventually at a certain point the

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.070 
chest eventually at a certain point the
lamp<00:05:32.740> will<00:05:32.919> go<00:05:33.069> off<00:05:33.340> because<00:05:33.909> boom<00:05:34.270> there<00:05:34.870> you

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
lamp will go off because boom there you

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.749 
lamp will go off because boom there you
can<00:05:35.229> see<00:05:35.259> now<00:05:35.530> the<00:05:35.560> chest<00:05:35.949> isn't<00:05:36.159> full<00:05:36.490> enough

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:36.759 
can see now the chest isn't full enough

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:38.790 
can see now the chest isn't full enough
to<00:05:37.300> keep<00:05:37.630> that<00:05:37.810> lit<00:05:38.080> and<00:05:38.199> if<00:05:38.259> I<00:05:38.319> go<00:05:38.470> ahead<00:05:38.590> and<00:05:38.680> I

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
to keep that lit and if I go ahead and I

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.770 
to keep that lit and if I go ahead and I
add<00:05:39.009> some<00:05:39.370> more<00:05:39.490> stuff<00:05:39.729> in<00:05:39.880> here<00:05:40.120> we<00:05:40.599> can

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
add some more stuff in here we can

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.209 
add some more stuff in here we can
increase<00:05:41.050> the<00:05:41.259> signal<00:05:41.440> there<00:05:41.740> you<00:05:41.860> are<00:05:42.009> and

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:42.219 
increase the signal there you are and

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:44.129 
increase the signal there you are and
now<00:05:42.280> we<00:05:42.340> can<00:05:42.550> see<00:05:42.699> the<00:05:42.820> light<00:05:42.969> is<00:05:43.180> on<00:05:43.210> so

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
now we can see the light is on so

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:45.390 
now we can see the light is on so
essentially<00:05:44.710> what<00:05:44.800> this<00:05:44.889> will<00:05:45.039> allow<00:05:45.190> you<00:05:45.250> to

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
essentially what this will allow you to

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.820 
essentially what this will allow you to
do<00:05:45.639> is<00:05:45.849> rig<00:05:46.180> certain<00:05:46.630> chest<00:05:46.900> and<00:05:47.199> know<00:05:47.560> if

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
do is rig certain chest and know if

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.379 
do is rig certain chest and know if
somebody<00:05:48.250> takes<00:05:48.550> stuff<00:05:48.820> out<00:05:48.969> of<00:05:49.000> your<00:05:49.120> chest

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
somebody takes stuff out of your chest

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.029 
somebody takes stuff out of your chest
you<00:05:49.930> know<00:05:50.050> the<00:05:50.169> light<00:05:50.320> will<00:05:50.469> come<00:05:50.500> on<00:05:50.650> when

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
you know the light will come on when

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:52.860 
you know the light will come on when
either<00:05:51.400> there<00:05:51.610> is<00:05:51.789> or<00:05:52.000> isn't<00:05:52.330> enough<00:05:52.539> stuff<00:05:52.750> in

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
either there is or isn't enough stuff in

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.830 
either there is or isn't enough stuff in
that<00:05:53.020> chest<00:05:53.289> for<00:05:53.949> you<00:05:54.370> to<00:05:54.610> or<00:05:55.270> for<00:05:55.570> there<00:05:55.719> to<00:05:55.750> be

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
that chest for you to or for there to be

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.209 
that chest for you to or for there to be
enough<00:05:56.050> stuff<00:05:56.259> in<00:05:56.320> the<00:05:56.409> chest<00:05:56.650> to<00:05:56.830> light<00:05:57.009> it<00:05:57.130> up

00:05:57.209 --> 00:05:57.219 
enough stuff in the chest to light it up

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:59.640 
enough stuff in the chest to light it up
so<00:05:57.759> it's<00:05:57.909> just<00:05:58.000> one<00:05:58.120> way<00:05:58.419> to<00:05:58.479> use<00:05:59.169> the<00:05:59.289> redstone

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
so it's just one way to use the redstone

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.740 
so it's just one way to use the redstone
comparator<00:05:59.770> in<00:06:00.159> your<00:06:00.280> world<00:06:00.460> I<00:06:00.699> realize<00:06:01.240> this

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
comparator in your world I realize this
