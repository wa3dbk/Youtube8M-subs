map<00:01:59.390> I<00:01:59.600> mean<00:01:59.810> I<00:01:59.990> think<00:02:00.680> actually<00:02:00.890> in<00:02:01.250> model<00:02:01.490> for

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
map I mean I think actually in model for

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.250 
map I mean I think actually in model for
3<00:02:01.790> it's<00:02:01.910> worse<00:02:02.240> than<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:02.570> was<00:02:02.660> a<00:02:02.690> model<00:02:02.960> for<00:02:03.140> two

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
3 it's worse than it was a model for two

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.040 
3 it's worse than it was a model for two
cuz<00:02:03.470> it<00:02:03.590> has<00:02:03.620> the<00:02:03.770> same<00:02:03.980> curses<00:02:04.490> dome<00:02:04.760> where<00:02:05.630> if

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
cuz it has the same curses dome where if

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.139 
cuz it has the same curses dome where if
you<00:02:06.200> spawn<00:02:06.530> on<00:02:06.770> offense<00:02:07.250> you<00:02:07.520> just<00:02:08.000> have<00:02:08.090> a

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
you spawn on offense you just have a

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.430 
you spawn on offense you just have a
tougher<00:02:08.509> time<00:02:08.539> generally<00:02:09.140> because<00:02:09.289> there's

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
tougher time generally because there's

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.229 
tougher time generally because there's
only<00:02:09.500> a<00:02:09.619> there's<00:02:10.250> like<00:02:10.429> three<00:02:10.670> ways<00:02:10.819> to<00:02:10.849> gather

easy<00:02:25.970> stalks<00:02:26.360> are<00:02:26.510> locked<00:02:26.659> down<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.870> whole

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
easy stalks are locked down the whole

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.380 
easy stalks are locked down the whole
map<00:02:27.530> but<00:02:28.370> that's<00:02:28.640> why<00:02:28.730> I<00:02:28.790> don't<00:02:28.879> like<00:02:29.090> it<00:02:29.120> and

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
map but that's why I don't like it and

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.059 
map but that's why I don't like it and
the<00:02:29.750> reason<00:02:29.930> I<00:02:29.959> think<00:02:30.019> it's<00:02:30.200> worse<00:02:30.440> in<00:02:30.950> this

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
the reason I think it's worse in this

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.890 
the reason I think it's worse in this
game<00:02:31.280> is<00:02:31.400> because<00:02:31.550> obviously<00:02:31.730> it's<00:02:32.569> plagued

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
game is because obviously it's plagued

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.069 
game is because obviously it's plagued
with<00:02:33.170> people<00:02:34.510> sitting<00:02:35.510> in<00:02:35.569> corners<00:02:35.930> with

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
with people sitting in corners with

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.559 
with people sitting in corners with
sitrep<00:02:36.439> and<00:02:36.680> which<00:02:37.579> is<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.849> wrong<00:02:38.030> way<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.540> use

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
sitrep and which is the wrong way to use

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:39.860 
sitrep and which is the wrong way to use
sitrep

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
sitrep

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.390 
sitrep
I<00:02:39.930> don't<00:02:40.439> know<00:02:40.590> if<00:02:40.650> there's<00:02:40.799> a<00:02:40.860> right<00:02:41.010> way

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
I don't know if there's a right way

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.960 
I don't know if there's a right way
lately<00:02:42.209> I've<00:02:42.390> actually<00:02:42.569> been<00:02:42.870> not<00:02:43.470> even<00:02:43.739> man<00:02:44.670> I

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
lately I've actually been not even man I

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.789 
lately I've actually been not even man I
don't<00:02:45.269> want<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.569> sound<00:02:45.750> like<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.959> hypocrite<00:02:46.200> but

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
don't want to sound like a hypocrite but

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.369 
don't want to sound like a hypocrite but
obviously<00:02:47.610> people's<00:02:48.329> opinions<00:02:48.989> are<00:02:49.170> entitled

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
obviously people's opinions are entitled

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.059 
obviously people's opinions are entitled
to<00:02:49.560> change<00:02:49.799> and<00:02:50.159> I<00:02:51.030> underestimated<00:02:52.069> the

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
to change and I underestimated the

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.339 
to change and I underestimated the
amount<00:02:53.310> grossly<00:02:53.939> underestimated<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:55.200> amount

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
amount grossly underestimated the amount

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.220 
amount grossly underestimated the amount
of<00:02:55.500> sitrep<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:56.040> would<00:02:56.700> run<00:02:56.940> into<00:02:57.000> after<00:02:57.989> making

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
of sitrep I would run into after making

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.470 
of sitrep I would run into after making
that<00:02:58.349> sitrep<00:02:58.739> video<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.220> don't<00:02:59.819> think<00:03:00.329> it's

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
that sitrep video I don't think it's

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.970 
that sitrep video I don't think it's
over<00:03:00.599> I'm<00:03:00.870> gonna<00:03:00.930> make<00:03:01.140> another<00:03:01.170> video<00:03:01.620> on<00:03:01.799> it

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
over I'm gonna make another video on it

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.710 
over I'm gonna make another video on it
probably<00:03:02.190> my<00:03:02.489> next<00:03:02.610> one<00:03:02.819> but<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.450> don't<00:03:03.599> think

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
probably my next one but I don't think

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.970 
probably my next one but I don't think
it's<00:03:03.810> like<00:03:03.900> overpowered<00:03:04.409> I<00:03:04.560> just<00:03:04.739> think<00:03:04.890> it

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
it's like overpowered I just think it

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.039 
it's like overpowered I just think it
changes<00:03:05.280> search<00:03:05.459> too<00:03:05.670> much<00:03:05.819> it<00:03:06.329> just<00:03:06.510> kind<00:03:07.019> of

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
changes search too much it just kind of

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.080 
changes search too much it just kind of
takes<00:03:07.230> away<00:03:07.349> from<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.739> but<00:03:08.430> I'll<00:03:08.849> save<00:03:09.060> that

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
takes away from it but I'll save that

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.839 
takes away from it but I'll save that
for<00:03:09.329> another<00:03:09.390> video<00:03:09.629> so<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.859> combined<00:03:11.670> with

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
for another video so that combined with

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.759 
for another video so that combined with
the<00:03:12.269> fact<00:03:12.420> that<00:03:12.569> you<00:03:12.720> know<00:03:12.810> lever<00:03:13.019> no<00:03:13.349> longer

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
the fact that you know lever no longer

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.319 
the fact that you know lever no longer
have<00:03:13.980> unlimited<00:03:14.579> sprint<00:03:14.730> all<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.120> have<00:03:15.239> is

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
have unlimited sprint all you have is

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:16.550 
have unlimited sprint all you have is
extreme<00:03:15.750> conditioning<00:03:16.109> which<00:03:16.230> is<00:03:16.349> double

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
extreme conditioning which is double

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.649 
extreme conditioning which is double
sprint<00:03:16.769> because<00:03:17.190> in<00:03:17.310> mono<00:03:17.430> for<00:03:17.670> two<00:03:17.879> you<00:03:18.540> could

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659 
sprint because in mono for two you could

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:19.849 
sprint because in mono for two you could
have<00:03:18.780> unlimited<00:03:18.959> sprint<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.530> get<00:03:19.620> out<00:03:19.709> of<00:03:19.799> the

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
have unlimited sprint and get out of the

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.800 
have unlimited sprint and get out of the
spawn<00:03:20.099> on<00:03:20.280> offense<00:03:20.579> a<00:03:20.670> lot<00:03:20.879> easier<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:21.389> I'm

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
spawn on offense a lot easier and I'm

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.750 
spawn on offense a lot easier and I'm
sure<00:03:22.230> if<00:03:22.409> unlimited<00:03:22.920> sprint<00:03:23.010> was<00:03:23.220> in<00:03:23.340> mono<00:03:23.489> for

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
sure if unlimited sprint was in mono for

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.580 
sure if unlimited sprint was in mono for
three<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.239> Dom<00:03:24.840> would<00:03:25.019> be<00:03:25.109> a<00:03:25.139> much<00:03:25.440> more

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
three and Dom would be a much more

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.069 
three and Dom would be a much more
playable<00:03:25.920> map<00:03:25.980> as<00:03:26.220> well<00:03:26.370> I<00:03:26.579> don't<00:03:27.359> usually<00:03:27.450> go

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
playable map as well I don't usually go

playable map as well I don't usually go
into<00:03:28.290> this<00:03:28.409> but<00:03:28.769> my<00:03:29.190> class<00:03:29.459> loadout<00:03:29.849> for<00:03:30.090> this

bullshit<00:04:13.049> I<00:04:13.079> think<00:04:13.349> there's<00:04:13.500> so<00:04:13.709> many<00:04:13.829> there's

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
bullshit I think there's so many there's

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.710 
bullshit I think there's so many there's
so<00:04:14.430> many<00:04:14.699> good<00:04:15.090> things<00:04:15.150> that<00:04:15.449> could<00:04:15.540> have<00:04:15.629> done

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
so many good things that could have done

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.000 
so many good things that could have done
with<00:04:15.840> recon<00:04:16.109> like<00:04:16.260> it's<00:04:16.410> beautiful<00:04:16.829> perk

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
with recon like it's beautiful perk

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.509 
with recon like it's beautiful perk
because<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.789> whole<00:04:17.910> idea<00:04:18.239> behind<00:04:18.299> it<00:04:18.630> was<00:04:18.690> to

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
because the whole idea behind it was to

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.650 
because the whole idea behind it was to
reveal<00:04:20.519> people<00:04:20.849> who<00:04:20.940> use<00:04:21.060> assassin<00:04:21.510> on<00:04:21.599> the

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
reveal people who use assassin on the

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.089 
reveal people who use assassin on the
radar<00:04:21.930> but<00:04:22.349> they<00:04:22.440> kind<00:04:22.590> of<00:04:22.620> just<00:04:22.770> achieved

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
radar but they kind of just achieved

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.529 
radar but they kind of just achieved
that<00:04:23.280> by<00:04:23.310> if<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:23.669> have<00:04:23.699> recon<00:04:24.150> on<00:04:24.180> and<00:04:24.419> call

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
that by if you have recon on and call

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.390 
that by if you have recon on and call
you<00:04:24.690> avian<00:04:25.080> they<00:04:25.620> appear<00:04:25.889> on<00:04:25.919> radar<00:04:26.010> that's

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
you avian they appear on radar that's

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.399 
you avian they appear on radar that's
like<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.880> easiest<00:04:27.330> way<00:04:27.659> for<00:04:27.690> recon<00:04:28.199> to<00:04:28.289> be<00:04:28.380> a

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:28.409 
like the easiest way for recon to be a

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:31.159 
like the easiest way for recon to be a
balance<00:04:28.979> perk<00:04:29.250> but<00:04:29.849> no<00:04:30.090> they<00:04:30.510> went<00:04:30.659> balls<00:04:30.930> deep

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
balance perk but no they went balls deep

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.270 
balance perk but no they went balls deep
on<00:04:31.349> it<00:04:31.470> and<00:04:31.590> made<00:04:31.680> it<00:04:31.800> so<00:04:31.889> if<00:04:31.949> you<00:04:32.039> shoot

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
on it and made it so if you shoot

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.100 
on it and made it so if you shoot
someone<00:04:32.310> with<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:32.729> bullets<00:04:33.090> or<00:04:33.539> hit<00:04:33.930> him<00:04:33.990> with

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
someone with the bullets or hit him with

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.779 
someone with the bullets or hit him with
an<00:04:34.199> explosion<00:04:34.740> even<00:04:34.949> a<00:04:35.010> fucking<00:04:35.250> flashbang

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
an explosion even a fucking flashbang

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.279 
an explosion even a fucking flashbang
your<00:04:36.030> pendant<00:04:36.330> on<00:04:36.389> recon<00:04:36.720> for<00:04:36.990> anywhere<00:04:37.229> from

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
your pendant on recon for anywhere from

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.070 
your pendant on recon for anywhere from
6<00:04:37.770> to<00:04:37.889> 12<00:04:38.250> seconds<00:04:38.760> and<00:04:39.000> it's<00:04:39.570> bullshit<00:04:39.930> it's

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
6 to 12 seconds and it's bullshit it's

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.779 
6 to 12 seconds and it's bullshit it's
basically<00:04:40.409> spawning<00:04:40.860> in<00:04:41.130> with<00:04:41.280> a<00:04:41.310> black<00:04:41.520> bird

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
basically spawning in with a black bird

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.640 
basically spawning in with a black bird
already<00:04:42.030> it's<00:04:42.449> just<00:04:42.599> it's<00:04:42.780> just<00:04:42.840> dumb<00:04:43.260> knowing

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
already it's just it's just dumb knowing

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.070 
already it's just it's just dumb knowing
the<00:04:43.830> enemy's<00:04:44.190> position<00:04:44.729> that<00:04:45.599> precisely

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
the enemy's position that precisely

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.020 
the enemy's position that precisely
knowing<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.650> direction<00:04:47.190> they're<00:04:47.729> facing

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
knowing the direction they're facing

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.730 
knowing the direction they're facing
seeing<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.080> move<00:04:49.289> in<00:04:49.500> real<00:04:49.680> time<00:04:49.979> it<00:04:50.310> is

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
seeing the move in real time it is

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.500 
seeing the move in real time it is
retarded<00:04:51.610> they<00:04:51.700> could<00:04:51.880> have<00:04:51.970> achieved<00:04:52.090> this

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
retarded they could have achieved this

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.450 
retarded they could have achieved this
again<00:04:52.930> another<00:04:53.410> way<00:04:53.560> to<00:04:53.620> balance<00:04:53.800> it<00:04:54.040> is<00:04:54.190> just

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
again another way to balance it is just

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.970 
again another way to balance it is just
to<00:04:54.660> make<00:04:55.660> it<00:04:55.720> like<00:04:55.930> an<00:04:56.050> advanced<00:04:56.290> UAV<00:04:56.650> do<00:04:56.830> like

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
to make it like an advanced UAV do like

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.100 
to make it like an advanced UAV do like
three<00:04:57.280> sweeps<00:04:57.670> just<00:04:58.540> show<00:04:58.630> the<00:04:58.780> basic

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
three sweeps just show the basic

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.510 
three sweeps just show the basic
direction<00:04:59.260> don't<00:04:59.680> show<00:04:59.860> the<00:05:00.010> movement<00:05:00.190> at<00:05:00.430> all

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
direction don't show the movement at all

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.070 
direction don't show the movement at all
and<00:05:00.760> then<00:05:01.330> it'd<00:05:01.420> be<00:05:01.510> fine

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
and then it'd be fine

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.230 
and then it'd be fine
wow<00:05:02.680> I<00:05:02.710> did<00:05:03.070> not<00:05:03.100> want<00:05:03.550> this<00:05:03.700> to<00:05:03.760> be<00:05:04.000> a<00:05:04.030> bitch

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240
