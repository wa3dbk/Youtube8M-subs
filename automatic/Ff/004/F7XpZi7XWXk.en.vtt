video on hard water or calcium buildup
on<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.520> tank<00:00:05.879> it's<00:00:06.600> always<00:00:06.990> nice<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.200> get<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.470> free

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
on a tank it's always nice to get a free

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.120 
on a tank it's always nice to get a free
tank<00:00:07.919> online<00:00:08.400> there's<00:00:08.700> usually<00:00:08.849> some<00:00:09.450> kind<00:00:09.480> of

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.130 
tank online there's usually some kind of

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.339 
tank online there's usually some kind of
stipulation<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.370> tank<00:00:11.840> either<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.080> seals

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
stipulation to the tank either the seals

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.070 
stipulation to the tank either the seals
are<00:00:13.559> busted<00:00:14.009> it's<00:00:14.639> got<00:00:14.820> this<00:00:14.910> nasty<00:00:15.299> calcium

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
are busted it's got this nasty calcium

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.700 
are busted it's got this nasty calcium
buildup<00:00:17.119> or<00:00:18.119> it's<00:00:18.390> cracked<00:00:18.779> shattered

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
buildup or it's cracked shattered

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.340 
buildup or it's cracked shattered
there's<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.160> chip<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.960> first<00:00:22.170> thing

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
there's a chip in it so the first thing

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.720 
there's a chip in it so the first thing
I<00:00:22.439> do<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.769> when<00:00:22.859> I'm<00:00:23.010> getting<00:00:23.100> these<00:00:23.310> tanks<00:00:23.609> for

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
I do is when I'm getting these tanks for

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.880 
I do is when I'm getting these tanks for
free<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.029> course<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.359> just<00:00:24.539> take<00:00:24.720> them<00:00:24.960> it's

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
free of course I just take them it's

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.620 
free of course I just take them it's
easier<00:00:26.279> just<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.519> give<00:00:26.760> them<00:00:26.910> away<00:00:27.029> than<00:00:27.420> just

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
easier just to give them away than just

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.349 
easier just to give them away than just
to<00:00:27.689> try<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.930> find<00:00:28.199> them<00:00:28.699> but<00:00:29.699> as<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.119> see

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
to try to find them but as you can see

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.709 
to try to find them but as you can see
right<00:00:30.510> here<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:31.679> hard<00:00:32.040> water<00:00:32.719> buildup

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
right here that hard water buildup

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.260 
right here that hard water buildup
calcium<00:00:34.500> buildup<00:00:34.890> what<00:00:35.640> probably<00:00:35.910> happened

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
calcium buildup what probably happened

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.389 
calcium buildup what probably happened
with<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.480> tank<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> water<00:00:37.559> level<00:00:37.950> kind<00:00:38.160> of

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
with this tank is a water level kind of

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.060 
with this tank is a water level kind of
sank<00:00:39.210> lower<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.690> lower<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.020> lower<00:00:40.070> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
sank lower and lower and lower the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.310 
sank lower and lower and lower the
person's<00:00:41.489> maybe<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:42.300> said<00:00:42.450> screw<00:00:42.600> it

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
person's maybe just said screw it

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.110 
person's maybe just said screw it
there's<00:00:43.739> maybe<00:00:43.920> no<00:00:44.100> fish<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.640> I'll<00:00:44.969> just

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
there's maybe no fish in it I'll just

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.990 
there's maybe no fish in it I'll just
let<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.480> go<00:00:45.629> whatever<00:00:45.890> as<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> water<00:00:47.250> calcium

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
let it go whatever as the water calcium

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.680 
let it go whatever as the water calcium
builds<00:00:48.450> up<00:00:48.710> these<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:49.980> nasty<00:00:50.670> white<00:00:51.120> residue

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
builds up these this nasty white residue

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.840 
builds up these this nasty white residue
as<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.890> can<00:00:53.010> see<00:00:53.190> right<00:00:53.340> here<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.699> water

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
as you can see right here the water

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.700 
as you can see right here the water
levels<00:00:54.239> go<00:00:54.360> down<00:00:54.539> down<00:00:54.809> down<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.590> have

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
levels go down down down and you have

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.500 
levels go down down down and you have
your<00:00:55.890> suction<00:00:56.160> cups<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.730> just<00:00:56.879> probably<00:00:57.120> for

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
your suction cups it's just probably for

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.130 
your suction cups it's just probably for
your<00:00:57.660> heater<00:00:58.129> and<00:00:59.180> yeah<00:01:00.210> get<00:01:00.480> these<00:01:00.629> nasty

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
your heater and yeah get these nasty

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.290 
your heater and yeah get these nasty
build<00:01:01.590> up<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.399> first<00:01:02.550> thing<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.850> do<00:01:02.910> with

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
build up so the first thing I do with

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.549 
build up so the first thing I do with
the<00:01:03.480> tanks<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.899> get<00:01:04.140> like<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.320> said<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.470> just

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
the tanks I get like I said I just

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.960 
the tanks I get like I said I just
grabbed<00:01:04.949> them<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.309> doesn't<00:01:05.519> hurt<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.790> grab

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
grabbed them it doesn't hurt to grab

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.330 
grabbed them it doesn't hurt to grab
them<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.689> check<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.850> seals<00:01:09.799> and<00:01:10.799> make<00:01:11.189> sure

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
them I check the seals and make sure

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.010 
them I check the seals and make sure
they're<00:01:11.520> all<00:01:11.549> intact<00:01:12.000> with<00:01:12.330> these<00:01:12.479> actually

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
they're all intact with these actually

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.310 
they're all intact with these actually
really<00:01:13.380> good<00:01:13.700> so<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:15.030> can<00:01:15.689> continue<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.170> with

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
really good so I can continue on with

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.730 
really good so I can continue on with
that<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.860> what<00:01:17.520> do<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.700> do<00:01:17.909> with<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.840> tank<00:01:19.560> that

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
that so what do you do with a tank that

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.450 
that so what do you do with a tank that
has<00:01:19.860> all<00:01:20.040> these<00:01:20.159> water<00:01:20.490> build<00:01:20.759> ups<00:01:22.159> just<00:01:23.159> use

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
has all these water build ups just use

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.850 
has all these water build ups just use
distilled<00:01:23.939> white<00:01:24.210> vinegar<00:01:24.270> now<00:01:25.229> what<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.409> do<00:01:25.590> is

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
distilled white vinegar now what I do is

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.719 
distilled white vinegar now what I do is
I<00:01:25.950> just<00:01:26.159> dump<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:28.189> and<00:01:29.189> your<00:01:29.310> whole<00:01:29.520> house

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
I just dump it in and your whole house

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.289 
I just dump it in and your whole house
to<00:01:30.030> smell<00:01:30.420> like<00:01:30.600> frickin<00:01:31.350> vinegar<00:01:31.829> look<00:01:32.670> it

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
to smell like frickin vinegar look it

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.090 
to smell like frickin vinegar look it
does<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> job<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.259> do<00:01:37.320> use<00:01:37.590> quite<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.890> bit<00:01:37.950> a

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
does the job and I do use quite a bit a

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.230 
does the job and I do use quite a bit a
lot<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.369> people<00:01:38.520> really<00:01:38.670> don't<00:01:38.970> need<00:01:39.180> that

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
lot of people really don't need that

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.929 
lot of people really don't need that
much<00:01:39.540> whatever<00:01:40.159> but<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.490> what<00:01:41.640> works<00:01:41.820> for

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
much whatever but this is what works for

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.350 
much whatever but this is what works for
me<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.270> I've<00:01:42.360> always<00:01:42.720> done<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.140> way<00:01:43.200> so

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
me and I've always done it this way so

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.730 
me and I've always done it this way so
this<00:01:45.360> way<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.659> kills<00:01:45.899> anything<00:01:46.170> down<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
this way it kills anything down the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.310 
this way it kills anything down the
bottom<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.820> know<00:01:48.270> softens<00:01:48.810> everything<00:01:48.899> up

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
bottom you know softens everything up

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.260 
bottom you know softens everything up
and<00:01:50.040> what<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.189> do<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.670> just<00:01:50.700> take<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.060> paper

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
and what I do is I just take a paper

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.170 
and what I do is I just take a paper
towel<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.740> will<00:01:52.979> wipe<00:01:53.220> down<00:01:53.460> them<00:01:53.670> water

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
towel and I will wipe down them water

do is I just coat each panel glass
there's<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.030> real<00:02:06.210> hard<00:02:06.450> spot<00:02:06.780> I'll<00:02:07.229> just<00:02:07.380> give

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
there's a real hard spot I'll just give

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.160 
there's a real hard spot I'll just give
it<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.680> quick<00:02:07.860> rub<00:02:08.360> well<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:09.509> go<00:02:09.810> down<00:02:09.989> the

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.570 

and<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.930> way<00:02:19.170> just<00:02:19.500> like<00:02:19.650> any<00:02:20.010> cleaner<00:02:20.880> uqs

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
and this way just like any cleaner uqs

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.060 
and this way just like any cleaner uqs
it's<00:02:23.580> gonna<00:02:23.820> help<00:02:24.230> just<00:02:25.230> kind<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.500> soften

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
it's gonna help just kind of soften

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.160 
it's gonna help just kind of soften
things<00:02:26.280> up<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.850> lot<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.450> times<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.840> won't<00:02:28.050> even

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
things up a lot of times you won't even

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.280 
things up a lot of times you won't even
have<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.830> scrub<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.250> off<00:02:29.370> now<00:02:29.850> right<00:02:30.060> here<00:02:30.420> and

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
have to scrub it off now right here and

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.930 
have to scrub it off now right here and
getting<00:02:31.710> quite<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.010> bit<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.460> buildup<00:02:32.760> right

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
getting quite a bit of buildup right

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.040 
getting quite a bit of buildup right
there<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.240> I'm<00:02:33.330> probably<00:02:33.450> gonna<00:02:33.720> have<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.900> take

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
there so I'm probably gonna have to take

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.140 
there so I'm probably gonna have to take
a<00:02:34.080> razor<00:02:34.260> blade<00:02:34.410> for<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.800> at<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.010> end<00:02:35.160> but

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
a razor blade for that at the end but

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.650 
a razor blade for that at the end but
we'll<00:02:36.330> see<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:40.170> think<00:02:40.710> I<00:02:40.830> said<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.190> just<00:02:41.660> rub

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
we'll see so I think I said you just rub

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.010 
we'll see so I think I said you just rub
it<00:02:42.690> down<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:44.640> let<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.420> sit<00:02:47.210> now<00:02:48.210> already<00:02:48.720> yeah

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
it down and let it sit now already yeah

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.560 
it down and let it sit now already yeah
it<00:02:49.140> looks<00:02:49.320> great<00:02:49.730> but<00:02:50.730> what<00:02:50.850> that's<00:02:51.030> doing<00:02:51.360> is

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
it looks great but what that's doing is

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.450 
it looks great but what that's doing is
masking<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.320> you<00:02:52.470> even<00:02:52.740> can<00:02:52.860> just<00:02:53.070> take<00:02:53.220> plain

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
masking it you even can just take plain

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.700 
masking it you even can just take plain
water<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.510> will<00:02:54.660> mask<00:02:54.870> those<00:02:55.290> calcium

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
water and it will mask those calcium

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.580 
water and it will mask those calcium
buildup<00:02:56.310> water<00:02:56.880> buildup<00:02:57.420> anything<00:02:58.410> like<00:02:58.560> that

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
buildup water buildup anything like that

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.200 
buildup water buildup anything like that
so<00:02:59.010> I'm<00:02:59.220> gonna<00:02:59.370> let<00:02:59.520> this<00:02:59.670> sit<00:02:59.940> for<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.180> few

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
so I'm gonna let this sit for a few

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.750 
so I'm gonna let this sit for a few
minutes<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:01.350> will<00:03:01.410> come<00:03:01.920> back<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.370> show

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
minutes and I will come back and show

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.610 
minutes and I will come back and show
you<00:03:02.790> what<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.120> looks<00:03:03.300> like<00:03:03.570> hopefully<00:03:04.350> when

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
you what it looks like hopefully when

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.870 
you what it looks like hopefully when
it's<00:03:04.770> dry<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:06.950> okay<00:03:07.950> so<00:03:08.010> I've<00:03:08.220> let<00:03:08.400> this<00:03:08.550> dry

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
it's dry so okay so I've let this dry

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.660 
it's dry so okay so I've let this dry
roughly<00:03:09.480> about<00:03:09.540> 11<00:03:10.140> minutes<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:10.830> what<00:03:11.040> my

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
roughly about 11 minutes is what my

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.420 
roughly about 11 minutes is what my
clock<00:03:11.910> is<00:03:12.120> telling<00:03:12.480> me<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:13.500> this<00:03:13.920> is<00:03:14.130> actually

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
clock is telling me and this is actually

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.640 
clock is telling me and this is actually
pretty<00:03:14.550> dry<00:03:14.940> I<00:03:15.360> don't<00:03:16.080> really<00:03:16.260> see<00:03:16.470> any

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
pretty dry I don't really see any

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.870 
pretty dry I don't really see any

here and there but for the most part you
got<00:03:21.030> maybe<00:03:21.360> like<00:03:21.570> an<00:03:21.660> algae<00:03:22.020> buildup<00:03:22.200> right

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
got maybe like an algae buildup right

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.080 
got maybe like an algae buildup right
there<00:03:22.740> some<00:03:22.950> razor<00:03:23.280> blades<00:03:23.490> gonna<00:03:23.670> take<00:03:23.940> that

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
there some razor blades gonna take that

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.590 
there some razor blades gonna take that
off

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600

off
you<00:03:25.260> got<00:03:25.410> another<00:03:25.620> algae<00:03:25.980> buildup<00:03:26.160> right<00:03:26.550> here

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
you got another algae buildup right here

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.490 
you got another algae buildup right here
and<00:03:27.540> then<00:03:27.630> you've<00:03:27.720> got<00:03:27.840> some<00:03:27.870> hard<00:03:28.260> water

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
and then you've got some hard water

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.800 
and then you've got some hard water
still<00:03:28.920> over<00:03:29.190> here<00:03:29.490> so<00:03:30.390> I'm<00:03:30.480> gonna<00:03:30.600> take<00:03:30.750> a

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.220 
razor blade to that but I'll pass out
from<00:03:33.480> inhaling<00:03:33.990> the<00:03:34.110> vinegar<00:03:34.440> and<00:03:36.050> do<00:03:37.050> it<00:03:37.140> like

fill the entire tank up now what does

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.750 
fill the entire tank up now what does
this<00:03:57.090> do<00:03:57.330> this<00:03:57.510> is<00:03:57.660> a<00:03:57.690> two<00:03:57.960> part<00:03:58.520> kind<00:03:59.520> of<00:03:59.670> a

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
this do this is a two part kind of a

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.900 
this do this is a two part kind of a
solution<00:04:00.200> this<00:04:01.200> helps<00:04:01.890> break<00:04:02.160> down<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.640> hard

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
solution this helps break down the hard

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.240 
solution this helps break down the hard
water<00:04:03.090> that<00:04:03.300> calcium<00:04:03.840> buildup<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:05.070> also
