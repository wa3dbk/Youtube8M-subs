00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
this way vertical down towards the floor

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.699 
this way vertical down towards the floor
and<00:02:53.269> pull<00:02:53.569> through<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.870> lashes<00:02:54.290> this<00:02:54.500> way

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
and pull through the lashes this way

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.009 
and pull through the lashes this way
what<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.430> does<00:02:55.579> is<00:02:55.610> it<00:02:55.760> coats<00:02:56.120> them<00:02:56.360> up<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:56.840> if

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
what it does is it coats them up and if

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.589 
what it does is it coats them up and if
you<00:02:57.110> get<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.560> base<00:02:57.769> it<00:02:58.040> helps<00:02:58.370> them<00:02:58.519> lift<00:02:58.790> coax

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
you get the base it helps them lift coax

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.210 
you get the base it helps them lift coax
them<00:02:59.750> up<00:02:59.900> makes<00:03:00.140> them<00:03:00.319> really<00:03:00.440> picking<00:03:00.860> not<00:03:01.069> me

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
them up makes them really picking not me

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.580 
them up makes them really picking not me
from<00:03:01.459> lumpy<00:03:01.730> but<00:03:02.030> separates<00:03:02.510> them<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:03.470> they'll

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
from lumpy but separates them so they'll

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.550 
from lumpy but separates them so they'll
kind<00:03:03.799> of<00:03:03.950> get<00:03:04.099> that<00:03:04.280> kind<00:03:04.489> of<00:03:04.519> like<00:03:04.670> PC<00:03:05.060> spiky

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
kind of get that kind of like PC spiky

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.840 
kind of get that kind of like PC spiky
lash<00:03:06.560> like<00:03:06.799> what<00:03:06.950> she<00:03:07.190> has<00:03:07.340> going<00:03:07.370> on<00:03:07.700> right

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.610 
to wait for it to dry and then scrape it
off<00:03:14.180> which<00:03:14.420> is<00:03:14.569> probably<00:03:14.780> like<00:03:15.049> not<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.440> best

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
off which is probably like not the best

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.420 
off which is probably like not the best
feeling<00:03:15.920> for<00:03:16.100> her

feeling for her

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.660 
feeling for her
but<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.180> works<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.799> lot<00:03:19.799> of<00:03:19.950> girls<00:03:20.280> always

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
then they go straight the reason that

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.949 
then they go straight the reason that
happens<00:03:26.609> is<00:03:27.000> because<00:03:27.180> they<00:03:27.420> start<00:03:27.689> applying

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959
