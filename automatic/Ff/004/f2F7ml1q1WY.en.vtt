00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.039 
looking for a forgiving and powerful
racket<00:01:47.439> the<00:01:48.100> Wilson<00:01:48.640> BLX<00:01:49.240> 2<00:01:49.570> is<00:01:49.990> a

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
racket the Wilson BLX 2 is a

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.319 
racket the Wilson BLX 2 is a
feather-light<00:01:50.740> rec<00:01:51.039> with<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.759> large<00:01:52.000> head

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
feather-light rec with the large head

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.480 
feather-light rec with the large head
size<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:53.140> first<00:01:53.350> thing<00:01:53.649> I<00:01:53.740> noticed<00:01:54.130> about<00:01:54.189> the

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
size the first thing I noticed about the

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.200 
size the first thing I noticed about the
frame<00:01:54.759> was<00:01:54.999> how<00:01:55.179> easy<00:01:55.539> it<00:01:55.840> was<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.200> swing

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
frame was how easy it was the swing

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.230 
frame was how easy it was the swing
but<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.420> 15<00:01:57.810> points<00:01:58.080> head<00:01:58.409> heavy<00:01:58.620> balance

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
but the 15 points head heavy balance

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
but the 15 points head heavy balance
facilitated<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.299> follow-through<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:01.049> my

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
facilitated the follow-through on my

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260 
facilitated the follow-through on my
service<00:02:01.680> motion<00:02:02.070> which<00:02:02.610> made<00:02:02.820> serving

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
service motion which made serving

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.600 
service motion which made serving
effortless<00:02:03.840> but<00:02:04.440> at<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.710> same<00:02:04.920> time<00:02:05.280> I

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
effortless but at the same time I

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.340 
effortless but at the same time I
couldn't<00:02:06.150> serve<00:02:06.390> as<00:02:06.570> strong<00:02:06.840> as<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.050> would<00:02:07.260> have

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
couldn't serve as strong as I would have

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.559 
couldn't serve as strong as I would have
liked<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.190> as<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.369> result<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:09.030> had<00:02:09.240> to<00:02:09.390> focus

liked and as a result I had to focus

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.750 
liked and as a result I had to focus
more<00:02:10.020> controlling<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.649> ball<00:02:10.860> due<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.640> the

from<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.980> backcourt<00:02:17.459> I<00:02:17.700> was<00:02:18.090> forced<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.569> curb

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
from the backcourt I was forced to curb

my usual forehand and backhand motions
the<00:02:21.930> rack<00:02:22.140> was<00:02:22.380> merely<00:02:22.650> doing<00:02:22.920> too<00:02:23.250> much<00:02:23.489> for

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
the rack was merely doing too much for

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.350 
the rack was merely doing too much for
my<00:02:23.819> liking

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
my liking

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.390 
my liking
when<00:02:24.840> swinging<00:02:25.230> from<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.410> baseline<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:26.190> had<00:02:26.310> to

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
when swinging from the baseline I had to

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.640 
when swinging from the baseline I had to
pull<00:02:26.670> back<00:02:26.940> at<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.300> last<00:02:27.540> moment<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.470> make

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
pull back at the last moment to make

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.440 
pull back at the last moment to make
sure<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:29.040> balls<00:02:29.280> would<00:02:29.519> stay<00:02:29.730> inside<00:02:30.030> the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
sure the balls would stay inside the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.110 
sure the balls would stay inside the
court<00:02:30.720> due<00:02:31.560> again<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.220> hammer<00:02:32.489> like<00:02:32.760> hit

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
court due again to the hammer like hit

court due again to the hammer like hit
heavy<00:02:33.330> balance<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.320> racket<00:02:34.709> would<00:02:34.769> get<00:02:34.950> ahead

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
heavy balance the racket would get ahead

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.430 
heavy balance the racket would get ahead
of<00:02:35.250> me<00:02:35.459> during<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.940> middle<00:02:36.209> of<00:02:36.269> my<00:02:36.450> stroke<00:02:36.720> to

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
of me during the middle of my stroke to

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.590 
of me during the middle of my stroke to
compensate<00:02:38.040> for<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.280> rackets<00:02:38.670> power<00:02:38.880> I<00:02:39.209> had

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
compensate for the rackets power I had

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.870 
compensate for the rackets power I had
to<00:02:39.750> slow<00:02:40.050> down<00:02:40.290> Midway<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.130> swinging<00:02:41.519> motion

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
to slow down Midway the swinging motion

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.180 
to slow down Midway the swinging motion
overall<00:02:42.750> this<00:02:42.989> racket<00:02:43.440> doesn't<00:02:43.620> suit<00:02:44.010> my

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
playing style but that doesn't mean it's

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.290 
playing style but that doesn't mean it's
not<00:02:46.620> for<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:47.010> if<00:02:47.550> you<00:02:47.790> need<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:47.970> lightly
