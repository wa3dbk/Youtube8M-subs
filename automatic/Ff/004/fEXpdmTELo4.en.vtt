the every two minutes which I felt was

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.789 
the every two minutes which I felt was
maybe<00:03:58.269> a<00:03:58.360> little<00:03:58.540> bit<00:03:58.750> for<00:03:58.930> overreaction<00:03:59.680> from

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
maybe a little bit for overreaction from

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:00.810 
maybe a little bit for overreaction from
the<00:03:59.920> year<00:04:00.010> before<00:04:00.160> where<00:04:00.519> they<00:04:00.579> go<00:04:00.670> in<00:04:00.730> every

the year before where they go in every
60<00:04:01.269> seconds<00:04:01.600> again<00:04:01.900> I<00:04:02.140> still<00:04:02.500> prefer<00:04:02.760> every<00:04:03.760> 90

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
60 seconds again I still prefer every 90

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.180 
60 seconds again I still prefer every 90
seconds<00:04:04.540> that<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:04.930> me<00:04:05.079> is<00:04:05.230> my<00:04:05.410> favorite<00:04:05.890> deal

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
right there as every 90 seconds when

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.270 
right there as every 90 seconds when
somebody<00:04:08.140> comes<00:04:08.290> in<00:04:08.500> I<00:04:08.590> think<00:04:08.799> two<00:04:08.980> minutes

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280

sometimes<00:04:09.459> a<00:04:09.760> little<00:04:10.030> long<00:04:10.269> can<00:04:10.780> lead<00:04:11.049> to<00:04:11.260> the

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
sometimes a little long can lead to the

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.870 
sometimes a little long can lead to the
event<00:04:11.650> being<00:04:11.829> drugged<00:04:12.100> out<00:04:12.280> a<00:04:12.310> little<00:04:12.549> bit<00:04:12.730> too
