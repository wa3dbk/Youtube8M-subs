 little barbecue from where we today 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.260
 Let's break two paradigms and 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.550
 barbecue the first paradigm is that it has 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.950
 people who say they can not 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.420
 I started the basic course I already bought a 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:23.150
 beautiful filet mignon will make and won until 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.030

 dijon mustard here it goes 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:36.259
 smear this piece of commoner

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:46.409
 [Music] 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.590
 let's mix with the same mercatto hand 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.590
 all 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.580
 here is going to be a delight 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.320
 since the two minutes tempering here 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.570
 with the one shown after we put salt 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.500
 thick and takes a back to Brazil. 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.500
 little salt coarse 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.400
 in that spread 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.760
 I have mine. 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.760
 put a little more boot 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.580
 of that spread 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.599
 Did you do this, just play in Brazil? 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.040
 the boot there in the background that is warmer 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.040
 barbecue is more critical 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:41.180
 It's very simple, we'll bust. 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.180

 mixture 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.790
 here is a delight both on the stage 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:16.810
 as in the load was in the glorious piece 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:18.330

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.540
 [Music] 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:25.930
 the crowd always has a spatula 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:28.420
 do not pierce the meat with the fork 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.830
 if it does not leave all the juice of it was a sock 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.910
 hour later 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.530
 We have that word, beauty, and it goes. 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.760
 Say you can not get filet mignon in the 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.710
 barbecue 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.710
 Let's see how delicious this was 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.639
 Ideally, it should look rosy for 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.419
 inside 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:56.330
 only alcohol because she if you let 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:59.449
 it will be very long and white. 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:02.050
 will stay dry so she will stay 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.050
 juicy 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.810
 the second paradigm it will break 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.570
 Barbecue today, you have to serve beer. 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:18.260
 We're not going to have a beautiful Sunday. It 's a 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.260

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.720
