00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.479 
that but we're going to now use hair
pins<00:03:21.420> because<00:03:21.930> hair<00:03:22.380> pins<00:03:22.680> are<00:03:22.890> going<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.280> give

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
pins because hair pins are going to give

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.880
