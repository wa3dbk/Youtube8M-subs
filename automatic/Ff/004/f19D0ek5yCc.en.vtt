amp<00:04:31.360> I<00:04:31.570> remember<00:04:32.380> this<00:04:32.470> is<00:04:32.650> coming<00:04:32.800> out<00:04:33.070> of<00:04:33.130> the

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.290 
amp I remember this is coming out of the
guitar<00:04:33.310> we're<00:04:33.699> just<00:04:33.849> playing<00:04:34.060> through<00:04:34.210> an

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
guitar we're just playing through an

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.600 
guitar we're just playing through an
acoustic<00:04:34.750> amp<00:04:34.960> here<00:04:35.229> so<00:04:35.889> these<00:04:36.039> tones<00:04:36.370> are

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
acoustic amp here so these tones are

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.010 
acoustic amp here so these tones are
actually<00:04:36.970> being<00:04:37.180> generated<00:04:37.720> by<00:04:37.960> the

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
actually being generated by the

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.839 
actually being generated by the
instrument<00:04:38.380> so<00:04:38.710> you<00:04:38.770> could<00:04:38.979> again<00:04:39.280> plug<00:04:39.699> this

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
instrument so you could again plug this

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:42.300

into<00:04:40.060> a<00:04:40.180> PA<00:04:40.389> or<00:04:40.750> an<00:04:41.320> acoustic<00:04:41.500> amp<00:04:41.889> and<00:04:42.099> get<00:04:42.220> the

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
into a PA or an acoustic amp and get the

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.050 
into a PA or an acoustic amp and get the
same<00:04:42.520> effects<00:04:42.910> out<00:04:43.120> of<00:04:43.240> it<00:04:44.639> let's<00:04:45.639> find<00:04:45.970> a

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
same effects out of it let's find a

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.270 
same effects out of it let's find a
