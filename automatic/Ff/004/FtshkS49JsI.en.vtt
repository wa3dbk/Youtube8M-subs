00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:07.770
 hi there, tungsten is the first 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.190
 Yaroslavl videobloger and repair our 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.130
 continued over the past few days have been 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.380
 done the following done 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:22.920
 frame here is this system of insulation 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:26.280
 Mine here on this wall screwed 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.380
 drywall here and he does not warm 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.270
 we can say it 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.980
 interior wall so 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:42.590
 this wall is also almost wider 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:45.649
 I also bought a laminate here such 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:50.610
 light shade thought that in the dark 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:53.750
 it will look not so good shade 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.149
 it means light that the room was light 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.270
 so very soon 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.170
 I think we will do the floor here of course 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:10.759
 this garbage will all clean here will be dry 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:13.889
 screed and of course we lay down the sheets said 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:17.999
 We will put the substrate , we will invest 

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:19.069
 this laminate is not so necessary 

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:21.929
 to lay 

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:26.249
 I think so here in a day you can manage 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:28.409
 in one of the videos I talked about such 

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:33.889
 bugs screws which are called here they are 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:37.560
 Black I bought these screws here these 

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:40.170
 tie suspensions here 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.060
 that stiffness was here they are 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.779
 screwed normally and not by 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.659
 profiles for these go well , not that 

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:56.659
 there and brilliant which 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:57.609
 Elena twists such interskol he 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.209
 I already have 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:04.819
 Year three-four and husband was spun 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:06.549
 incredible amount of screws he's in 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.959
 principle is not expensive and the company is so 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:12.200
 inexpensive 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:13.959
 Russian in Khimki they do mean 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.660
 any planes 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:20.720
 hammers and screwdrivers whatnot 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.700
 do so of course he looks 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:28.660
 now it is unpresentable so but 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.879
 our functions are performed all we twist 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.329
 okay it March 14 Wii 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:37.400
 although so much time has passed in principle 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:40.750
 the battery still keeps charging all 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.730
 works fine in d understand yes 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:49.239
