00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.240
 since the end of May we have to 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.710
 start thinking about doing transplants to 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.570
 all those species that are in 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.290
 vegetative rest for you to 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.760
 know 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.070
 are those that develop and 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.660
 they bloom during spring and summer but 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.400
 let's take advantage of this work not only for 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.710
 change the planters but to 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.240
 reorder the garden and back frontar 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.570
 those species that are very 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.369
 tight and do not look for example this 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.470
 minute has originally a form 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.720
 rounded but for his search for light 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.710
 had to grow elongated mind by 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.710
 below the peak is by or 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.220
 another example is this green that is 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.290
 drowned by the vine 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.180
 green is an attractive plant that grows 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.920
 one and a half meters in diameter and what 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.230
 we can put in another place that looks 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.880
 more and so let this vine 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.880
 grow and cover this massif with green 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.380
 another species that we are going to transplant is 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.540
 this aspire to thunberg and that is being 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.550
 tight by the bible we're going to take it out 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.260
 to take advantage of it elsewhere and so 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.780
 this time he will grow and cover this 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.210
 space the spiral blooms in spring 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.430
 and now in autumn it 's normal to lose 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.259
 its leaves we have to plant it in a 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.540
 sunny place so you have a 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.610
 abundant flowering pressure pre caring 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.350
 that is a cool environment tolerates well 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.950
 frost and you need a risk 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.950
 moderate 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.460
 with these plants we can form a 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.320
 new solid or regroup in pots 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.750
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.060
 prune them to facilitate the transfer and 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.060
 also to stimulate its original shape 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.659
 it is very good to water to moisten and 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.690
 soften the earth so it will be easier 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.820
 take out the plant 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.280
 we mark on the earth around the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.380
 base calculating leave in all the 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.780
 bread of roots for this is important 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.430
 use a large shovel and depending on the 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.640
 hardness of the earth you have to use a 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.640
 chuzo 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.780
 the transfer we do it by wrapping the 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.700
 root bread with this sack and applying 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.200
 peat to protect it and so we can 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.560
 Take some time to prepare the 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.560
 ground 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.409
 now we are going to plant and the place that 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.150
 we took it has to be fine the one that you 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.250
 I do to be able to add organic matter 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.000
 with sheet earth and sand from the 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.000
 improve drainage 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.600
 for the plantation we will use two 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.520
 associated products triple superphosphate 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.470
 in the hard pot and hormones in perform 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.510
 tea sprinkled on the roots bread 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.190
 both products will help 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.080
 establishment of the plant in its new 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.080
 place and will strengthen their roots 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.959
 yes 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.819
 we are almost ready with the plantation 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.200
 but let's take a break to 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.549
 answer questions 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.980
 We have the question of Alejandro who 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.989
 has a asking buddy flowerpot that 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.060
 despite the fact that he takes care of it, it seems 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.440
 that the truth is drying alejandro 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.540
 that is probably not drying 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.430
 but it is being attacked by fungi 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.260
 the mushrooms and the conifers are very 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.269
 common and to prevent them and 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.700
 control them you have to apply oxychloride 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.739
 copper is rough on the foliage and 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.379
 you have to do three applications one per 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.150
 week the next question is from 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.950
 book who has to level your garden 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.199
 and wants to know if he has to withdraw the 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.699
 grass and then replant the 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.310
 truth is that if the best you can 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:25.130
 do explain the grass eliminate it and 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.500
 then leveling then prepare the bed in 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.630
 seed with sand of compost and lampa 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.520
 then sow remembers that in this era 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.410
 not all seeds germinate 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.820
 I recommend that you apply festuca volume 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.430
 because others need more 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.710
 temperature the next question is from 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.240
 Monica who wants to know how you can 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.820
 the coves and when the 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.530
 multiplication the coves do not put on 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.419
 they take out the dried leaves and the flowers 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.310
 when they are dry and multiplication 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:52.700
 It is done in September from 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.200
 the plant and dividing its rhizomes the 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.030
 time to do transplants you have to 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.620
 take advantage of it very well because when 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.260
 we can make the most drastic changes 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.600
 in the garden relocating the plants without 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.740
 damage it without affecting its development we 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.740
 we see next week
