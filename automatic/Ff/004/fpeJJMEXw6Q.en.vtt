it'll<00:02:00.810> crack<00:02:00.990> right<00:02:01.200> out<00:02:01.439> but<00:02:01.920> if<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.100> use<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
it'll crack right out but if you use the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.810 
it'll crack right out but if you use the
more<00:02:02.670> flex<00:02:03.290> it<00:02:04.290> happens<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.189> be<00:02:05.219> flexible

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820

because<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:06.360> an<00:02:06.479> acrylic<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:07.409> could<00:02:07.619> also

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
because it's an acrylic you could also

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.639 
because it's an acrylic you could also
take<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.129> float<00:02:08.489> like<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:09.869> use

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
take a float like this and you just use

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.430 
take a float like this and you just use
a<00:02:10.679> little<00:02:10.770> bit<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.039> water<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.580> float<00:02:12.120> it

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
a little bit of water and you float it

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.980 
a little bit of water and you float it
because<00:02:13.440> this<00:02:13.650> is

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
because this is

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.230 
because this is
water<00:02:14.350> cleanup<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:15.190> could<00:02:15.430> not<00:02:15.610> do<00:02:15.820> that<00:02:16.030> with

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
water cleanup you could not do that with
