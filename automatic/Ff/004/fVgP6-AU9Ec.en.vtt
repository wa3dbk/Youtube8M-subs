real quick video to show off the latest
thing<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.230> got<00:00:07.410> done<00:00:07.680> in<00:00:07.830> my<00:00:08.150> list<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:10.010> things<00:00:11.010> to

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
thing I got done in my list of things to

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.680 
thing I got done in my list of things to
get<00:00:11.309> done<00:00:11.780> I<00:00:13.040> had<00:00:14.040> wanted<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.509> switch<00:00:15.509> my

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
get done I had wanted to switch my

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.689 
get done I had wanted to switch my
generator<00:00:16.109> over<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:16.680> that<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:16.859> could<00:00:17.100> be<00:00:17.609> able

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
generator over so that I could be able

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.689 
generator over so that I could be able
to<00:00:17.880> run<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.150> on<00:00:18.210> propane<00:00:18.770> as<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:19.890> said<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.220> one<00:00:20.490> of

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
to run it on propane as I said in one of

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.090 
to run it on propane as I said in one of
my<00:00:20.820> other<00:00:20.970> videos<00:00:21.590> if<00:00:22.590> something<00:00:22.980> ever

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
my other videos if something ever

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.380 
my other videos if something ever
happened<00:00:23.519> where<00:00:23.640> we<00:00:23.760> had<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.970> run<00:00:24.180> on<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
happened where we had to run on the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.500 
happened where we had to run on the
generator<00:00:24.810> for<00:00:25.050> an<00:00:25.140> extended<00:00:25.590> period<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.920> time

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
generator for an extended period of time

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.810 
generator for an extended period of time
you<00:00:27.510> know<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.630> only<00:00:27.840> have<00:00:28.109> about<00:00:29.070> ten<00:00:29.369> gallons

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
you know I only have about ten gallons

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.100 
you know I only have about ten gallons
worth<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.810> gasoline<00:00:32.090> set<00:00:33.090> aside<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.750> know<00:00:33.840> for

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
worth of gasoline set aside you know for

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.319 
worth of gasoline set aside you know for
the<00:00:34.230> for<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.620> generator<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.340> actually

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
the for the generator and I actually

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.910 
the for the generator and I actually
alternate<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.020> go<00:00:37.170> through<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.800> know<00:00:37.890> I

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
alternate I go through that you know I

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.170 
alternate I go through that you know I
run<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.250> through<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.460> mower<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.910> stuff<00:00:39.090> like

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
run it through the mower and stuff like

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.000 
run it through the mower and stuff like
that<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.540> then<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.719> just<00:00:39.750> go<00:00:40.079> fill<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.770> jugs

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
that and then I just go fill the jugs

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.940 
that and then I just go fill the jugs
back<00:00:41.190> up<00:00:43.550> but<00:00:44.550> anyway<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.480> if<00:00:45.890> that<00:00:46.890> ever

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
back up but anyway so if that ever

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.060 
back up but anyway so if that ever
happened<00:00:48.289> you<00:00:49.289> know<00:00:49.410> there<00:00:49.710> might<00:00:49.860> be<00:00:49.920> a

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
happened you know there might be a

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.709 
happened you know there might be a
situation<00:00:50.250> where<00:00:50.610> fuel<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.000> hard<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.360> come<00:00:51.539> by

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
situation where fuel is hard to come by

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.920 
situation where fuel is hard to come by
and<00:00:52.219> plus<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:53.399> just<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.670> pain<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.780> know<00:00:54.870> to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
and plus it's just a pain you know to

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.209 
and plus it's just a pain you know to
have<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.199> keep<00:00:55.469> running<00:00:55.770> back<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.039> forth

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
have to keep running back and forth

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.900 
have to keep running back and forth
grabbing<00:00:57.180> more<00:00:57.510> fuel<00:00:57.949> so<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.370> wanted<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.730> use

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
grabbing more fuel so I wanted to use

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.959 
grabbing more fuel so I wanted to use
the<00:01:00.809> propane<00:01:01.520> because<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.699> have<00:01:02.820> an

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
the propane because I have an

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.450 
the propane because I have an
underground<00:01:03.449> propane<00:01:04.229> tank<00:01:04.530> for<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.280> house

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
underground propane tank for the house

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.190 
underground propane tank for the house
and<00:01:07.430> you<00:01:08.430> know<00:01:08.520> pretty<00:01:08.850> much<00:01:08.939> only<00:01:09.720> thing<00:01:10.020> it

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
and you know pretty much only thing it

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.109 
and you know pretty much only thing it
really<00:01:10.380> runs<00:01:10.740> all<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:10.950> time<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.610> hot

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
really runs all the time is the hot

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.490 
really runs all the time is the hot
water<00:01:12.330> heater<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.659> we<00:01:12.810> even<00:01:12.930> have<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.350> a

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
water heater and we even have that on a

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.060 
water heater and we even have that on a
timer

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
timer

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.660 
timer
so<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.340> only<00:01:14.430> comes<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:14.850> twice<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.720> day<00:01:16.430> and<00:01:17.430> then

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
so it only comes on twice a day and then

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.399 
so it only comes on twice a day and then
the<00:01:17.820> furnace<00:01:18.210> we<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.630> turned<00:01:18.869> down<00:01:19.049> quite<00:01:19.380> a

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
the furnace we have turned down quite a

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.380 
the furnace we have turned down quite a
bit<00:01:19.500> because<00:01:20.130> we<00:01:20.580> heat<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.000> house<00:01:21.150> with<00:01:21.360> a

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
bit because we heat the house with a

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.280 
bit because we heat the house with a
pellet<00:01:21.630> stove<00:01:23.090> so<00:01:24.090> we've<00:01:24.360> got<00:01:24.570> about<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.810> 500

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
pellet stove so we've got about a 500

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.030 
pellet stove so we've got about a 500
gallon<00:01:26.030> tank<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.299> lasts<00:01:28.259> quite<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.560> while<00:01:28.770> that

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
gallon tank and lasts quite a while that

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.630 
gallon tank and lasts quite a while that
tank<00:01:29.250> will<00:01:29.400> last<00:01:29.549> us<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.790> year<00:01:31.159> so<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.460> should<00:01:32.610> be

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
tank will last us a year so we should be

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.399 
tank will last us a year so we should be
able<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.880> run<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.119> generator<00:01:33.540> just<00:01:33.869> fine<00:01:34.079> for

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
able to run the generator just fine for

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.420 
able to run the generator just fine for
quite<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.220> while<00:01:36.619> haven't<00:01:37.619> actually<00:01:37.920> done<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
quite a while haven't actually done the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.300 
quite a while haven't actually done the
math<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:39.299> figure<00:01:39.659> out<00:01:39.900> how<00:01:40.049> long<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:40.619> I'm<00:01:41.009> sure

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
math to figure out how long but I'm sure

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.569 
math to figure out how long but I'm sure
it's<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:42.140> few<00:01:43.140> weeks<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:46.200> yeah<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.009> basically

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
it's a few weeks so yeah so basically

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.130 
it's a few weeks so yeah so basically
here's<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.509> generator<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:50.659> it's<00:01:51.659> sitting<00:01:52.049> on

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
here's the generator and it's sitting on

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.499 
here's the generator and it's sitting on
the<00:01:52.409> little<00:01:53.100> concrete<00:01:53.579> slab<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.180> poured

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
the little concrete slab that I poured

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.679 
the little concrete slab that I poured
for<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:55.100> because<00:01:56.100> before<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.520> had<00:01:56.640> like<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.030> it

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
for it because before I had like a it

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.569 
for it because before I had like a it
was<00:01:57.750> just<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:58.200> slope<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.159> underneath

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
was just a slope and this is underneath

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.480 
was just a slope and this is underneath
my<00:02:00.140> all-season<00:02:01.140> porch<00:02:01.409> or<00:02:01.770> three-season

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
my all-season porch or three-season

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.969 
my all-season porch or three-season
porch<00:02:02.520> rather<00:02:03.200> you<00:02:04.200> can<00:02:04.320> see<00:02:04.439> there's<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.680> slope

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
porch rather you can see there's a slope

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.620 
porch rather you can see there's a slope
there<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.369> when<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.610> rains<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.180> water<00:02:06.210> will

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
there and when it rains the water will

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.850 
there and when it rains the water will
come<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:06.960> under<00:02:07.110> there<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:09.619> you<00:02:10.619> know<00:02:10.739> it's

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
come in under there and you know it's

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.120 
come in under there and you know it's
right<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.009> pallet<00:02:11.489> in<00:02:11.610> there<00:02:11.760> that

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
right a pallet in there that

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.920 
right a pallet in there that
kind<00:02:12.490> of<00:02:12.550> try<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.730> level<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.120> generator<00:02:13.570> at<00:02:13.810> me

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
kind of try to level the generator at me

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.890 
kind of try to level the generator at me
had<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.140> say<00:02:14.260> for<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:14.770> I<00:02:14.800> put<00:02:15.160> this<00:02:15.580> little

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
had to say for that so I put this little

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.699 
had to say for that so I put this little
platform<00:02:17.829> in<00:02:17.980> here<00:02:18.510> concrete<00:02:19.590> except<00:02:20.590> the

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
platform in here concrete except the

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.490 
platform in here concrete except the
generator<00:02:21.129> on<00:02:21.569> so<00:02:22.569> this<00:02:22.810> is<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:22.989> first<00:02:23.260> load

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
generator on so this is the first load

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.979 
generator on so this is the first load
test<00:02:23.769> I've<00:02:24.579> actually<00:02:24.849> got<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.390> house<00:02:25.689> running

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
test I've actually got the house running

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.960 
test I've actually got the house running
on<00:02:26.230> generator<00:02:27.129> right<00:02:27.310> now

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.479 

110<00:02:30.970> outlet<00:02:31.330> so<00:02:31.569> they<00:02:31.690> can<00:02:31.870> watch<00:02:32.129> this<00:02:33.129> is<00:02:33.310> the

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
110 outlet so they can watch this is the

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.240 
110 outlet so they can watch this is the
low<00:02:33.909> pressure<00:02:33.940> regulator

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.520 

you<00:02:39.250> can<00:02:39.400> see<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.730> venturi<00:02:40.090> there<00:02:40.420> behind<00:02:41.410> the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
you can see the venturi there behind the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.220 
you can see the venturi there behind the
air<00:02:41.680> cleaner<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:43.270> basically<00:02:43.660> just<00:02:43.900> bolts

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
air cleaner and basically just bolts

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.970 
air cleaner and basically just bolts
right<00:02:44.350> on<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:46.080> I've<00:02:47.080> switched<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.680> back<00:02:47.710> and

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
right on and I've switched it back and

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.070 
right on and I've switched it back and

contain it sells gas related stuff

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.320 
contain it sells gas related stuff
and<00:03:44.930> then<00:03:45.050> we<00:03:45.170> transition<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.710> hard<00:03:45.980> pipe<00:03:46.330> to

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
and then we transition to hard pipe to

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.610 
and then we transition to hard pipe to
go<00:03:47.450> ahead<00:03:47.630> and<00:03:47.750> house<00:03:47.870> and<00:03:48.170> of<00:03:48.230> course<00:03:48.410> get<00:03:48.590> a

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
go ahead and house and of course get a

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:56.480 
go ahead and house and of course get a
shutoff<00:03:49.130> valve<00:03:49.490> there

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.360 

shot<00:03:57.210> at<00:03:57.330> a<00:03:57.390> meter<00:03:57.600> here<00:03:57.930> you<00:03:58.110> can<00:03:58.290> see

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
shot at a meter here you can see

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:08.660 
shot at a meter here you can see
sixty-two

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.850 

and<00:04:08.910> basically<00:04:09.300> what<00:04:09.990> you<00:04:10.200> want<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.530> do<00:04:10.650> here

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
and basically what you want to do here

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.309 
and basically what you want to do here
is<00:04:11.040> if<00:04:11.819> you're<00:04:12.030> running<00:04:12.210> under<00:04:12.569> load<00:04:12.810> you<00:04:13.170> can

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
is if you're running under load you can

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.640 
is if you're running under load you can
adjust<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.980> there's<00:04:14.400> a<00:04:14.520> little<00:04:15.650> adjustment

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
adjust the there's a little adjustment

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.150 
adjust the there's a little adjustment
on<00:04:16.859> that<00:04:17.040> propane

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
on that propane

on that propane
low<00:04:18.490> pressure<00:04:18.700> regulator<00:04:19.270> I'm<00:04:19.600> sorry<00:04:19.870> the

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
low pressure regulator I'm sorry the

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.230 
low pressure regulator I'm sorry the
feed<00:04:20.170> that<00:04:20.530> brass<00:04:21.250> elbow<00:04:21.640> becomes

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
feed that brass elbow becomes

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.990 
feed that brass elbow becomes
you<00:04:22.599> can<00:04:22.750> screw<00:04:22.990> that<00:04:23.139> into

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.560 

back<00:04:27.540> it<00:04:27.720> off<00:04:27.870> to

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
back it off to

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.040 
back it off to
provide<00:04:30.110> more<00:04:30.320> fuel

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.959 

so<00:04:34.979> inside<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.520> basement

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:36.969 
so inside the basement

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:38.629 
so inside the basement
you<00:04:37.509> can<00:04:37.629> see<00:04:37.809> where<00:04:38.019> we<00:04:38.199> come<00:04:38.439> through

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
you can see where we come through

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:44.419 
you can see where we come through
transition<00:04:40.199> from<00:04:41.199> the<00:04:41.860> hard<00:04:42.069> pipe<00:04:42.279> to<00:04:42.909> the

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:44.429 
transition from the hard pipe to the

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:47.729 
transition from the hard pipe to the
flexible<00:04:45.429> I<00:04:45.639> think<00:04:46.239> we<00:04:46.299> call<00:04:46.479> it<00:04:46.509> CST<00:04:47.019> gonna

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:47.739 
flexible I think we call it CST gonna

00:04:47.739 --> 00:04:52.669 
flexible I think we call it CST gonna
show<00:04:48.129> off<00:04:48.189> valve<00:04:48.489> there<00:04:48.729> and<00:04:48.969> a<00:04:49.059> sediment<00:04:49.899> trap

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:52.679 

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:55.379 

and<00:04:53.679> come<00:04:53.979> back<00:04:54.129> to<00:04:54.339> the<00:04:54.429> manifold<00:04:54.909> and<00:04:55.119> again

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
and come back to the manifold and again

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.359 
and come back to the manifold and again
this<00:04:55.479> is<00:04:55.629> three-quarter<00:04:56.139> inch<00:04:56.289> line<00:04:56.529> I<00:04:56.559> could

00:04:57.359 --> 00:04:57.369 
this is three-quarter inch line I could

00:04:57.369 --> 00:04:59.489 
this is three-quarter inch line I could
have<00:04:57.489> done<00:04:57.909> half<00:04:58.419> inch<00:04:58.689> I<00:04:58.839> think<00:04:58.869> and<00:04:59.259> gotten

00:04:59.489 --> 00:04:59.499 
have done half inch I think and gotten

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:01.319 
have done half inch I think and gotten
away<00:04:59.589> with<00:04:59.709> it<00:04:59.889> but<00:05:00.039> I<00:05:00.339> thought<00:05:00.639> well<00:05:00.879> I'm

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:01.329 
away with it but I thought well I'm

00:05:01.329 --> 00:05:02.399 
away with it but I thought well I'm
gonna<00:05:01.449> do<00:05:01.629> it<00:05:01.659> I<00:05:01.809> might<00:05:01.899> as<00:05:01.959> well<00:05:02.049> just<00:05:02.289> do

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:02.409 
gonna do it I might as well just do

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:03.809 
gonna do it I might as well just do
three-quarter<00:05:02.949> inch<00:05:03.099> because<00:05:03.219> that's<00:05:03.309> that's

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:03.819 
three-quarter inch because that's that's

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:05.219 
three-quarter inch because that's that's
for<00:05:04.329> the<00:05:04.389> length<00:05:04.599> of<00:05:04.719> the<00:05:04.779> run<00:05:05.019> with<00:05:05.169> a

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
for the length of the run with a

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.889 
for the length of the run with a
low-pressure<00:05:05.559> system<00:05:07.319> with<00:05:08.319> the<00:05:08.469> 6800<00:05:09.189> Watts

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:09.899 
low-pressure system with the 6800 Watts

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:13.319 
low-pressure system with the 6800 Watts
that's<00:05:10.899> what<00:05:11.409> I<00:05:11.679> guess<00:05:12.369> that's<00:05:12.579> what<00:05:13.029> it<00:05:13.119> needs

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:13.329 
that's what I guess that's what it needs

00:05:13.329 --> 00:05:17.309 
that's what I guess that's what it needs
so<00:05:14.729> to<00:05:15.729> be<00:05:15.849> on<00:05:15.939> the<00:05:15.969> safe<00:05:16.179> side<00:05:16.209> I<00:05:16.449> did<00:05:16.689> that<00:05:16.869> so

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:17.319 
so to be on the safe side I did that so

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:19.139 
so to be on the safe side I did that so
you<00:05:17.379> can<00:05:17.529> see<00:05:17.559> here<00:05:17.860> where<00:05:18.039> we're<00:05:18.999> actually

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:19.149 
you can see here where we're actually

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:24.600 
you can see here where we're actually
under<00:05:19.509> load<00:05:20.729> not<00:05:21.729> very<00:05:21.939> much<00:05:22.149> but<00:05:23.369> what<00:05:24.369> about

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
under load not very much but what about

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.859 
under load not very much but what about
1500<00:05:25.149> watts<00:05:25.299> or<00:05:25.449> so<00:05:28.529> and<00:05:29.529> you<00:05:29.619> can<00:05:29.739> see<00:05:29.799> the

00:05:30.859 --> 00:05:30.869 
1500 watts or so and you can see the

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:33.809 
1500 watts or so and you can see the
interlock<00:05:31.869> there<00:05:32.139> is<00:05:32.289> in<00:05:32.469> the<00:05:32.669> position<00:05:33.669> where

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:33.819 
interlock there is in the position where

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:39.169 
interlock there is in the position where
it's<00:05:33.999> locking<00:05:34.719> out<00:05:35.019> the<00:05:35.289> main<00:05:35.860> utility<00:05:36.159> feed

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:39.179 

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:44.999 

so<00:05:40.179> now<00:05:40.539> let's<00:05:40.779> switch<00:05:40.929> back<00:05:41.259> over<00:05:41.439> to<00:05:44.009> utility

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:45.009 
so now let's switch back over to utility

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:47.459 
so now let's switch back over to utility
feed<00:05:45.219> so<00:05:46.209> the<00:05:46.300> first<00:05:46.509> thing<00:05:46.659> I<00:05:46.719> do<00:05:46.779> I'll<00:05:47.139> shut

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:47.469 
feed so the first thing I do I'll shut

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:49.170 
feed so the first thing I do I'll shut
off<00:05:47.589> all<00:05:47.769> these

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
off all these

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.409 
off all these
branch<00:05:49.990> circuits

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
branch circuits

00:05:52.419 --> 00:06:11.640 
branch circuits
watch<00:05:52.930> the<00:05:53.110> meter<00:05:53.580> need<00:05:54.580> let's<00:05:54.729> come<00:05:54.939> down

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.159 

and<00:06:12.090> finally<00:06:13.090> we<00:06:13.270> turn<00:06:13.449> the<00:06:13.570> backside<00:06:13.930> breaker

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:14.169 
and finally we turn the backside breaker

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:16.320 
and finally we turn the backside breaker
off<00:06:14.410> you<00:06:15.220> see<00:06:15.370> the<00:06:15.490> interlocks<00:06:15.850> slide<00:06:16.120> back

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
off you see the interlocks slide back

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.730 
off you see the interlocks slide back
down<00:06:17.040> which<00:06:18.040> now<00:06:18.220> allows<00:06:18.370> us<00:06:18.520> to<00:06:18.910> go<00:06:19.210> ahead<00:06:19.330> and

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
down which now allows us to go ahead and

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:26.180 
down which now allows us to go ahead and
switch<00:06:20.740> over<00:06:20.919> the<00:06:21.880> main<00:06:22.830> breaker

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.190 

or<00:06:26.460> our<00:06:26.580> utility<00:06:27.060> I'll<00:06:27.390> go<00:06:27.480> ahead<00:06:27.570> when<00:06:27.870> Oliver

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
or our utility I'll go ahead when Oliver

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:38.810 
or our utility I'll go ahead when Oliver
English<00:06:28.440> back<00:06:28.620> on<00:06:36.950> and<00:06:37.950> that's<00:06:38.430> pretty<00:06:38.730> much

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
English back on and that's pretty much

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.220 
English back on and that's pretty much
it<00:06:39.030> so<00:06:39.440> I'm<00:06:40.440> pretty<00:06:40.590> happy<00:06:40.710> with<00:06:41.070> that<00:06:41.130> kit<00:06:42.230> you

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.230 
it so I'm pretty happy with that kit you

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.870 
it so I'm pretty happy with that kit you
get<00:06:43.320> paid<00:06:43.530> just<00:06:43.560> over<00:06:43.890> two<00:06:44.220> hundred<00:06:44.250> for<00:06:44.790> the

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
get paid just over two hundred for the

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.700 
get paid just over two hundred for the
kid<00:06:45.410> and<00:06:47.270> it's<00:06:48.270> been<00:06:48.420> a<00:06:48.450> little<00:06:48.660> time<00:06:48.840> figuring

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710 
kid and it's been a little time figuring

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.100 
kid and it's been a little time figuring
out<00:06:49.830> with<00:06:50.010> the<00:06:50.100> best<00:06:50.250> place<00:06:50.490> to<00:06:50.520> mount<00:06:50.880> it<00:06:51.110> on

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
out with the best place to mount it on

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.990 
out with the best place to mount it on
the<00:06:52.290> frame<00:06:52.470> that<00:06:52.650> I<00:06:52.710> have<00:06:52.950> and<00:06:53.340> it<00:06:53.730> worked<00:06:53.880> out

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 
the frame that I have and it worked out

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.380 
the frame that I have and it worked out
pretty<00:06:54.150> well<00:06:54.300> I<00:06:54.770> did<00:06:55.770> the<00:06:55.920> 90-degree<00:06:56.730> elbow<00:06:56.940> so

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:57.390 
pretty well I did the 90-degree elbow so

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.650 
pretty well I did the 90-degree elbow so
that<00:06:57.420> it<00:06:57.840> would<00:06:58.640> so<00:06:59.640> the<00:06:59.730> hose<00:06:59.880> wouldn't<00:07:00.210> screw

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 
that it would so the hose wouldn't screw

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.540 
that it would so the hose wouldn't screw
down<00:07:00.810> the<00:07:00.870> side<00:07:01.200> but<00:07:01.440> rather

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.550 
down the side but rather

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.190 
down the side but rather
come<00:07:03.030> out<00:07:03.180> and<00:07:03.419> translate

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:04.200 
come out and translate

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.269 
come out and translate
going<00:07:04.620> up

00:07:06.269 --> 00:07:06.279 
going up

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:08.369 
going up
and<00:07:06.369> I<00:07:06.639> thought<00:07:06.819> I<00:07:06.879> might<00:07:07.179> zip<00:07:07.509> tie<00:07:07.749> it<00:07:07.809> to<00:07:08.289> the

00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:08.379 
and I thought I might zip tie it to the

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:09.909 
and I thought I might zip tie it to the
frame<00:07:08.679> the<00:07:08.889> hoes

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 
frame the hoes

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:13.029 
frame the hoes
it's<00:07:10.400> a<00:07:10.520> pretty<00:07:10.729> pretty<00:07:11.270> heavy-duty<00:07:11.930> and<00:07:12.169> got

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 
it's a pretty pretty heavy-duty and got

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:16.230 
it's a pretty pretty heavy-duty and got
that<00:07:13.189> sitting<00:07:13.639> on<00:07:13.729> there<00:07:13.909> pretty<00:07:14.090> tight<00:07:14.180> so

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 
that sitting on there pretty tight so

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.570 
that sitting on there pretty tight so
pretty<00:07:16.840> good<00:07:18.690> that's<00:07:19.690> it<00:07:20.340> if<00:07:21.340> you<00:07:21.460> have<00:07:21.550> any

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:21.580 
pretty good that's it if you have any

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.690 
pretty good that's it if you have any
questions<00:07:22.000> let<00:07:22.150> me<00:07:22.180> know<00:07:22.270> Thanks
