hey Alex monetary power here and welcome
to<00:00:14.180> our<00:00:14.300> supercar<00:00:14.780> virtual<00:00:15.140> last<00:00:15.950> time<00:00:16.220> we

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
to our supercar virtual last time we

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.070 
to our supercar virtual last time we
made<00:00:16.730> some<00:00:16.940> improvements<00:00:17.510> to<00:00:17.600> our<00:00:17.720> chassis

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
made some improvements to our chassis

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.200 
made some improvements to our chassis
and<00:00:18.350> this<00:00:18.920> time<00:00:19.160> we're<00:00:19.550> making<00:00:19.820> some<00:00:20.029> more

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
and this time we're making some more

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.960 
and this time we're making some more
from<00:00:21.020> afar<00:00:21.380> there's<00:00:21.710> not<00:00:21.950> much<00:00:22.190> change<00:00:22.460> but

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
from afar there's not much change but

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.600 
from afar there's not much change but
the<00:00:23.090> devil<00:00:23.360> is<00:00:23.540> in<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:23.810> details

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
the devil is in the details

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.400 
the devil is in the details
the<00:00:25.610> car<00:00:25.850> was<00:00:26.060> raised<00:00:26.300> by<00:00:26.510> one<00:00:26.630> stop<00:00:26.900> so<00:00:27.290> that

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
the car was raised by one stop so that

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.659 
the car was raised by one stop so that
it<00:00:27.560> will<00:00:27.650> have<00:00:27.860> the<00:00:28.009> proper<00:00:28.310> right<00:00:28.460> height

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:28.669 
it will have the proper right height

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.540 
it will have the proper right height
when<00:00:29.029> its<00:00:29.360> final<00:00:29.630> weight<00:00:29.829> with<00:00:30.829> some<00:00:31.130> changes

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
when its final weight with some changes

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.550 
when its final weight with some changes
in<00:00:31.700> geometry<00:00:31.910> this<00:00:32.450> costs<00:00:32.900> some<00:00:33.170> bumps<00:00:33.500> here

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
in geometry this costs some bumps here

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.560 
in geometry this costs some bumps here
which<00:00:34.160> we<00:00:34.310> try<00:00:34.520> to<00:00:34.579> eliminate<00:00:34.850> by<00:00:35.270> the<00:00:35.329> next

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
which we try to eliminate by the next

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.080 
which we try to eliminate by the next
episode<00:00:35.960> I<00:00:36.310> replaced<00:00:37.310> the<00:00:37.579> front<00:00:37.700> strut

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
episode I replaced the front strut

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.850 
episode I replaced the front strut
towers<00:00:38.420> with<00:00:38.750> corn<00:00:38.989> pieces<00:00:39.380> because<00:00:39.739> the

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
towers with corn pieces because the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.890 
towers with corn pieces because the
Bionicle<00:00:40.310> parts<00:00:40.610> were<00:00:41.030> hard<00:00:41.300> to<00:00:41.480> find<00:00:41.720> on

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
Bionicle parts were hard to find on

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.540 
Bionicle parts were hard to find on
brick<00:00:42.079> link<00:00:42.290> and<00:00:42.470> I<00:00:42.980> think<00:00:43.190> it's<00:00:43.370> much<00:00:43.489> better

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
brick link and I think it's much better

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.000 
brick link and I think it's much better
now<00:00:43.879> the<00:00:44.600> firewall<00:00:45.079> has<00:00:45.440> also<00:00:45.739> been

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
now the firewall has also been

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.709 
now the firewall has also been
determined<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:46.910> this<00:00:47.059> gives<00:00:47.300> us<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:47.570> maximum

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
determined and this gives us the maximum

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.470 
determined and this gives us the maximum
dimensions<00:00:48.230> that<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:48.859> engine<00:00:49.190> can<00:00:49.370> have<00:00:49.579> it

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
dimensions that the engine can have it

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.500 
dimensions that the engine can have it
can<00:00:50.660> be<00:00:50.809> no<00:00:50.989> longer<00:00:51.320> than<00:00:51.590> 23<00:00:52.129> studs<00:00:52.399> as<00:00:52.640> long

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
can be no longer than 23 studs as long

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.509 
can be no longer than 23 studs as long
as<00:00:53.690> it's<00:00:53.870> an<00:00:53.989> inline<00:00:54.320> engine<00:00:54.649> and<00:00:54.800> it<00:00:55.190> will<00:00:55.370> be

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
as it's an inline engine and it will be

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:57.700 
as it's an inline engine and it will be
width<00:00:56.300> and<00:00:56.510> height<00:00:56.719> are<00:00:56.960> not<00:00:57.170> a<00:00:57.199> problem

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
width and height are not a problem

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.189 
width and height are not a problem
and<00:00:57.800> while<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:58.820> firewall<00:00:59.239> is<00:00:59.390> there<00:00:59.600> I<00:00:59.780> went

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
and while the firewall is there I went

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:01.959 
and while the firewall is there I went
ahead<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:00.500> also<00:01:01.070> added<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.519> steering<00:01:01.820> column

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
ahead and also added the steering column

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.600 
ahead and also added the steering column
the<00:01:02.870> rear<00:01:03.109> of<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.289> car<00:01:03.559> is<00:01:03.769> also<00:01:04.280> completely

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
the rear of the car is also completely

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.150 
the rear of the car is also completely
different<00:01:04.970> i<00:01:05.500> strengthened<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.710> swing<00:01:06.920> arms

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
different i strengthened the swing arms

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.280 
different i strengthened the swing arms
as<00:01:07.310> much<00:01:07.400> as<00:01:07.820> possible<00:01:08.000> and<00:01:08.360> I'm<00:01:08.930> fairly

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
as much as possible and I'm fairly

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.220 
as much as possible and I'm fairly
satisfied<00:01:09.800> by<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.190> result<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:11.810> rear<00:01:11.990> chassis

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
satisfied by the result the rear chassis

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.860 
satisfied by the result the rear chassis
is<00:01:12.710> also<00:01:13.400> completely<00:01:13.730> different<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:14.330> much

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
is also completely different and much

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.800 
is also completely different and much
closer<00:01:15.170> to<00:01:15.560> what<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:15.680> real<00:01:15.829> thing<00:01:16.189> looks<00:01:16.490> like

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
closer to what the real thing looks like

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.270 
closer to what the real thing looks like
there's<00:01:17.810> also<00:01:18.049> another<00:01:18.380> change<00:01:18.680> of<00:01:18.799> plans<00:01:19.040> I

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
there's also another change of plans I

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.880 
there's also another change of plans I
decided<00:01:20.240> that<00:01:20.540> this<00:01:20.840> car<00:01:21.110> will<00:01:21.320> be<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.470> touring

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
decided that this car will be a touring

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.490 
decided that this car will be a touring
just<00:01:22.520> like<00:01:22.670> my<00:01:22.820> car<00:01:23.030> you<00:01:23.869> can<00:01:24.020> see<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.320> grey

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
just like my car you can see the grey

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.530 
just like my car you can see the grey
bricks<00:01:24.710> on<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.100> chassis<00:01:25.280> which<00:01:25.759> mark<00:01:26.090> where

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
bricks on the chassis which mark where

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.660 
bricks on the chassis which mark where
the<00:01:26.570> approximate<00:01:27.200> locations<00:01:27.680> of<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:27.979> a<00:01:28.009> B<00:01:28.490> and

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
the approximate locations of the a B and

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.569 
the approximate locations of the a B and
C<00:01:28.820> pillars<00:01:29.119> are<00:01:29.360> so<00:01:30.290> in<00:01:30.439> the<00:01:30.530> next<00:01:30.649> episode<00:01:31.159> we

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
C pillars are so in the next episode we

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.690 
C pillars are so in the next episode we
will<00:01:31.610> probably<00:01:31.909> see<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.479> roof<00:01:32.630> taking<00:01:32.869> shape

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
will probably see the roof taking shape

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.100 
will probably see the roof taking shape
so<00:01:34.700> this<00:01:34.880> episode<00:01:35.119> was<00:01:35.689> all<00:01:35.930> about

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
so this episode was all about

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.830 
so this episode was all about
fine-tuning<00:01:36.710> in<00:01:36.799> the<00:01:36.890> car<00:01:37.070> as<00:01:37.280> it<00:01:38.000> is<00:01:38.119> now<00:01:38.270> you

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
fine-tuning in the car as it is now you

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.450 
fine-tuning in the car as it is now you
can<00:01:39.020> already<00:01:39.350> motorized<00:01:39.950> it<00:01:40.130> with<00:01:40.280> power

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
can already motorized it with power

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.490 
can already motorized it with power
functions<00:01:40.850> or<00:01:41.030> legal<00:01:41.420> RC<00:01:41.719> motors<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:42.259> have

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
functions or legal RC motors and have

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.190 
functions or legal RC motors and have
some<00:01:42.649> fun<00:01:42.860> with<00:01:43.009> it<00:01:43.130> as<00:01:43.219> always<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.899> pictures

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
some fun with it as always the pictures

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.840 
some fun with it as always the pictures
of<00:01:45.320> everything<00:01:45.619> we<00:01:45.829> made<00:01:45.979> today<00:01:46.250> are<00:01:46.460> in<00:01:46.759> the
