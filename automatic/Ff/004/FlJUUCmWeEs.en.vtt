okay I want to show you how to draw a
better<00:00:03.090> realistic<00:00:04.020> view<00:00:04.170> a<00:00:04.200> year<00:00:04.440> because<00:00:04.830> the

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
better realistic view a year because the

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:14.110 
better realistic view a year because the
other<00:00:05.339> one<00:00:05.549> is<00:00:05.730> basically<00:00:12.469> it's<00:00:13.469> kind<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.799> a

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
other one is basically it's kind of a

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:31.669 
other one is basically it's kind of a
weird<00:00:15.120> shaped<00:00:17.600> figure<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.630> guess<00:00:30.410> make<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.560> look

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
weird shaped figure I guess make it look

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.420 
weird shaped figure I guess make it look
like<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.070> 3d<00:00:34.610> and<00:00:35.610> then<00:00:36.950> make<00:00:37.950> those<00:00:38.129> circles

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
like it's 3d and then make those circles

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:46.279 
like it's 3d and then make those circles
around<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:40.160> inside<00:00:44.329> just<00:00:45.329> keep<00:00:45.570> going<00:00:46.020> till

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
around it inside just keep going till

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.810 
around it inside just keep going till
you<00:00:46.350> throw<00:00:47.010> most<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:49.399> you<00:00:50.399> don't<00:00:50.579> want<00:00:50.730> to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.570 

Tesla<00:01:47.880> takes<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.390> longest

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
Tesla takes the longest

00:01:50.580 --> 00:02:39.390 
Tesla takes the longest
we<00:01:51.120> gotta<00:01:51.360> carefully<00:01:51.870> told<00:01:52.080> everything

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.720 

mm-hmm<00:02:40.650> this<00:02:41.650> is<00:02:41.829> what<00:02:41.980> really<00:02:42.129> takes<00:02:42.489> the

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
mm-hmm this is what really takes the

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
mm-hmm this is what really takes the
most<00:02:42.909> time<00:02:44.849> work<00:02:45.849> though<00:02:46.239> you<00:02:46.390> get<00:02:46.510> really

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
most time work though you get really

00:02:46.750 --> 00:03:20.080 
most time work though you get really
cool

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.290 

mm<00:03:20.900> stick<00:03:21.560> on<00:03:21.800> it<00:03:21.830> and<00:03:24.670> you<00:03:25.670> can<00:03:25.849> see<00:03:26.090> how<00:03:26.180> it

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
mm stick on it and you can see how it

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:36.880 
mm stick on it and you can see how it
looks<00:03:26.480> like<00:03:26.599> a<00:03:26.660> media<00:03:27.080> now

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.990 

I<00:03:36.980> just<00:03:37.610> keep<00:03:37.790> going<00:03:38.000> all<00:03:38.300> in

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.790 

okay<00:03:43.780> now<00:03:44.440> comes<00:03:44.710> the<00:03:44.830> fun<00:03:45.040> part<00:03:46.530> drying<00:03:47.530> the

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
okay now comes the fun part drying the

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.360 
okay now comes the fun part drying the
flame

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
flame

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.470 
flame
the<00:03:48.970> only<00:03:49.300> difference<00:03:49.660> when<00:03:50.580> just<00:03:51.580> come<00:03:51.850> out<00:03:52.090> I

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.100 

just<00:03:55.480> make<00:03:55.660> a<00:03:55.690> series<00:03:56.230> of<00:03:59.670> don't<00:04:00.670> like<00:04:00.850> that

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
just make a series of don't like that

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.420 
just make a series of don't like that
come<00:04:02.110> over<00:04:02.320> here<00:04:02.590> and<00:04:02.710> do<00:04:02.830> the<00:04:02.890> same<00:04:02.950> exact

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
come over here and do the same exact

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:14.250 
come over here and do the same exact
thing<00:04:03.460> the<00:04:03.910> opposite

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:27.420 

until<00:04:15.040> you<00:04:15.129> come<00:04:15.370> up

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.159 

so<00:04:27.910> that's<00:04:28.060> basically<00:04:28.540> what<00:04:28.750> it's<00:04:28.930> going<00:04:28.960> to

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
so that's basically what it's going to

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.100 
so that's basically what it's going to
look<00:04:29.260> like<00:04:30.300> and<00:04:31.300> now<00:04:31.449> you<00:04:31.510> want<00:04:31.750> to<00:04:31.810> make<00:04:31.930> like

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
look like and now you want to make like

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:45.879 
look like and now you want to make like
a<00:04:32.199> bunch<00:04:32.410> of<00:04:32.500> squiggly<00:04:32.710> lines

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:56.129 

all<00:04:46.430> over<00:04:46.729> the<00:04:46.999> plane<00:04:47.620> so<00:04:52.360> you<00:04:53.360> throw<00:04:53.659> that<00:04:53.870> in

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.170

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
that fact adjust I practiced this a

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:06.939 
that fact adjust I practiced this a
couple<00:04:59.479> times<00:04:59.509> now<00:04:59.870> so<00:05:05.020> okay<00:05:06.020> so<00:05:06.229> now<00:05:06.680> you've

now you've okay so with these little
things<00:05:19.310> coming<00:05:19.909> out<00:05:20.000> of<00:05:20.120> the<00:05:20.210> flame<00:05:20.449> you<00:05:20.569> want

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
things coming out of the flame you want

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:32.890 
things coming out of the flame you want
to<00:05:20.810> make<00:05:20.930> them<00:05:21.080> a<00:05:21.110> little<00:05:21.289> Dorothy

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:44.320 

you<00:05:33.900> know<00:05:33.990> it<00:05:34.470> looks<00:05:34.650> a<00:05:34.770> lot<00:05:34.890> better

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.240 

just<00:05:44.960> keep<00:05:45.169> on<00:05:45.379> and<00:05:47.949> tell<00:05:48.949> you've<00:05:49.069> got

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
just keep on and tell you've got

00:05:49.250 --> 00:06:04.490 
just keep on and tell you've got
everything<00:05:49.580> every<00:05:50.569> single<00:05:50.870> wanted<00:05:51.139> it

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.380 

then<00:06:05.040> let's<00:06:05.280> pretty<00:06:05.490> much<00:06:05.640> it<00:06:05.820> and<00:06:06.060> we<00:06:06.150> just

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
then let's pretty much it and we just

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:17.030 
then let's pretty much it and we just
call<00:06:06.600> it<00:06:06.660> open<00:06:07.080> orange

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.040 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:41.570 

gonna<00:06:17.670> make<00:06:17.850> this<00:06:17.910> a<00:06:18.090> little<00:06:18.330> bit<00:06:18.750> later

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:48.469 

and<00:06:42.120> that's<00:06:42.300> basically<00:06:42.840> your<00:06:42.990> meteor<00:06:47.210> next<00:06:48.210> it

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 
and that's basically your meteor next it

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:51.139 
and that's basically your meteor next it
for<00:06:48.690> this<00:06:48.780> video
