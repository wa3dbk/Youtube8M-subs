00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
challenges remaining and we fought for

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.350 
challenges remaining and we fought for
fought<00:00:47.010> for<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.250> point<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.820> used<00:00:48.149> one<00:00:48.270> of

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
fought for the point and I used one of

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.639 
fought for the point and I used one of
my<00:00:48.450> challenges<00:00:48.660> when<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.050> thought<00:00:49.230> here<00:00:49.530> that

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
my challenges when I thought here that

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.380 
my challenges when I thought here that
out<00:00:49.770> ball<00:00:49.980> but<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.250> was<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.789> had<00:00:51.210> nothing

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
out ball but it was in and had nothing

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.939 
out ball but it was in and had nothing
left<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.899> challenge<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> match<00:00:52.710> point

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
left to challenge on the match point

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.250 
left to challenge on the match point
which<00:00:53.160> killed<00:00:53.430> me<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:53.850> uh<00:00:53.879> that's<00:00:54.750> my<00:00:54.899> fault<00:00:55.140> I

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
which killed me but uh that's my fault I

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.360 
which killed me but uh that's my fault I
guess<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.649> was<00:00:55.739> tough<00:00:55.920> for<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.100> umpire

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
guess and it was tough for the umpire

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.979 
guess and it was tough for the umpire
overall<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.120> mean<00:00:57.449> how<00:00:57.539> do<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.690> kind<00:00:57.870> of

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
overall that I mean how do you kind of

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.260 
overall that I mean how do you kind of
just<00:00:58.350> put<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.680> aside<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.039> just<00:00:59.789> sort<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.090> try

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
just put that aside and just sort of try

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.849 
just put that aside and just sort of try
and<00:01:00.359> concentrate<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.199> know<00:01:01.320> what<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.620> such

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
and concentrate on you know what is such

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.429 
and concentrate on you know what is such
an<00:01:02.010> epic<00:01:02.940> match<00:01:03.120> already<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.690> think<00:01:03.899> if<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.320> was

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
an epic match already I think if I was

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.780 
an epic match already I think if I was
feeling<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.799> little<00:01:04.949> better<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.309> probably<00:01:05.580> would

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
feeling a little better I probably would

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.039 
feeling a little better I probably would
have<00:01:05.880> used<00:01:05.970> more<00:01:06.150> mental<00:01:06.510> energy<00:01:06.840> getting

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
have used more mental energy getting

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.690 
have used more mental energy getting
angry<00:01:07.380> at<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> referee<00:01:07.860> but<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.189> was<00:01:08.280> pretty<00:01:08.430> I

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
angry at the referee but I was pretty I

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.160 
angry at the referee but I was pretty I
was<00:01:08.939> pretty<00:01:09.180> knackered<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.780> didn't<00:01:10.080> have

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
was pretty knackered so I didn't have

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.080 
was pretty knackered so I didn't have
didn't<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.130> much<00:01:11.280> left<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.790> kind<00:01:12.030> of

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
didn't have much left so I kind of

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.580 
didn't have much left so I kind of
thought<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.330> he's<00:01:12.720> not<00:01:12.900> going<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.080> change<00:01:13.320> it

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
thought I he's not going to change it

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.109 
thought I he's not going to change it
and<00:01:13.770> nothing's<00:01:14.159> gonna<00:01:14.310> change<00:01:14.549> now<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.060> I

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
and nothing's gonna change now so I

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.480 
and nothing's gonna change now so I
tried<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.390> regroup<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.290> I'm<00:01:16.770> getting<00:01:17.009> broken

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
tried to regroup and I'm getting broken

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.370 
tried to regroup and I'm getting broken
but<00:01:17.850> yeah<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.299> found<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.750> way<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.869> get<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.170> done<00:01:19.290> in

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
but yeah I found a way to get it done in

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.749 
but yeah I found a way to get it done in
table<00:01:19.619> rate<00:01:19.830> obviously<00:01:20.310> you're<00:01:20.610> so

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759
