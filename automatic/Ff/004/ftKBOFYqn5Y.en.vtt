00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
running over top of the eyeliner just to

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.110 
running over top of the eyeliner just to
kind<00:04:17.090> of<00:04:17.150> smoke<00:04:17.570> it<00:04:17.720> out<00:04:17.840> and<00:04:18.049> make<00:04:18.320> it<00:04:18.350> really

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
kind of smoke it out and make it really

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.969 
kind of smoke it out and make it really
really<00:04:20.120> dark<00:04:20.299> along<00:04:20.599> the<00:04:20.720> lash<00:04:20.870> line<00:04:21.169> and<00:04:21.440> then

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
really dark along the lash line and then

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.490 
really dark along the lash line and then
I'm<00:04:22.250> also<00:04:22.430> doing<00:04:22.759> that<00:04:22.849> on<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.300> bottom<00:04:23.840> lash

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
I'm also doing that on the bottom lash

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.680 
I'm also doing that on the bottom lash
line<00:04:24.530> as<00:04:24.949> well<00:04:25.250> and<00:04:25.520> blending<00:04:26.000> it<00:04:26.090> out<00:04:26.180> with<00:04:26.449> a

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
line as well and blending it out with a

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.390 
line as well and blending it out with a
little<00:04:26.960> brush<00:04:27.289> it's<00:04:27.770> actually<00:04:28.070> connected<00:04:28.220> to

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
little brush it's actually connected to

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.620 
little brush it's actually connected to
the<00:04:28.520> other<00:04:28.639> side<00:04:28.910> of<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.120> eye<00:04:29.150> shadow<00:04:29.449> which

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
the other side of the eye shadow which

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.230 
the other side of the eye shadow which
is<00:04:29.720> quite<00:04:29.930> handy<00:04:30.080> and<00:04:30.470> then<00:04:31.190> the<00:04:31.729> next<00:04:32.030> step<00:04:32.210> is

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
is quite handy and then the next step is

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.150 
is quite handy and then the next step is
to<00:04:32.479> take<00:04:32.630> a<00:04:32.690> black<00:04:33.110> eyeliner<00:04:33.500> and<00:04:33.740> my

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
to take a black eyeliner and my

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.100 
to take a black eyeliner and my
tightline<00:04:34.639> and<00:04:34.669> waterline<00:04:34.849> just<00:04:35.690> as<00:04:35.840> you

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
tightline and waterline just as you

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.020 
tightline and waterline just as you
normally<00:04:36.289> would<00:04:36.560> you<00:04:37.190> can<00:04:37.340> skip<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.699> step<00:04:37.940> if

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
normally would you can skip the step if

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.580 
normally would you can skip the step if
you<00:04:38.090> don't<00:04:38.270> want<00:04:38.419> to<00:04:38.509> be<00:04:38.599> as<00:04:38.750> intense<00:04:39.259> but<00:04:39.530> I

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
you don't want to be as intense but I

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.860 
you don't want to be as intense but I
really<00:04:39.919> wanted<00:04:40.160> it<00:04:40.310> to<00:04:40.370> be<00:04:40.460> super<00:04:41.030> super<00:04:41.300> smoky

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
really wanted it to be super super smoky

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.290 
really wanted it to be super super smoky
so<00:04:42.410> I'm<00:04:42.650> also<00:04:42.889> blending<00:04:43.490> that<00:04:43.759> out<00:04:43.940> a<00:04:44.030> little

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
so I'm also blending that out a little

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:52.540 
so I'm also blending that out a little
bit<00:04:44.539> as<00:04:44.720> well<00:04:50.830> just<00:04:51.830> a<00:04:51.979> little<00:04:52.280> bit<00:04:52.400> more

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
bit as well just a little bit more

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.820 
bit as well just a little bit more
layering<00:04:52.849> to<00:04:53.150> go<00:04:53.360> I'm<00:04:53.659> putting<00:04:54.080> on<00:04:54.199> some<00:04:54.620> more

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
layering to go I'm putting on some more

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.890 
layering to go I'm putting on some more
liquid<00:04:55.039> eyeliner<00:04:55.520> on<00:04:55.789> that<00:04:56.090> wing<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:56.539> then

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
liquid eyeliner on that wing and then

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.390 
liquid eyeliner on that wing and then
I'm<00:04:57.050> blending<00:04:57.289> it<00:04:57.560> out<00:04:57.650> with<00:04:57.710> a<00:04:58.039> blending

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
I'm blending it out with a blending

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.219 
I'm blending it out with a blending
brush<00:04:58.610> and<00:04:59.090> this<00:04:59.419> just<00:04:59.659> creates<00:04:59.990> a<00:05:00.199> really

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
brush and this just creates a really

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.010 
brush and this just creates a really
bold<00:05:00.949> defined<00:05:01.760> wing<00:05:02.030> I<00:05:02.210> really<00:05:02.539> like<00:05:02.690> how<00:05:02.870> it

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
bold defined wing I really like how it

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.920 
bold defined wing I really like how it
looks<00:05:03.289> so<00:05:03.949> just<00:05:04.639> do<00:05:04.789> that<00:05:04.820> or<00:05:05.210> skip<00:05:05.659> it<00:05:05.780> if<00:05:05.870> you

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
looks so just do that or skip it if you

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.779 
looks so just do that or skip it if you
don't<00:05:06.080> want<00:05:06.199> it<00:05:06.260> to<00:05:06.320> be<00:05:06.409> as<00:05:06.590> intense<00:05:06.949> as<00:05:07.220> always

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
don't want it to be as intense as always

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.089
