00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.029 
the dollar tree foam board at first I
was<00:00:13.469> having<00:00:13.769> some<00:00:14.330> durability<00:00:15.330> issues<00:00:16.039> I've

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
was having some durability issues I've

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.269 
was having some durability issues I've
got<00:00:17.310> about<00:00:17.460> 20<00:00:17.880> plus<00:00:18.630> flights<00:00:19.140> on<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.680> now<00:00:20.840> and

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
got about 20 plus flights on it now and

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.620 
got about 20 plus flights on it now and
basically<00:00:23.810> going<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.519> dual<00:00:26.519> ailerons<00:00:27.090> and

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
basically going to the dual ailerons and

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:35.660 
basically going to the dual ailerons and
the<00:00:27.720> single<00:00:28.439> elevator<00:00:28.800> setup<00:00:34.040> seems<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.370> have

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
the single elevator setup seems to have

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.020 
the single elevator setup seems to have
taken<00:00:36.570> care<00:00:36.870> meshes<00:00:37.410> with<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.649> tail<00:00:38.040> I'm<00:00:38.670> all

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
taken care meshes with the tail I'm all

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.100 
taken care meshes with the tail I'm all
this<00:00:39.210> ugly<00:00:39.570> tape<00:00:39.870> back<00:00:40.170> here<00:00:40.550> has<00:00:41.899> done<00:00:42.899> its

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
this ugly tape back here has done its

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.090 
this ugly tape back here has done its
purpose<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:45.410> haven't<00:00:46.410> had<00:00:46.530> any<00:00:46.710> troubles

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
purpose and haven't had any troubles

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.490 
purpose and haven't had any troubles
with<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.520> control<00:00:48.090> surfaces<00:00:48.629> breaking<00:00:49.110> on<00:00:49.260> me

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
with the control surfaces breaking on me

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.470 
with the control surfaces breaking on me
now<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.160> think<00:00:50.399> I've<00:00:50.700> kind<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.000> gotten<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.449> a

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
now so I think I've kind of gotten to a

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.229 
now so I think I've kind of gotten to a
point<00:00:51.750> with<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.170> plane<00:00:52.530> where<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.160> might<00:00:54.090> be

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
point with this plane where I might be

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.880 
point with this plane where I might be
able<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.449> just<00:00:54.629> take<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.989> out<00:00:55.110> flat<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.710> not

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
able to just take it out flat and not

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.240 
able to just take it out flat and not
have<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.250> patch<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.640> up<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:57.980> couple<00:00:58.980> of

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
have to patch it up a couple of

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.030 
have to patch it up a couple of
modifications<00:00:59.609> I<00:01:00.359> did<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:02.420> chewed<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:03.600> a

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
modifications I did I chewed up a

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.020 
modifications I did I chewed up a
propeller<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:05.489> our<00:01:05.760> petrol<00:01:06.240> matte<00:01:06.479> runway<00:01:08.030> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
propeller on our petrol matte runway the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.469 
propeller on our petrol matte runway the
propeller<00:01:10.310> just<00:01:11.310> comes<00:01:11.700> even<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
propeller just comes even with the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.740 
propeller just comes even with the
bottom<00:01:12.710> of<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.860> airplane<00:01:14.310> here<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.299> when<00:01:15.720> I

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
bottom of the airplane here and when I

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.230 
bottom of the airplane here and when I
flared<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.530> pretty<00:01:17.189> much<00:01:17.280> disintegrated<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
flared I pretty much disintegrated the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.640 
flared I pretty much disintegrated the
prop<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.810> added<00:01:19.140> these<00:01:19.259> little<00:01:20.030> foam<00:01:21.030> pads

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
prop so I added these little foam pads

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.580 
prop so I added these little foam pads
out<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.830> blue<00:01:23.009> car<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.970> two<00:01:24.270> pieces<00:01:24.750> thick<00:01:25.290> is

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
out of blue car just two pieces thick is

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.870 
out of blue car just two pieces thick is
all<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.159> took<00:01:26.540> to<00:01:27.540> kind<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.810> make<00:01:27.990> some<00:01:28.880> spacers

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
all it took to kind of make some spacers

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.340 
all it took to kind of make some spacers
for<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:31.759> runway<00:01:32.759> or<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.900> keep

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
for the runway or that you have to keep

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.609 
for the runway or that you have to keep
the<00:01:34.530> runway<00:01:34.860> from<00:01:34.920> tearing<00:01:35.430> up<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.670> propeller

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
the runway from tearing up the propeller

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.800 
the runway from tearing up the propeller
as<00:01:37.619> far<00:01:37.950> as<00:01:38.070> batteries<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:39.060> forgot<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.600> say

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
as far as batteries I forgot to say

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.230 
as far as batteries I forgot to say
something<00:01:39.840> about<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:41.659> I'm<00:01:42.659> running<00:01:43.049> at<00:01:44.240> 2203

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
something about that I'm running at 2203

here<00:01:48.720> up<00:01:48.960> basically<00:01:49.890> as<00:01:50.009> far<00:01:50.250> forward<00:01:50.610> as

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
here up basically as far forward as

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.730 
here up basically as far forward as
it'll<00:01:51.210> go<00:01:51.240> and

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
it'll go and

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:01.050 
it'll go and
I<00:01:53.799> also<00:01:54.369> flown<00:01:55.140> with<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:58.259> 1303<00:01:59.259> cell<00:02:00.060> mounted

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
I also flown with the 1303 cell mounted

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.710 
I also flown with the 1303 cell mounted
in<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.329> same<00:02:01.570> spot<00:02:02.280> gives<00:02:03.280> you<00:02:03.430> about<00:02:03.759> a

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
in the same spot gives you about a

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.760 
in the same spot gives you about a
little<00:02:05.350> more<00:02:05.710> fcg<00:02:07.170> makes<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.410> airplane<00:02:08.739> a

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
little more fcg makes the airplane a

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.330 
little more fcg makes the airplane a
little<00:02:09.190> more<00:02:09.369> responsive<00:02:10.769> still<00:02:11.769> flies<00:02:12.010> great

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
little more responsive still flies great

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.600 
little more responsive still flies great
though<00:02:12.700> flies<00:02:13.180> great<00:02:13.420> on<00:02:13.660> both<00:02:13.870> batteries

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
though flies great on both batteries

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.830 
though flies great on both batteries
quite<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.640> bit<00:02:15.819> of<00:02:15.910> weight<00:02:16.030> difference<00:02:16.480> between

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
quite a bit of weight difference between

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.910 
quite a bit of weight difference between
the<00:02:16.959> two<00:02:17.170> or<00:02:17.349> maybe<00:02:17.530> not<00:02:17.769> that<00:02:17.980> much<00:02:18.250> but

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
the two or maybe not that much but

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.990 
the two or maybe not that much but
anyway<00:02:20.920> I<00:02:21.340> hope<00:02:21.730> this<00:02:22.000> maybe<00:02:22.330> helps<00:02:22.870> out<00:02:24.000> with

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
anyway I hope this maybe helps out with

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.470 
anyway I hope this maybe helps out with
people<00:02:25.420> that<00:02:25.510> are<00:02:25.660> building<00:02:25.959> this<00:02:26.410> aircraft

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
people that are building this aircraft

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.600 
people that are building this aircraft
maybe<00:02:28.480> save<00:02:28.840> them<00:02:29.019> some<00:02:29.230> steps<00:02:29.860> at<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.340> flying

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
maybe save them some steps at the flying

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.519 
maybe save them some steps at the flying
field<00:02:32.100> have<00:02:33.100> fun
