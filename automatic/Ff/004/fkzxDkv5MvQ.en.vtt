00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
doing as a kid there is a lot of

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.510 
doing as a kid there is a lot of
planning<00:00:36.719> involved<00:00:36.960> if<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.800> start<00:00:38.129> painting<00:00:38.340> on

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
planning involved if I start painting on

planning involved if I start painting on
canvas<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:39.300> early<00:00:39.510> part<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.989> painting<00:00:40.230> is

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
canvas the early part of a painting is

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.440 
canvas the early part of a painting is
just<00:00:40.890> developing<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.460> concept<00:00:42.030> just

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
just developing the concept just

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.060 
just developing the concept just
thinking<00:00:42.780> about<00:00:42.930> what<00:00:43.379> kind<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.710> subject

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
thinking about what kind of subject

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.740 
thinking about what kind of subject
matter<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.370> would<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.910> try<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.450> pursue

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
matter I would like to try and pursue

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.139 
matter I would like to try and pursue
sort<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.320> doodling<00:00:46.739> rough<00:00:47.010> sketches<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.969> once

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
sort of doodling rough sketches and once

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.020 
sort of doodling rough sketches and once
I<00:00:48.570> decide<00:00:49.260> what<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.739> initial<00:00:50.070> concept<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.760> I

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
I decide what the initial concept is I

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.119 
I decide what the initial concept is I
spend<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.629> lot<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.840> time<00:00:52.170> doing<00:00:52.379> preparatory

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
spend a lot of time doing preparatory

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.670 
spend a lot of time doing preparatory
drawings<00:00:53.670> probably<00:00:54.300> about<00:00:54.539> 60%<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> time

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
drawings probably about 60% of the time

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.209 
drawings probably about 60% of the time
is<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.789> dry<00:00:57.480> preparation<00:00:58.379> stage<00:00:58.680> when<00:00:59.190> I

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
is in that dry preparation stage when I

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.430 
is in that dry preparation stage when I
sort<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.850> all<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.120> get<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> point<00:01:01.320> where

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
sort that all I get it to a point where

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.830 
sort that all I get it to a point where
I<00:01:01.590> have<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:02.160> drawing<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.789> shows<00:01:03.239> all<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.629> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
I have a drawing that shows all of the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.440 
I have a drawing that shows all of the
important<00:01:04.229> elements<00:01:04.739> drawing<00:01:05.070> an<00:01:05.280> outline

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
important elements drawing an outline

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.780 
important elements drawing an outline
and<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.540> transfer<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.200> onto<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:08.010> canvas<00:01:08.250> it's

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
and I transfer that onto the canvas it's

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.789 
and I transfer that onto the canvas it's
usually<00:01:09.060> about<00:01:09.330> three<00:01:09.750> weeks<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.229> do<00:01:10.650> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
usually about three weeks to do the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.550 
usually about three weeks to do the
painting<00:01:11.040> part<00:01:11.369> which<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:12.200> relatively<00:01:13.200> short

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
painting part which is relatively short

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.289 
painting part which is relatively short
compared<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.340> planning<00:01:14.729> part<00:01:14.880> but<00:01:15.119> it's

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
compared to the planning part but it's

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.880 
compared to the planning part but it's
kind<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.689> most<00:01:15.840> enjoyable<00:01:16.170> part<00:01:16.619> because

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
kind of the most enjoyable part because

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.230 
kind of the most enjoyable part because
it's<00:01:17.009> more<00:01:17.159> intuitive<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.790> don't<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.150> to

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
it's more intuitive I don't have to

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.999 
it's more intuitive I don't have to
agonize<00:01:18.570> quite<00:01:18.840> decisions<00:01:19.320> started<00:01:19.740> doing<00:01:19.890> my

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
agonize quite decisions started doing my

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.679 
agonize quite decisions started doing my
first<00:01:20.189> paintings<00:01:20.670> when<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.850> was<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> teenager<00:01:21.450> I

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
first paintings when I was a teenager I

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.270 
first paintings when I was a teenager I
think<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.080> was<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> moment<00:01:22.710> when<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:22.950> realized

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
think it was the moment when I realized

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.460 
think it was the moment when I realized
that<00:01:23.909> creating<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.869> painting<00:01:25.170> from<00:01:25.320> my

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
that creating a painting from my

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.830 
that creating a painting from my
imagination<00:01:25.740> seemed<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.700> create<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.360> window

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
imagination seemed to create a window

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.170 
imagination seemed to create a window
into<00:01:28.110> another<00:01:28.439> world<00:01:28.880> realizing<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.030> that's

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
into another world realizing that that's

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.330 
into another world realizing that that's
something<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.869> could<00:01:31.079> achieve<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.979> was

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
something that I could achieve that was

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.850 
something that I could achieve that was
the<00:01:32.579> moment<00:01:32.759> where<00:01:33.119> I

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
the moment where I

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.310 
the moment where I
we<00:01:33.950> felt<00:01:34.190> excited<00:01:34.730> and<00:01:35.570> I<00:01:35.630> just<00:01:35.900> went<00:01:36.080> from<00:01:36.230> one

these<00:02:21.709> sorts<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.070> things<00:02:22.130> I<00:02:22.490> wanted<00:02:22.850> to<00:02:22.910> do<00:02:23.090> a

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
these sorts of things I wanted to do a

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.720 
these sorts of things I wanted to do a
painting<00:02:23.420> that<00:02:24.200> connected<00:02:24.830> with<00:02:25.010> that<00:02:25.250> sense

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
painting that connected with that sense

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.640 
painting that connected with that sense
of<00:02:25.880> romance<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.480> longing<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.170> the

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
of romance and longing and the

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.500 
of romance and longing and the
connection<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.340> Seas<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.880> conception<00:02:29.480> of

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
connection to the Seas the conception of

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.850 
connection to the Seas the conception of
this<00:02:29.660> opinion<00:02:29.930> was<00:02:29.990> a<00:02:30.080> little<00:02:30.320> bit<00:02:30.470> different

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
this opinion was a little bit different

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.440 
this opinion was a little bit different
compared<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.310> some<00:02:31.459> of<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.640> others<00:02:31.880> I<00:02:32.120> felt

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
compared to some of the others I felt

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.970 
compared to some of the others I felt
like<00:02:32.630> it<00:02:32.810> almost<00:02:33.140> needed<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.560> element<00:02:33.920> of

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
like it almost needed the element of

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.500 
like it almost needed the element of
time<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.790> almost<00:02:34.910> like<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.300> could<00:02:35.420> have

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
time to it almost like it could have

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.420 
time to it almost like it could have
been<00:02:35.570> part<00:02:36.020> of<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.200> short<00:02:36.440> film<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:37.010> in<00:02:37.220> fact

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
been part of a short film and in fact

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.430 
been part of a short film and in fact
I've<00:02:37.580> actually<00:02:37.630> executed<00:02:38.630> a<00:02:38.810> couple<00:02:39.350> of

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
I've actually executed a couple of

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.500 
I've actually executed a couple of
paintings<00:02:39.800> based<00:02:40.220> on<00:02:40.459> this<00:02:40.580> concept<00:02:40.850> which

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
paintings based on this concept which

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.360 
paintings based on this concept which
occur<00:02:42.050> in<00:02:42.080> what<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:42.709> could<00:02:42.860> imagine<00:02:43.010> would<00:02:43.280> be

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
occur in what you could imagine would be

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.710 
occur in what you could imagine would be
a<00:02:43.400> few<00:02:43.640> moments<00:02:43.790> where<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:44.450> would<00:02:44.600> come

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
a few moments where you would come

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.660 
a few moments where you would come
across<00:02:45.140> this<00:02:45.440> scene<00:02:45.769> coming<00:02:46.130> up<00:02:46.280> onto<00:02:46.489> the

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
across this scene coming up onto the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.850 
across this scene coming up onto the
roof<00:02:46.850> there's<00:02:47.720> another<00:02:47.959> painting<00:02:48.620> where<00:02:48.739> I've

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
roof there's another painting where I've

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.500 
roof there's another painting where I've
done<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:49.250> where<00:02:49.610> it<00:02:49.910> moves<00:02:50.150> on<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:50.420> another

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
done it where it moves on to another

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.330 
done it where it moves on to another
point<00:02:50.989> of<00:02:51.080> view<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.530> ballast<00:02:51.920> rates<00:02:52.130> that

point of view the ballast rates that

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.740 
point of view the ballast rates that
seem<00:02:52.550> to<00:02:52.670> be<00:02:52.760> morphing<00:02:53.269> in<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.510> first

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
seem to be morphing in the first
