row I like to go up and down two rows so

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.389 
row I like to go up and down two rows so
here<00:01:35.890> we<00:01:35.979> go

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
here we go

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.040 
here we go
up<00:01:36.580> through<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:37.030> red<00:01:37.210> beads<00:01:39.660> pick<00:01:40.660> up<00:01:40.840> two

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
up through the red beads pick up two

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.639 
up through the red beads pick up two
beads<00:01:44.970> down<00:01:45.970> through<00:01:46.420> both<00:01:46.960> of<00:01:47.259> these<00:01:47.380> red

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
beads down through both of these red

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:54.700 
beads down through both of these red
beads

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.740 

and<00:01:55.250> sometimes<00:01:55.880> you'll<00:01:56.060> see<00:01:56.300> that<00:01:56.510> they'll

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
and sometimes you'll see that they'll

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.690 
and sometimes you'll see that they'll
twist<00:01:57.260> a<00:01:57.500> little<00:01:57.530> bit<00:01:57.860> on<00:01:58.010> the<00:01:58.250> promise

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
twist a little bit on the promise

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.480 
twist a little bit on the promise
reading<00:01:59.210> it<00:01:59.600> just<00:01:59.810> takes<00:02:00.020> a<00:02:00.140> little<00:02:00.230> bit<00:02:00.490> to

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
reading it just takes a little bit to

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.600 
reading it just takes a little bit to
get<00:02:01.610> them<00:02:01.820> to<00:02:01.940> sit<00:02:02.120> right<00:02:03.190> then<00:02:04.190> here<00:02:04.370> we<00:02:04.460> go

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
get them to sit right then here we go

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:12.190 
get them to sit right then here we go
again<00:02:04.760> up<00:02:05.570> smooth<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.920> green<00:02:07.190> beads<00:02:10.990> pick<00:02:11.990> up

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
again up smooth the green beads pick up

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.970 
again up smooth the green beads pick up
to<00:02:15.700> down<00:02:16.700> through<00:02:17.030> both<00:02:17.240> of<00:02:17.270> these<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:18.230> green

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
to down through both of these and green

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.550 
to down through both of these and green
beads<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.900> there<00:02:24.050> we<00:02:24.170> go

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
beads and there we go

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.330 
beads and there we go
now<00:02:24.709> I'm<00:02:24.830> going<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:24.980> flip<00:02:25.250> my<00:02:25.400> work<00:02:25.610> again<00:02:27.340> and

this end bead and that's how I make my
turn<00:02:52.430> I<00:02:52.840> know<00:02:53.840> some<00:02:54.200> people<00:02:54.470> do<00:02:54.590> it

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
turn I know some people do it

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.530 
turn I know some people do it
differently<00:02:55.130> but<00:02:55.430> that's<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:56.000> way<00:02:56.120> I<00:02:56.150> like<00:02:56.390> to

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
at this point again it's just picking up

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:10.240 
at this point again it's just picking up
two<00:03:03.110> beads<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:05.950> now<00:03:06.950> I<00:03:07.430> put<00:03:07.880> it<00:03:07.970> down<00:03:09.250> through

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
two beads and now I put it down through

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.320 
two beads and now I put it down through
just<00:03:10.549> one<00:03:10.880> bead

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.920 

okay<00:03:17.730> up<00:03:18.730> through<00:03:19.330> this<00:03:19.570> next<00:03:19.900> red<00:03:20.320> bead<00:03:21.930> there

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
okay up through this next red bead there

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
okay up through this next red bead there
we<00:03:23.020> go

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.190 

try<00:03:26.950> not<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.280> get<00:03:27.400> your<00:03:27.690> stop<00:03:28.690> bead<00:03:28.900> thread

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
try not to get your stop bead thread

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.430 
try not to get your stop bead thread
caught<00:03:29.530> up<00:03:29.680> in<00:03:29.860> there<00:03:30.840> okay<00:03:31.840> so<00:03:31.900> we're<00:03:32.350> gonna
