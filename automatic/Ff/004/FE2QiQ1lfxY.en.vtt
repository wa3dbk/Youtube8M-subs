ties<00:00:28.220> the<00:00:29.120> system<00:00:29.900> itself<00:00:30.200> is<00:00:30.440> very<00:00:30.560> simple<00:00:30.830> to

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.100 
ties the system itself is very simple to

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:38.799 
ties the system itself is very simple to
use<00:00:31.160> which<00:00:31.550> you<00:00:31.730> have<00:00:32.329> to<00:00:32.480> find<00:00:32.689> out<00:00:37.809> firstly

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
use which you have to find out firstly

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.239 
use which you have to find out firstly
you<00:00:39.079> what<00:00:39.199> you<00:00:39.289> need<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:39.559> do<00:00:39.679> is<00:00:39.769> cut<00:00:39.949> the<00:00:40.070> pack

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:40.249 
you what you need to do is cut the pack

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:44.010 
you what you need to do is cut the pack
-<00:00:40.460> as<00:00:41.390> I<00:00:41.539> said<00:00:41.690> it<00:00:41.809> comes<00:00:41.899> complete

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
- as I said it comes complete

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.120 
- as I said it comes complete
this<00:00:44.590> is<00:00:44.800> such<00:00:45.040> a<00:00:45.070> easy<00:00:45.610> system<00:00:46.330> to<00:00:46.390> use<00:00:47.130> you

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
this is such a easy system to use you

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.900 
this is such a easy system to use you
can<00:00:48.280> see<00:00:48.490> that<00:00:48.700> there<00:00:48.940> is<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:50.200> writing<00:00:50.910> there

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
can see that there is the writing there

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.850 
can see that there is the writing there
is<00:00:52.000> one<00:00:52.180> simple<00:00:52.540> rule<00:00:52.810> I'm<00:00:53.140> using<00:00:53.350> this<00:00:53.590> and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
is one simple rule I'm using this and

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.010 
is one simple rule I'm using this and
that<00:00:53.950> is<00:00:54.070> the<00:00:54.250> writing<00:00:54.460> space<00:00:54.850> to<00:00:55.060> the<00:00:55.180> top<00:00:55.780> on

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
that is the writing space to the top on

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.010 
that is the writing space to the top on
the<00:00:56.110> pipe<00:00:56.320> is<00:00:56.530> laid<00:00:57.150> all<00:00:58.150> the<00:00:58.510> is<00:00:58.660> also

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
the pipe is laid all the is also

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.500 
the pipe is laid all the is also
measured<00:00:59.350> so<00:01:00.250> you've<00:01:00.400> got<00:01:00.610> from<00:01:00.850> your

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
measured so you've got from your

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.690 
measured so you've got from your
measurements<00:01:01.960> on<00:01:02.110> the<00:01:02.200> pipette<00:01:02.650> and<00:01:02.920> you<00:01:03.550> can

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
measurements on the pipette and you can

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.640 
measurements on the pipette and you can
see<00:01:03.910> here<00:01:04.150> a<00:01:04.449> little<00:01:04.780> pair<00:01:05.020> of<00:01:05.050> scissors<00:01:05.470> where

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
see here a little pair of scissors where

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.970 
see here a little pair of scissors where
they<00:01:05.800> actually<00:01:06.490> cut<00:01:06.730> through<00:01:07.050> so<00:01:08.050> firstly<00:01:08.410> now

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
they actually cut through so firstly now

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.470 
they actually cut through so firstly now
we're<00:01:09.190> just<00:01:09.310> going<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.580> take<00:01:09.760> 10<00:01:10.030> meters<00:01:10.330> of

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 
we're just going to take 10 meters of

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.980 
we're just going to take 10 meters of
this<00:01:10.600> pot<00:01:12.750> will<00:01:13.750> you<00:01:13.840> do<00:01:13.930> is<00:01:14.080> follow<00:01:14.230> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
this pot will you do is follow the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:26.970 
this pot will you do is follow the
writing

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.160 

to<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.610> 10-meter<00:01:27.910> section<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:30.220> can<00:01:30.340> see<00:01:30.580> here

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
to the 10-meter section you can see here

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.450 
to the 10-meter section you can see here
there's<00:01:32.170> a<00:01:32.230> 10<00:01:32.440> meter<00:01:32.710> and<00:01:32.920> then<00:01:33.040> there<00:01:33.220> is<00:01:33.340> the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
there's a 10 meter and then there is the

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.170 
there's a 10 meter and then there is the
scissor<00:01:33.700> cut<00:01:34.360> they<00:01:35.290> just<00:01:35.500> take<00:01:35.680> a<00:01:35.710> sharp<00:01:36.040> knife

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:53.640 

cut<00:01:39.750> through<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.140> section

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.530 

now<00:01:54.650> I'm<00:01:54.710> thirsty<00:01:55.040> all<00:01:55.370> you<00:01:55.520> do<00:01:55.640> is<00:01:55.760> stop<00:01:56.330> in

it's fast efficient and save you a lot

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:06.309 
it's fast efficient and save you a lot
of<00:02:56.980> time<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.430> labor

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.589 

what<00:03:06.590> we<00:03:06.680> do<00:03:06.829> is<00:03:06.920> we<00:03:07.069> start<00:03:07.280> at<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.640> end<00:03:07.939> here

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
what we do is we start at the end here

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.259 
what we do is we start at the end here
and<00:03:08.870> this<00:03:09.590> is<00:03:09.739> a<00:03:09.769> flexibility<00:03:10.519> of<00:03:10.609> the<00:03:10.790> system

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
and this is a flexibility of the system

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.759 
and this is a flexibility of the system
all<00:03:12.260> you<00:03:12.379> need<00:03:12.560> do<00:03:12.739> is<00:03:12.879> pull<00:03:13.879> it<00:03:13.999> through<00:03:14.269> wrap

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
all you need do is pull it through wrap

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:34.390 
all you need do is pull it through wrap
it<00:03:15.769> around<00:03:17.799> and<00:03:18.799> lay<00:03:19.489> the<00:03:19.549> pipe

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.980 

as<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:35.550> can<00:03:35.670> see<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.060> simple<00:03:36.420> rule<00:03:36.600> is<00:03:36.750> to

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
as you can see the simple rule is to

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.680 
as you can see the simple rule is to
keep<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.460> to<00:03:38.460> mix<00:03:38.640> replenishment<00:03:39.270> writing<00:03:39.570> to

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
keep the to mix replenishment writing to
