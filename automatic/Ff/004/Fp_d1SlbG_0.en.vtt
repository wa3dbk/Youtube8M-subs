00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.229 
cut this into 8 equal pieces just cut it
into<00:02:58.829> fourths<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.340> then<00:02:59.549> cut<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.790> fourth<00:03:00.000> in

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
into fourths and then cut the fourth in

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.229 
into fourths and then cut the fourth in
half<00:03:00.720> so<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.140> have<00:03:01.260> 8<00:03:01.620> equal<00:03:01.860> pieces<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.849> then

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
half so you have 8 equal pieces and then

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.610 
half so you have 8 equal pieces and then
go<00:03:03.360> ahead<00:03:03.569> and<00:03:03.750> set<00:03:03.959> all<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.170> pieces<00:03:04.349> off

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.159 
ideal pretzel salts really cheap so
might<00:04:32.729> as<00:04:32.819> well<00:04:32.940> use<00:04:33.180> it<00:04:33.360> a<00:04:33.569> little<00:04:33.900> goes<00:04:34.139> a

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
might as well use it a little goes a

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.020 
might as well use it a little goes a
long<00:04:34.289> way<00:04:34.650> but<00:04:35.069> it<00:04:35.310> really<00:04:35.490> does<00:04:35.759> make<00:04:35.789> a

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
long way but it really does make a

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.360 
long way but it really does make a
difference<00:04:36.139> so<00:04:37.139> just<00:04:37.349> sprinkle<00:04:37.949> a<00:04:38.129> little<00:04:38.220> bit

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
difference so just sprinkle a little bit

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.040 
difference so just sprinkle a little bit
of<00:04:38.490> salt<00:04:38.699> on<00:04:38.879> the<00:04:39.030> top<00:04:39.180> of<00:04:39.360> each<00:04:39.539> one<00:04:39.599> of<00:04:39.900> these

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
of salt on the top of each one of these

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.300
