began<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.910> get<00:00:45.059> dark<00:00:45.450> um<00:00:46.399> goblet<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.430> fire<00:00:47.520> was

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
began to get dark um goblet of fire was

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.130 
began to get dark um goblet of fire was
pretty<00:00:48.180> dark<00:00:48.390> because<00:00:48.660> someone<00:00:48.989> actually

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
pretty dark because someone actually

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
where everything started going in a

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.540 
where everything started going in a
little<00:00:54.390> bit<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.809> dark<00:00:55.050> direction<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.739> it
