00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.989
 so 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.650
 2014 a new era for Formula 1 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.250
 for the first time in the history of 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.619
 the discipline 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.960
 the cars will be motorized by a 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.609
 hybrid powertrain 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.320
 extremely sophisticated using 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.320
 fuel and electrical energy 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.079
 much more than just a motor 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.210
 new generation thrusters associates 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.610
 a turbocharged combustion v6 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.680
 internal with powerful systems of 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.780
 energy recovery two generators 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.850
 electric recovers heat energy 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.120
 at the level of the exhaust gases as well 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.110
 that mechanical energy when braking 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.059
 the systems work so 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.860
 complementary throughout a large 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.420
 price the stables must find the right 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.949
 compromise between the two sources 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.629
 of energy both generators 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.729
 electric motors are coupled to 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.059
 turbo is perfectly integrated into the 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:01.059
 frame 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.940
 during the acceleration phase the 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.710
 internal combustion engine turns to 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.990
 full speed and the turbocharger 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.430
 reaches a rotation speed close 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.900
 and one hundred thousand rpm 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.600
 the energy recovery system 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.740
 thermal the mg an ax works 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.110
 then as a generator 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.030
 it harvests the energy generated by the 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.950
 exhaust whose single output is 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.560
 located in the central axis of the car 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.150
 this energy can then be preserved 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.909
 in the battery for use 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.130
 or transmitted to the system 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.369
 kinetic energy recovery 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.340
 the mg had to be connected to the crankshaft of the 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.160
 v6 the uca mg acts as a motor and 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.509
 delivers extra power 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.110
 when the pilot brakes after 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.479
 straight line 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.850
 the mg uca then goes into generator mode 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.830
 and recovers the energy dissipated during the 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.780
 braking stored in the battery 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.010
 it can then be used more 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.010
 late during the tour 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.910
 after a big braking the speeds of 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.250
 rotation of the motor and 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.170
 turbocharger drops sharply for 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.900
 avoid the response time of the turbo to the 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.330
 re-acceleration the m g us works 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.860
 as a motor and allows the turbo to 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.400
 keep a rotation speed 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.400
 optimal 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.630
 these complex energy exchanges are 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.290
 generated by control systems 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.210
 electronic 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.320
 However, some modes can is 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.960
 pilot operated 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.120
 they offer more flexibility for the 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.950
 racing strategy or well over 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.980
 power when attempting to 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.980
 overtaking 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.400
 very energy recovery system 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.770
 powerful restrictions on the 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.830
 fuel consumption and quantity 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.290
 embedded propellers 2014 are 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.650
 among the most effective in the world on the 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.650
 energy plan
