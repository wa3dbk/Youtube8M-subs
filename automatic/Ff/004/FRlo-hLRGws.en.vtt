00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.550
 Hey guys, "I'm just kidding 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.060
 City Council one year 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.449
 started a project which was called 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:26.800
 September 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.800
 I started with a few sketches 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.570
 and to Photoshop Gedöns, the topic is of course 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.710
 Percent of these two pictures 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.950
 and percent at first happig 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.670
 on the Internet as ever came up with the idea if you visited a bit and 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.329
 to have 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.220
 three times where that is quite interesting and indeed 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.670
 I have seen someone a square Paris Hilton and Hilton 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.660
 and the percent and then this in different colors illuminates that 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.070
 destroy so interesting 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.610
 this is partly from the desk and has about Zugspitze in 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.970
 Photoshop made 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.360
 and percent 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.890
 Bite more massive with dimensions of Oswald and pull so bring in 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.750
 Have landscape orientation 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.110
 and then I experimented a bit more colors bomb up to 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.660
 this result 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.660
 and I liked that pretty much 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.160
 Percent yes 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.100
 then 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.950
 that was old at my civil service 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.950
 I thought about Somalia and Yemen Obi 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.429
 and kids in practitioner markets Cooks after a few building materials 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.800
 to build this device 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.800
 to get it into the water and then a little bit more 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.470
 to have a nice lamp 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.290
 As I said the first sketches Datacenter made progress and then I had 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.670
 all at once the finished but already 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.230
 and percent yes 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.280
 the procedure was 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.960
 that I first 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.110
 around 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.390
 I had planned a few sketches 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.660
 deep down he 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.939
 to have looked at whether I want it knows now in white 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:15.629
 but I never thought black and white is better when dancing the contrast 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:16.759
 easier 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:21.729
 and blow dry if they do not turn off promis percent pretty interesting 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:22.539
 out 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:27.029
 I want to sell a stencil what they are 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:31.289
 Quite funny thing was because then when it was absolutely Woo 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:34.930
 have printed on several sheets of these 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.989
 and have cut out 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.739
 to the poster Mansour is 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.260
 can also introduce leads sometime 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.689
 it is supported then I have an apple 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.859
 suspended from these thin wooden panels 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:52.949
 with the jigsaw in the waistband, of course I do that with the template 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:54.619
 recorded 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:57.619
 very careful because the wood has been win 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:01.969
 then I have the centerpiece Plexiglas what everyone pull 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.649
 yes as 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:06.699
 Rhön translucent 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:07.869
 percent 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:11.359
 and there is to receive the reference and the St 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:12.949
 really shaky 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:14.870
 Numbers does light let through sec 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.099
 it is clear that it is necessary 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.359
 Once again there money I still have the needed 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.060
 and about the handling by blows so I have with Plexiglas 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:26.049
 concerned 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.510
 she is probably the Taliban 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.449
 Cook 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.209
 and built a greasing box 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.509
 by then I put the lamp, the whole thing took me then 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:38.359
 glued together 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:39.389
 and around 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.040
 the wood panel painted 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.299
 Black several times 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.299
 Yes 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.849
 it was overall pretty much a costly affair then I have 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.189
 still the fluorescent tube 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:52.319
 percent 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.389
 behind it 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.389
 tinkered and 

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:01.789
 then mounted on the wall 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:05.759
 so 

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:09.649
 and that helped 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:12.779
 Meier planned crazy projects from start to finish 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:14.129
 criticism 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.070
 I used it relatively long for Rapid had runtime barriers 

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:22.800
 maybe you like it as well as I do 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.409
 "It even shines that I rarely, but if it shines then it would be 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:30.330
 is always nice and beautiful 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.030
 for the tenth title 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.030
 what is coming now 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.100
 because once lust aloud Mocken 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.030
 Ahrensburg we have done APA 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:50.860
 percent
