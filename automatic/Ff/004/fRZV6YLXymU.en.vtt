00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.419 

hi<00:00:00.870> well<00:00:01.170> I'm<00:00:01.350> gonna<00:00:01.500> show<00:00:02.010> a<00:00:02.040> little<00:00:02.159> video

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
hi well I'm gonna show a little video

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.660 
hi well I'm gonna show a little video
here<00:00:02.909> on<00:00:03.120> how<00:00:03.750> I<00:00:03.780> sharp<00:00:04.500> and<00:00:04.770> there's<00:00:05.220> so<00:00:05.520> many

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
here on how I sharp and there's so many

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.900 
here on how I sharp and there's so many
ways<00:00:05.910> to<00:00:05.970> do<00:00:06.390> it<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:07.160> you<00:00:08.160> know<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.309> can't<00:00:08.730> say

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
ways to do it and you know I can't say

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.060 
ways to do it and you know I can't say
this<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.330> less<00:00:09.599> expensive<00:00:09.809> because<00:00:10.740> when<00:00:10.920> it

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
this is less expensive because when it

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.650 
this is less expensive because when it
started<00:00:11.460> out<00:00:11.639> it<00:00:11.849> might<00:00:12.000> have<00:00:12.179> been<00:00:12.300> because<00:00:12.480> I

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
started out it might have been because I

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.410 
started out it might have been because I
just<00:00:12.900> started<00:00:13.320> with<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.590> scary<00:00:13.920> sharp<00:00:14.420> but

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
just started with the scary sharp but

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.380 
just started with the scary sharp but
now<00:00:16.109> I've<00:00:16.350> added<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.980> diamond<00:00:17.520> things<00:00:17.880> and

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
now I've added the diamond things and

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.529 
now I've added the diamond things and
that<00:00:18.539> sort<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:18.960> thing<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.539> they're

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
that sort of thing and and so they're

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.200 
that sort of thing and and so they're
all<00:00:21.689> expensive<00:00:22.439> even<00:00:22.769> if<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.519> go<00:00:23.699> with<00:00:24.029> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
all expensive even if you go with the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.230 
all expensive even if you go with the
more<00:00:24.539> expensive<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.470> think<00:00:25.500> it's<00:00:25.800> like<00:00:26.240> torques

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
more expensive I think it's like torques

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.790 
more expensive I think it's like torques
or<00:00:27.510> something<00:00:27.930> like<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.439> know<00:00:28.529> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
or something like that you know the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.020 
or something like that you know the
where<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.939> wheels<00:00:30.179> turn<00:00:31.430> eventually<00:00:32.430> you

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
where the the wheels turn eventually you

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.180 
where the the wheels turn eventually you
can<00:00:33.180> get<00:00:33.360> five<00:00:33.660> six<00:00:33.930> hundred<00:00:34.110> dollars<00:00:34.680> into<00:00:35.070> it

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
can get five six hundred dollars into it

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.540 
can get five six hundred dollars into it
very<00:00:35.550> quickly<00:00:36.860> so<00:00:38.780> what<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.809> get<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
very quickly so what I get is is the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.430 
very quickly so what I get is is the
shelf<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.300> built<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.989> there's<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.290> video

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
shelf that I built that there's a video

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.740 
shelf that I built that there's a video
on<00:00:43.890> where<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.219> can<00:00:44.520> just<00:00:44.760> slide<00:00:45.059> these<00:00:45.420> things

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
on where I can just slide these things

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.150 
on where I can just slide these things
off

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
off

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.420 
off
I<00:00:47.219> moved<00:00:47.879> my<00:00:48.239> sharpening<00:00:48.930> station<00:00:49.350> over<00:00:50.190> there

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
I moved my sharpening station over there

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.350 
I moved my sharpening station over there
and<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.000> can<00:00:51.120> pull<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.390> off<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.699> that's<00:00:53.699> this

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
and I can pull it off and that's this

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.080 
and I can pull it off and that's this
right<00:00:54.690> here<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:56.190> here<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.520> have<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.760> drawer

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
that I use these were my original stones

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.789 
that I use these were my original stones
for<00:01:41.210> sharpening<00:01:42.210> those<00:01:42.540> are<00:01:42.810> really<00:01:43.649> not

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
for sharpening those are really not

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.870 
for sharpening those are really not
stones<00:01:44.159> those<00:01:44.490> are<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.570> diamond<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.880> they

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
stones those are the diamond and they

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.149 
stones those are the diamond and they
worked<00:01:48.060> really<00:01:48.149> well<00:01:48.420> but<00:01:49.290> they<00:01:49.560> only<00:01:49.740> went<00:01:49.979> up

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
worked really well but they only went up

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.830 
worked really well but they only went up
to<00:01:50.520> 750<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.930> they're<00:01:52.829> smaller<00:01:53.250> but<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:54.450> got<00:01:54.630> me

to 750 and they're smaller but it got me

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:04.300 
to 750 and they're smaller but it got me
going<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:57.020> now<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.079> use<00:01:58.850> this<00:01:59.850> Veritas

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
know that I'm on the second angle here

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.700 
know that I'm on the second angle here
and<00:02:24.780> I'm<00:02:25.560> on<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.160> 25<00:02:26.700> degree<00:02:27.680> mark<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.600> that's

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
and I'm on the 25 degree mark and that's

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.830 
and I'm on the 25 degree mark and that's
that's<00:02:31.710> how<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.250> remember<00:02:32.940> where<00:02:33.240> because<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:33.780> do

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
that's how I remember where because I do

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.210 
that's how I remember where because I do
different<00:02:34.380> different<00:02:34.800> ones<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:36.800> this<00:02:37.800> stone

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
different different ones and this stone

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.940 
different different ones and this stone
here<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:39.240> 220<00:02:39.870> on<00:02:39.960> one<00:02:40.140> side<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.650> think<00:02:40.740> it's

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
here is 220 on one side and I think it's

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.290 
here is 220 on one side and I think it's
325<00:02:41.640> on<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.970> other<00:02:42.120> then<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.560> go<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.580> 600

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
325 on the other then I go to the 600

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.590 
325 on the other then I go to the 600
and<00:02:45.630> 1200<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.830> those<00:02:47.340> work<00:02:47.730> really<00:02:48.090> well<00:02:48.360> in

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
and 1200 and those work really well in

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.330 
and 1200 and those work really well in
there<00:02:48.780> nice<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.050> big<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:50.070> they're<00:02:50.190> always

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
there nice and big and they're always

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:58.580 
there nice and big and they're always
flat<00:02:51.860> then<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:52.890> move<00:02:53.250> from<00:02:53.520> there<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:55.850> my<00:02:57.590> 1500

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
flat then I move from there to my 1500

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.360 
flat then I move from there to my 1500
because<00:02:59.580> I'm<00:02:59.760> already<00:02:59.940> at<00:03:00.300> 1200<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.950> then<00:03:02.340> I

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
because I'm already at 1200 and then I

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.670 
because I'm already at 1200 and then I
move<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.920> 2000<00:03:04.920> 2500<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.690> my<00:03:07.260> newest

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
move to 2000 2500 and my newest

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.170 
move to 2000 2500 and my newest
additions<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.850> a<00:03:09.560> 4000<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:10.770> an<00:03:11.010> 8000<00:03:11.940> and

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
additions is a 4000 and an 8000 and

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.640 
additions is a 4000 and an 8000 and
those<00:03:12.660> are<00:03:12.840> DMT<00:03:13.380> diamond<00:03:14.690> plates<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:16.110> then<00:03:16.620> I

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
those are DMT diamond plates and then I

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.550 
those are DMT diamond plates and then I
use<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.040> strop<00:03:17.550> that<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.000> made<00:03:18.330> at<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.750> piece<00:03:19.410> of

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
use a strop that I made at a piece of

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.420 
use a strop that I made at a piece of
wood<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:19.890> some<00:03:20.100> leather<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.720> use<00:03:21.930> this

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
wood and some leather and I use this

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.830 
wood and some leather and I use this
flex<00:03:23.430> cut<00:03:25.220> see<00:03:26.220> this<00:03:26.520> is<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:26.840> polishing

flex cut see this is a polishing

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.729 
flex cut see this is a polishing
compound<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.860> I<00:03:29.790> use<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.260> can<00:03:31.470> really

edge<00:04:09.030> back<00:04:09.360> on<00:04:09.660> them<00:04:09.840> starting<00:04:10.440> with<00:04:10.470> that

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
edge back on them starting with that

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.050 
edge back on them starting with that
very<00:04:11.310> quickly<00:04:11.670> and<00:04:13.250> the<00:04:14.250> reason<00:04:14.580> I'm<00:04:14.700> sharp

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
very quickly and the reason I'm sharp

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.580 
very quickly and the reason I'm sharp
I'm<00:04:15.239> sharpening<00:04:15.570> all<00:04:15.900> of<00:04:16.109> these<00:04:16.260> right<00:04:16.560> now

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
I'm sharpening all of these right now

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.470 
I'm sharpening all of these right now
normally<00:04:17.190> I<00:04:17.220> just<00:04:17.340> kind<00:04:17.790> of<00:04:17.850> remember<00:04:18.000> which

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
normally I just kind of remember which

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.870 
normally I just kind of remember which
ones<00:04:18.750> I<00:04:18.930> use<00:04:19.169> it<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.530> different<00:04:19.859> project<00:04:20.070> but<00:04:20.669> I

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
ones I use it a different project but I

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.130 
ones I use it a different project but I
made<00:04:21.299> a<00:04:21.330> mistake

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
made a mistake

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.960 
made a mistake
I<00:04:22.169> built<00:04:23.039> out<00:04:23.550> of<00:04:24.210> some<00:04:25.190> wood

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
I built out of some wood

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.000 
I built out of some wood
just<00:04:27.510> some<00:04:27.660> scrap<00:04:28.020> wood<00:04:28.610> these<00:04:30.530> blocks<00:04:31.530> to

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
just some scrap wood these blocks to

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.950 
just some scrap wood these blocks to
hold<00:04:32.250> my<00:04:34.340> chisels<00:04:35.340> and<00:04:36.000> they<00:04:36.510> work<00:04:36.720> really

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
hold my chisels and they work really

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.310 
hold my chisels and they work really
well<00:04:37.520> glue<00:04:38.520> them<00:04:38.700> together<00:04:38.880> and<00:04:39.450> then<00:04:39.660> sanded

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
well glue them together and then sanded

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.600 
well glue them together and then sanded
them<00:04:40.410> and<00:04:40.590> that<00:04:40.890> sort<00:04:41.130> of<00:04:41.190> thing

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
them and that sort of thing

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.890 
them and that sort of thing
that<00:04:41.940> way<00:04:42.060> I<00:04:42.090> don't<00:04:42.240> have<00:04:42.390> them<00:04:42.690> in<00:04:42.780> these

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
that way I don't have them in these

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.130 
that way I don't have them in these
boxes<00:04:43.350> here<00:04:44.340> and<00:04:44.490> I<00:04:45.390> would<00:04:45.570> never<00:04:45.750> pull<00:04:46.020> them

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
boxes here and I would never pull them

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.550 
boxes here and I would never pull them
out<00:04:46.260> so<00:04:46.590> I've<00:04:46.770> got<00:04:47.070> a<00:04:47.700> maple<00:04:48.660> one<00:04:48.900> and<00:04:49.380> there's

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
out so I've got a maple one and there's

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.890 
out so I've got a maple one and there's
some<00:04:49.860> some<00:04:50.370> of<00:04:50.490> some<00:04:51.060> leftover<00:04:51.570> some<00:04:51.750> other

some some of some leftover some other
kind<00:04:52.170> of<00:04:52.200> wood<00:04:52.380> back<00:04:52.620> there<00:04:52.980> that<00:04:53.610> I<00:04:53.670> put<00:04:53.910> those

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
kind of wood back there that I put those

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.900 
kind of wood back there that I put those
in<00:04:54.180> and<00:04:55.170> by<00:04:55.260> the<00:04:55.290> way<00:04:55.530> those<00:04:55.920> bent<00:04:56.280> chisels<00:04:56.760> I

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
in and by the way those bent chisels I

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.630 
in and by the way those bent chisels I
just<00:04:57.180> love<00:04:57.420> them<00:04:57.600> they're<00:04:57.930> great<00:04:58.350> for<00:04:58.860> I<00:04:59.100> don't

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
just love them they're great for I don't

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.720 
just love them they're great for I don't
I<00:04:59.940> don't<00:05:00.420> make<00:05:00.840> their<00:05:01.110> angles<00:05:01.650> steep<00:05:02.100> because

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
I don't make their angles steep because

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.250 
I don't make their angles steep because
I<00:05:03.180> use<00:05:03.960> them<00:05:04.170> especially<00:05:05.060> for<00:05:06.140> popping<00:05:07.140> out

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
I use them especially for popping out

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:14.000 
I use them especially for popping out
mortises<00:05:07.890> like<00:05:08.310> for<00:05:11.840> hinges<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.200> they're

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
mortises like for hinges and they're

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.680 
mortises like for hinges and they're
good<00:05:14.220> for<00:05:14.460> getting<00:05:14.640> glue<00:05:14.880> out<00:05:15.030> of<00:05:15.150> corners<00:05:15.510> and

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
good for getting glue out of corners and

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.540 
good for getting glue out of corners and
that<00:05:15.780> sort<00:05:16.080> of<00:05:16.140> thing<00:05:16.320> but<00:05:16.860> anyway<00:05:16.980> back<00:05:17.310> to<00:05:17.340> my

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
that sort of thing but anyway back to my

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.540 
that sort of thing but anyway back to my
mistake<00:05:18.060> when<00:05:18.600> I<00:05:18.630> glued<00:05:18.960> this<00:05:19.169> together<00:05:19.560> I<00:05:19.919> was

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
mistake when I glued this together I was

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.590 
mistake when I glued this together I was
so<00:05:20.669> anxious<00:05:20.910> to<00:05:21.150> put<00:05:21.540> my<00:05:22.880> bits<00:05:23.880> in<00:05:24.090> there<00:05:24.240> I

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
so anxious to put my bits in there I

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.300 
so anxious to put my bits in there I
gave<00:05:24.840> it<00:05:24.990> about<00:05:25.169> an<00:05:25.320> hour<00:05:25.440> so<00:05:25.860> it<00:05:26.010> was<00:05:26.040> all

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
gave it about an hour so it was all

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.680 
gave it about an hour so it was all
glued<00:05:26.580> together<00:05:26.760> I<00:05:27.030> sanded<00:05:27.510> it<00:05:27.630> and

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
glued together I sanded it and

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.880 
glued together I sanded it and
everything<00:05:28.200> and<00:05:28.380> then<00:05:28.590> I<00:05:28.830> put<00:05:29.700> my<00:05:30.590> chisels<00:05:31.590> in

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
everything and then I put my chisels in

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.310 
everything and then I put my chisels in
there<00:05:32.160> and<00:05:32.750> the<00:05:33.750> glue<00:05:34.260> and<00:05:35.160> I'll<00:05:35.250> show<00:05:35.490> you

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
there and the glue and I'll show you

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.780 
there and the glue and I'll show you
what's<00:05:37.320> happened<00:05:37.740> some<00:05:37.980> of<00:05:38.070> the<00:05:38.160> chisels<00:05:38.580> here

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
what's happened some of the chisels here

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.300 
what's happened some of the chisels here
the<00:05:39.000> glue<00:05:39.390> I<00:05:39.780> think<00:05:40.110> had<00:05:40.380> moisture<00:05:41.010> in<00:05:41.130> them

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
the glue I think had moisture in them

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:48.170 
the glue I think had moisture in them
and<00:05:41.570> it<00:05:44.270> see<00:05:45.270> that<00:05:45.510> that<00:05:45.900> rust<00:05:46.320> on<00:05:46.560> on<00:05:46.979> that<00:05:47.310> it

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
and it see that that rust on on that it

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.219 
and it see that that rust on on that it
rested<00:05:49.340> the<00:05:50.340> ends<00:05:50.760> so<00:05:50.940> I've<00:05:51.450> got<00:05:51.660> to<00:05:51.780> redo

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
rested the ends so I've got to redo

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.010 
rested the ends so I've got to redo
these<00:05:52.500> so<00:05:52.800> I'm<00:05:52.919> literally<00:05:53.430> starting<00:05:54.180> from

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
these so I'm literally starting from

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:02.810 
these so I'm literally starting from
scratch<00:05:56.270> to<00:05:57.270> do<00:05:57.450> it<00:05:57.660> and<00:05:59.960> anyway<00:06:00.960> so<00:06:01.520> I<00:06:02.520> think

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
scratch to do it and anyway so I think

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.510 
scratch to do it and anyway so I think
I'll<00:06:03.240> go<00:06:03.419> ahead<00:06:03.510> and<00:06:04.020> I'll<00:06:04.140> do<00:06:04.470> this<00:06:04.890> I've<00:06:05.190> just

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
I'll go ahead and I'll do this I've just

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.730 
I'll go ahead and I'll do this I've just
loaded<00:06:06.300> this<00:06:06.419> one<00:06:06.690> in<00:06:06.840> here<00:06:07.080> in<00:06:07.260> fact<00:06:07.440> maybe

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
loaded this one in here in fact maybe

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.219 
loaded this one in here in fact maybe
what<00:06:08.040> I'll<00:06:08.160> do<00:06:08.340> is<00:06:08.520> is<00:06:08.729> all<00:06:08.910> unload<00:06:09.419> it<00:06:09.630> and

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
what I'll do is is all unload it and

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:12.740 
what I'll do is is all unload it and
kind<00:06:10.530> of<00:06:10.590> reload<00:06:11.070> it<00:06:11.340> and<00:06:11.520> show<00:06:11.910> you<00:06:11.940> start<00:06:12.690> to

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
kind of reload it and show you start to

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.170 
kind of reload it and show you start to
finish<00:06:12.870> but<00:06:13.410> I'll<00:06:13.590> I'll<00:06:14.340> be<00:06:14.580> playing<00:06:14.910> this

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
finish but I'll I'll be playing this

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.550 
finish but I'll I'll be playing this
pretty<00:06:15.510> fast<00:06:15.840> so<00:06:16.530> I'll<00:06:17.040> speed<00:06:17.430> it<00:06:17.460> up<00:06:17.760> when

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
pretty fast so I'll speed it up when

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.650 
pretty fast so I'll speed it up when
when<00:06:19.560> I<00:06:19.590> get<00:06:19.860> it<00:06:19.979> on<00:06:20.040> the<00:06:20.100> computer<00:06:20.400> and<00:06:20.940> that

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
when I get it on the computer and that

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.270 
when I get it on the computer and that
way<00:06:21.810> you<00:06:21.870> don't<00:06:22.020> have<00:06:22.410> to<00:06:22.590> but<00:06:22.800> you<00:06:22.830> can<00:06:22.950> kind

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
way you don't have to but you can kind

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:19.789 
go ahead and and also that I do very

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:25.149 
go ahead and and also that I do very
similar<00:07:20.210> the<00:07:20.419> same<00:07:20.449> thing<00:07:20.990> like<00:07:21.379> with<00:07:21.620> my<00:07:24.159> my

00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:25.159 
similar the same thing like with my my

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:28.629 
similar the same thing like with my my
planes<00:07:25.520> my<00:07:26.000> hand<00:07:26.240> planes<00:07:26.569> and<00:07:27.250> you'll<00:07:28.250> notice

00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 
planes my hand planes and you'll notice

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:30.430 
planes my hand planes and you'll notice
like<00:07:28.759> maybe<00:07:29.360> kind<00:07:29.719> of<00:07:29.750> hard<00:07:29.960> to<00:07:29.990> see<00:07:30.199> but<00:07:30.229> you

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440 
like maybe kind of hard to see but you

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.610 
like maybe kind of hard to see but you
can<00:07:30.770> kind<00:07:31.069> of<00:07:31.190> see<00:07:31.490> in<00:07:31.879> this<00:07:32.270> hand<00:07:32.930> plane<00:07:33.259> you

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:33.620 
can kind of see in this hand plane you

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.830 
can kind of see in this hand plane you
see<00:07:33.800> I've<00:07:34.099> written<00:07:34.370> inside<00:07:34.729> on<00:07:35.360> the<00:07:35.599> blade

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840 
see I've written inside on the blade

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.100 
see I've written inside on the blade
itself<00:07:36.550> how<00:07:37.550> you<00:07:38.030> know<00:07:38.150> what<00:07:38.419> the<00:07:38.569> angle<00:07:38.719> is

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:39.110 
itself how you know what the angle is

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.980 
itself how you know what the angle is
and<00:07:39.169> and<00:07:39.680> what<00:07:40.250> number<00:07:40.580> I<00:07:40.610> put<00:07:40.940> it<00:07:41.090> on<00:07:41.210> so<00:07:41.629> and

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:41.990 
and and what number I put it on so and

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.110 
and and what number I put it on so and
they<00:07:42.259> seem<00:07:42.560> to<00:07:42.590> stay<00:07:42.919> on<00:07:43.099> there<00:07:43.310> very<00:07:43.340> well<00:07:43.759> so

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:44.120 
they seem to stay on there very well so

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.689 
they seem to stay on there very well so
works<00:07:44.659> pretty<00:07:44.870> good<00:07:44.990> but<00:07:45.680> anyway<00:07:45.770> I'll<00:07:46.550> go

00:07:46.689 --> 00:07:46.699 
works pretty good but anyway I'll go

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:48.640 
works pretty good but anyway I'll go
ahead<00:07:46.789> and<00:07:47.150> get<00:07:47.270> ready<00:07:47.419> to<00:07:47.599> set<00:07:47.810> up<00:07:47.840> here<00:07:48.409> and

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:48.650 
ahead and get ready to set up here and

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.260 
ahead and get ready to set up here and
then<00:07:48.889> we'll<00:07:49.039> kind<00:07:49.849> of<00:07:50.000> speed<00:07:50.449> it<00:07:50.630> up<00:07:50.810> as<00:07:50.990> we<00:07:51.199> go

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:52.270 
then we'll kind of speed it up as we go

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.270 
then we'll kind of speed it up as we go
Thanks
