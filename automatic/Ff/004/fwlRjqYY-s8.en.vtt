00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
like a perfect perfect size not too big

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.090 
like a perfect perfect size not too big
but<00:05:14.990> it's<00:05:15.140> big<00:05:15.289> enough<00:05:15.410> to<00:05:15.530> handle<00:05:15.860> just<00:05:15.919> about

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
but it's big enough to handle just about

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.380 
but it's big enough to handle just about
anything<00:05:16.370> you<00:05:16.490> can<00:05:16.580> throw<00:05:16.760> at<00:05:16.910> it<00:05:16.970> nice<00:05:17.180> and
