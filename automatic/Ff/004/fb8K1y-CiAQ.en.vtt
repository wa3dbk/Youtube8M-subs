 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.049
 gameplay in oran my room is 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.760
 messy and if I miss you seus is that 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.620
 lately I do not have much desire if 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.240
 we leave right 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.590
 Well, a boy named Alvaro who 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:21.119
 He has dedicated a good orchestra and a 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.340
 time without an orchestra and the truth is that it leaves 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.570
 rather dedicated a song with 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.080
 instruments are plan 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.880
 So I have not left the truth 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.489
 bowled over 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.070
 I know how to handle tears when I heard 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.100
 the first time he calls himself danger 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.590
 wonder in a social network of these for 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.660
 I could upload music and such and he told me that 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.690
 he played the piano and I loved 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.879
 dedicate this song of the wing world and 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.860
 apart it has also dedicated it to satoru 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.829
