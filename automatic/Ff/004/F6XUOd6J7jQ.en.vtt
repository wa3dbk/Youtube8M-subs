a very frequently asked question that I

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.700 
a very frequently asked question that I
get<00:00:02.399> is<00:00:02.700> is<00:00:03.389> using<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:03.929> friction<00:00:04.319> zone

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
get is is using the friction zone

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
just loosen two nuts on there you turn

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.799 
just loosen two nuts on there you turn
it<00:00:53.160> up<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.820> get<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> little<00:00:54.180> bit<00:00:54.329> more<00:00:54.510> play

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
it up and you get a little bit more play

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.660 
it up and you get a little bit more play
turn<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> opposite<00:00:55.949> way<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.489> get<00:00:56.640> a

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
turn it the opposite way you get a

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.189 
turn it the opposite way you get a
little<00:00:56.910> bit<00:00:57.030> less<00:00:57.239> play<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.780> clutch<00:00:57.989> I

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
little bit less play in the clutch I

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.770 
little bit less play in the clutch I
personally<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.129> have<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.609> clutch<00:00:59.910> or<00:01:00.539> a

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
personally like to have that clutch or a

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.080 
personally like to have that clutch or a
frisson<00:01:01.109> zone<00:01:01.440> grab<00:01:01.710> well<00:01:02.309> maybe<00:01:02.550> an<00:01:02.699> inch<00:01:02.910> and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
frisson zone grab well maybe an inch and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.060 
frisson zone grab well maybe an inch and
a<00:01:03.120> half<00:01:03.149> from<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> grip<00:01:03.930> some<00:01:04.470> people<00:01:04.769> like<00:01:04.920> it

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
a half from the grip some people like it

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.590 
a half from the grip some people like it
a<00:01:05.100> little<00:01:05.220> bit<00:01:05.400> further<00:01:05.640> out<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.970> feel<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
a little bit further out I feel that the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.840 
a little bit further out I feel that the
the<00:01:06.810> closer<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.530> grabs<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.100> better<00:01:08.490> because

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
the closer it grabs the better because

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.120 
the closer it grabs the better because
you've<00:01:09.030> got<00:01:09.240> much<00:01:10.200> more<00:01:10.229> dexterity<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.040> your

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
you've got much more dexterity in your

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.679 
you've got much more dexterity in your
hand<00:01:11.400> here<00:01:11.670> than<00:01:11.880> when<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.119> stretched<00:01:12.450> out

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
hand here than when it's stretched out

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.330 
hand here than when it's stretched out
if<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.470> find<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.799> while<00:01:14.010> you're<00:01:14.159> practicing

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
if you find that while you're practicing

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.060 
if you find that while you're practicing
these<00:01:14.760> maneuvers<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:16.080> friction<00:01:16.530> zone<00:01:16.560> starts

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
these maneuvers the friction zone starts

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.620 
these maneuvers the friction zone starts
to<00:01:17.189> move<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.580> other<00:01:17.700> words<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.090> clutch<00:01:18.270> starts

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
to move in other words the clutch starts

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.870 
to move in other words the clutch starts
to<00:01:18.750> grab<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> little<00:01:19.170> further<00:01:19.500> out<00:01:19.799> stop<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
to grab a little further out stop the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.370 
to grab a little further out stop the
bike<00:01:21.030> let<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.360> cool<00:01:21.479> down<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.750> little<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.200> then

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
bike let it cool down a little and then

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.020 
bike let it cool down a little and then
adjust<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.130> grabs<00:01:23.340> where<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.670> want<00:01:23.909> it

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
adjust it so it grabs where you want it

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.749 
adjust it so it grabs where you want it
at<00:01:24.180> times<00:01:24.869> especially<00:01:25.470> on<00:01:25.950> newer<00:01:26.159> Harley's<00:01:26.610> it

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
at times especially on newer Harley's it

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.340 
at times especially on newer Harley's it
seems<00:01:27.000> when<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> bikes<00:01:27.509> are<00:01:27.780> new<00:01:27.990> especially

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
seems when the bikes are new especially

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.620 
seems when the bikes are new especially
that<00:01:29.159> clutch<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.610> just<00:01:29.880> will<00:01:30.030> go<00:01:30.060> out<00:01:30.329> quite

the<00:01:48.180> stock<00:01:48.479> Harley<00:01:48.750> clutches<00:01:49.229> work<00:01:49.409> fine<00:01:49.710> to

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the stock Harley clutches work fine to

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.359 
the stock Harley clutches work fine to
learn<00:01:50.610> these<00:01:50.899> techniques<00:01:51.899> but<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.920> have<00:01:53.130> found

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
learn these techniques but I have found

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.039 
learn these techniques but I have found
on<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:53.850> particular<00:01:54.119> bike<00:01:54.479> we<00:01:54.689> use<00:01:54.869> as<00:01:55.020> a

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
on this particular bike we use as a

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.139 
on this particular bike we use as a
training<00:01:55.259> bike<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.799> put<00:01:56.070> more<00:01:56.250> than<00:01:56.399> 20<00:01:56.880> people

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
training bike I put more than 20 people

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.480 
training bike I put more than 20 people
on<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:57.570> bike<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:58.020> never<00:01:58.409> rode<00:01:58.680> before<00:01:58.890> they

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
on this bike that never rode before they

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.859 
on this bike that never rode before they
tend<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.820> be<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.000> little<00:02:00.240> rough<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.659> clutch

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
tend to be a little rough on the clutch

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.080 
tend to be a little rough on the clutch
so<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.350> replace<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.950> clutches<00:02:02.280> with<00:02:02.430> Barnet<00:02:02.909> a

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
so I replace the clutches with Barnet a

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.030 
so I replace the clutches with Barnet a
Barnet<00:02:03.780> makes<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.079> heavy-duty<00:02:04.350> clutch<00:02:04.799> and

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
Barnet makes a heavy-duty clutch and

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.590 
Barnet makes a heavy-duty clutch and
they<00:02:05.280> virtually<00:02:05.460> last<00:02:05.880> forever<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.329> haven't

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
they virtually last forever I haven't

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.760 
they virtually last forever I haven't
had<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.719> single<00:02:06.930> problem<00:02:07.380> with<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.560> clutch

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
had a single problem with the clutch

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.919 
had a single problem with the clutch
since<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.369> switched<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.759> bike<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.060> Barnet<00:02:09.450> now

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
since I switched the bike to Barnet now
