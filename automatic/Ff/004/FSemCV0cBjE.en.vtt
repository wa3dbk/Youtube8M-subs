 bear and bare hands 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.599

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.610
 us, we represent exactly Laplace 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.250

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.060
 go through so as not to stare at his 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.080
 the appearance of him would still in the hands of a panda give 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.250
 and a bottle of moonshine 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.380

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.230
 my autumn goes very well with him 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.269
 extravagant appearance I first do not 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.569

 his beard knows everything that he did not know 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.300
 English because when he tried 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.729
 at least how to speak English he 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:38.050
 seemed down some sort of hanged himself up 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:40.760

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.640

 like a footballer like an ordinary hunky 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.570

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.479
 grow a beard then it looks like a board eyelet 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.860
 but damn that's what it was like crap 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.389
 she approached him so strangely 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:04.430
 looked like a beard 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:06.910
 very similar to Zeus, then this 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.180
