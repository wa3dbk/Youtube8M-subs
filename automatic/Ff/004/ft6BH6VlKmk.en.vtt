 in the production of cellular concrete 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.890
 sand anhydride is used not extinguished 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.420
 lime and cement as a binder 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.060
 aluminum powder or fasting as 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.039
 gas generator and water sand 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.320
 makes up most of the raw mass 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.460
 lime cement are responsible for strength 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.710
 finished products 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.810
 aluminum powder post promotes 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.150
 fermentation and pore formation 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.339
 accurate recipe selection has 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.219
 decisive influence on the properties of the final 

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:38.289
 products and its quality at the plant 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:40.269
 wall materials Kuban production 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.679
 cellular concrete is carried out with 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.829
 using German equipment 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:46.659
 manufacturer 's cable systems completely 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.389
 automated production line 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:51.370
 vkb guarantee production of 300 thousand 

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:55.109
 cubic meters of high quality 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.109
 cellular concrete blocks per year 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.030
 the sand is fine before the subsequent processing 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.519
 crushed into wet mills and 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.440
 mixed with water for each process 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.870
 mixing raw materials are served 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.100
 separately in weight tanks 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.900
 and then come in strictly established 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.150
 sequences into mixing 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.420
 setting where they don't mix in 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.950
 homogeneous mixture 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.229
 certain amount and pure concrete 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.979
 the mixture is fed from the mixing plant 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.570
 pre-lubricated fill 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.520
 maturation occurs at exactly 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.350
 certain temperatures in heat 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.690
 camera for two and a half three 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.390
 hours in order to increase the volume and 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.060
 setting the mass in this way is cellular 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.310
 concrete is 80 percent air 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.220
 and only on the groove and percent of solid 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.500
 particulate filler forms vkb specifically 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.470
 designed for gentle and high quality 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.910
 separation of the raw array from the form 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.009
 connection and disconnection of the bottom and sides 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.229
 forms carried portal 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.270
 setting the raw array 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.610
 moves very carefully what 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.120
 eliminates the appearance of damage which 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.590
 visible only after autoclaving blog 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.430
 currently the array is sufficient 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.200
 is soft 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.510
 so it can be calibrated and 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:20.730
 sliced ​​into a block of desired formats without 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:23.340
 special effort line cutting century into the target 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.280
 one guarantees excellent cutting quality 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.410
 and consists of the following nodes 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:33.120
 pre-abruptly 2 tilter a 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.140
 horizontal and vertical calibration 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.120
 cutting 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.890
 on the site pre sharp and 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.500
 horizontal array 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.750
 cut off the roughness of the array after 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.970
 of this array of cellular concrete with 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.709
 tilter and turns over 90 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.540
 degrees and set vertically 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.820
 chop and flax pan 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.880
 on calibration trimmed tank 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.170
 vertically located array 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.870
 cutting long blocks and 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.790
 grooves and ridges are applied on the plot 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.770
 horizontal cutting height is cut 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.540
 pneumatically tensioned block 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.450
 horizontal metal strings 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.730
 cuttings are angled from 0 to 60 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.750
 degrees it guarantees the output of strings without 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.610
 damage to the array stretched string 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.769
 vertical cutting located in 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.030
 depending on the format of the blocks moving in 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.400
 opposite direction 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.100
 associated movements they pass 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.880
 through the array from top to bottom slicing at 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.590
 this block width in the conclusion 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.299
 carried out trimming the back and 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.530
 front of the array 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.709
 pruning served on installation 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.299
 use of return sludge 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.870
 arrest if necessary 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.609
 grippers vacuum suction cutter 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.099
 hold the top under the carved layer 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.620
 a crust which later falls into the pit 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.460
 and using a scraper conveyor 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.320
 served again production 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.690
 during the second canting process 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.790
 array flips 90 degrees 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.100
 real autoclave then 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.310
 autoclave sweat by capturing 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.810
 is placed on the car of the main car and 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.480
 moves to the site autoclaving 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.610
 through the friction wheels loading and 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.650
 autoclave unloading is carried out with 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.620
 using an electric transmission bridge 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.739
 autoclave marks 18 arrays 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.300
 concrete autoclaving process 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:21.000
 occurs at a pressure of 12 bart and 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.360
 temperature of 190 degrees with 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.800
 cellular concrete gains final 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.230
 physical and chemical characteristics complete 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.540
 the autoclaving process continues 12 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.850
 hours after the autoclaving process 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.860
 cars main pallets removed from cars 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.990
 main trolley using the portal 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.120
 grapple plants and transported 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.800
 to the third tilter at the portal 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.840
 setting to move the whole package 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.890
 solidified blocks with auto main 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.990
 trolleys on tilter next step 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.120
 the second package with blocks is placed on 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.220
 first and the tilter turns them over 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.800
 90 degrees on wooden pallets 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.680
 wooden pallets with blocks one by one 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.270
 served on the installation of packaging 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.509
 here the blocks are wrapped in film 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.509
 stretch 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.470
 bags of cellular concrete 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.979
 transported by 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.810
 forklift to warehouse 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.699
