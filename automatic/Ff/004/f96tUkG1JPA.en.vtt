kilometres away and typically you do

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.250 
kilometres away and typically you do
exactly<00:00:37.250> what<00:00:37.700> you're<00:00:37.910> seeing<00:00:38.149> here<00:00:38.330> get<00:00:39.230> up

and you hop on your track and you go a
long<00:00:46.970> long<00:00:47.000> way<00:00:47.740> this<00:00:48.740> particular<00:00:49.130> journey

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
long long way this particular journey

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.270 
long long way this particular journey
takes<00:00:50.210> about<00:00:50.480> just<00:00:51.440> under<00:00:51.650> three<00:00:52.070> minutes

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
takes about just under three minutes

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.970 
takes about just under three minutes
around<00:00:52.610> two<00:00:53.090> minutes<00:00:53.420> and<00:00:53.570> 50<00:00:53.989> seconds<00:00:54.500> which

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
around two minutes and 50 seconds which

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.440 
around two minutes and 50 seconds which
is<00:00:55.100> a<00:00:55.130> fairly<00:00:55.430> long<00:00:55.670> time<00:00:55.940> in<00:00:56.120> a<00:00:56.180> lot<00:00:56.210> of

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
is a fairly long time in a lot of

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.090 
is a fairly long time in a lot of
downtime<00:00:56.690> if<00:00:57.140> you're<00:00:57.260> going<00:00:57.440> backwards<00:00:57.710> and

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
downtime if you're going backwards and

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.620 
downtime if you're going backwards and
forwards<00:00:58.360> well<00:00:59.360> there<00:01:00.170> is<00:01:00.350> a<00:01:00.380> faster<00:01:01.040> way<00:01:01.220> and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
forwards well there is a faster way and

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.780 
forwards well there is a faster way and
I'm<00:01:02.630> gonna<00:01:02.870> show<00:01:03.110> it<00:01:03.140> to<00:01:03.290> you<00:01:03.470> here<00:01:03.980> but<00:01:04.129> first

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
I'm gonna show it to you here but first

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.510 
I'm gonna show it to you here but first
we'll<00:01:05.540> just<00:01:05.750> have<00:01:05.899> a<00:01:05.930> look<00:01:06.170> at<00:01:06.259> a<00:01:06.290> map<00:01:06.619> so<00:01:07.460> you

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
we'll just have a look at a map so you

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.340 
we'll just have a look at a map so you
can<00:01:07.729> get<00:01:07.850> an<00:01:07.939> idea<00:01:08.030> of<00:01:08.540> what<00:01:08.720> we're<00:01:08.899> doing<00:01:09.049> and

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
can get an idea of what we're doing and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.889 
can get an idea of what we're doing and
where<00:01:09.530> we're<00:01:09.710> going

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
where we're going

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:15.099 
where we're going
okay<00:01:11.899> now<00:01:12.170> spawns<00:01:12.740> up<00:01:12.979> here<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:13.719> down<00:01:14.719> here<00:01:15.020> is

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:15.109 
okay now spawns up here and down here is

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:16.569 
okay now spawns up here and down here is
a<00:01:15.139> little<00:01:15.409> farm<00:01:15.679> and<00:01:15.889> that's<00:01:16.009> where<00:01:16.219> we'll<00:01:16.399> be

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
a little farm and that's where we'll be

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.190 
a little farm and that's where we'll be
starting<00:01:16.909> we'll<00:01:17.420> have<00:01:17.509> a<00:01:17.569> quick<00:01:17.749> look<00:01:17.899> at<00:01:18.049> that

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
starting we'll have a quick look at that

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.419 
starting we'll have a quick look at that
you<00:01:18.560> can<00:01:18.679> see<00:01:18.859> the<00:01:18.979> portal<00:01:19.399> there<00:01:19.549> and<00:01:20.709> if<00:01:21.709> we

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
you can see the portal there and if we

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:24.219 
you can see the portal there and if we
zoom<00:01:22.700> out<00:01:22.880> a<00:01:22.939> little<00:01:23.060> bit<00:01:23.299> we're<00:01:23.869> going<00:01:23.990> to<00:01:24.079> go

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
zoom out a little bit we're going to go

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.459 
zoom out a little bit we're going to go
all<00:01:24.679> the<00:01:25.159> way<00:01:25.189> down<00:01:25.850> here<00:01:26.420> to<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:26.990> closest

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 
all the way down here to the closest

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:31.179 
all the way down here to the closest
jungle<00:01:27.889> biome<00:01:28.130> as<00:01:28.520> I<00:01:29.179> said<00:01:29.450> about<00:01:29.979> 7500<00:01:30.979> blocks

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
jungle biome as I said about 7500 blocks

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.109 
jungle biome as I said about 7500 blocks
away<00:01:31.369> in<00:01:31.639> the<00:01:31.670> overworld<00:01:33.520> now<00:01:34.520> if<00:01:34.639> we<00:01:34.880> look<00:01:34.999> at

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
away in the overworld now if we look at

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.599 
away in the overworld now if we look at
that<00:01:35.299> map<00:01:35.600> again<00:01:35.630> you<00:01:36.619> can<00:01:36.799> see<00:01:37.069> the<00:01:37.279> journey

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
that map again you can see the journey

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.760 
that map again you can see the journey
that<00:01:37.909> we<00:01:38.090> took<00:01:38.329> on<00:01:38.539> the<00:01:38.659> minecart<00:01:39.229> shown<00:01:39.560> in

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
that we took on the minecart shown in

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.289 
that we took on the minecart shown in
red<00:01:39.979> here<00:01:41.139> now<00:01:42.189> we're<00:01:43.189> gonna<00:01:43.369> do<00:01:43.609> it<00:01:43.759> this<00:01:43.999> way

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
red here now we're gonna do it this way

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.849 
red here now we're gonna do it this way
as<00:01:45.729> shown<00:01:46.729> in<00:01:46.759> purple<00:01:47.359> here<00:01:47.869> we<00:01:48.469> won't<00:01:48.679> be

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:48.859 
as shown in purple here we won't be

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:51.160 
as shown in purple here we won't be
digging<00:01:49.189> any<00:01:49.340> tunnels<00:01:49.639> laying<00:01:50.329> any<00:01:50.569> tracks<00:01:50.959> or

using<00:01:51.740> any<00:01:51.829> mine<00:01:52.130> carts<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:53.020> we'll<00:01:54.020> be

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:54.139 
using any mine carts and we'll be

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:56.349 
using any mine carts and we'll be
shaving<00:01:54.619> off<00:01:54.770> probably<00:01:55.310> a<00:01:55.340> whole<00:01:55.729> minute<00:01:56.209> off

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
shaving off probably a whole minute off

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:01.569 
shaving off probably a whole minute off
the<00:01:56.659> transport<00:01:57.289> time<00:01:57.560> that's<00:01:58.459> 30%<00:01:59.060> faster<00:02:00.579> to

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
the transport time that's 30% faster to

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.819 
the transport time that's 30% faster to
begin<00:02:01.909> our<00:02:02.060> journey<00:02:02.090> we<00:02:03.079> need<00:02:03.319> to<00:02:03.439> go<00:02:03.590> back<00:02:03.770> to

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
begin our journey we need to go back to

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.999 
begin our journey we need to go back to
our<00:02:04.099> little<00:02:04.310> farm<00:02:04.700> here<00:02:05.149> and<00:02:05.719> I'd<00:02:06.409> like<00:02:06.439> to<00:02:06.649> say

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
our little farm here and I'd like to say

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.040 
our little farm here and I'd like to say
that<00:02:07.249> there's<00:02:07.399> no<00:02:07.669> camera<00:02:08.390> or<00:02:08.539> editing

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
that there's no camera or editing

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.010 
that there's no camera or editing
trickery<00:02:09.470> here<00:02:09.830> it's<00:02:10.250> very<00:02:10.550> straightforward

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
trickery here it's very straightforward

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.180 
trickery here it's very straightforward
we're<00:02:12.020> just<00:02:12.200> going<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.440> change<00:02:12.709> back<00:02:13.010> into

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190

made easier and faster now we've just

done so in summary there are some

disadvantages to this method the first
one<00:03:23.110> being<00:03:23.380> that<00:03:23.680> no<00:03:24.310> other<00:03:24.519> portals<00:03:25.269> can<00:03:26.080> be

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
overworld portals and roughly around 128

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.610 
overworld portals and roughly around 128
meters<00:03:33.070> of<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.970> nether<00:03:34.209> portals<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:35.080> there's

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
meters of the nether portals and there's

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.140 
meters of the nether portals and there's
ways<00:03:35.769> of<00:03:36.010> getting<00:03:36.280> around<00:03:36.370> this<00:03:36.850> with

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
ways of getting around this with

ways of getting around this with
self-extinguishing<00:03:38.019> portals<00:03:38.620> etc<00:03:39.190> but<00:03:39.550> gets

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
self-extinguishing portals etc but gets

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.070 
self-extinguishing portals etc but gets
fairly<00:03:40.150> complicated

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
fairly complicated

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.890 
fairly complicated
I<00:03:41.110> should<00:03:41.800> also<00:03:41.950> probably<00:03:42.670> say<00:03:42.940> that<00:03:43.630> a

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
I should also probably say that a

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.490 
I should also probably say that a
jumpring<00:03:44.890> ice<00:03:45.070> block<00:03:45.580> slipway<00:03:46.390> transport<00:03:47.230> in

jumpring ice block slipway transport in
the<00:03:47.769> nether<00:03:47.980> is<00:03:48.750> probably<00:03:49.750> a<00:03:49.840> contender<00:03:50.500> for

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
the nether is probably a contender for

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.680 
the nether is probably a contender for
being<00:03:50.890> faster<00:03:51.400> than<00:03:51.549> this<00:03:51.730> but<00:03:52.450> if<00:03:52.570> you've

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
being faster than this but if you've

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.690 
being faster than this but if you've
ever<00:03:52.900> used<00:03:52.989> one<00:03:53.560> you'll<00:03:54.100> know<00:03:54.310> that<00:03:54.340> it's

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
ever used one you'll know that it's

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.660 
ever used one you'll know that it's
pretty<00:03:55.000> darn<00:03:55.299> inconvenient<00:03:56.170> and<00:03:56.519> here<00:03:57.519> we<00:03:57.640> are

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
pretty darn inconvenient and here we are

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:04.380 
pretty darn inconvenient and here we are
at<00:03:58.060> our<00:03:58.120> destination<00:03:59.100> the<00:04:00.100> jungle<00:04:00.610> biome<00:04:03.390> so

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
at our destination the jungle biome so

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.580 
at our destination the jungle biome so
there<00:04:04.600> you<00:04:04.750> have<00:04:04.780> it<00:04:04.959> folks

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
there you have it folks

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.000 
there you have it folks
I<00:04:05.739> just<00:04:06.489> wanted<00:04:06.790> to<00:04:06.910> show<00:04:07.150> you<00:04:07.180> a<00:04:07.390> fairly

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
I just wanted to show you a fairly

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.280 
I just wanted to show you a fairly
underutilized<00:04:09.010> use<00:04:09.700> of<00:04:10.030> nether<00:04:10.330> portals<00:04:10.930> that

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
underutilized use of nether portals that

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.620 
underutilized use of nether portals that
has<00:04:11.500> real<00:04:11.799> potential<00:04:12.280> especially<00:04:13.180> when<00:04:13.540> you

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
has real potential especially when you

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.240 
has real potential especially when you
start<00:04:13.900> thinking<00:04:14.110> about<00:04:14.320> different<00:04:14.680> ways<00:04:15.010> they

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
start thinking about different ways they

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.070 
start thinking about different ways they
can<00:04:15.280> be<00:04:15.489> used<00:04:15.640> and<00:04:16.239> self-extinguishing

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
can be used and self-extinguishing

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.979 
can be used and self-extinguishing
portals<00:04:17.739> as<00:04:17.890> I<00:04:18.040> previously<00:04:18.370> mentioned<00:04:18.790> it<00:04:19.630> can

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
portals as I previously mentioned it can

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.340 
portals as I previously mentioned it can
really<00:04:20.380> be<00:04:20.859> a<00:04:21.100> terrific<00:04:21.640> and<00:04:22.270> novel<00:04:22.900> way<00:04:23.110> of

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
really be a terrific and novel way of
