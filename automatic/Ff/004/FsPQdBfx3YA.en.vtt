00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
you pop this open and the fuses will be

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.039 
you pop this open and the fuses will be
back<00:01:40.079> here<00:01:40.400> on<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.790> Jetta<00:01:42.090> however<00:01:42.509> they<00:01:42.960> are

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049

before you go replacing anything on my
Jetta<00:02:07.129> moduli<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.670> happens<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.060> be<00:02:09.179> this

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420
