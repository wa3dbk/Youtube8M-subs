little<00:01:04.540> bit<00:01:04.720> because<00:01:05.140> the<00:01:05.409> creative<00:01:05.799> park

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
little bit because the creative park

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.679 
little bit because the creative park
makes<00:01:06.250> it<00:01:06.369> so<00:01:06.549> easy<00:01:06.759> you<00:01:06.970> can<00:01:07.000> either<00:01:07.299> print

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
them out in like a 4x6 flap size that

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.270 
them out in like a 4x6 flap size that
you<00:01:11.049> can<00:01:11.170> mount<00:01:11.289> on<00:01:11.469> a<00:01:11.499> card<00:01:11.770> like<00:01:11.859> we've<00:01:12.130> done

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
you can mount on a card like we've done

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.940 
you can mount on a card like we've done
here<00:01:12.340> or<00:01:12.789> you<00:01:13.240> can<00:01:13.450> print<00:01:13.689> it<00:01:13.810> out<00:01:13.929> in<00:01:14.289> the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
quarter cards so basically you'll just

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.599 
quarter cards so basically you'll just
fold<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.679> paper<00:01:17.890> into<00:01:18.039> four<00:01:18.219> quarters<00:01:18.429> and
