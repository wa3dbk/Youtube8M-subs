00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.559
 the mirror is the place where we go to 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.809
 try to reflect the city that 

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:12.419
 we live the city of miami and talk about 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.980
 the city ​​is talking about the protagonists 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:19.500
 of that daily life from politicians to 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.780
 Sometimes we are saturated with politicians 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.120
 but let's look 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.950
 great personalities that live hidden 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.250
 and what 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.800
 and that we do not know them and that's why we have 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.320
 a segment that is called patio people 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:43.070
 or local talent that will not only bring 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.800
 painters artists but also that's going 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.890
 attracts people who do curious things and 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.690
 difficult beyond what is important to 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.309
 interesting how important what 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:58.220
 interesting I like this gift of 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.620
 welcome to the excellent program that 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.030
 envisions starting at ten thirty 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.739
 the night at six thirty in the evening 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.420
 in americateve that is the space that 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.490
 had perose esp of which is passed to 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.610
 be the star program of the eight of 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.610
 the night 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.460
 Well, I'm going to try first 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.270
 that does not go to that audience that I ask 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.140
 I already had and it's a bit risky because 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.729
 let's make a different format in the 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:32.200
 that there will be reports that I will recover that 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.280
 that old profession that I did so much at 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.590
 over the years that is the 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.360
 reporter on the street that I love if 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.340
 I had a really bony reporter 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.520
 goalkeeper during 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.799
 20 years I was 15 years old 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.930
 specifically since 1992 as the 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.850
 hurricane andrew 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.290
 I was good to cut in of course 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.450
 the entire transition of the countries 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.100
 communists the fall of the berlin wall 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.250
 what happened with noriega in panama 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.440
 but really from 1992 I did it 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.439
 in a constant way the route between 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.299
 countries of latin america and europe 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.070
 interviewing the same presidents who 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.739
 ordinary people but you're happy because 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.880
 you have your program I have heard you 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:14.390
 many times in the hallways to this 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.510
 channel saying thinking dreaming to have your 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.360
 own program we all dream of having 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.770
 our own program but I've 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.050
 put the mirror because I do not want that 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.800
 be my program I want it to be the 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.239
 program yours the program of all that 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.430
 you feel in front of the television the 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.830
 your program is what I want 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.350
 that it reflects not my aspirations 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.970
 but the aspirations of the dreams of 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.830
 the ones who live in this city ​​and that's why 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.450
 it is the mirror but there will be controversies because 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.519
 you are a controversial journalist always 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.080
 I've seen your reports I remember some 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.580
 with some states that are already very famous 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.120
 the meetings with fidel Castro with 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.069
 robaina with lage and pérez roque 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.989
 also here in local all had 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.909
 controversial is always your opinion is very 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.590
 important people follow it may be 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.110
 okay or not but you're going to take it 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.580
 also to the program you know that I do not 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.409
 he has never tried to be a journalist 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.440
 controversial not to me the polemic pursues me 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:12.239
 and then I ask questions because I think that 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.599
 the journalist in the background 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.829
 fidel Castro in panama in a speech in 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.420
 the university after I did it 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.150
 two or three questions the famous things 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.640
 what is Marianao's, I say not with a 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.870
 impertinent there that told me not the 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.640
 escorts okay they called me the 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.980
 impertinent, I have not thought 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.840
 that in the end a journalist must be 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.209
 an impertinent guy who does the 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.790
 exact question that the interviewee 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.140
 He wants them to do it because if we are not 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.010
 complacent but I do not 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.959
 purposes of the just the controversy I 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.750
 chases I 'll try here I'll try here 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:49.230
 of being very kind to be the home of 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.670
 all and then I'm going to mark a 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.109
 difference is going to be a moment in the 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.700
 interview that I'm going to ask the 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.709
 between states and wants me to do 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.940
 indiscreet questions if you do not want not to 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.530
 I make them 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.450
 because they say nobody resists a 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.030
 file and we will learn a great 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.760
 file people who said today is in favor 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.470
 of the embargo but not so long ago 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.050
 he said he was against people who 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.510
 has some positions nowadays that 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.700
 totally contradict if you want 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.830
 undergo that interrogation not the 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.370
 mirror will look like some other program 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.950
 If everything is invented, the mirror is something 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.990
 what has been done in other programs 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.670
 Argentina in Spain we are going to 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.000
 do in our style and your mirror like 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.760
 wax 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.930
 my mirror is the one I offer you in 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.120
 the rest 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.030
 something else that I would like to say like this should already 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.800
 to cecilio of what starts soon 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.880
 because this comes from youtube 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.800
 it leaves on Monday and of course already every day 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.759
 Midweek Monday through Friday at 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.350
 10 30 at night I really invite you to 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.389
 to accompany me until now the 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.590
 public has always accompanied me but I 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.660
 I think now it's time to 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.880
 give them back and that's also why 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:03.040
 mirror and have where people can you 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:06.830
 writing commented on the mirror on facebook 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.390
 is already in Facebook mirror and I do not know 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.660
 exactly in the direction I would have to 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.250
 ask the next perhaps but yes to 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.720
 through my name today you find yourself in 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.810
 any side puts you in your name in 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.180
 google or on youtube and it appears of everything not 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.129
 can you make me an advance or what will 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.080
 pass on monday 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:26.270
 what's on the banal payroll on Monday 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.789
 let's remember the history of the 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:33.139
 last 20 years of our city of 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:36.619
 miami but through the lens of a 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:39.739
 photographer of a reporter a 

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:41.689
 photojournalist who has covered all 

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:44.300
 important events and then we're going to 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:45.889
 look us through excellent through 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.899
 from that mirror that is the camera 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:50.989
 photographic of that artist marc audios 

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:53.239
 it is not interesting I wish you much 

00:05:50.989 --> 00:05:56.990
 good luck, congratulations on this success 

00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:58.159
 staff in your long and fun career 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.629
 because one is encouraged and we are going to 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:06.289
 fun is important not because the 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:08.779
 intelligence does not have to be dense and what 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:10.729
 entertaining does not have to be 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:12.080
 empty let's do entertainment with 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:15.009
 contents 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.009
 he told me luck 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.300
 of death 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.500
 bye
