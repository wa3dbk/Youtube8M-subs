00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.350 
barrier on this rock next to this
helicopter<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.640> barrier<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.060> actually

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
helicopter and this barrier is actually

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.670 
helicopter and this barrier is actually
really<00:01:15.509> small<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.020> got<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.229> hit<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.380> just

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
really small so you got to hit it just

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.499 
really small so you got to hit it just
right<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.640> are<00:01:17.670> pretty<00:01:17.909> high<00:01:18.119> up<00:01:18.150> right

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
right but you are pretty high up right

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.719 
right but you are pretty high up right
here<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.869> from<00:01:19.590> here<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.520> we're<00:01:20.640> going

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
here and from here this is we're going

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:21.770 
here and from here this is we're going
to<00:01:20.790> be<00:01:20.970> where<00:01:21.240> we're<00:01:21.330> going<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.509> be<00:01:21.600> getting

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
to be where we're going to be getting

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.899 
to be where we're going to be getting
outside<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.470> map<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:23.189> you're<00:01:23.700> going<00:01:23.790> to

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
outside of the map so you're going to

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.640 
outside of the map so you're going to
need<00:01:24.000> your<00:01:24.180> XO<00:01:24.540> sprint<00:01:24.900> for<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.560> do

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
need your XO sprint for this and to do

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.200 
need your XO sprint for this and to do
this<00:01:25.799> all<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.430> do<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.939> turn<00:01:27.060> on

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
this all you do is you have to turn on

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.850 
this all you do is you have to turn on
your<00:01:27.299> XO<00:01:27.540> sprint<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:28.140> got<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> lot<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.590> times

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
your XO sprint it's got a lot of times

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.469 
your XO sprint it's got a lot of times
they<00:01:29.100> don't<00:01:29.130> worry<00:01:29.400> about<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:30.360> not

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
they don't worry about that it's not

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.640 
they don't worry about that it's not
going<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.659> run<00:01:30.750> out<00:01:30.810> really<00:01:31.049> quickly<00:01:31.229> like<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
going to run out really quickly like the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.050 
going to run out really quickly like the
XO<00:01:31.890> hover<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.310> you're<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.520> going<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.759> jump

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
XO hover and you're just going to jump

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.240 
XO hover and you're just going to jump
over<00:01:33.420> here<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.200> can<00:01:34.320> jump<00:01:34.560> around<00:01:34.680> you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
over here and you can jump around you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.490 
over here and you can jump around you
don't<00:01:35.430> want<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.610> jump<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:36.090> through<00:01:36.570> where

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
don't want to jump like through where

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.749 
don't want to jump like through where
the<00:01:37.619> helicopter<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.430> have<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.579> jump

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
the helicopter is you have to jump

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.670 
the helicopter is you have to jump
around<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.450> whole<00:01:39.659> area<00:01:39.960> because<00:01:40.439> there's

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
around that whole area because there's

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.109 
around that whole area because there's
like<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.890> death<00:01:41.159> barrier<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.670> don't<00:01:41.729> want

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
like a death barrier and you don't want

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.270 
like a death barrier and you don't want
to<00:01:42.150> hit<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:43.049> jump<00:01:43.409> like<00:01:43.649> kind<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:43.979> far

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
to hit that so jump like kind of far

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.280 
to hit that so jump like kind of far
over<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.390> really<00:01:45.659> not<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.840> hard<00:01:46.110> to

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
over and it's really not that hard to

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.990 
over and it's really not that hard to
hit<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.740> spot<00:01:46.920> right<00:01:47.070> there<00:01:47.250> but<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.880> always

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
hit that spot right there but it always

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.609 
hit that spot right there but it always
says<00:01:48.210> how<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.360> get<00:01:48.570> out<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.899> map<00:01:49.049> as<00:01:49.290> well

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
says how you get out of the map as well

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.200 
says how you get out of the map as well
as<00:01:49.770> on<00:01:49.890> top<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.310> map<00:01:50.460> I'll<00:01:50.640> kind<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.939> speed

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
as on top of the map I'll kind of speed

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.580 
as on top of the map I'll kind of speed
the<00:01:51.390> video<00:01:51.600> up<00:01:51.750> right<00:01:51.930> now<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.470> guys

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the video up right now so the you guys

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.859 
the video up right now so the you guys
can<00:01:52.740> see<00:01:52.920> all<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.070> places<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.549> can<00:01:53.670> get<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
can see all the places you can get the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.539 
can see all the places you can get the
first<00:01:55.110> part<00:01:55.350> like<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.649> said<00:01:55.890> getting<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.219> top<00:01:56.399> of

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
first part like I said getting on top of

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.950 
first part like I said getting on top of
the<00:01:56.610> map<00:01:56.790> which<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.270> basic<00:01:57.630> part<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.899> the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
the map which is the basic part of the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.749 
the map which is the basic part of the
glitch<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.259> actually<00:01:58.979> really<00:01:59.159> easy<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.610> do<00:01:59.729> you

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
glitch is actually really easy to do you

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.459 
glitch is actually really easy to do you
can<00:02:00.090> do<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.270> almost<00:02:00.420> every<00:02:00.659> single<00:02:00.930> time<00:02:01.200> and

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
can do it almost every single time and

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.810 
can do it almost every single time and
it's<00:02:01.860> really<00:02:01.920> not<00:02:02.070> going<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.369> be<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.490> much<00:02:02.670> of

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
it's really not going to be that much of

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.550 
it's really not going to be that much of
a<00:02:02.969> struggle<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.390> figure<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.689> out<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.200> second

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
a struggle to figure it out the second

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.050 
a struggle to figure it out the second
part<00:02:04.710> you're<00:02:04.979> going<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.189> spend<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:05.729> at<00:02:05.939> least

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
part you're going to spend like at least

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.359 
part you're going to spend like at least
10<00:02:06.360> minutes<00:02:06.479> probably<00:02:06.840> around<00:02:07.079> there

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
10 minutes probably around there

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.650 
10 minutes probably around there
figuring<00:02:08.369> out<00:02:08.520> because<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.270> kind<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.569> a

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
figuring out because it is kind of a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.880 
figuring out because it is kind of a
little<00:02:09.720> bit<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:09.989> tricky<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.410> get<00:02:10.500> around<00:02:10.739> that

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
little bit of tricky to get around that

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.330 
little bit of tricky to get around that
death<00:02:11.099> go

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
death go

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.250 
death go
here<00:02:11.489> but<00:02:11.970> just<00:02:12.209> go<00:02:12.360> around<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.810> whole<00:02:13.019> area

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
here but just go around that whole area

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.170 
here but just go around that whole area
like<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.620> said<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.280> video<00:02:14.519> just<00:02:14.730> do<00:02:15.060> it

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
like I said and the video just do it

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.150 
like I said and the video just do it
like<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.420> did<00:02:15.480> exactly<00:02:16.110> in<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.260> video<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.769> you

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
like I did exactly in the video and you

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.350 
like I did exactly in the video and you
shouldn't<00:02:17.370> have<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.640> whole<00:02:17.910> lot<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.120> trouble

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
shouldn't have a whole lot of trouble

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.940 
shouldn't have a whole lot of trouble
but<00:02:19.050> anyways<00:02:19.319> guys<00:02:19.440> I'd<00:02:19.650> really<00:02:19.860> appreciate

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
but anyways guys I'd really appreciate

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.530 
but anyways guys I'd really appreciate
it<00:02:20.310> if<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.519> could<00:02:20.550> drop<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:20.879> like<00:02:21.150> on<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.450> video

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
it if I could drop a like on the video

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.030 
it if I could drop a like on the video
that<00:02:21.900> always<00:02:22.019> really<00:02:22.290> helps<00:02:22.560> me<00:02:22.590> out<00:02:22.739> when<00:02:23.010> you

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
that always really helps me out when you

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.490
