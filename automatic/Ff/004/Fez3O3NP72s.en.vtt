welcome<00:00:01.650> back<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.979> another<00:00:02.220> tutorial<00:00:02.460> today

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
welcome back to another tutorial today

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.840 
welcome back to another tutorial today
we're<00:00:03.510> going<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.840> be<00:00:03.959> doing<00:00:04.310> water<00:00:05.310> mills<00:00:05.609> from

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
we're going to be doing water mills from

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.730 
we're going to be doing water mills from
industrial<00:00:06.390> crafts<00:00:06.690> that<00:00:06.930> are<00:00:07.080> automatically

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
industrial crafts that are automatically

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.790 
industrial crafts that are automatically
filled<00:00:08.099> with<00:00:08.189> buckets<00:00:08.790> by<00:00:09.030> red<00:00:09.360> power<00:00:09.599> -<00:00:09.900> we'll

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
filled with buckets by red power - we'll

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.280 
filled with buckets by red power - we'll
be<00:00:10.920> using<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.309> retriever<00:00:11.759> which<00:00:12.120> requires<00:00:13.019> blue

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
be using a retriever which requires blue

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.870 
be using a retriever which requires blue
tricity<00:00:13.650> so<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:13.980> will<00:00:14.250> need<00:00:14.460> some<00:00:14.700> glue

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
tricity so you will need some glue

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.640 
tricity so you will need some glue
tricity<00:00:15.269> power<00:00:16.850> so<00:00:17.850> let's<00:00:18.330> get<00:00:18.510> started<00:00:18.930> first

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
tricity power so let's get started first

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.070 
tricity power so let's get started first
you<00:00:20.580> make<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> path<00:00:21.180> for<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.510> blue<00:00:21.720> tricity

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
you make a path for you blue tricity

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.920 
you make a path for you blue tricity
wire<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.769> then<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.490> dig<00:00:23.670> out<00:00:23.850> one<00:00:24.090> two<00:00:24.420> three

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
wire and then you dig out one two three

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.220 
wire and then you dig out one two three
and<00:00:25.230> one<00:00:25.830> two<00:00:26.400> three<00:00:26.900> and<00:00:27.900> then<00:00:28.019> you're<00:00:28.140> going

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
and one two three and then you're going

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.740 
and one two three and then you're going
to<00:00:28.320> need<00:00:28.470> one<00:00:28.710> here<00:00:28.980> at<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.189> bottom<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.789> for

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
to need one here at the bottom and for

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.200 
to need one here at the bottom and for
however<00:00:30.990> many<00:00:31.260> water<00:00:31.560> mills<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.009> want<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:33.180> a

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
however many water mills you want to a

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.660 
however many water mills you want to a
minimum<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.930> two<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.950> will<00:00:35.100> need<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.370> dig<00:00:35.550> it

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
minimum of two you will need to dig it

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.660

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.850 
inside of that place your water here and
here<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.220> then<00:01:14.220> you're<00:01:14.460> going<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.820> need<00:01:15.860> some

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
here and then you're going to need some

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.749 
here and then you're going to need some
red<00:01:17.790> power<00:01:18.119> wire<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.430> power<00:01:20.430> your

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
red power wire here and power your

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.260 
red power wire here and power your
retriever<00:01:21.299> like<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.400> then<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.700> place<00:01:23.970> your

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
retriever like so then you place your

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.330 
retriever like so then you place your
water<00:01:24.540> mills<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:25.110> your<00:01:25.439> tubes

and after you place your timer which you

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.819 
and after you place your timer which you
can<00:01:34.960> actually<00:01:35.140> set<00:01:35.500> as<00:01:35.680> low<00:01:36.310> as<00:01:37.320> point<00:01:38.320> five

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
can actually set as low as point five

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.520 
can actually set as low as point five
five<00:01:39.070> zero<00:01:39.130> seconds<00:01:39.970> you<00:01:40.600> are<00:01:40.630> going<00:01:41.200> to<00:01:41.350> want

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
five zero seconds you are going to want

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.800 
five zero seconds you are going to want
to<00:01:42.039> place<00:01:42.280> more<00:01:42.579> buckets<00:01:43.000> in<00:01:43.090> your<00:01:43.450> deployer

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
to place more buckets in your deployer

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.399 
to place more buckets in your deployer
you<00:01:44.500> need<00:01:44.710> at<00:01:44.890> least<00:01:45.189> as<00:01:45.490> many<00:01:45.729> buckets<00:01:46.240> as<00:01:46.630> you

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
you need at least as many buckets as you

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.070 
you need at least as many buckets as you
have<00:01:47.619> water<00:01:47.860> mills<00:01:48.189> the<00:01:48.670> more<00:01:48.850> you<00:01:48.970> have<00:01:49.210> the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
have water mills the more you have the

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.020 
have water mills the more you have the
faster<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.649> system<00:01:51.009> will<00:01:51.490> keep<00:01:51.729> the<00:01:51.850> water

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
faster the system will keep the water

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:59.669 
faster the system will keep the water
mills<00:01:52.299> filled<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.740> as<00:01:56.979> you<00:01:57.250> can<00:01:57.340> see<00:01:58.350> our<00:01:59.350> water

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
mills filled so as you can see our water

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.969 
mills filled so as you can see our water
mills<00:01:59.920> are<00:02:00.070> all<00:02:00.189> filling<00:02:00.700> up<00:02:00.820> nicely<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:01.979> now

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
mills are all filling up nicely and now

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.300 
mills are all filling up nicely and now
we<00:02:03.039> have<00:02:03.369> an<00:02:03.810> automatic<00:02:04.810> water<00:02:05.440> mill<00:02:05.679> system<00:02:06.100> I

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
we have an automatic water mill system I

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.370 
we have an automatic water mill system I
find<00:02:07.060> that<00:02:07.209> this<00:02:07.330> can<00:02:07.569> handle<00:02:07.869> at<00:02:08.080> least

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
find that this can handle at least

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.640 
find that this can handle at least
fourteen<00:02:11.380> of<00:02:11.560> these<00:02:11.680> probably<00:02:12.580> more<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.650> would

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
fourteen of these probably more I would

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.170 
fourteen of these probably more I would
imagine<00:02:14.830> that<00:02:15.130> this<00:02:15.220> could<00:02:15.280> probably<00:02:15.790> handle

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
imagine that this could probably handle

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.360 
imagine that this could probably handle
around<00:02:16.450> 20<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.319> that's<00:02:17.620> with<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.860> full<00:02:18.160> load

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
around 20 and that's with a full load

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.870 
around 20 and that's with a full load
using<00:02:19.180> all<00:02:19.360> of<00:02:19.390> their<00:02:19.660> energy<00:02:20.099> so<00:02:21.099> I<00:02:21.340> hope<00:02:21.760> you

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
using all of their energy so I hope you

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.339
