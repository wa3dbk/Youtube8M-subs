00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.200 
think it's really interesting most golf
courses<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:04.979> our<00:01:05.100> tee<00:01:05.220> time<00:01:05.250> spread<00:01:05.850> out<00:01:06.000> you

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
courses have our tee time spread out you

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.940 
courses have our tee time spread out you
know<00:01:06.299> nine<00:01:06.630> minutes<00:01:06.960> apart<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.650> here<00:01:07.890> you

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
know nine minutes apart and here you

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.899 
know nine minutes apart and here you
guys<00:01:08.100> do<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> little<00:01:08.430> bit<00:01:08.520> differently

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
guys do it a little bit differently

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.969 
guys do it a little bit differently
right<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.659> do<00:01:09.930> we<00:01:10.740> have<00:01:11.119> 12<00:01:12.119> minute<00:01:12.390> tee<00:01:12.570> times

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
right we do we have 12 minute tee times

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.530 
right we do we have 12 minute tee times
basically<00:01:13.979> what<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.220> means<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.060> golfer

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
basically what that means to the golfer

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.649 
basically what that means to the golfer
is<00:01:15.689> when<00:01:15.990> you're<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.680> first<00:01:17.100> tee<00:01:17.659> with

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
is when you're on the first tee with

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.390 
is when you're on the first tee with
12-minute<00:01:19.140> times<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.619> group<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.009> front<00:01:20.310> of

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
12-minute times the group in front of

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.580 
12-minute times the group in front of
you<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.880> putting<00:01:21.450> out<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.840> leaving<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.290> green

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
you is putting out and leaving the green

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.070 
you is putting out and leaving the green
right<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.460> what<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:23.909> means<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.540> when<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.900> get

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
right so what that means is when you get

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.240 
right so what that means is when you get
to<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.380> second<00:01:25.860> tee<00:01:26.840> you<00:01:27.840> don't<00:01:28.049> run<00:01:28.710> into<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
to the second tee you don't run into the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.069 
to the second tee you don't run into the
same<00:01:29.490> people<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.479> solved<00:01:30.900> their

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
same people that you just solved their

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.990 
same people that you just solved their
only<00:01:31.380> rain<00:01:31.590> down<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.070> waist<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.759> spreads

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
only rain down the waist so it spreads

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.260 
only rain down the waist so it spreads
it<00:01:33.329> out<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.659> allow<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.900> golf<00:01:34.290> course<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.740> play
