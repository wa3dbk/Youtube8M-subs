00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.799
 nice guys, here I am with them 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.960
 come back after a long time 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.390
 I wanted to surprise you later 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.820
 that you asked me in many like 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.160
 never make videos commented with 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.950
 the audio and then I wanted to do 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.200
 this surprises came back nice here 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.789
 I came back with a gameplay like 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.300
 you can see call of duty again 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:38.659
 black ops 2 and I was playing search and 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.589
 destroy one of my earliest firsts 

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:43.670
 yesterday's matches where I play in 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.760
 this map does not remember the name 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.129
 sorry I tried 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.210
 while I'm talking about nothing reform 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.640
 I can not not remember the name 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.100
 fuck and ok, this map anyway 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.889
 this sort of very luxurious yacht 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.260
 that is of chieri with nervous is anyway 

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:02.719
 it spoiled in the kitchen as you see 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.150
 the sami cocomeri the corpse on the ground a lot 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.890
 suggestive is fine and in any case I am nothing 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.660
 playing circles where it was destroyed 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.360
 I'm a jerk who kept inviting me 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.650
 showy but okay that is, come on come but 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.560
 He did not know that I was recording it I 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.490
 ruined video of this video not 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.610
 I knew where to go 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.500
 since being my first time to 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.850
 I play this map in fact against here 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.470
 in this kind of closet where 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.680
 fuck I wanted to go I don't know either 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.970
 and anyway I was playing with a class 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.660
 mp 7 not silenced I simply had 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:40.580
 the holographic viewfinder and then I put it 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:42.620
 one of the new exclusive cards by 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.610
 this year with card if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.680
 they call it something 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.870
 sorry non-recurring evidence of the article 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.790
 like a card that allows you to put 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.400
 the primary weapons also secondary therefore 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.560
 a mixture like secondary the sniper who 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.330
 however very useful because the 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.670
 morissette the thing close clash to 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.040
 medium distance 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.380
 then someone far away is a sniper 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.420
 good capitolasse is nothing to say about 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.670
 I like this black ops 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.950
 i really like nature just that though 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.000
 I have to say a negative note but 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:16.290
 but not so negative at the end is the lag 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.290
 initial discrimination a lot 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.300
 let's say that often it happens 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.110
 the disconnection breaks my balls though 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.269
 at the end its own black bernava being 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.920
 the first few times of this server I think 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.489
 who will have to update it with a face 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.750
 most probably it is what to say the campers 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.880
 they never fail 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.850
 being the first times they play with 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.720
 this game you know are all firm that 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.860
 it genuinely bothers me I am 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.840
 I'm doing these with the first few games 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.880
 only dying he brought god 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.459
 here was not missing a christ I always have 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.940
 had to give in every where I do 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.310
 immediately said however they never fail 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.959
 because in the end since the balls do not 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.430
 they know the maps rightly so 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.350
 they say no because I have to move the 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.209
 put in camper was dated 1 and the 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.269
 asshole like me who doesn't like camper 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.020
 like to move bo get a nice one 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.400
 campera 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.580
 ready look at for less 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.650
 important to have fun ie we say that 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.320
 this is a word is a sentence made 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.270
 it's not that I enjoy are pato 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.790
 still continues to die despite me 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.560
 like to be west and move anyway anyway 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.510
 qua cadeau I don't even know where the fuck I am 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.830
 found here I prefer to go back to why 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.650
 I said how the fuck I ended up then 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.510
 in nothing guys this game 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.290
 however really well made of graphics 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:38.470
 I very little like the story already 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.170
 coordinated kata the platinum what to say if 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.660
 enter normal medium difficulty because 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.820
 in the end, however, it requires the classics 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.680
 trophies finish the veteran story which 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.820
 so zombies like the first call of duty is 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.630
 exclusive that there are trophies online 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:58.900
 of prestige that makes me very happy 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.210
 which makes an anonymous prestige however 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.610
 they could put it like a tenth 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.900
 fifth prestige was more cool they have 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.550
 wanted to do only for the grenade 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.410
 negative note yet that I wanted 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.850
 to specify to destroy shit 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:15.640
 removed the huge 500 points 10 100 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.920
 pity though oh good line shot 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.890
 that game is pretty cool 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.590
 see written as good for me 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:26.400
 that for many friends, so here 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.770
 I forgot the emblems are 32 layers and 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.170
 great guys 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.000
 the video is finished I was pleased to 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.140
 comment on the videos for him 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.140
 let's hear hello beautiful
