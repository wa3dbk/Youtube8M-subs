00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.430
 if there is a player whose name is 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.920
 written with gold letters in history 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.400
 of the real valladolid this is víctor 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.380
 Manuel Fernández born in 1974 on 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.630
 Extremadura front marked a time in 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.910
 the club of pucela and also militated with 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.529
 success in the villarreal its first 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.599
 steps started in the categories 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.060
 inferiors of real madrid where víctor 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.730
 He stood out for his work and his great success 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.200
 facing goal from very small the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.230
 forward learned the values of the club 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.300
 and had as a reference one of the most 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.170
 great strikers who have gone through the 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.170
 santiago bernabéu 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.670
 very young and as a person I also believe 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.670
 that was a reference for me 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.660
 with cruise that teach you to win from 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.129
 very tiny where you are going to have to go 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.210
 to win to prove is from real madrid 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.880
 better the truth that has made me be a 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.340
 competitive winning person and go 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.220
 where you go through your mind is we win in 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.470
 the 94-95 season with only 20 years 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.479
 He left for Tenerife and was able to debut 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.220
 first division by not having 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.740
 many minutes in the winter market 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.720
 the Extremaduran went to Toledo that in 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.820
 those moments militated in the category 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.649
 of silver there completed a good second 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.880
 back that gave him the possibility of 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.880
 sign for the real valladolid 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.090
 they start to be very good colist 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:40.530
 everything that had entered me in tenerife 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.170
 that there was practically no game with him 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.850
 and he tells me I love you as you will see in 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.860
 the change is nothing 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.979
 and so on account with me was for two 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.450
 matches the first year I all 17 goals 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.820
 a very important figure for me lied 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.740
 a year on 22 17 goals when the 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.659
 playmaker and good defeat them when 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.659
 I start to be a victorious footballer 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.329
 the first year of Victor on the team 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.630
 blanquivioleta marked a before and after 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:12.320
 then in the club of pucela 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.730
 in that campaign in 96-97 he scored 16 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.230
 goals in 42 games 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.940
 the valladolid got the seventh 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.830
 garter post what allowed him 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.830
 dispute the uefa the following season 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.440
 I think the year for me but for everything 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.790
 Variable a very good year for the 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.050
 we put in uefa 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.450
 we make a spectacular group more 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.370
 players us frames fernando we were 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.320
 five is in front of the real madrid that we 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.970
 we come back together in the four 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.090
 seasons that he was in the 'submarine 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.200
 yellow ' the striker scored 38 goals 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.760
 becoming the highest scorer 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.739
 Spanish club history 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.900
 villarreal was four very good years 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:57.129
 villarreal went from being a normal team 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.550
 to be a little bit bigger love a great 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.790
 team 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.530
 and four good seasons 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.810
 with the arrival of players like 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.370
 riquelme force nano sonny anderson and 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.680
 victor was relegated to a second 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.359
 flat in 2004 the forward decided 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.140
 return to the club where he had consecrated 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.240
 as a player the valladolid 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.830
 and of course I remembered my previous stage and 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.090
 apply that wonderful I knew that the 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.090
 people were crazy about him coming back 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.890
 in the mistake that I wanted to be important 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.709
 in being a good team while being 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.730
 there in the front line and I did not need 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.380
 villarreal had lost the illusion 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.900
 there had been a desire to play soccer 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.700
 I had even thought about retiring with 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.610
 things that we have full and the head you 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.290
 They make you haunt you at times and I went back 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.330
 because where it was my home 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.530
 I knew that they were going to provide me with many 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.900
 things and about everything I needed 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.989
 after two difficult seasons in second 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.700
 division in the 2006-2007 campaign víctor 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.650
 got the goal for which he had 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.670
 returned to russel by the hand of jose luis 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.860
 mendilibar 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.440
 the valladolid got back to the league 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.790
 bbva in the 20 years that víctor spent in 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.070
 professional football had to 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.660
 face the toughest defenders 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.550
 the forward remembers how life 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.010
 impossible some of the backs more 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.870
 important ones that have gone through the middle 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.640
 alkorta now from fernando iron maybe 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.230
 what is two big times I was 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.640
 a player who did much damage the 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.889
 big team I've scored many goals 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.389
 madrid and barcelona atlético madrid 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.909
 not even just stronger because 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.949
 perhaps they are given a little more 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:24.360
 always referee to team defense 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.529
 Large forever lets you make a 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.689
 little bit more and they are the ones 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:28.080
 wasted in giving you stronger and 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:30.389
 best 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.039
 Victor left Valladolid in 2009 as 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.710
 third highest scorer of history 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:37.949
 of the club the last few years would militarize in 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.949
 Cartagena and in 2012 to leganés 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.539
 37 years of Merida with some boots and 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.430
 He returned to Valladolid where he lives 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.930
 currently the point now wants to continue 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.729
 in the world of football this time from 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.770
 the benches for this has the 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.449
 experience of having been under 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.430
 orders of trainers braces 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.770
 then they mixed relationship to the day 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.930
 so many coaches so small that 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.699
 try to get the best of each one already 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.710
 I spoke with rafa benítez we determined very 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.689
 young man teaches many tactical things 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.069
 I did not realize how when I 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:06.779
 he asked to be never always doubted what 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:09.120
 everything was very clear all very studied 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:12.919
 design much like in its moment thing the 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.919
 things of guardiola things 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.340
 I grew a lot mendilibar has been very 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.449
 centered what what he told me those 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.699
 little things that I like and 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.750
 Well I will try to make a shaker and 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:24.750
 get the best of each one 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.750
 players with the class delivery and the 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.000
 ability to face the goal as víctor is 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.220
 count on your fingers for all this the 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.780
 battering ram will always remain in the retina of 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.080
 the fans of valladolid and 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.080
 villarreal
