the freezing mark should should not be a
problem<00:02:29.069> today<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.520> that's<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.790> reason

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
problem today and that's the reason

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.760 
problem today and that's the reason
there<00:02:30.300> are<00:02:30.360> no<00:02:30.510> winter<00:02:30.840> weather<00:02:31.050> advisories

but<00:02:31.980> again<00:02:32.250> we<00:02:32.430> all<00:02:32.610> know<00:02:32.850> we<00:02:33.540> have<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.720> limited

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
but again we all know we have a limited

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.890 
but again we all know we have a limited
skill<00:02:34.740> set<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.480> dealing<00:02:36.480> with<00:02:36.510> this

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
skill set and dealing with this

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.870 
skill set and dealing with this
especially<00:02:37.590> down<00:02:38.130> here<00:02:38.160> in<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.490> deep<00:02:38.640> south

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
especially down here in the deep south

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.030 
especially down here in the deep south
so<00:02:39.180> I'll<00:02:39.390> just<00:02:39.420> be<00:02:39.780> aware<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.860> watch

that's the large-scale look at this at
noon<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.510> heavier<00:03:04.500> rain<00:03:04.769> should<00:03:04.950> be<00:03:05.070> down<00:03:05.250> south

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
noon a heavier rain should be down south

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.800 
noon a heavier rain should be down south
now<00:03:05.820> this<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.360> first<00:03:07.050> off<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.560> high<00:03:07.860> res<00:03:08.160> nam

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
now this is first off the high res nam

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.560 
now this is first off the high res nam
today<00:03:09.810> at<00:03:09.959> one<00:03:10.170> o'clock<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:11.030> by<00:03:12.030> golly<00:03:12.269> it's

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
today at one o'clock and by golly it's

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.380 
today at one o'clock and by golly it's
showing<00:03:13.370> snow<00:03:14.370> up<00:03:14.610> over<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:14.970> Tennessee

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
showing snow up over the Tennessee

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.050 
showing snow up over the Tennessee
Valley<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.900> again<00:03:16.200> this<00:03:16.620> is<00:03:16.830> suggesting<00:03:17.430> we

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
Valley and again this is suggesting we

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.819 
Valley and again this is suggesting we
might<00:03:18.299> see<00:03:18.540> snow<00:03:18.870> falling<00:03:19.320> even<00:03:19.500> this

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
might see snow falling even this

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.949 
might see snow falling even this
afternoon<00:03:20.370> in<00:03:20.549> places<00:03:20.940> like<00:03:20.970> haleyville<00:03:21.690> and

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
afternoon in places like haleyville and

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.800 
afternoon in places like haleyville and
vinemont<00:03:23.450> decatur<00:03:24.450> molten<00:03:25.320> and<00:03:25.530> points<00:03:26.400> north

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
vinemont decatur molten and points north

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.479 
vinemont decatur molten and points north
we<00:03:27.810> think<00:03:28.049> temperatures<00:03:28.560> by<00:03:28.799> then<00:03:29.100> should<00:03:29.370> be

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
we think temperatures by then should be

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.420 
we think temperatures by then should be
above<00:03:29.820> freezing<00:03:29.880> so<00:03:30.630> no<00:03:31.560> travel<00:03:32.280> related

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
above freezing so no travel related

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.550 
above freezing so no travel related
problems<00:03:33.180> this<00:03:33.360> afternoon<00:03:33.780> despite<00:03:34.290> that

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
problems this afternoon despite that

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.180 
problems this afternoon despite that
fact<00:03:35.180> this<00:03:36.180> is<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.360> GFS<00:03:37.140> at<00:03:37.350> noon<00:03:37.620> today<00:03:37.860> and

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
fact this is the GFS at noon today and

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.920 
fact this is the GFS at noon today and
again<00:03:38.400> this<00:03:38.489> is<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.700> lower<00:03:39.030> resolution<00:03:39.390> and

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
again this is a lower resolution and

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.620 
again this is a lower resolution and
this<00:03:40.019> is<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.290> new<00:03:40.410> high<00:03:41.100> res<00:03:41.430> gfs<00:03:42.150> but<00:03:42.360> even

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
this is the new high res gfs but even

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.009 
this is the new high res gfs but even
the<00:03:42.750> new<00:03:43.340> gfs<00:03:44.340> is<00:03:44.549> lower<00:03:44.820> resolution<00:03:45.600> compared

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
the new gfs is lower resolution compared

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.009 
the new gfs is lower resolution compared
to<00:03:46.170> like<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:46.769> know<00:03:46.829> the<00:03:46.980> her<00:03:47.130> model<00:03:48.019> still

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
to like you know the her model still

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.479 
to like you know the her model still
it's<00:03:49.200> got<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.500> shades<00:03:49.739> of<00:03:49.890> blue<00:03:50.130> up<00:03:50.310> there

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
it's got the shades of blue up there

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:51.949 
it's got the shades of blue up there
basically<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:51.150> same<00:03:51.299> place<00:03:51.600> around

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
basically the same place around

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.770 
basically the same place around
haleyville<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.769> vinemont<00:03:53.640> and<00:03:53.940> molten<00:03:54.540> and

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
haleyville and vinemont and molten and

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.330 
haleyville and vinemont and molten and
decatur<00:03:55.350> and<00:03:57.650> again<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:58.769> can<00:03:58.799> see<00:03:59.130> that

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
decatur and again you can see that

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.120 
decatur and again you can see that
there's<00:04:00.030> some<00:04:00.180> chance<00:04:00.390> of<00:04:00.660> snow<00:04:01.140> up<00:04:01.170> there

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.509 

there's<00:04:05.130> a<00:04:05.250> look<00:04:05.340> at<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:06.709> possible<00:04:07.709> total

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
there's a look at the possible total

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.819 
there's a look at the possible total
snow<00:04:08.940> coming<00:04:09.360> off<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.780> her<00:04:09.989> model<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:10.590> again

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
snow coming off the her model and again

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.199 
snow coming off the her model and again
it<00:04:10.950> strips<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.370> little<00:04:11.579> bit<00:04:11.760> puts<00:04:11.940> a<00:04:12.000> little

it strips a little bit puts a little

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.940 
it strips a little bit puts a little

strong trough rotates through here aloft
and<00:04:48.759> that<00:04:48.880> will<00:04:49.300> probably<00:04:49.539> bring<00:04:49.780> some<00:04:50.199> clouds

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
and that will probably bring some clouds

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.629 
and that will probably bring some clouds
will<00:04:51.820> call<00:04:52.030> it<00:04:52.180> partly<00:04:52.210> sunny<00:04:52.930> on<00:04:53.680> Sunday<00:04:54.430> and

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
dropping down in the low 50s so we'll

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.870

Sunday and again that upper trough might
squeeze<00:05:04.150> out<00:05:04.330> a<00:05:04.360> few<00:05:04.570> sprinkles<00:05:04.930> over
