00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
control which is basically like sector

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.039 
control which is basically like sector
control<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.300> conquest<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.540> some<00:00:12.719> other<00:00:12.840> ones

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
second round the map moves to the next

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.320 
second round the map moves to the next
part<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.289> map<00:00:25.439> with<00:00:25.830> different<00:00:26.279> flags<00:00:26.640> at

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
part of the map with different flags at

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.550 
part of the map with different flags at
different<00:00:27.570> points<00:00:27.840> which<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.439> pretty

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
different points which is pretty

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.339 
different points which is pretty

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
but he's a he's actually in the game

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.930 
but he's a he's actually in the game
itself<00:00:37.469> like<00:00:37.710> I'm<00:00:37.829> just<00:00:38.040> record<00:00:38.399> i'm<00:00:38.670> stalking

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
this recording anyway so the game has

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.630 
this recording anyway so the game has
battlefield<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.829> call<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.039> duty<00:00:47.250> elements

but it has its own worthwhile stuff like
battlefield<00:00:53.010> battle<00:00:53.789> points<00:00:54.059> which<00:00:55.020> are<00:00:55.260> you

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
battlefield battle points which are you

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.529 
battlefield battle points which are you
earn<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.219> middle<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.579> battle<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.210> then

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
you use them to make your basically your

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.450 
you use them to make your basically your
kill<00:01:00.420> streak<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.890> get<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> Hellfire

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
direct x lovin that's pretty much it

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.770 
direct x lovin that's pretty much it
I'll<00:01:15.330> here<00:01:15.509> I'm<00:01:15.600> mowing<00:01:15.720> them<00:01:15.930> down<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:17.659> got<00:01:18.659> all

that on this gun at all so you got no

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.200 
that on this gun at all so you got no
recoil<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.250> guns<00:01:26.430> feel<00:01:26.700> really<00:01:27.030> nice

like oops got skype there yep you can
die<00:01:30.659> pretty<00:01:30.900> quickly<00:01:30.990> here<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:32.340> guns<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:32.880> no

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
die pretty quickly here the guns have no

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.560 
die pretty quickly here the guns have no
recoil<00:01:34.040> seem<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.220> no<00:01:35.369> recoil<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:36.479> they

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
recoil seem to have no recoil but they

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.499 
recoil seem to have no recoil but they
feel<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:37.400> real<00:01:38.400> guns<00:01:38.700> for<00:01:38.939> some<00:01:39.060> reason<00:01:39.329> like

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
feel like real guns for some reason like

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.350 
feel like real guns for some reason like
when<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.810> fire<00:01:40.020> they<00:01:40.880> they're<00:01:41.880> balanced<00:01:42.270> it

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
when you fire they they're balanced it

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.749 
when you fire they they're balanced it
very<00:01:42.540> well<00:01:42.659> anyway<00:01:43.220> so<00:01:44.220> here<00:01:44.399> I'm<00:01:44.490> using<00:01:44.579> a

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
very well anyway so here I'm using a

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.490 
very well anyway so here I'm using a
Hellfire<00:01:45.180> missile<00:01:45.210> but<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.840> fail<00:01:46.079> epically

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
Hellfire missile but I fail epically

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.870 
Hellfire missile but I fail epically
because<00:01:46.890> my

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
because my

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.190 
because my
first<00:01:49.880> time<00:01:50.030> using<00:01:50.210> a<00:01:50.360> hellfire<00:01:50.750> over<00:01:51.020> there

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
first time using a hellfire over there

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.930 
first time using a hellfire over there
so<00:01:53.500> I've<00:01:54.500> recently<00:01:54.710> just<00:01:55.130> got<00:01:55.190> this<00:01:55.520> and<00:01:55.760> I'm

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
so I've recently just got this and I'm

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.340 
so I've recently just got this and I'm
still<00:01:56.150> trying<00:01:56.360> to<00:01:56.420> learn<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.810> mechanics<00:01:57.020> of

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
still trying to learn the mechanics of

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.670 
still trying to learn the mechanics of
this<00:01:57.440> game<00:01:57.650> a<00:01:58.600> lot<00:01:59.600> of<00:01:59.810> reviewers<00:02:00.260> seemed<00:02:00.590> to

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
this game a lot of reviewers seemed to

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.260 
this game a lot of reviewers seemed to
bash<00:02:00.890> this<00:02:01.130> game<00:02:01.340> because<00:02:01.580> of<00:02:01.730> the<00:02:01.880> single

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
bash this game because of the single

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.720 
bash this game because of the single
player<00:02:02.360> but<00:02:02.780> I<00:02:03.020> don't<00:02:03.950> usually<00:02:04.190> judge<00:02:04.550> the

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
player but I don't usually judge the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:05.980 
player but I don't usually judge the
game<00:02:04.880> just<00:02:05.060> by<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.240> single<00:02:05.540> player<00:02:05.600> itself

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
game just by the single player itself

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.080 
game just by the single player itself
especially<00:02:06.530> battlefield<00:02:07.280> I<00:02:07.550> mean

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
especially battlefield I mean

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.700 
especially battlefield I mean
battlefield<00:02:08.509> two<00:02:08.630> had<00:02:08.810> no<00:02:08.929> single<00:02:09.259> player<00:02:09.410> but

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
battlefield two had no single player but

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.060 
battlefield two had no single player but
it<00:02:10.460> was<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.640> fantastic<00:02:10.940> game<00:02:11.270> in<00:02:11.450> itself

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
it was a fantastic game in itself

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.730 
it was a fantastic game in itself
because<00:02:13.070> of<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.400> multiplayer<00:02:13.790> so<00:02:14.690> here<00:02:15.050> the

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
because of the multiplayer so here the

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.680 
because of the multiplayer so here the
single<00:02:15.980> player<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.280> really<00:02:16.640> short<00:02:16.850> I<00:02:17.120> from

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
single player is really short I from

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:18.730 
single player is really short I from
what<00:02:17.870> people<00:02:18.080> say<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:18.230> haven't<00:02:18.380> finished<00:02:18.560> it

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
what people say I haven't finished it

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.120 
what people say I haven't finished it
yet<00:02:18.850> and<00:02:19.850> i<00:02:20.630> thought<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.560> guy<00:02:21.740> was<00:02:22.010> gonna

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
yet and i thought that guy was gonna

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.570 
yet and i thought that guy was gonna
kill<00:02:22.400> me<00:02:22.550> like<00:02:23.480> he<00:02:23.660> was<00:02:23.690> on<00:02:23.840> my<00:02:23.900> team<00:02:23.990> anyway<00:02:24.800> so

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
kill me like he was on my team anyway so

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.520 
kill me like he was on my team anyway so
the<00:02:25.670> single<00:02:25.910> player<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:26.240> I've<00:02:27.170> only<00:02:27.380> played
