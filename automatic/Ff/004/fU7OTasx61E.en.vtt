mower deck so I figured why not show how
I<00:01:46.420> go<00:01:46.750> about<00:01:46.929> doing<00:01:46.990> it<00:01:47.319> so<00:01:47.860> here<00:01:48.009> we<00:01:48.130> go

this thing's called it's a bracket the

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:15.000 
this thing's called it's a bracket the
hosel<00:02:07.210> pulleys<00:02:07.570> together<00:02:07.870> I<00:02:13.440> just<00:02:14.440> take<00:02:14.830> the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
hosel pulleys together I just take the

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.630 
hosel pulleys together I just take the
not<00:02:15.610> stick<00:02:16.450> it<00:02:16.570> in<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.750> box<00:02:16.990> into<00:02:17.200> this<00:02:17.640> wrench

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
not stick it in the box into this wrench

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:31.320 
not stick it in the box into this wrench
it's<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.570> 14<00:02:19.990> millimeter<00:02:20.170> Ram<00:02:29.850> this<00:02:30.850> washer

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
it's a 14 millimeter Ram this washer

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:38.840 
it's a 14 millimeter Ram this washer
make<00:02:31.780> sure<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:32.020> washes<00:02:32.440> in<00:02:32.620> place<00:02:33.630> down<00:02:34.630> here

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.090 

back<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:39.970> chief<00:02:40.180> with<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.450> belt<00:02:40.660> down

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
bracket now I just pull the bolt out I

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.080 
bracket now I just pull the bolt out I
up<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.440> nut<00:02:53.650> through<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.310> hole<00:02:56.730> push<00:02:57.730> it<00:02:57.880> belt

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
up the nut through the hole push it belt

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:23.449 
up the nut through the hole push it belt
down<00:02:58.330> so<00:02:59.020> I<00:02:59.080> find<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.470> nut

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.480 

okay<00:03:24.930> if<00:03:25.930> you<00:03:26.110> not<00:03:26.500> if<00:03:26.800> you're<00:03:27.010> unclear<00:03:27.340> with
