00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:09.090
 with us playing band was calm 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.130
 street new and owner of the games and today 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.630
 I'm here with you for a new video 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.089
 fights 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.980
 This is what it will be with beating faults in 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.560
 top of the barrier 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.500
 it is for you who do not know that you are new 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.289
 already had an episode of how to hit faults 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.660
 and it was over the keeper then 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.990
 I advise you to attend to you 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.730
 learn all the different methods and the 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.160
 link will be in the video description 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.140
 so let's start now 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.570
 The method that I'm going to show you. 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.000
 today is effective in this area that I take 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.820
 I'm calling now on the big screen. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.100
 square for this method I'm going to use the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.379
 ronaldinho one of the best collectors of 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.239
 and the world after they have 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.730
 watched this video I advise you 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.039
 train this technique with your collector 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.180
 because it's a bit different with each one 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:04.739
 but here the levels you see are 78 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.530
 of force 88 of aim and 90 of curve the most 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.780
 important here is bend and look near the 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.890
 large area humiliates slightly to the side 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.380
 of the beam 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.100
 vote back two bars of force and 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.600
 tic the left tic up to 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.689
 the right side is good to have a player 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.729
 down and left one left-handed player 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.259
 but if you will not tell 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.409
 Charge, no problem, I'll go. 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.930
 explain how to do it here with you guys are 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.420
 seeing is further away and the only thing that 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.670
 change is the force then put some more 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.430
 two bars like the video here 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.799
 and for kicking further into charges 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.990
 in the center of the field this method is not the 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.140
 better then I'll show the other method 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.240
 in the next video here in the middle near the 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.790
 large area you have to put a little 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.820
 less than two bars of force since it is 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.340
 very close to the goal me a little on the side of the 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.990
 and as directed before 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.060
 left up 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.640
 here is no example but if it is 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.790
 beating with the other is you look exactly 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.789
 on the other side of the side beam style 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.280
 the same thing got me a little to the right of the 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.630
 if the player is right-handed or a 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.480
 little corner of the brake if gained 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.940
 the boot around two bars of force 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.620
 depending on the player and let the cyc 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.420
 left up 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.190
 As you can see, you can not 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.350
 hit the first goal 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.840
 so I advise you to train with your 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.820
 collector of the team in the next video of 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.340
 I will learn to fight you. 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.680
 how to hit from a distance and how to hit 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.770
 Curve is like I told you in the 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.990
 beginning the victor sorority robinho has done 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.750
 an episode of fighting fouls then 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.460
 I advise you are watching the video and 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.440
 Of course all the links are in the description 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.200
 below the video 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.090
 So that's all it is people, please leave 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.490
 a jewel that helps a lot in publicizing the 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.840
 channel and follow us on Twitter 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.840
