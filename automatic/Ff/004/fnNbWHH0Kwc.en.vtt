00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
you can use brown oil why that doesn't

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.430 
you can use brown oil why that doesn't
really<00:00:52.980> help<00:00:53.190> much<00:00:53.460> I'd<00:00:53.879> say<00:00:54.149> your<00:00:54.989> best<00:00:55.230> bet

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
really help much I'd say your best bet

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.049 
really help much I'd say your best bet
is<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:56.250> remember<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.520> name<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.910> oil

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
is I can remember the name of the oil

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.520 
is I can remember the name of the oil
but<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> oil<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.809> does<00:00:57.960> ten<00:00:58.199> percent

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
but it's the oil that does ten percent

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.510 
but it's the oil that does ten percent
damage<00:00:59.510> increase<00:01:00.510> or<00:01:00.809> across<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.590> field<00:01:01.829> so

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
damage increase or across the field so

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.920 
damage increase or across the field so
basically<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.910> general<00:01:03.239> strategy<00:01:03.690> for<00:01:03.870> this

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
basically the general strategy for this

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.509 
basically the general strategy for this
boss<00:01:04.170> fight<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.650> if<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.979> notice<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
boss fight is if you notice on the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.490 
boss fight is if you notice on the
tentacles<00:01:06.000> there's<00:01:06.210> going<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.540> be<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.869> big

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
tentacles there's going to be a big

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.830 
tentacles there's going to be a big
glowy<00:01:07.830> part<00:01:08.220> now<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.490> use<00:01:08.760> your<00:01:08.970> electrical

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
glowy part now you use your electrical

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.600 
glowy part now you use your electrical
trap<00:01:10.229> rune<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.979> ground<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.430> when<00:01:11.520> it

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
trap rune on the ground and when it

trap rune on the ground and when it
swings<00:01:12.080> it<00:01:13.080> will<00:01:13.260> leave<00:01:14.070> its<00:01:15.110> ligament

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
swings it will leave its ligament

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.640

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
just cut it off and then retreat it's

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.539 
just cut it off and then retreat it's
going<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.229> asset<00:01:22.680> spray<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.070> metal<00:01:23.430> it's

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
going to asset spray in the metal it's

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.100 
going to asset spray in the metal it's
going<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.759> beat<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.150> middle<00:01:24.390> up<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:24.930> that's

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
going to beat the middle up so that's

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.249 
going to beat the middle up so that's
why<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.290> don't<00:01:25.470> want<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.650> be<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.920> middle

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.030 
apparently doesn't have very good aim as
it<00:01:30.509> completely<00:01:31.020> attacks<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.590> watching<00:01:31.890> for

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
it completely attacks and watching for
