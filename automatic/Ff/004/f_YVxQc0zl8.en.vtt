all right welcome to chapter 3 in
chapter<00:00:03.899> 3<00:00:04.140> we<00:00:04.170> were<00:00:04.380> going<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.710> be<00:00:04.830> looking<00:00:05.160> at

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
chapter 3 we were going to be looking at

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.190 
chapter 3 we were going to be looking at
modeling<00:00:05.730> using<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.240> extrude<00:00:06.660> and<00:00:06.839> loop<00:00:06.990> tool

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
modeling using the extrude and loop tool

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.160 
modeling using the extrude and loop tool
we're<00:00:07.740> going<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.040> be<00:00:08.130> making<00:00:08.340> an<00:00:08.670> x-wing<00:00:09.170> this

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
we're going to be making an x-wing this

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.560 
we're going to be making an x-wing this
lesson<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.740> tip<00:00:11.010> for<00:00:11.219> tat<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.639> what<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.150> mean<00:00:12.389> is

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
lesson is tip for tat and what I mean is

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.990 
lesson is tip for tat and what I mean is
whenever<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.410> do<00:00:13.590> something<00:00:13.950> you<00:00:14.549> should<00:00:14.790> do<00:00:14.880> it

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
whenever I do something you should do it

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.060 
whenever I do something you should do it
also<00:00:16.310> why<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:18.000> because<00:00:18.890> this<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.039> a

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
also why that is is because this is a

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.580 
also why that is is because this is a
very<00:00:20.369> beginning<00:00:20.789> intro<00:00:21.240> lesson<00:00:21.600> still<00:00:22.020> but<00:00:22.560> I

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
very beginning intro lesson still but I

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.230 
very beginning intro lesson still but I
want<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.980> make<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.250> advanced<00:00:23.609> enough<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.000> be

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
want to make it advanced enough to be

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.259 
want to make it advanced enough to be
interesting<00:00:24.420> an<00:00:25.099> x-wing<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.250> very<00:00:26.490> complex

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
interesting an x-wing is very complex

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.259 
interesting an x-wing is very complex
but<00:00:28.019> if<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:29.099> look<00:00:29.310> at<00:00:29.519> how<00:00:29.760> things<00:00:30.060> are<00:00:30.240> done

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
but if you look at how things are done

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.290 
but if you look at how things are done
and<00:00:30.660> how<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.560> make<00:00:31.830> forms<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.579> how<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.759> blend

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
and how to make forms and how to blend

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.020 
and how to make forms and how to blend
forms<00:00:33.719> together<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.620> should<00:00:34.860> be<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.940> should

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
forms together you should be it should

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.819 
forms together you should be it should
be<00:00:36.210> no<00:00:36.420> big<00:00:36.840> deal<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.380> make<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.559> x-wing<00:00:38.690> but

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
be no big deal to make this x-wing but

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.950 
be no big deal to make this x-wing but
that<00:00:40.829> being<00:00:40.860> said<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:42.120> don't<00:00:42.239> like<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.809> do

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
at least one lesson tit for tat if not

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.579 
at least one lesson tit for tat if not
maybe<00:01:02.910> two<00:01:03.239> maybe<00:01:03.660> later<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.199> down<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.409> road

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
maybe two maybe later on down the road

lesson and if you want to see the
outcome<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.710> lesson<00:01:17.070> real<00:01:17.759> quick<00:01:18.030> if<00:01:19.020> i

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
outcome to this lesson real quick if i

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.240 
outcome to this lesson real quick if i
go<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.549> hear<00:01:20.549> here's<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.330> x-wing<00:01:21.869> okay<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:23.040> we

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
go to hear here's this x-wing okay so we

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.530 
go to hear here's this x-wing okay so we
take<00:01:23.520> image<00:01:24.479> planes<00:01:25.850> bring<00:01:26.850> them<00:01:27.030> into<00:01:27.180> Maya

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
take image planes bring them into Maya

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:35.200 
take image planes bring them into Maya
and<00:01:28.850> then<00:01:29.850> model<00:01:30.210> out<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.509> next<00:01:30.720> week<00:01:32.299> okay

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
and then model out it next week okay

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.390 
and then model out it next week okay
it's<00:01:36.210> also<00:01:36.360> important<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.079> know<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
it's also important to know that in the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.850 
it's also important to know that in the
this<00:01:38.729> lesson<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.630> don't<00:01:39.900> join<00:01:40.170> forms<00:01:40.650> together

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
this lesson we don't join forms together

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.010 
this lesson we don't join forms together
okay<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.240> we<00:01:42.390> only<00:01:42.570> make<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.350> forms<00:01:43.680> touch<00:01:43.979> and

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
okay so we only make the forms touch and

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.840 
okay so we only make the forms touch and
then<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.229> start<00:01:46.680> learning<00:01:47.280> how<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.430> blend

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
then we start learning how to blend

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.359 
then we start learning how to blend
forms<00:01:48.299> together<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.259> next<00:01:49.409> lesson<00:01:49.740> in<00:01:50.130> or

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
forms together in the next lesson in or

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.859 
forms together in the next lesson in or
the<00:01:50.549> next<00:01:50.729> chapter<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.689> we'll<00:01:52.590> get<00:01:52.770> there<00:01:53.869> also

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
the next chapter so we'll get there also

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.660 
the next chapter so we'll get there also
I<00:01:55.170> start<00:01:55.979> showing<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.520> how<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.729> make<00:01:56.969> very

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
I start showing you how to make very

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.179 
I start showing you how to make very
hard<00:01:59.670> edge<00:01:59.969> geometry<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:01.469> when<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.740> hit<00:02:01.829> three

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
hard edge geometry so when you hit three

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.580 
hard edge geometry so when you hit three
on<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.399> keyboard<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.030> smooth<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.170> stuff<00:02:04.439> out

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
on the keyboard to smooth this stuff out

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.160 
on the keyboard to smooth this stuff out
it<00:02:04.829> smooths<00:02:05.250> well<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:06.030> doesn't<00:02:06.479> collapse<00:02:06.869> and

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
it smooths well it doesn't collapse and

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.249 
it smooths well it doesn't collapse and
in<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.710> self<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.599> reason<00:02:09.599> for<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.840> is

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
in that self and the reason for that is

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.930 
in that self and the reason for that is
later<00:02:10.530> on<00:02:10.770> in<00:02:10.950> lessons<00:02:11.370> i<00:02:11.550> want<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.790> show<00:02:11.910> you

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
later on in lessons i want to show you

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.250 
later on in lessons i want to show you
how<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.180> bake<00:02:12.480> textures

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
how to bake textures

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.869 
how to bake textures
out<00:02:13.379> and<00:02:13.939> how<00:02:14.939> to<00:02:15.000> make<00:02:15.269> textures<00:02:15.780> for<00:02:16.019> it<00:02:16.230> so

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
out and how to make textures for it so

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.059 
out and how to make textures for it so
we'll<00:02:17.879> revisit<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.959> x-wing<00:02:19.379> probably<00:02:19.829> later

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
we'll revisit the x-wing probably later

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.640 
we'll revisit the x-wing probably later
on<00:02:20.280> in<00:02:20.459> one<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.819> lessons<00:02:21.260> so<00:02:22.260> we<00:02:22.379> can<00:02:22.500> add

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
on in one of the lessons so we can add

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.069 
on in one of the lessons so we can add
texture<00:02:23.099> to<00:02:23.129> it<00:02:23.310> but<00:02:23.849> for<00:02:24.030> right<00:02:24.150> now<00:02:24.180> this<00:02:24.599> is

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
texture to it but for right now this is

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.170 
texture to it but for right now this is
just<00:02:25.110> beginning<00:02:25.500> modeling<00:02:26.159> and<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:26.909> is<00:02:27.060> how

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
just beginning modeling and this is how

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.690 
just beginning modeling and this is how
it's<00:02:27.360> done<00:02:27.540> alright<00:02:28.319> so<00:02:28.650> enjoy<00:02:29.129> the<00:02:29.340> chapter

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
it's done alright so enjoy the chapter

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.860 
it's done alright so enjoy the chapter
and<00:02:30.140> i'll<00:02:31.140> see<00:02:31.349> you<00:02:31.379> in<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.590> videos
