00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.520 
here I am okay in your references stem
cell<00:00:28.380> procedures<00:00:28.920> yes<00:00:29.520> they<00:00:30.110> if<00:00:31.110> you<00:00:31.200> look<00:00:31.410> at

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:31.530 
cell procedures yes they if you look at

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.229 
cell procedures yes they if you look at
the<00:00:31.560> website<00:00:31.800> they<00:00:32.430> go<00:00:32.610> into<00:00:32.790> pretty<00:00:33.030> good

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
the website they go into pretty good

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.189 
the website they go into pretty good
detail<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.660> procedures<00:00:36.660> they<00:00:36.839> do<00:00:36.899> with

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
detail on on the procedures they do with

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.669 
detail on on the procedures they do with
the<00:00:37.320> stem<00:00:37.559> cells<00:00:37.859> and<00:00:38.839> they<00:00:39.839> seem<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.260> have<00:00:40.440> a

00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:40.679 
the stem cells and they seem to have a

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.540 
the stem cells and they seem to have a
good<00:00:41.579> knowledge<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:42.269> on<00:00:43.280> injecting<00:00:44.280> stem

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
good knowledge on on injecting stem

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.950 
good knowledge on on injecting stem
cells<00:00:44.820> into<00:00:45.109> a<00:00:46.109> knee<00:00:46.499> to<00:00:47.809> regrow<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
cells into a knee to regrow the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.889 
cells into a knee to regrow the
cartilages<00:00:49.550> what<00:00:50.550> we're<00:00:50.699> hoping<00:00:50.879> for<00:00:51.059> great

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
cartilages what we're hoping for great

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.219 
cartilages what we're hoping for great
so<00:00:52.489> how<00:00:53.489> much<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.909> know<00:00:54.089> about<00:00:54.239> stem<00:00:54.839> cells

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:55.229 
so how much you know about stem cells

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.090 
so how much you know about stem cells
other<00:00:55.589> than<00:00:55.859> what<00:00:55.979> you<00:00:56.129> write<00:00:56.339> on<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.609> website

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
other than what you write on the website

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.629 
other than what you write on the website
probably<00:00:59.100> about<00:00:59.339> like<00:00:59.399> anyone<00:00:59.999> not<00:01:00.239> very<00:01:00.420> much

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:01.639 
probably about like anyone not very much

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:05.180 
probably about like anyone not very much
I'm<00:01:02.639> basically<00:01:03.210> going<00:01:03.569> on

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
I'm basically going on

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.590 
I'm basically going on
the<00:01:05.900> doctors<00:01:06.900> knowledge<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:09.150> fact<00:01:09.420> that

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
the doctors knowledge and the fact that

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.930 
the doctors knowledge and the fact that
this<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.740> new<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:10.980> understand<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:13.940> we're

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
going to we're trying something that

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.880 
going to we're trying something that
hasn't<00:01:17.280> been<00:01:17.490> done<00:01:17.610> very<00:01:18.030> many<00:01:18.240> times<00:01:18.330> but<00:01:19.020> it

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
hasn't been done very many times but it

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.380 
hasn't been done very many times but it
looks<00:01:20.160> like<00:01:20.250> there<00:01:20.550> has<00:01:20.730> been<00:01:21.030> some<00:01:21.210> positive

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390

there<00:02:32.650> was<00:02:32.769> a<00:02:32.799> lot<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.069> pain<00:02:34.620> probably<00:02:35.620> about

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
there was a lot of pain probably about

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.240 
there was a lot of pain probably about
two<00:02:36.970> took<00:02:37.420> about<00:02:37.659> two<00:02:37.930> weeks<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.530> get<00:02:38.680> back<00:02:38.950> to

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
two took about two weeks to get back to

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.640 
two took about two weeks to get back to
being<00:02:39.940> able<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.330> put<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.840> lot<00:02:41.049> of<00:02:41.080> pressure<00:02:41.470> on

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
being able to put a lot of pressure on

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.910 
being able to put a lot of pressure on
it<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:43.330> so<00:02:43.629> there<00:02:43.780> was<00:02:43.900> some<00:02:44.080> damage<00:02:44.290> in<00:02:44.680> there

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
it and so there was some damage in there

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.180 
it and so there was some damage in there
and<00:02:46.349> I<00:02:48.150> had<00:02:49.150> my<00:02:49.360> other<00:02:49.510> knee<00:02:49.750> operated<00:02:50.230> on<00:02:50.500> a

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
and I had my other knee operated on a

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.640 
and I had my other knee operated on a
couple<00:02:51.700> of<00:02:51.790> times<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.480> I<00:02:52.989> didn't<00:02:53.260> want<00:02:53.379> to<00:02:53.500> do

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
couple of times and I didn't want to do

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.259 
couple of times and I didn't want to do
that<00:02:53.680> with<00:02:54.040> this<00:02:54.250> needed<00:02:54.849> hadn't<00:02:55.180> been

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
that with this needed hadn't been

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.119 
that with this needed hadn't been
operated<00:02:55.750> on<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:59.140> found<00:02:59.590> two<00:02:59.739> finally

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
operated on so I I found two finally

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.910 
operated on so I I found two finally
found<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.430> procedure<00:03:00.879> that<00:03:01.060> maybe<00:03:02.019> we<00:03:02.200> can<00:03:02.440> get

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
found a procedure that maybe we can get

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.839 
found a procedure that maybe we can get
it<00:03:03.069> to<00:03:03.099> repair<00:03:03.819> itself<00:03:04.260> being<00:03:05.260> that<00:03:05.620> it<00:03:06.099> we're

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
it to repair itself being that it we're

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.880 
it to repair itself being that it we're
pretty<00:03:07.120> sure<00:03:07.209> that<00:03:07.420> it's<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:08.230> cartilage

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
pretty sure that it's a cartilage

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.150 
pretty sure that it's a cartilage
meniscus<00:03:09.640> tear<00:03:10.049> that's<00:03:11.049> it<00:03:11.230> so<00:03:11.680> we're<00:03:11.859> hoping

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
meniscus tear that's it so we're hoping

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.500 
meniscus tear that's it so we're hoping
to<00:03:12.250> regrow<00:03:13.239> cartilage<00:03:14.200> in<00:03:14.560> both<00:03:14.799> knees<00:03:15.510> well

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
to regrow cartilage in both knees well

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.270 
to regrow cartilage in both knees well
we<00:03:16.690> know<00:03:16.870> we're<00:03:17.109> going<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:17.260> regrow<00:03:17.709> it<00:03:17.859> in<00:03:18.099> the

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
we know we're going to regrow it in the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.740 
we know we're going to regrow it in the
one<00:03:18.519> knee<00:03:19.049> that<00:03:20.049> has<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.530> cartilage<00:03:20.980> torn<00:03:21.370> now

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
one knee that has the cartilage torn now

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.420 
one knee that has the cartilage torn now
that's<00:03:22.750> pretty<00:03:23.109> well<00:03:23.319> documented<00:03:24.129> that

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
that's pretty well documented that

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.130 
that's pretty well documented that
that's<00:03:24.700> going<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:25.000> work<00:03:25.150> just<00:03:25.420> fine<00:03:25.660> they<00:03:25.959> have

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
that's going to work just fine they have

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.490 
that's going to work just fine they have
the<00:03:26.260> procedure<00:03:26.650> in<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.430> other<00:03:27.579> knee<00:03:28.500> both

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
the procedure in the other knee both

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.259 
the procedure in the other knee both
meniscus<00:03:30.099> a--'s<00:03:30.280> have<00:03:30.489> been<00:03:30.669> removed<00:03:31.060> in

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
meniscus a--'s have been removed in

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.470 
meniscus a--'s have been removed in
previous<00:03:31.750> surgeries<00:03:32.349> due<00:03:32.739> to<00:03:32.919> tears<00:03:33.250> in<00:03:33.669> the

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
previous surgeries due to tears in the

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.970 
previous surgeries due to tears in the
past<00:03:36.000> they<00:03:37.000> weren't<00:03:37.269> scoped<00:03:37.690> they<00:03:38.470> just<00:03:38.709> went

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
past they weren't scoped they just went

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.729 
past they weren't scoped they just went
in<00:03:39.099> there<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:39.599> removed<00:03:40.599> the<00:03:40.810> entire<00:03:41.139> meniscus

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
in there and removed the entire meniscus

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.809 
in there and removed the entire meniscus
so<00:03:41.919> we're<00:03:42.099> going<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.280> actually<00:03:42.489> try<00:03:43.209> to<00:03:44.819> start

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
so we're going to actually try to start

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.629 
so we're going to actually try to start
over<00:03:45.970> in<00:03:46.299> there<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:46.630> see<00:03:46.840> if<00:03:46.930> we<00:03:47.079> can<00:03:47.639> roca

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
over in there and see if we can roca

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:49.980 
over in there and see if we can roca
gross<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:49.419> luminous

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
gross and luminous

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.960 
gross and luminous
not<00:03:50.470> it<00:03:50.680> and<00:03:51.040> what's<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.370> condition<00:03:51.400> of

neither<00:04:04.720> other<00:04:05.410> than<00:04:05.650> just<00:04:06.130> just<00:04:06.580> until<00:04:06.910> I<00:04:06.940> had

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
neither other than just just until I had

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.480 
neither other than just just until I had
that<00:04:07.390> one<00:04:07.630> pop<00:04:07.930> but<00:04:08.530> it<00:04:08.650> wasn't<00:04:09.070> a<00:04:09.130> ligament

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
that one pop but it wasn't a ligament

that one pop but it wasn't a ligament
and<00:04:09.670> I<00:04:09.760> could<00:04:09.940> tell<00:04:10.150> because<00:04:10.330> I<00:04:10.510> know<00:04:10.660> what<00:04:11.020> it

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
and I could tell because I know what it

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.370 
and I could tell because I know what it
feels<00:04:11.170> like<00:04:11.650> when<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.550> ligament<00:04:13.030> tears

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
feels like when the ligament tears

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.860 
feels like when the ligament tears
that's<00:04:14.380> what<00:04:14.590> happened<00:04:14.980> in<00:04:15.100> the<00:04:15.250> left<00:04:15.460> knee

specifically<00:04:31.570> what<00:04:32.380> sort<00:04:32.710> of<00:04:33.000> expectations

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
specifically what sort of expectations

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.380 
specifically what sort of expectations
are<00:04:34.150> you<00:04:34.240> hoping<00:04:34.540> from<00:04:34.750> the<00:04:34.900> street<00:04:35.850> well<00:04:36.850> it's

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
are you hoping from the street well it's

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.080 
are you hoping from the street well it's
it's<00:04:38.170> somewhat<00:04:38.680> experimental<00:04:39.040> but<00:04:39.700> at<00:04:39.970> the

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
it's somewhat experimental but at the

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.500 
it's somewhat experimental but at the
same<00:04:40.300> time<00:04:41.160> there's<00:04:42.160> been<00:04:42.400> a<00:04:42.460> lot<00:04:42.730> of<00:04:42.760> progress

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
same time there's been a lot of progress

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.490 
same time there's been a lot of progress
and<00:04:43.990> I'm<00:04:44.080> thinking<00:04:44.970> in<00:04:45.970> i'm<00:04:46.690> looking<00:04:46.960> to<00:04:47.170> get
