not<00:04:36.380> buy<00:04:36.500> the<00:04:36.560> 3ds<00:04:36.920> but<00:04:37.190> this<00:04:37.340> is<00:04:37.460> something<00:04:37.640> I

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
not buy the 3ds but this is something I

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
they get packaged with hardware yeah

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.780 
they get packaged with hardware yeah
they're<00:05:18.020> throw<00:05:18.320> away<00:05:18.470> tacos<00:05:18.800> usually<00:05:19.100> this<00:05:19.580> is

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790

I<00:05:23.300> think<00:05:23.360> the<00:05:23.630> launch<00:05:23.840> lineup<00:05:24.020> is<00:05:24.230> actually

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
I think the launch lineup is actually

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.810 
I think the launch lineup is actually
pretty<00:05:24.650> sorry<00:05:24.890> I<00:05:25.070> think<00:05:25.310> the<00:05:25.490> one<00:05:25.640> thing<00:05:25.760> that

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
pretty sorry I think the one thing that

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.520 
pretty sorry I think the one thing that
I'm<00:05:26.030> hoping<00:05:26.330> that<00:05:26.480> Sony<00:05:26.690> will<00:05:26.870> do<00:05:27.020> is<00:05:27.230> that

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
I'm hoping that Sony will do is that

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.930 
I'm hoping that Sony will do is that
they<00:05:27.620> will<00:05:27.710> help<00:05:27.950> distinguish<00:05:28.400> the<00:05:28.550> Vita<00:05:28.730> from

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
they will help distinguish the Vita from

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.670 
they will help distinguish the Vita from
the<00:05:29.030> ps3<00:05:29.330> that<00:05:29.720> you<00:05:29.840> don't<00:05:30.020> have<00:05:30.170> too<00:05:30.590> many

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
the ps3 that you don't have too many

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.500 
the ps3 that you don't have too many
resistances<00:05:31.280> and<00:05:31.460> on<00:05:31.550> charges<00:05:31.970> that<00:05:32.030> they

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
resistances and on charges that they

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.120 
resistances and on charges that they
make<00:05:32.690> it<00:05:32.810> its<00:05:32.960> own<00:05:33.170> system<00:05:33.440> they<00:05:33.740> can<00:05:33.830> find<00:05:34.040> a

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
make it its own system they can find a

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.680 
make it its own system they can find a
new<00:05:34.160> market<00:05:34.640> because<00:05:34.850> now<00:05:35.030> that's<00:05:35.300> that's<00:05:35.510> the

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
new market because now that's that's the

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.480 
new market because now that's that's the
easy<00:05:35.870> crotch<00:05:36.140> for<00:05:36.380> them<00:05:36.470> okay<00:05:36.830> I<00:05:36.860> would<00:05:37.160> really
