00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
and right here where the seam is

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.820 
and right here where the seam is
I<00:01:26.270> just<00:01:26.960> unglue<00:01:27.380> it<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:33.110> I<00:01:33.170> take<00:01:33.410> it<00:01:33.530> apart

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
I just unglue it and I take it apart

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.670 
I just unglue it and I take it apart
just<00:01:34.430> like<00:01:34.550> that<00:01:34.820> and<00:01:35.660> where<00:01:35.899> all<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.350> seams

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
just like that and where all the seams

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.930 
just like that and where all the seams
are<00:01:37.960> like<00:01:38.960> right<00:01:39.410> across<00:01:39.590> here<00:01:40.100> all<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.850> way

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
are like right across here all the way

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.690 
are like right across here all the way
down<00:01:40.970> I<00:01:41.420> take<00:01:42.140> that<00:01:42.350> off<00:01:42.410> with<00:01:43.070> an<00:01:43.190> exacto

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
down I take that off with an exacto

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.060 
down I take that off with an exacto
knife<00:01:43.910> I<00:01:44.149> usually<00:01:45.110> do<00:01:45.259> it<00:01:45.380> from<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.619> inside

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
knife I usually do it from the inside

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.749 
knife I usually do it from the inside
because<00:01:46.600> if<00:01:47.600> I<00:01:47.780> do<00:01:47.840> it<00:01:48.200> from<00:01:49.160> the<00:01:49.310> other<00:01:49.460> side

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
because if I do it from the other side

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.120 
because if I do it from the other side
it<00:01:50.000> has<00:01:50.090> like<00:01:50.360> a<00:01:50.390> coating<00:01:50.960> on<00:01:51.110> it<00:01:51.320> that<00:01:51.770> doesn't

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
it has like a coating on it that doesn't

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.100 
it has like a coating on it that doesn't
cut<00:01:52.310> very<00:01:52.550> well<00:01:52.759> so<00:01:53.630> you<00:01:53.690> just<00:01:53.869> take<00:01:54.050> your

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
cut very well so you just take your

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.180 
cut very well so you just take your
exacto<00:01:54.800> and<00:01:55.160> just<00:01:55.310> go<00:01:55.490> ride<00:01:56.590> just<00:01:57.590> follow<00:01:57.920> the

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
exacto and just go ride just follow the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:05.770 
exacto and just go ride just follow the
crease<00:01:58.549> of<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:58.850> box<00:02:00.430> and<00:02:01.869> go<00:02:02.869> ahead<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:04.780> cut

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
crease of the box and go ahead and cut

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.750 
crease of the box and go ahead and cut
this<00:02:05.930> down<00:02:07.989> so<00:02:08.989> when<00:02:09.590> you<00:02:09.679> do<00:02:09.830> it<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:10.130> have<00:02:10.160> one

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
this down so when you do it you have one

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.030 
this down so when you do it you have one
panel<00:02:11.180> like<00:02:11.390> this<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:11.810> has<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.200> two<00:02:12.380> ends<00:02:12.890> on

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
panel like this it has the two ends on

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.170 
panel like this it has the two ends on
both<00:02:13.760> sides<00:02:14.799> and<00:02:15.799> I<00:02:16.190> just<00:02:16.430> fold<00:02:16.640> those<00:02:16.760> up<00:02:16.820> and

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
both sides and I just fold those up and

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.270 
both sides and I just fold those up and
then<00:02:17.269> cut<00:02:17.450> these<00:02:17.570> off<00:02:17.780> also<00:02:18.880> so<00:02:19.880> just<00:02:21.250> like<00:02:22.250> I

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
then cut these off also so just like I

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.250 
then cut these off also so just like I
said<00:02:22.549> just<00:02:22.580> follow<00:02:22.940> on<00:02:23.360> I<00:02:23.780> don't<00:02:23.840> have<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.170> be

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
said just follow on I don't have to be

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.370 
said just follow on I don't have to be
perfectly<00:02:24.680> straight<00:02:26.019> nobody's<00:02:27.019> gonna<00:02:27.140> know

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
perfectly straight nobody's gonna know

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.420

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
once I get them cut off then I measure

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.830 
once I get them cut off then I measure
this<00:02:39.040> piece<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:41.140> see<00:02:41.950> how<00:02:42.129> wide<00:02:42.370> it<00:02:42.549> is<00:02:42.579> and<00:02:43.030> I

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
this piece and see how wide it is and I
