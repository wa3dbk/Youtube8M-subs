 we are entering for a new video 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.969
 it's true that it's a little bit not 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:15.059

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:18.340

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.320
 even a little more time but good gp 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.460
 too long the timer right now 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.859
 although still two holiday months 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.210
 I could have done it during these two 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.240
 months but burn like a big con I the 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.609

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.860
 only one week before school 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.110

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.640
 So while I hope before you went 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.860
 a good holiday - I did not give in 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.570
 a good holiday despite the 2014 weather 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.750
 so trunked for a new 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.880
 crash is a crack pc or a tutorial 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.470
 that allow you to crack truck 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.300
 simulator of a crate truck 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.800
 simulator 2 so this is a kamin game 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.390
 so here we create his business so 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 we live it's really very realistic hic 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.750
 so after that I invite you to go see 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.550
 youtube videos of gameplay etc 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.410
 I'm here to explain 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.020
 how crack is already bicycles 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.640
 fake widower in guide at this point 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.130
 excuse me it will take you to 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.580
 software so it's going to take us some 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.560
 torrent 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.150
 what's left of the torrent that 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.410
 is a yes it's the download that 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.360
 allows you to download the games a 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.380
 little more quickly after that depends 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.740
 your connection so me it's already 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.690
 so download normally you have 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.759
 the link in the discretion to fight 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.190
 day when it is downloaded as you 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.850
 see it is in point iso you want 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:30.080
 you will see it on your pc in 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.080
 excuse my pc is a little bit slow 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.190
 so normally you will have a 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.750
 little file like that the withdrawal estimates 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.900
 erroneously wrongly worshiped and 2 2 who will 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:46.690
 downloaded so 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:51.230
 it will be in iso so when these will be 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.580
 how to say yes it will not be there will be 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.200
 not this little sheep head like 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.690
 you see it will be too far it will be a 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.950
 point iso this is normal since the 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.960
 iso bridges are used for games 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.580
 psp wii games or games 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.420

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.400
 anything but are not 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.080
 converted to ps g2 and so for that it 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.600
 will you have to convert it from game you 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.630
 put it read in the aggression of the software 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.520
 virtual clonedrive so scared on the spot 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.620
 even close ding allows me to create a 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.060
 new driver in your pc that allows 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.790
 to record games in iso point 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.340
 that it is retransmitted in point the hic this 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.230
 which will allow you to play them so 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.760
 you put the parameters like me I 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.080

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.790
 put it so you have a fucking 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.410
 good pc I might have pc morals 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.760

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.410
 you do it is you put displayed 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.000
 the virtual icon czech conserve 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.380
 Mounted Mounted Images History 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.840
 automatic the latest images on 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.180
 rest you uncheck language level you 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.040
 put French frankly what if you 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.600

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.250
 want information will leave you to 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.140
 traces but then you do ok 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.959
 then it may take a little bit 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.700
 a lot of time you have your 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.850
 computer is going to get me to row 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.500
 like a big pig so when these 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.970
 has finished rowing not your Lemétayer 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.010
 pc is facing a goal that makes louis 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.230
 driver when this new driver writes 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.620
 so as you see me I have my 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.770
 dvdrw player I have my back and I mandate 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.720
 older the microsoft so normally he 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.050
 you created a new partition so 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.320
 the drives bd rom so of which there are 550 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:28.550
 lots of books on it next when those 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.960
 here's writing your iso file there you 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.030
 right click on it 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.320
 so I saw my pc ream the right click 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.990
 but a little more time but good 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.940
 then you get up do you do 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.160
 I mean you get reopened with 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.320
 mount filed with virtual clonedrive 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.490
 hair does not make you choose as dan 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.450
 is wrong and then you are looking for a 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:49.820
 file 8 be clonedrive then that goes 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.470
 you the min is so it can take 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.930
 a little bit of time including once 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.240
 these have made you redone again 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.740
 a right click on this software on this 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.390
 link I mean you do 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.250
 here you have this thing that opened 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.500
 makes you open folders 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.360
 so how do you have you 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.920
 have four files that interests us 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.280
 or we do not care about it, we do not care 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.650
 a little 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.320
 you close you right click 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:16.010

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.900
 explain how to install 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.640
 because it's an installation 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.950
 basics of a game like every 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.200
 old so you open happy if the 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.220

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.220
 key who wanted to see me that there was a 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.450
