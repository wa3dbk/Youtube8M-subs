you see that red line all around there

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.130 
you see that red line all around there
now<00:01:52.530> when<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:52.950> do<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:54.630> way<00:01:54.750> I'm<00:01:54.930> doing

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
now when you do this the way I'm doing

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.380 
now when you do this the way I'm doing
it<00:01:55.290> with<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.530> big<00:01:55.710> grinder<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.969> always<00:01:57.210> want

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
it with the big grinder you always want

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.270 
it with the big grinder you always want
to<00:01:57.450> cut<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.110> inside<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:58.950> line

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
to cut to the inside of this line

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.149 
to cut to the inside of this line
because<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.390> line<00:02:00.689> marks<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.380> outside<00:02:01.950> edge

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
because this line marks the outside edge

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.999 
because this line marks the outside edge
of<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.990> otherwise<00:02:03.990> you'll<00:02:04.259> get<00:02:04.409> too<00:02:04.710> big

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
of that and otherwise you'll get too big

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.370 
of that and otherwise you'll get too big
and<00:02:05.219> then<00:02:06.119> you'll<00:02:06.299> have<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.479> really<00:02:07.079> hard<00:02:07.200> time

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
and then you'll have a really hard time

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.360 
and then you'll have a really hard time

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
this all up and show you guys when I got

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.720 
this all up and show you guys when I got
what<00:05:48.540> I'm<00:05:48.630> done<00:05:48.810> there<00:05:49.440> we<00:05:49.560> go<00:05:49.740> forget<00:05:50.520> it<00:05:50.550> all

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
what I'm done there we go forget it all

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.990 
what I'm done there we go forget it all
braised<00:05:51.030> around<00:05:51.980> it<00:05:52.980> ain't<00:05:53.220> real<00:05:53.400> pretty<00:05:53.760> but

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
braised around it ain't real pretty but

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.720 
braised around it ain't real pretty but
I<00:05:54.300> wasn't<00:05:54.570> being<00:05:54.930> real<00:05:55.140> precise<00:05:55.620> with<00:05:55.920> it<00:05:56.130> if

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.730 
I wasn't being real precise with it if

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.130 
I wasn't being real precise with it if
I'd<00:05:56.910> have<00:05:57.030> been<00:05:57.150> doing<00:05:57.390> it<00:05:57.510> all<00:05:57.600> kinds<00:05:58.080> of

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.140 
I'd have been doing it all kinds of

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.630 
I'd have been doing it all kinds of
right<00:05:58.320> I'd<00:05:58.500> have<00:05:58.620> been<00:05:58.710> using<00:05:59.040> a<00:05:59.100> dremel<00:05:59.310> tool

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
right I'd have been using a dremel tool

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.530 
right I'd have been using a dremel tool
for<00:05:59.940> my<00:06:00.030> cuts<00:06:00.710> or<00:06:01.710> a<00:06:01.770> plasma<00:06:02.490> cutter<00:06:02.670> which<00:06:03.270> we

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
for my cuts or a plasma cutter which we

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.360 
for my cuts or a plasma cutter which we
don't<00:06:03.660> have<00:06:03.810> out<00:06:04.110> here<00:06:04.350> but<00:06:04.590> haven't<00:06:05.280> ever

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
don't have out here but haven't ever

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.790 
don't have out here but haven't ever
really<00:06:05.490> needed<00:06:06.180> one<00:06:06.510> and<00:06:06.720> I'd<00:06:07.530> have<00:06:07.680> been

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
really needed one and I'd have been

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.980 
really needed one and I'd have been
using<00:06:07.980> a<00:06:08.160> wire<00:06:08.340> feed<00:06:08.610> welder<00:06:08.880> and<00:06:09.210> then<00:06:09.630> an<00:06:09.780> if

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
using a wire feed welder and then an if

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.590 
using a wire feed welder and then an if
I<00:06:10.140> have<00:06:10.350> done<00:06:11.280> it<00:06:11.430> like<00:06:11.640> the<00:06:11.850> bodywork<00:06:12.360> way

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
I have done it like the bodywork way

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.720 
I have done it like the bodywork way
then<00:06:13.470> I<00:06:13.560> would<00:06:13.740> have<00:06:13.770> finished<00:06:13.980> off<00:06:14.370> by

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:14.730 
then I would have finished off by

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.960 
then I would have finished off by
grinding<00:06:15.090> down<00:06:15.480> my<00:06:15.780> well<00:06:16.520> finishing<00:06:17.520> it<00:06:17.790> like

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
grinding down my well finishing it like

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.320 
grinding down my well finishing it like
so<00:06:19.040> but<00:06:20.040> this<00:06:20.190> is<00:06:20.310> a<00:06:20.370> good<00:06:20.580> technique<00:06:20.820> to<00:06:21.060> know

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
so but this is a good technique to know

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.480 
so but this is a good technique to know
I<00:06:21.360> mean<00:06:21.660> it<00:06:21.780> gives<00:06:21.960> you<00:06:22.080> the<00:06:22.200> basics<00:06:22.710> for<00:06:23.010> how

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
I mean it gives you the basics for how

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.120 
I mean it gives you the basics for how
to<00:06:23.550> do<00:06:23.850> many<00:06:24.780> simple<00:06:25.230> things<00:06:25.470> like<00:06:25.710> this<00:06:25.920> I

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
to do many simple things like this I

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.950 
to do many simple things like this I
mean<00:06:26.280> something<00:06:26.820> like<00:06:27.000> this<00:06:27.180> can<00:06:27.360> be<00:06:27.540> used<00:06:27.750> to

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
mean something like this can be used to

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.430 
mean something like this can be used to
fix<00:06:28.260> to<00:06:28.560> fix<00:06:29.550> a<00:06:29.700> rust<00:06:29.970> patch<00:06:30.270> like<00:06:30.690> this<00:06:31.020> of

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
fix to fix a rust patch like this of

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.930 
fix to fix a rust patch like this of
course<00:06:31.650> I'm<00:06:31.830> not<00:06:32.040> going<00:06:32.220> to<00:06:32.280> do<00:06:32.430> that<00:06:32.460> on<00:06:32.760> this

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
course I'm not going to do that on this

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.130 
course I'm not going to do that on this
vehicle<00:06:33.210> just<00:06:33.720> just<00:06:34.560> because<00:06:34.980> or<00:06:35.900> the<00:06:36.900> floor

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140 
vehicle just just because or the floor

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.900 
vehicle just just because or the floor
panels<00:06:37.590> it's<00:06:37.770> probably<00:06:38.160> the<00:06:38.340> same<00:06:38.550> way<00:06:38.760> I'll

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
panels it's probably the same way I'll

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.120 
panels it's probably the same way I'll
fix<00:06:39.150> the<00:06:39.300> floor<00:06:39.510> panels<00:06:39.930> either<00:06:40.620> that<00:06:40.740> or<00:06:40.890> I'll

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.130 
fix the floor panels either that or I'll

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:46.580 
fix the floor panels either that or I'll
just<00:06:41.340> get<00:06:41.490> some<00:06:41.730> like<00:06:41.910> 16<00:06:42.810> gauge<00:06:43.080> steel<00:06:45.590> and

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 
just get some like 16 gauge steel and

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.300 
just get some like 16 gauge steel and
form<00:06:47.580> it<00:06:47.700> and<00:06:47.910> weld<00:06:48.120> it<00:06:48.270> in<00:06:48.980> one<00:06:49.980> thing<00:06:50.160> or<00:06:50.280> the

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.310 
form it and weld it in one thing or the

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.600 
form it and weld it in one thing or the
other<00:06:50.400> or<00:06:51.330> I<00:06:51.360> could<00:06:51.600> just<00:06:51.810> leave<00:06:52.140> it<00:06:52.230> alone<00:06:52.610> who

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
other or I could just leave it alone who

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.390 
other or I could just leave it alone who
knows<00:06:53.850> but<00:06:54.780> you<00:06:55.380> know<00:06:55.500> this<00:06:55.680> technique<00:06:56.190> can<00:06:56.220> be

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 
knows but you know this technique can be

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.280 
knows but you know this technique can be
used<00:06:56.490> for<00:06:56.790> a<00:06:56.910> lot<00:06:57.060> of<00:06:57.120> different<00:06:57.240> things<00:06:57.720> like

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:58.290 
used for a lot of different things like

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.980 
used for a lot of different things like
