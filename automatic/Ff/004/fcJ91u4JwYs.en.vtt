00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
it I'm trying to do this with one hand

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.660 
it I'm trying to do this with one hand
so<00:01:57.049> that's<00:01:58.049> why<00:01:58.320> it's<00:01:58.469> kind<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.649> shaky<00:01:58.890> but

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
so that's why it's kind of shaky but

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.330 
so that's why it's kind of shaky but
anyways<00:02:00.090> when<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.479> spawn<00:02:00.979> see<00:02:01.979> there's<00:02:02.219> an

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
anyways when you spawn see there's an

anyways when you spawn see there's an
NPC<00:02:02.820> village<00:02:02.850> right<00:02:03.360> there<00:02:04.549> try<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.610> find<00:02:05.850> an

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000

NPC village right there try to find an
NPC<00:02:06.450> village<00:02:06.920> probably<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.009> easiest<00:02:08.369> way<00:02:08.640> is

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
NPC village probably the easiest way is

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.720 
NPC village probably the easiest way is
to<00:02:09.300> do<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.349> it's<00:02:10.530> just<00:02:10.830> pull<00:02:11.099> out<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.340> map

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
to do it it's just pull out a map

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.790 
to do it it's just pull out a map
because<00:02:12.120> they<00:02:12.450> show<00:02:12.720> up<00:02:12.930> on<00:02:13.200> your<00:02:13.410> ass

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
because they show up on your ass

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.740 
because they show up on your ass
and<00:02:14.010> then<00:02:14.160> just<00:02:14.430> sprint<00:02:14.940> around<00:02:15.240> until<00:02:15.660> you

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
and then just sprint around until you

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.270 
and then just sprint around until you
find<00:02:15.990> one<00:02:16.170> on<00:02:16.320> your<00:02:16.440> map<00:02:16.620> where<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:16.920> see<00:02:17.100> one

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
find one on your map where you see one

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.070 
find one on your map where you see one
yourself<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.980> then<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:21.690> guys<00:02:21.870> are<00:02:21.990> probably

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
yourself and then you guys are probably

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.690 
yourself and then you guys are probably
wondering<00:02:22.290> like<00:02:22.650> how<00:02:22.950> would<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.520> ever

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
wondering like how would you ever

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.320 
wondering like how would you ever
survive<00:02:24.330> on<00:02:24.630> this<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:25.710> know<00:02:25.830> whatever<00:02:26.070> so<00:02:26.790> you

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
survive on this you know whatever so you

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.170 
survive on this you know whatever so you
could<00:02:27.510> break<00:02:27.750> this<00:02:28.200> wheat<00:02:28.800> farm<00:02:29.250> water<00:02:29.730> right

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
could break this wheat farm water right

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.960 
could break this wheat farm water right
here<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:31.350> could<00:02:31.590> take<00:02:32.190> these<00:02:32.430> wooden<00:02:32.790> planks

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
here you could take these wooden planks

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.770 
here you could take these wooden planks
and<00:02:33.780> then<00:02:34.020> take<00:02:34.290> this<00:02:34.500> stone<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.610> make<00:02:36.480> stone

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
and then take this stone and make stone

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.940 
and then take this stone and make stone
pickaxes<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.530> stone<00:02:38.120> swords<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.330> stuff<00:02:39.950> and

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
pickaxes and stone swords and stuff and

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.260 
pickaxes and stone swords and stuff and
so<00:02:41.490> it's<00:02:41.930> kind<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:43.050> just<00:02:43.170> like<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.500> fun<00:02:44.280> game

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
so it's kind of just like a fun game

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.710 
so it's kind of just like a fun game
mode<00:02:45.660> type<00:02:46.500> thing<00:02:46.770> such<00:02:47.250> as<00:02:47.400> Skyblock<00:02:48.210> to<00:02:48.480> play

really<00:02:54.240> like<00:02:54.590> make<00:02:55.590> this<00:02:56.090> you<00:02:57.090> know<00:02:57.210> cuz<00:02:57.480> super

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
really like make this you know cuz super

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.890 
really like make this you know cuz super
flat<00:02:58.200> world<00:02:58.380> was<00:02:58.620> already<00:02:58.800> in<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.250> game<00:02:59.450> but<00:03:00.450> I

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
flat world was already in the game but I

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.300 
flat world was already in the game but I
kind<00:03:01.470> of<00:03:01.590> just<00:03:01.860> thought<00:03:02.330> of<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.480> idea<00:03:03.510> of

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
kind of just thought of the idea of

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.730 
kind of just thought of the idea of
maybe<00:03:05.310> trying<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.790> survive<00:03:06.120> in<00:03:06.570> a<00:03:07.260> super<00:03:07.530> flat

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
maybe trying to survive in a super flat

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.370 
maybe trying to survive in a super flat
world<00:03:10.220> but<00:03:11.360> anyways<00:03:12.360> it's<00:03:12.870> pretty<00:03:13.140> fun

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
world but anyways it's pretty fun

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.820 
world but anyways it's pretty fun
actually<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:14.340> build<00:03:14.520> like<00:03:15.230> try<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.260> survive

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
actually to build like try to survive

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.660 
actually to build like try to survive
you<00:03:17.640> know<00:03:17.790> like<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.450> can
