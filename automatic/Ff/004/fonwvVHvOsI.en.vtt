00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.910
 5 reasons why a PC starts and is 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.360
 turn off alone 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.219
 reason 1 the voltage of the electrical network 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.590
 is too low and the source of 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:19.450
 PC power cut by excess of 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:23.260
 current solution install a ups 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:28.340
 uninterrupted power system note 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:32.840
 power whats equal to voltage volts per 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.000
 current amps and equals tc ergo for 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.699
 deliver a constant power value 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.710
 if the voltage decreases, the current 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:43.010
 Increase by burning the tracks 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:47.780
 by howl law among others 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.940
 reason 2 the almost internal temperature of the 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.550
 cabinet exceeds 20 degrees above 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.960
 of the ambient temperature and the ptc of 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.550
 the motherboard shuts down by excess solution 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.399
 install a color that reinforces the 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.460
 cfm cubic feet per meter of air 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:07.840
 displaced inside the cabinet achieve 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.390
 more than 28 cfm for each cular installed 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.020
 note the cfm value can be read in the 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.000
 technical specifications of each cular 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.149
 note 2 respect the meaning of 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.039
 Air circulation inside the cabinet 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.140
 he enters from the front and is expelled by 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.800
 the back part in accordance with the 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.800
 power supply 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.820
 reason 3 the power source has less 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.170
 power in watts or is at the limit with 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.430
 regarding the consumption of the solution team 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.549
 replace the source with another one with 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.940
 less 400 watts more power than the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.000
 already installed is not happening very often 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.340
 when we add more hard drives 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.670
 ram memory dvd players or 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.740
 blu-ray and the pc note 2 would be 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.290
 advisable to measure the tension of pg 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.570
 power wood from the fountain with a 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.020
 multimeter and verify that it is in 5 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:08.250
 Exact volts in the gray cable 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.450
 Reason 4 CD drive or hard drive 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.090
 with mechanism in short solution 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.980
 disconnect disks 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.900
 DVD recorders and use a tester 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.940
 of source to determine which of the 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.629
 different tensions is absent or 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.610
 failing note can also be used 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.610
 a common multimeter on the scale of 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.650
 voltage to measure the 12 volts 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.349
 dedicated to power engines and 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.860
 5 volts that feed the plates 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:40.500
 logic note 2 a deviation from the 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.230
 measurements up to 5% below and 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.670
 above 5 or 12 volts is acceptable 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.260
 as right reason 5 the button 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.660
 ignition of the cabinet is in 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.950
 Short turns off every 6 seconds 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.019
 approximately solution using a 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.120
 tester in the bipar function or 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.700
 continuity verify the correct 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.900
 switch operation or 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.629
 push button for the current systems x 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:14.000
 that's all for today I hope it serves them 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:20.930
 and if so, please say a hug 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.930
