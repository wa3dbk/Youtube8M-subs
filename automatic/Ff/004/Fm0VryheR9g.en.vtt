00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.080
 available only in japan korea 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.160
 you already have credit for what you do 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.040
 treats lg optimus gt 5 and a half inches 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.000
 the display really really studying 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.489
 a full hd display with 400 pixels per 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.350
 thumb that reproduces colors and yield 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.150
 in a fabulous way we wanted to do 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.940
 review we have already uploaded of I'm for 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.489
 show you the fidelity of white colors 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.430
 really white our site in the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.769
 desktop version also for others heavy 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.769
 really really nice I have to say 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.500
 a display as few have seen 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.870
 personally I had not yet seen 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.460
 playing a full hd display e 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.650
 I must say that this is really right 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.160
 as if there is some video show it 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.740
 friends is right there is no car in 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:19.740
 taking live boys therefore playmovies 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:22.229
 let's see if there is any reference to the a 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.080
 look for the gallery called because 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.740
 we found a video we see of 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.340
 play it 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.340
 and so we have 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.850
 obviously the video is loaded with a 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.640
 color specifically to favor the region 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.659
 the display does not look that good 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.149
 really a lesson 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:45.100
 the spectacular candy 5 inches and a half 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.049
 400 pixels for funds heard of everything 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.039

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:53.530
 1.7 ghz the camera is a 13 megapixel camera 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:57.899
 rear and a 2 megapixel front 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.899
 the battery from 3,000 to 140,000 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.880

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.040
 another of the news that will be present 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.890

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.050

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.730
 customizable led that we can go 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.730

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.709
 we can activate it deactivate a 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.330
 this customizable point not in the 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.190
 choice of color but in the assignment 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.920
 of the notifications we want to receive ad 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.270
 a color already prepared as I said 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.270
 raffaele has announced that this 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.850
 will also be present in the series 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.530
 l twice very good to win the 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.720
 left at the back button on the right 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.530
 settings button the interface is the 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.630
 which lg optimus 3.0 as a series 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.100
 difficult that moves then tomorrow 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.220
 in the meeting I had with Raffaele vi 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.500
 we will show in more detail the 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.390
 design is very beautiful 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.280
 it looks very very fine too 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.740
 light despite 5 inches and a half 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.090
 let's see this is a person lte why 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.640
 as I told you it will not be available 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.290
 for our country, the reverse is true 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.990
 being in plastic, it takes up the design 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.120
 of the nexus all of the optimum camera from 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.000
 13 megapixel rear speaker 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.550
 flash led from this part instead we have 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.050
 the ignition unlock button among other things 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.760
 the cover is now open 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.280
 I wanted to clarify that the battery is 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.819
 immovable and not fixed 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.220
 volume rocker and button 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:24.020

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.730

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.560
 plastic and aluminum with the jack of three 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.230
