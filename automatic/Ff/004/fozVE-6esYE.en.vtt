00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.560
 Hello 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.950
 transformer 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.950
 seemingly ordinary transformer 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:21.220
 here are the sins here 772 792 no need to jump 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.870
 us licensed 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.570
 semi-professional ratio 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:30.760
 transformations buy there and at exit 42 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.760
 gate 4 1 volt jumps like that too 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.940
 no tricky coil fille 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:41.449
 oncoming so on there is similar 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.840
 common to us about the cloud except on 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.340
 lack of influence 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.449
 the amount of chain on the primary ie they are 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.449
 don't see each other 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.850
 I close 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.780
 no cheating such as was 772 792 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.780
 jump that is they 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.210
 and ready free energy generator 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:17.370
 here the top that went to saturation 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:19.770
 core received secondary circuit 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.620
 not only with a trans factor to break 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.930
 about five with a corresponding increase 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.280
 getting five times on this created the whole 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.860
 principle of operation of the generator free 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:34.610
 energy is only important saturation 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:37.100
 core and and non-linear mode and 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.850
 recoil and and 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:46.950
 on the load in the second quarter of the period 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.810
 without affecting the primary circuit in 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.630
 ordinary classic transformer 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:57.330
 it is a linear process that is, we get 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.020
 the current in the primary circuit by changing 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.390
 inductance in the secondary circuit that is 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.230
 load connection given 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.420
 transformer 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:13.590
 this is not there is no load 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:16.160
 chasing the saturation current primary sector 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.520
 Sarmatians song 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:24.260
 primary so say yes let my important 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.550
 whether on current in 1 amp I figuratively speak 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.230
 because I donâ€™t 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:33.200
 allows 1 amp we get the same 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.180
 1 amp at the output but only with 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.920
 transformation ratio such as 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:43.610
 we need everything will depend just as well 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.190
 the stronger the core the better then 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:51.590
 there is and accordingly a wire section in 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:54.850
 principle the end result is on 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:59.420
 as long as you have enough 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:02.150
 how to wind the core so to speak 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:09.110
 the voltage that you need is valid 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:13.940
 300 volts to 1 amp or per thousand 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:16.760
 volt 1 amp no difference then 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.220
 voltage be with that current which 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.959
 whether we are not still but hearts 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:28.760
 only in one case they are not each other 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:31.870
 sees in this case sync 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.000
 changes because change because 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.720
 sync goes on the blue ray as well 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.720
 no change 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:51.520
 that is, they did not lead each other at all 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:55.600
 that is, 1 quarter of the period we have 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.840
 hearty only gets to saturation 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.970
 in the second and and this saturation current 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.090
 pick up in the second quarter translate 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.310
 load i.e. secondary winding 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.950
 transformer 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.840
 This principle made all the generators 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:16.960
 have get current to saturation 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:21.730
 core he is non-linear naturally this 

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:25.290
 for those who will be like to understand when the current 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.520
 core saturation will be maximized 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.690
 then when will be nonlinear 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.520
 volt-ampere characteristic as soon as 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.200
 it's linear means only us very 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.820
 cardio minimum my maximum 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.220
 further there is no point it is just empty 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:46.600
 waste of energy that is it is linear 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:49.800
 the usual transformer is obtained here and 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.750
 all in caps is just done 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:59.620
 electronically cuts off 1 quarter 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:05:01.240
 period from 2 quarter period but their 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.260
 I don't have an oscillator circuit 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.590
 oscillatory circuit 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:08.590
 he has an oscillatory circuit 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:13.710
 not parallel because he needs 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:15.850
 work from blood to more consistently 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.710
 modified as i say last 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:22.450
 because with consistent and not 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:24.820
 we will have from the top we will have 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:31.280
 only stress resonance at 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:35.120
 parallel resonance only thats all 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.850
 Why is it time for him to have consequences? 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.770
 what he needs is modified and in something 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:43.340
 he get voltage resonance 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:47.450
 voltage and current that is, it turns out as 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:51.290
 would he have two resonant moments and 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:53.960
 current and voltage are all tested 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:56.180
 that's why i say so why him 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.030
 need direct current voltage needed and 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:03.590
 voltage to work with blood to that is 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:08.600
 about two or three kilovolts of articles to him on 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:10.970
 regulates saturation current due to 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:15.320
 voltage and cuts off the excess 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:18.770
 current due to the narrow century works you blood 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:22.100
 to goes not just so he cuts off 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:25.840
 will go to work the tabletop in the secondary 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:29.389
 chains so to speak controlled throttle 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.270
 which starts working at that moment 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:34.520
 when only the current is cut off 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:38.800
 respectively, through the inductor waiting 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.800
 direct and choke in the secondary circuit 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:44.900
 up to this point 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:47.630
 secondary load circuit does not see in 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:51.910
 the action of the primary circuit and the inverse 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:56.180
 but the whole thing 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:07:00.500
 Kapanadze he specifically calculated 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:06.169
 under load if the load is less 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:07.880
 than himself designed the generator if at 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:11.479
 it has problems in the primary circuit that is 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:13.669
 jet resistance be walking in 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:16.930
 primary circuit i.e. it will be already 

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:20.720
 load same converter 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:26.720
 tension and warm up accordingly 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:28.160
 will be the core so if it him 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:33.080
 made two kilovolts 

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:36.160
 connect a kilowatt generator to one 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.160
 or there for 500 

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.380
 wat 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:43.340
 can but will bask in the core 

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.360
 accordingly there will be a load on 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.220
 converters 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.960
 nothing good but they will not 

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.410
 variegated and transformer before 

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.610
 the core is crimson anyway 

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:56.060
 the converter is wrong firstly because 

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:58.580
 that reactive currents in it do not walk in 

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.290
 such a volume and convert to come 

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.170
 kirdyk 

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:06.190
 This is definitely what happened to him. 

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:11.530
 basically in the last video when he 

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:14.740
 turned on the garland of lamps on the Russian all 

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.740
 bye everyone
