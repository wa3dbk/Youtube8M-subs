 a few minutes because net tells you about 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.800
 powerful and more frightening and real that has 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.460

 around here in the description and attentive 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.980
 because a developer of deus ex will 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.950
 complaint about the resemblance of black ops 3 with 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.770
 the title with its title does not and is that 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.050
 well you know that during this afternoon 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.190
 in the channel we have published the news of 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.280

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.480
 at the sony level and then in microsoft 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.580
 and then, well, like 20 minutes 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.810
 after having posted the trailer there 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.880
 you have the proof in the source in the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.009
 description in the on twitter 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.070
 or call of duty the official twitter of 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.590
 call of duty for good public trailer and 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.229
 just minutes later seconds later 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.070
 if you have published it from the account 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.289
 official deus ex verified account 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.560
 name call of duty and the image comes out 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:30.420
 of a kitten the truth is that the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.670
 own developers of deus ex have 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.460
 showed his own discontent both to 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.280
 through twitter as well to 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.280
 through the game art director 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.409
 in both statements you can see how 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.720
 an ironic tone expressing his rejection of 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.209
 the call of duty franchise that follows 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.840
 the plot that they tell their own games 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:53.880
 not on the limits of the advances 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.219
 technological 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.950
 the truth is that for good sprinkled 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.590
 they have really stung and splashed to base 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.710
 of good it is necessary to say it not all there is 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.329
 controversy do not go to the brain we are going to 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.880
 see how all this ends the truth is 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.459
 what 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.530
 all this suits the deus saga and 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.540
 the truth is that it is a very saga 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.610
 Undervalued, of course, because they are not 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.840
 his games about the last one is a 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.250
 after this one is very well is very well 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.489
 the game so if you have not 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.410
 tested and tested and nothing more and 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.140
 you know everything came because of the argument 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.450
 to enter this afternoon what is is 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:37.200
 quite similar what counts not 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.879
 so nothing but great itch itch 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.280
 polemics to the pse that is and between 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.480
 developers and nothing else 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.150
 thank you all for being there lake and 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.489
 favorites and tell from you who you choose 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.959
