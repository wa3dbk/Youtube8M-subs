00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:14.309

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:16.679
 simple and very fast that good is done 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.369

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:24.240
 very cheap and here is everything 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.449
 we need this is a bit of breeding bird 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.570
 or of chicken extract mixed with 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:35.039
 curry as you see in very few advancing 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:38.250
 some noodles and this is a 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:42.899
 normal levels first of all that 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:46.010
 let's do is mix in a bowl 250 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.010
 milliliters of water 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.940
 a little oil 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:56.690
 and the chicken extract mixed with the 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:01:00.320
 curry now 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:04.480
 and we put the mixture in the microwave to a 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.480
 Average temperature for 30 seconds 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.429
 i 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.160
 when we have removed it from the microwave 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.940
 and so we introduce the noodles in 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.940
 Two parts 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.390
 and re-introduce the microwave 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.390
 a high power for 30 seconds 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.100
 ah 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.100
 i 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.830
 with this we will get the videos 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:49.140
 that were submerged soften and 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:51.570
 we can enter all in the bowl 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.200
 when we have the submerged noodles 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.720
 completely in the bowl we put it to the 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:03.229
 microwave at a high power during 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.229
 45 minutes depends how you like it 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.780
 and we would have it ready this is the 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.020
 texture and the look that they would have 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.420
 our noodles 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:26.640
 as you see then very a recipe very 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.230
