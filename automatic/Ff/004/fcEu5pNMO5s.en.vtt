00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.170
 lifesaver and by the end of the 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.940
 match actually in injury time all 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.620

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.620
 I am good at running 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.060

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.400

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.489
 I really care about him 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.989
 and I care about him but it doesn't come 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.730
 more good with him i hope off the ground 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.080
 the materials club goes into fifa 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.030
 are therefore those to the first division 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.010
 what that should do with him every year so yes 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.940
 I win 3 one points so that I 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.350
 win the title 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.850

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.260

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.310
 I participate in competitions 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.310
 lost so yes not that long 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.840
 I did not want the next one 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.680
 match is against this team and he is coming 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.030
 on a 0 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.800
 but luckily I fight back because off 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.900
 the rebound of a shot of berend is 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.130
 I had to use elestafa el kabir for an i 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.690

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.690
 Partnerships will continue here 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.930
 bear is by on the side 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.940
 find the boat is on moestafa el kabir and 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.050
 no the fire nixons 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.150
 nick and the beer duo is sick 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.190
 busy and energy through and it has a 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.570
 hard shot pom 3 yrs and i go this one 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:38.470

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.940
 java i have the 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.530
 yes you will get a punch in the nose 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.380
 against the resident's rides 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.820
 he the three two one and you can already feel him 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.360
 to hang 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.070
 I want it anyway because yes in 90 minutes 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.440
 don't give away anymore and be a cut 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.910
 points in in physical 6 what I mine 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.530
 wounds takes on steam this looks 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.989
 reasonable from us that the fair you do not 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.930
 Everywhere is good you make i10 mesh 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.760
 martiri 200 l kabir makes the 307 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.860
 by one of inattention and it 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.220
 state 3 one but the 4th will also be 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.170
 created by moestafa el kabir a no that 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.209
 it doesn't like nothing that was that becomes 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.590
 becomes the root you do so annoyingly we and 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.540
 therefore home with 4 to the wall one 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.370
 and I have six points in the bag in the 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.620
 vision 6 and remember those six group five 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.060
 six points in that vision of remember 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.680
 well and well remember on the next 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.020
 manner that always geert good team 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.330
 probe rebry and leon tazkiyah can be such 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.120
 story one are still the one one 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.100
 only two nights 318 there 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.710
 ultimately the savior in distress 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.419
 still makes something of it 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.910
 in the end, the four and two are yours 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.740
 your arm last and then i won't lose 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.020
 three points but you know who 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.330

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.990
 Adam and the next jar as opposed 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.479
 these bats and yes that is not so 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.490

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.900
 by sea salt and from the shot there is then 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.490
 also you two of him there and that 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.169
 keeper really can't do anything about it. I don't understand 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.940
 that you are still the keeper just yet 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.160
 good that no one is in the bowl 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.870

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.960

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.840

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.699
 second body also in a four 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.680
 headers and yes then then yes then the bad yes 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.360
