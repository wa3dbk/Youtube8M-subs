00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.520
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.470
 Maracas today would like to show you 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.530
 again rubric review errors beginners 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.559
 quite a while she was not you and me 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.900
 asked and I decided to do it so 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.070
 Today we have lost coast 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.430
 on all fours he has 1046 efficiency 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.039
 7 thousand fights 51 percent of victories 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.680
 I think that it can be called a novice 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.679
 Well, of course with me, as always, everything will be 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.670
 argue about this and so is our hero 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.489
 rides of course on the right side of the mountains 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:42.600
 that's quite true and a great tactic 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:47.070
 you need to take these positions right away 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.960
 that everything is pretty well our 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.780
 the hero is watching anyone coming here 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.010
 near the mountain glows 54 to the enemy 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.050
 so let's get a little bigger map 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:04.320
 I will do and then suddenly breaks out 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.630
 green at 120 is unexpected because everything 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.100
 he doesnâ€™t seem to allow the skill 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:15.330
 such are stupid mistakes in the end our 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.570
 hero mun was able to throw two 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.759
 what seems to be nice but true with 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.430
 to a platoon on 50 fours two times too 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.759
 not necessarily and you and by the way here 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.350
 while i was talking he drove up to the root 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.150
 caernarvon and a favor under our hero and in 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.090
 in general 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.490
 it was necessary to look at the mini-map and 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.660
 then our hero would not lose 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:46.570
 hp another serious mistake for some reason in 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.660
 the costa lost drove forward well that is 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.240
 Three deuces left the shelters 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.110
 moodboard gave optional damage then 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:00.390
 there he got it and in general, in response 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:03.790
 gave no damage is the most terrible at all 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.660
 conditions that can only be you this 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.110
 exchanges 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.630
 on the same about the enemy is such 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.000
 the most minimal conditions that you need 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.890
 to comply or do not lose at all 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.690
 and do the damage yourself are perfect 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:22.410
 conditions when you just lose it 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:26.470
 a serious mistake which in general 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.110
 enemy heavy vehicles approach unacceptably 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.110
 tanks now also had one more mistake 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.850
 and one more mistake i have two errors in 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.800
 coupe 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.220
 that is, now I will explain everything to our hero 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.070
 drove forward and for some reason on it 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.140
 enemies are not faster if they were more 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.530
 accurate is our hero would have picked up already 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:51.010
 plus he started asking back and again 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.970
 that, too, could throw him lucky 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.549
 just opponents are not so skill a 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:01.110
 someone lost trying after all 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:06.120
 bite it and it bears fruit 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:10.959
 fv215b 183 blows 30 deuce 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:15.750
 again one more mistake and again well then 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:20.080
 There is it right I do not know the error in error 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:24.549
 first went out of 80 reacted then 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:27.130
 showed her karma and says you need 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.760
 come on, remember, I showed you 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.160
 pocket 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.940
 Of course from 8 did not refuse such 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.900
 sentence one more mistake our hero 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:41.010
 too briskly went ahead in the end a little bit 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.069
 not cut off from the vase but 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.829
 but lucky enough to get isa 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:50.299
 the third 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:53.700
 great you can still throw in the fifth 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:59.000
 of course 5 turns around too gives 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:03.659
 and in the end lost is already shot and at least 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.879
 manages to take e 5 though it might not 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:07.829
 punch by the way 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.780
 our hero shoot mostly babe 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:12.120
 he only 5 flew to honest 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.030
 saying i wouldn't risk that 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.699
 in general of course handsome yes it can 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.820
 say even farmed it all punches 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:24.630
 here it is in this fight but I think that 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.750
 at least there 15 cumulative need to take 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.090
 the rate of four all 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.970
 in order to punch normally 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.840
 for example some years of such 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:39.660
 armored enemies to the right to dozens 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.560
 the bones will fall and he will be there 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:46.169
 to do in the end it will just crush him 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.090
 nothing can do but in this 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.430
 case he is lucky he is all great 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:54.180
 breaks through but here is not very armored 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:58.860
 the tanks are perfectly centered 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:03.570
 throw here basically already almost everything 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:06.410
 errors that I had to disassemble 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:10.349
 showed you don't commit them 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:13.729
 see where to focus the enemies where 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:17.669
 they look because if you will 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:19.889
 leave here so carelessly then you 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.830
 can she throw and you go to 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:27.300
 hangar in no case can not go there 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.039
 where you do not know what will be there 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.970
 how many opponents are they? 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:36.960
 look first you need to see how 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:39.289
 generally distribute the enemies where they are 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.180
 kiss and if they 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:44.930
 you do not pay attention only need 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.809
 then go and shoot you cost he 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:53.210
 made mistakes he's too careless 

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:57.020
 went back and forth and it is not clear only 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:06:00.199
 why he had not been taken before, that is, here 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.089
 lucky that the enemies were not as accurate 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:07.419
 Any stats they such already 

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:10.969
 do not forgive mistakes in general do not commit 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:14.029
 mistakes costa and play more 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:15.889
 neat and well and he loss tail too 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:19.430
 please don't be so scared 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:22.369
 because all the same you need to take care of 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:27.139
 as best as possible that is never 

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:30.189
 be substituted and the main rule about 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:31.969
 to which I have already said this 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:33.129
 the minimum conditions are you 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:37.399
 exchanges 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:39.409
 with adversary xn is the same then you are 

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:43.240
 power on 300 his home cook it on 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:45.919
 300 but perfect is when you shoot a 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:50.240
 the enemy or you do not pierce or 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:54.490
 just can not get you and does not see 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:56.860
 you are generally in different ways lucky here 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:00.069
 1390 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:04.599
 without gold also so strangely he 

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:06.759
 played could spin and there in the board 

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:10.469
 nad he generally there just in the forehead 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:14.909
 strether is generally a different matter 

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:17.650
 I hope this video was useful to you 

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:18.840
 Good luck fighting friends send your 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:22.930
 replays 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:26.159
 still this rubric for me and 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:29.680
 probably when many interesting 

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:32.860
 we'll see your replay 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.840
 but keep in mind that you really need fights 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.479
 where you are wrong they are where you are just 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:40.719
 much there on the news of the damage and you have 

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:41.949
 there must be all the same mediocre 

00:07:40.719 --> 00:07:45.990
 statistics or bad 

00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:45.990
 good luck overall
