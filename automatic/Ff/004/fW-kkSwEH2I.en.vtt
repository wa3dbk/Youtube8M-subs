00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:27.680
 good morning to all then guys and me 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.380
 I tested the new snow palette 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.660
 adoc rom cosmetics is new 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.050
 absolute I do not know if the success already so 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.970
 to see me I show it for a moment 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.970
 up close so you realize 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.510
 I state that I went out I came back 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.390
 in fact, they can't do it at night 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.120
 talking is the trick is still intact 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.460
 that is, I am very happy I thought I have 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.000
 had the feeling this palette was 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.430
 a little too creamy but actually has 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.040
 a texture that goes from tribute to 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.710
 fuss in the sense of a mix is ​​a 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.590
 something really special and i am 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.350
 There are some hyper pigmented colors 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.850
 color like midsummer than finally 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.630
 the one that in the end is what 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.910
 applied as in the ater and is more point 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.130
 light that a color for its own 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.130
 usual for these types of makeup sif 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.900
 strong so strong I usually with 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.119
 these tricks did not make the point 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.479
 use and bright however this here with 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:37.259
 I do not know slight change 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.420
 attracted the end I did it I did not 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.690
 I see so bad you must not see it 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.759
 anything 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.520
 I'll show you the makeup for a moment 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.950
 close so you realize 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.560
 after per customer six hours then I would say 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.780
 that the correct trick is a fold or 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.820
 also to say that I also applied two 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:02.190
 then bases the premier paulson e 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:06.330
 the further base of kiko but not me 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:10.200
 this still looks beautiful 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.920
 color a lot anyway I leave you the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.770
 tutorial 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:19.980
 I hope you like the trick 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:24.110
 mister we say hello ok i'm going to sleep 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.110
 a kiss to the next video 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.710
 as usual I apply a premier eyes 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.710
 so that the make-up is not made from folds 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.590
 and from more with further base and the smoke 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:58.060
 lightly with your fingers also because it is 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:59.650
 a very clear color I start with the first one 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.319
 color that is this red color 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.709
 orange is logical over the entire eyelid 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.709
 mobile 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.880
 now I take this very intense blue and 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.800
 I go to apply it in the stone in the 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.320
 final part the eye with a brush a 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.320
 nuance es I will smoke for good 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.630
 help me with the nuance with mine 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.630
 usually beso of trust 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.510
 and under the eyebrow arch and I go to 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.510
 apply midsummer 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.520
 highlight of the trick ie she laner 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.430
 take all the time you want it 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.580
 you have and do an eyeliner both above and 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.010
 below I will also go inside the rhyme 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.200
 still take the test to see if 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.390
 you are allergic no because sometimes you 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.870
 the mehr should not be applied indoors 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.870
 of the rhyme 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.300
 a plus with own electric blue mascara 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.470
 because I like to make sense of 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.470
 continuity with e e laner 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.150
 were slightly lengthen and define the 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.930
 my eyebrows because I miss them here 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.930
 just a little bit 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:16.780
 I do some touring with one 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.780
 dull earth and foam well 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.410
 opens with pink blush todescato standing 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.010
 be careful not to take the center because 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.010
 it is a light point 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.710
 for the open opted for a news and ho 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.080
 checked the lips and then filled with 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:06:05.719
 the pencil and then applied the 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:06:08.830
 lipstick makeup also finished the end I 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:08.830
 recorded in the night
