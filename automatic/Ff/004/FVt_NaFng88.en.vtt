right we're gonna go like that like that
like<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.770> that's<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.790> we're

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
like that like that that's it we're

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.780 
like that like that that's it we're
gonna<00:01:09.150> do<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.630> people<00:01:09.990> ah<00:01:10.260> ah<00:01:12.080> one<00:01:13.080> two

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:33.050 

one<00:01:17.790> two<00:01:18.049> three<00:01:20.390> three<00:01:31.070> now<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.130> goal<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:32.520> is

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
one two three three now the goal here is

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.210 
one two three three now the goal here is
that<00:01:33.600> when<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:33.900> one<00:01:34.110> moves<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:35.009> one

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
that when this one moves this one

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.859 
that when this one moves this one
doesn't<00:01:35.490> move<00:01:35.850> at<00:01:36.180> all<00:01:36.320> right<00:01:38.600> she's<00:01:39.600> going

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
doesn't move at all right she's going

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.140 
doesn't move at all right she's going
like<00:01:40.049> that

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
like that

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.590 
like that
just<00:01:41.300> going<00:01:41.600> like<00:01:41.630> that<00:01:41.840> it's<00:01:42.740> just<00:01:42.800> chillin

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
just going like that it's just chillin

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.330 
just going like that it's just chillin
that's<00:01:44.600> going<00:01:44.870> to<00:01:44.960> be<00:01:44.990> so<00:01:45.410> useful<00:01:45.770> to<00:01:46.100> you<00:01:46.190> when

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
that's going to be so useful to you when

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.280 
that's going to be so useful to you when
you<00:01:46.460> expand<00:01:46.910> into<00:01:47.210> poppy<00:01:47.480> in<00:01:47.720> your<00:01:47.840> whole<00:01:48.020> body

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
you expand into poppy in your whole body

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.320 
you expand into poppy in your whole body
because<00:01:49.130> so<00:01:49.280> much<00:01:49.430> of<00:01:49.490> hopping<00:01:50.030> is<00:01:50.150> just

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
because so much of hopping is just

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.270 
because so much of hopping is just
moving<00:01:50.660> one<00:01:50.930> thing<00:01:51.320> well<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.010> other<00:01:52.160> thing

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
moving one thing well the other thing

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.840 
moving one thing well the other thing
stays<00:01:53.120> still<00:01:53.510> this<00:01:54.470> is<00:01:54.650> the<00:01:54.770> basics<00:01:55.340> of<00:01:55.520> finger

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
stays still this is the basics of finger

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.330 
stays still this is the basics of finger
touch<00:01:56.060> right<00:01:56.360> if<00:01:56.570> you<00:01:56.690> go<00:01:56.870> here<00:01:57.230> you<00:01:57.260> can<00:01:58.070> pivot

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
touch right if you go here you can pivot

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.000 
touch right if you go here you can pivot
you<00:01:58.970> go<00:01:59.090> here<00:01:59.510> you<00:01:59.540> can<00:01:59.900> do<00:02:00.110> it<00:02:00.260> if<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:00.440> go<00:02:00.620> here

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
you go here you can do it if you go here

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.390 
you go here you can do it if you go here
you<00:02:01.070> can<00:02:01.550> put<00:02:01.790> it<00:02:01.970> right<00:02:02.210> this<00:02:03.050> pivoting<00:02:03.650> is

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
you can put it right this pivoting is

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.450 
you can put it right this pivoting is
going<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.670> be<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:04.880> basis<00:02:05.330> if<00:02:05.570> you<00:02:05.690> go<00:02:05.900> here<00:02:06.410> you

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
going to be the basis if you go here you

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.820 
going to be the basis if you go here you
