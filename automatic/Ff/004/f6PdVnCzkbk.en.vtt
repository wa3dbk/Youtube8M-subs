one of the best overall minerals and you

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.970 
one of the best overall minerals and you
can<00:02:51.760> take<00:02:51.940> because<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.690> magnesium<00:02:53.140> is<00:02:53.530> one<00:02:53.650> of

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
can take because the magnesium is one of
