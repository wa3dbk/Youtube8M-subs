00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
was very very easy now for the bottom

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.429 
was very very easy now for the bottom
excuse<00:01:16.500> me<00:01:16.619> for<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> case<00:01:18.049> we<00:01:19.049> have<00:01:19.229> this

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
excuse me for the case we have this

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.249 
excuse me for the case we have this
little<00:01:19.680> it's<00:01:20.520> really<00:01:20.909> hard<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.240> see<00:01:21.420> we<00:01:22.080> have

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
little it's really hard to see we have

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.420 
little it's really hard to see we have
this<00:01:24.020> protrusion<00:01:25.020> there<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.040> can<00:01:26.189> see<00:01:26.220> it

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
this protrusion there you can see it

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.969 
this protrusion there you can see it
pretty<00:01:26.460> well<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:27.659> needs<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.170> go<00:01:28.290> inside<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
pretty well that needs to go inside the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.130 
pretty well that needs to go inside the
case<00:01:29.189> first<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.210> other<00:01:30.329> words<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.810> bottom

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
case first so in other words the bottom

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.730 
case first so in other words the bottom
of<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.530> case<00:01:31.740> goes<00:01:32.070> on<00:01:32.280> first<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.530> with<00:01:34.530> one

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
of the case goes on first and with one

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.319 
of the case goes on first and with one
hand<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.100> hard<00:01:35.130> for<00:01:35.460> me<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.640> show<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.030> you

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
hand is hard for me to show that to you

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:47.090 
hand is hard for me to show that to you
but<00:01:37.880> it's<00:01:40.070> like<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:45.799> it's<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.950> lot<00:01:47.070> easier

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
but it's like that it's a lot easier

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.670 
but it's like that it's a lot easier
than<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:48.060> looks<00:01:48.210> then<00:01:48.990> I'm<00:01:49.140> making<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.530> look

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
than it looks then I'm making it look

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.859 
than it looks then I'm making it look
the<00:01:50.369> same<00:01:50.399> way<00:01:50.640> once<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.060> do<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.210> then<00:01:51.659> you

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
the same way once you do that then you

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.109 
the same way once you do that then you
just<00:01:52.549> pop<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.869> you<00:01:54.869> know<00:01:54.960> inside<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.890> then<00:01:56.549> the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
just pop it you know inside and then the

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.080 
just pop it you know inside and then the
power<00:01:57.329> button<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.840> right<00:01:58.020> here<00:01:58.670> you<00:01:59.670> push<00:01:59.909> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
power button is right here you push the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.959 
power button is right here you push the
power<00:02:00.270> button<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:01.310> it's<00:02:02.310> going<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.549> start<00:02:02.820> up

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
power button and it's going to start up

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.579 
power button and it's going to start up
and<00:02:03.180> soon<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.840> will<00:02:03.869> see<00:02:04.020> what<00:02:04.469> what<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.369> have
