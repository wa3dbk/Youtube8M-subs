00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.240 
extra point this doesn't mean that
everyone<00:02:04.049> on<00:02:04.259> your<00:02:04.380> team<00:02:04.439> must<00:02:04.740> complete<00:02:05.159> the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
trio but each person or just one person

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.529 
trio but each person or just one person
can<00:02:08.039> get<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> shining<00:02:08.580> for<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> trio<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.119> if<00:02:09.420> all

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
can get a shining for a trio and if all

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.999 
can get a shining for a trio and if all
are<00:02:09.690> obtained<00:02:10.020> in<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.319> trio<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.800> get<00:02:10.920> an

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
are obtained in that trio you get an

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.540 
are obtained in that trio you get an
extra<00:02:11.129> point<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:12.060> for<00:02:12.239> example<00:02:12.270> let's<00:02:12.840> say

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
extra point so for example let's say

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.640 
extra point so for example let's say
someone's<00:02:14.000> hunting<00:02:14.120> tepig<00:02:14.690> on<00:02:14.900> your<00:02:15.410> team

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
someone's hunting tepig on your team

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.150 
someone's hunting tepig on your team
soft<00:02:16.490> reset<00:02:17.140> if<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.320> were<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.530> get<00:02:18.620> an<00:02:18.740> Oshawa

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
soft reset if you were to get an Oshawa

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.320 
soft reset if you were to get an Oshawa
and<00:02:19.400> someone<00:02:19.640> else<00:02:19.760> on<00:02:19.880> your<00:02:19.970> team<00:02:20.030> were<00:02:20.240> to

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
and someone else on your team were to

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.660 
and someone else on your team were to
get<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.480> snivy<00:02:20.960> that<00:02:21.710> counts<00:02:22.160> for<00:02:22.220> an<00:02:22.400> extra

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
get a snivy that counts for an extra

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.280 
get a snivy that counts for an extra
point<00:02:22.820> so<00:02:23.090> you'll<00:02:23.270> get<00:02:23.450> four<00:02:23.720> points<00:02:23.930> rather

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
point so you'll get four points rather

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.460 
point so you'll get four points rather
than<00:02:24.440> just<00:02:24.710> three<00:02:25.600> you<00:02:26.600> can't<00:02:26.900> hatch<00:02:27.140> in<00:02:27.350> this

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
than just three you can't hatch in this

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.530 
than just three you can't hatch in this
tournament<00:02:27.710> it's<00:02:28.130> all<00:02:28.370> know<00:02:28.700> emulators<00:02:29.270> you

tournament it's all know emulators you

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.380 
tournament it's all know emulators you

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
can only do one in 8192 on a legit copy

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.140 
can only do one in 8192 on a legit copy
of<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.750> game<00:02:32.930> I<00:02:33.830> believe<00:02:34.580> that<00:02:34.610> you<00:02:34.910> can<00:02:35.030> on

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
of a game I believe that you can on

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.030 
of a game I believe that you can on
Victini<00:02:35.570> restroom<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.140> Zekrom<00:02:36.500> by<00:02:36.680> removing

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
Victini restroom and Zekrom by removing

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.160 
Victini restroom and Zekrom by removing
the<00:02:37.130> shiny<00:02:37.310> checks<00:02:37.670> but<00:02:38.000> i'm<00:02:38.240> not<00:02:38.450> positive<00:02:38.510> so

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
the shiny checks but i'm not positive so

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.320 
the shiny checks but i'm not positive so
don't<00:02:39.320> take<00:02:39.440> my<00:02:39.590> word<00:02:39.800> for<00:02:40.010> that<00:02:40.180> but<00:02:41.180> that's

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
don't take my word for that but that's

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330 
don't take my word for that but that's
what<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.510> believe<00:02:41.810> I<00:02:41.960> think<00:02:42.350> so<00:02:42.560> um<00:02:42.770> because

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
what I believe I think so um because

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.210 
what I believe I think so um because
that<00:02:43.580> was<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.730> rule<00:02:43.940> last<00:02:44.120> year<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:44.450> you<00:02:44.570> could

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
that was a rule last year that you could

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.590 
that was a rule last year that you could
so<00:02:46.220> those<00:02:46.430> are<00:02:46.460> pretty<00:02:46.760> much<00:02:46.970> all<00:02:47.240> of<00:02:47.480> the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
so those are pretty much all of the

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.660 
so those are pretty much all of the
rules<00:02:47.810> that<00:02:48.020> I<00:02:48.140> was<00:02:48.290> asked<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.560> cover<00:02:48.860> but

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
rules that I was asked to cover but

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.360 
rules that I was asked to cover but
again<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:50.210> starts<00:02:50.330> July<00:02:50.900> eighth<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:52.040> ends

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
again it starts July eighth and it ends

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.430 
again it starts July eighth and it ends
sep<00:02:53.060> tember<00:02:53.210> first<00:02:53.630> so<00:02:53.990> it's<00:02:54.140> an<00:02:54.230> eight<00:02:54.320> week

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
sep tember first so it's an eight week

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.050 
sep tember first so it's an eight week
span<00:02:54.740> and<00:02:55.300> that's<00:02:56.300> pretty<00:02:56.720> much<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:56.990> so<00:02:58.060> again

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
span and that's pretty much it so again

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.190 
span and that's pretty much it so again
you<00:02:59.540> it's<00:02:59.870> not<00:03:00.170> more<00:03:00.560> of<00:03:00.770> a<00:03:01.660> American<00:03:02.660> versus

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
you it's not more of a American versus

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.290 
you it's not more of a American versus
French<00:03:03.610> competition<00:03:04.610> this<00:03:04.730> year<00:03:04.790> it's<00:03:05.120> more

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
because that's what that's allowed this

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.150 
because that's what that's allowed this
year<00:03:29.900> because<00:03:30.020> last<00:03:30.140> year<00:03:30.530> it<00:03:30.650> seemed<00:03:30.890> a<00:03:30.980> lot

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
year because last year it seemed a lot

year because last year it seemed a lot
more<00:03:32.200> American<00:03:33.200> versus<00:03:33.709> French<00:03:33.980> base<00:03:34.280> so<00:03:34.640> we

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
more American versus French base so we

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.610 
more American versus French base so we
don't<00:03:34.970> want<00:03:35.120> to<00:03:35.180> have<00:03:35.300> that<00:03:35.420> this<00:03:35.630> year<00:03:35.959> so<00:03:36.530> you

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
don't want to have that this year so you

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.680 
don't want to have that this year so you
can<00:03:37.010> be<00:03:37.130> on<00:03:37.220> a<00:03:37.250> team<00:03:37.459> with<00:03:37.520> anybody<00:03:37.880> but<00:03:38.540> that's

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
can be on a team with anybody but that's

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.000 
can be on a team with anybody but that's
