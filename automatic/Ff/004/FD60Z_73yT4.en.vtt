00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
injectors fire two-timing you used to

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.960 
injectors fire two-timing you used to
use<00:03:15.319> a<00:03:15.349> timing<00:03:15.829> light<00:03:15.860> now<00:03:16.610> you<00:03:16.670> need<00:03:16.940> a

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
use a timing light now you need a

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.490 
use a timing light now you need a
computer<00:03:17.329> really<00:03:17.599> to<00:03:17.810> change<00:03:18.049> that<00:03:18.200> sort<00:03:18.440> of

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500
