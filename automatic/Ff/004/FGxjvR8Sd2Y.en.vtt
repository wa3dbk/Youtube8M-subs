00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
correct term I used to say it too but I

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.450 
correct term I used to say it too but I
got<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.139> lot<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.379> ships<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.800> people<00:00:17.070> especially

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
skipping sizes all I wouldn't recommend

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.460 
skipping sizes all I wouldn't recommend
cuz<00:01:14.520> i<00:01:14.610> went<00:01:14.790> from<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.150> like<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> 16<00:01:16.170> when<00:01:16.409> I

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
cuz i went from that to like a 16 when I

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.440 
cuz i went from that to like a 16 when I
went<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.650> 14<00:01:17.100> then<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.400> went<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.580> 12<00:01:17.939> when<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.299> went

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
went to 14 then I went to 12 when I went

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.570 
went to 14 then I went to 12 when I went
to<00:01:18.509> 10<00:01:18.840> but<00:01:19.680> some<00:01:19.890> people<00:01:20.130> say<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.430> can

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
to 10 but some people say that you can

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.880 
to 10 but some people say that you can
skip<00:01:20.880> when<00:01:21.659> you're<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.900> those<00:01:22.049> smaller<00:01:22.500> sizes

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
skip when you're in those smaller sizes

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.670 
skip when you're in those smaller sizes
because<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.520> not<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.060> big<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.450> jump<00:01:24.689> but

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
because it's not that big of a jump but

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.819 
because it's not that big of a jump but
I<00:01:25.710> don't<00:01:26.070> know<00:01:26.159> just<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.580> safe<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:27.000> didn't<00:01:27.299> um

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829

could get a blowout those are really

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.310 
could get a blowout those are really
hard<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.060> fix<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.630> think<00:01:43.759> surgery<00:01:44.869> or<00:01:45.869> if<00:01:46.200> you

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
hard to fix I think surgery or if you

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.980 
hard to fix I think surgery or if you
put<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> smaller<00:01:47.100> smaller<00:01:47.790> size<00:01:48.270> back<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.750> like

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
put a smaller smaller size back in like

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.870 
put a smaller smaller size back in like
go<00:01:49.140> down<00:01:49.290> size<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.009> they<00:01:50.100> can<00:01:50.280> like<00:01:50.490> shrink

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
go down size and they can like shrink

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.770 
go down size and they can like shrink
but<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.270> don't<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.950> wouldn't<00:01:52.950> risk<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.520> if<00:01:53.780> it's

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
but I don't I wouldn't risk it if it's

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.940 
but I don't I wouldn't risk it if it's
not<00:01:54.990> worth<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.320> just<00:01:55.680> wait<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:57.469> typically<00:01:58.469> you

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
not worth it just wait and typically you

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.550 
not worth it just wait and typically you
want<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.280> wait<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.759> waited<00:02:00.479> two<00:02:00.750> weeks<00:02:00.780> between

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
want to wait I waited two weeks between

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.469 
want to wait I waited two weeks between
my<00:02:01.860> stretchings<00:02:02.369> but<00:02:02.670> everyone's<00:02:03.299> different

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
my stretchings but everyone's different

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.270 
my stretchings but everyone's different
so<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.869> just<00:02:04.020> depends<00:02:04.290> on<00:02:04.439> your<00:02:04.560> body<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.100> how

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
so it just depends on your body and how

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.730 
so it just depends on your body and how
like<00:02:06.180> how<00:02:06.329> classic<00:02:06.719> heels<00:02:06.960> or<00:02:07.140> whatever<00:02:07.380> i'd

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
like how classic heels or whatever i'd

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.150 
like how classic heels or whatever i'd
say<00:02:08.250> like<00:02:08.489> to
