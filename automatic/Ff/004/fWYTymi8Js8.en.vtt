00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.690
 well, Teresa terales is a mom 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.700
 who is also an athlete I have a 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.800
 small 5 years old called Maria not 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.990
 I'm married very much in love 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.939
 I am a super passionate person with everything 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.810
 What I do I love to live I love it 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.000
 enjoy the life 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.070
 I love discovering things 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.500
 wonderful those little things that give 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.769
 sense to everything that surrounds us and everything 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.110
 what we feel and I love putting the 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.150
 things in their proper measure you know not 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.129
 criticize for criticizing or complaining about everything 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.570
 the day that is good for nothing but give me 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.280
 account of the enormous luck I have and 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.379
 of the wonderful people that I'm going 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.780
 knowing each day so look at a 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.970
 disabled is a person with many 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.299
 capabilities many capacities within 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.260
 that if the people that are standing that do not 

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:55.040
 you have any kind of disability 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.930
 apparent or that you give opportunities to 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.299
 discover what is truly important 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.769
 of people you realize that the 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:03.710
 chair alone is a piece that accompanies me 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:06.710
 on the road nothing more but the rest I 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.960
 I do not feel different, so just more 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.020
 short there are not many athletes who 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.150
 have so many games in the body have 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.980
 merit endure so many years 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.110
 in the clear end he looked back and 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.250
 I used to talk to a kid who came 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.230
 to say hello to me and since when have you said 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.170
 Well, look at competing since 1998 with the 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.830
 Spanish team in here 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.360
 Of course I have looked at it and I say 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.360
 you are not so many years true 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.860
 has merit to endure yes but is that 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.060
 I had a good time, I like it, so look 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.800
 I have many things in my head because 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.720
 I like to squeeze every moment of the day 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.570
 the truth is that it is not you enjoy 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.250
 too much leisure but I do 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.630
 in a super intense way but I like it 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.090
 a lot of reading I love music 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.250
 I have super varied music I have ready 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.470
 of music for example when I prepare 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.550
 the competitions are very rare the 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.160
 truth is that they are a pretty list 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.930
 different from the usual but 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.060
 let's go what I like the most is to be with 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.760
 the small play with him enjoy with the 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.860
 as long as possible and with my husband 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.570
 and good with my pets that in the end 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.820
 I have a few pets I have 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.650
 fish I have land turtle and I have a 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.290
 puppy already well over 14 and 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.870
 medium that is an eternal sun is conquered 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.220
 already in some things the truth to see in 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.900
 day to day is not that I spend too much 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.640
 time you spend too much time 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.250
 coquetry in that because it happens 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.510
 too much time to soak then it would be 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.709
 absurd to get up in the morning and 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.200
 paint me when after a while I'll go to 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.850
 train you know but I have my 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.620
 very specific coquetry points by 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.750
 example, I love shoes 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.150
 love high -heeled shoes 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.189
 the more daring the more exaggerated they are 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.290
 because it's really because apart from 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.700
 that I like I love breaking the 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.890
 molds I love that people 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.290
 Astonishment that I wear heels because I 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.170
 I understand if I 'm not going to break the 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.659
 foot and if I break it does not hurt 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.730
 then I can wear heels during 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:59.910
 a lot of hours I would not have to 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.630
 surprise anyone 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.620
 and that collects turtles for example 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.620
 good medals too but 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.810
 but collecting collects turtles and 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.810
 more collection items 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.250
 well collect good and if I have a 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.800
 super big appearance plus I have more 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.069
 or about 22 of the typical cubes of 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.830
 rubik they take me a lot the truth are 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.650
 pimps this is for real or this is 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.690
 of the hard ones this I put it of example 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.890
 because it is one of those that it costs to move and 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.870
 when I speak for example of someone with 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.610
 disability explained look at you when 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.370
 you have a body so it's true that you 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.980
 it costs more to get things done 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.019
 because the turn in this case in this 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.549
 model is very difficult there are no two models 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.590
 which are simpler because they are those of 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.769
 speed feeling that you with a finger can 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.620
 move something here cost me that is to move 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.060
 the complete cube so not to have 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.970
 more difficulties means that it is 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.620
 impossible only when you get what 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.079
 you enjoy it much more because the road has 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.450
 been super intense indeed life 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.010
 is to live it to enjoy it for 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.349
 challenge her to dare to break the cube 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.370
 rubik nothing happens that if you do not learn 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.379
 to solve it for yourself 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.449
 fortunately now we have 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.859
 technologies or we have aids that do not 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.359
 we had before when we were little 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.380
 now you go to YouTube and you get like 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.500
 solve the rubik's cube 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.390
 3 x 3 tutorial and tell you the steps 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.220
 If we already have many things discovered 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.280
 so you have to take on the challenges and there are 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.530
 that you have to not be selfish there are people 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.820
 that is not here to live it because I gave myself 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.350
 account look I was a very person 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.960
 shy indeed in fact in class 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.130
 I never raised my hand to do 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.270
 No question because I was dying 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.700
 embarrassment when I had to talk 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.080
 in front of 20 people because I spent it 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.240
 fatal when I had to pick up a prize 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.530
 It was the worst thing you could do to see me 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.930
 prize because I had to give you the 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.300
 thanks in front of the audience and hit me 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.250
 15 days without sleep because I had to 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.110
 think about the speech but then I gave myself 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.680
 realize that people actually have 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.919
 something magical I insist 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.039
 and smile and talk with the heart and not 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:08.520
 you are wrong because it is possible I think that 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:10.560
 when you lose something probably because 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.900
 you try to find other things and in 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.050
 look for meaning and find other 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.840
 things that keep you wanting 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.280
 enjoy or want to live because I guess 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.979
 that yes you discover that you have left over 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.550
 other things I do not know if they give them to us but yes 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:29.540
 I know that they appear I am tremendously 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.970
 happy seriously a lot 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.610
 a lot because I give thanks every day 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.790
 also for the greatest gift of all 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.790
 I'm alive
