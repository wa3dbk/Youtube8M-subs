00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:06.529
 Hello, my name is Eldar Usmanov 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.540
 this is the jobmax.ru site in this tutorial 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.670
 talk about how to help you 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.400
 the search engine index your site 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.340
 and this is done using a special 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.480
 the plugin that creates the sitemap on 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:23.090
 Our Joomla site will use 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:26.480
 xmap component plugins for this we 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:30.470
 go to the official website extensions 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:35.229
 and here we download such here such 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.229
 xml extension click download 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.290
 here we download 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.800
 then we go to our website 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.720
 extension manager extensions and 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.720
 we install in the most usual way 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.530
 I chose the file that I just downloaded 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.530
 and click download and install 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.250
 everything is successfully installed 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.330
 after we installed the extension 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.580
 we turn to the plugin manager 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.950
 here we see the plugins that 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.990
 we established along with the expansion and 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.770
 here we include 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.619
 xmap content and weblinks also if 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.790
 use any of these extensions 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.479
 for example co2 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.189
 then also include it but nothing here 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.429
 used therefore I am inclusive only 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:42.179
 these 2 now I turn into components 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:44.220
 xml here i click create and we create 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.340
 sitemap any title 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.070
 eg 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:53.130
 something like this is published 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.700
 then we go to the tab 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.890
 the menu and here we are celebrating all the menus 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.869
 which will be included in the site map 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.909
 also indicate priority from sea 1 to 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.720
 units that is, the higher the priority 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.890
 this menu should be faster 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.660
 indexed in the site map further and 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.780
 indicate the frequency of changes that is, we 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:23.130
 We inform the search engine how often it will be 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.880
 change our menu for example it is here 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.600
 set 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.660
 once a week 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:32.320
 can also do for example once a day 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.650
 if we change it more often, either 1 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.650
 hour 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.430
 I will note all 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.060
 further in the parameters we clean you 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:50.239
 link to the author because he allows 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:52.110
 do and click save and close 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.060
 we are the 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.960
 created a site map and we can with you 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.270
 to push 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.150
 Here on this ssylochku and see how she 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.580
 It looks like now we should 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.580
 tell the search engine what we have 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.340
 with you site map is an example 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.010
 I show the index how to google and 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.920
 the same now i am in yandex 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.590
 webmaster if what you have in google 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.550
 webmaster and there it will also be possible 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.340
 add here to settings 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:30.000
 indexing is a file tab 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.900
 sitemap and here we are copying here 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.900
 this here is a reference 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:42.170
 insert sd first check correctly 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.520
 whether we entered the address here 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.950
 and then if everything is correct then add 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.739
 this is how it all works and 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.069
 in this lesson we have learned how to add 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.600
 site map to our juma site 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:00.400
