00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.670
 is the vehicle leaving you can 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.670
 appreciate that the view of the 300 in america 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.939
 someone was injured but the truck 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.289
 with the president of the republic 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.789
 I even remember elements 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.789
 Armenians I think to shut up 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:39.050
 this image or to take out the recent 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.260
 practically the president already left in 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.329
 medium of a gust of gases 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.910
 tear a policeman fell here is 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.949
 seriously injured if any organism of 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.230
 relief can help us to help a 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.230
 uniformed that is practically 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.420
 attended and does not move well let's wait 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.500
 there that effectively the red cross or 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.789
 some organization for medical can 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.729
 approach there to risk the 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:10.649
 we received asking for help to the red cross there 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.140
 a military or police does not know more 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.300
 It seems that it is military because it fell with a 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.190
 good shield we take for granted that see more 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.929
 stands practically on them are 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.429
 seeing the new mission and they will have given 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:25.740
 notice that a uniform does not move and 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:27.570
 practically that pipe for all 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.520
 and you can see two arrive 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.759
 uniformed auxiliary are going to us 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.759
 rescue 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.890
 this is what prevents them from leaving by 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.960
 complete the uniformed 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.880
 the special group of operations that are 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.110
 those responsible for the safety of 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.110
 president of the republic 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.820
 the fall was practically 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.829
 there is a considerable height rolled 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.270
 exactly but we do not know if it rolled 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:02:01.000
 hurt or if it was just a stumbling but not 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.670
 It seems that he is very hurt because his 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.860
 hands of retreats of more uniformed not 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.390
 they can take they are asking for your help 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.390
 to a family something like that 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.130
 We are doing our best to carry 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.360
 forward this transmission 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.430
 an operation that has lasted 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.620
 approximately about 35 minutes 15 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.650
 minutes 35 minutes and the country has 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.150
 could see in audio thanks to this 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.160
 transmission give us a little more I do not know 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.160
 what done in the hedgehog holds another 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:39.980
 I do not need good, we are already 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.690
 to see what it is going to do you are going to 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.540
 approach that can not be are 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.900
 practically retired they are already in 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.900
 withdrawal 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.830
 leave at night yes no 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.610
 there are many to help the injured in 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.620
 this moment but the strange thing is that not 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.760
 you see a paramedical unit no that's 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.090
 important in the effort of a unit 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.000
 to keep safe if the police 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.120
 is quite serious and sorry the military 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.220
 of his military we know he does not leave 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.080
 we can visualize the are members of the 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.880
 group of special operations those that 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.340
 they are here is a policeman who 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.340
 practically rolled down the stands 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.960
 and it's motionless so if some 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.840
 organism can help us good 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.670
 we understand that the lords of the army 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.930
 they are there communicated by radio and can 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.450
 ask a rescue unit to 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.180
 to have the army 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.440
 they are practically in retreat and 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.360
 can appreciate they are taken to 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.850
 mate there 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.370
 that's army police you can 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.680
 distinguish are from the go the group of 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.990
 special operations that is the 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.250
 national police is boy is from the police 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:10.480
 national that's how they are policemen 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:15.090
 and they took him to the hospital 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.090
 the military is already retreating 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.510
 the operative is about to end 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.700
 then the operative already sir 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.070
 president and all his collaborators 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.510
 nearby that they have accompanied the 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.210
 work 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.700
 to the diet to the ambulance finally arrived 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.560
 the ambulance to take care of detainees and 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.820
 is that they take it somewhere else though 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.510
 we understand that in the hospital itself 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.639
 maybe they can take care of it 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.639
 [Applause] 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.470
 [Applause] 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.200
 with friends we ask you to keep 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.840

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.009
 forward we hope to have images of the 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:07.169
 presidency of the Republic 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:07.169
