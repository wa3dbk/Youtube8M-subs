00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:15.860
 in this video I will show how to do 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:15.860
 warm their ranks process so here we are 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:23.400
 plan 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:28.619
 area what we want to allocate under 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:33.050
 warm bed is desirable to do so 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:36.030
 It was convenient to approach either side 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.570
 us here now we do this thing in 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.260
 here's a greenhouse here a little bit of a place we 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.629
 we will do a row here 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:50.340
 what is needed for this is the perimeter 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:54.719
 with you have planned to dig a hole about 40 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:58.350
 centimeters now we will deal 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:02.969
 do and in the process will take pictures for 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:08.369
 we still need this here 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:14.939
 kind of wood all that is in stock 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:19.180
 any branches polina boards all that is 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:24.260
 households that should have been thrown away 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:27.470
 we also need straw and this 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:31.840
 earth what are we gonna do so 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:35.240
 the first layer is about 20 centimeters 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:41.270
 this land we throw in one direction 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:44.800
 everything else we will be throwing out 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:50.570
 the other side because here is this land 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:53.540
 that she is less fertile below and we her 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.920
 we will just cover this land 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:02.270
 here these logs and so on then we 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:07.640
 we will make the salon layer and then the layer 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:14.090
 branches and then this layer of fertile 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:18.770
 the ground that we now take off the top here we are 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:22.840
 removed the first layer of earth we put in 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:27.820
 one side is fertile soil 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.769
 centimeters somewhere took 20-25 minutes and 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.630
 now we will be a centimeter above 30 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:38.739
 dig and this whole earth will 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:42.610
 throw away the other side already and so we 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.610
 dug such a pit 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:52.760
 about half a meter right here 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:55.700
 the land lies this below and here is black soil 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.470
 here is this land fertile remote 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.830
 fertile soil will now be over 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.080
 scatter to here these all there Polina 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:09.610
 and so on and in the process we will continue 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:13.180
 shoot here we are already throwing all sorts there 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:17.120
 Pauline and now we will fill it with earth 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:23.050
 the first layer is this to take 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:25.460
 the bottom of the very here we covered 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:29.630
 thin layer of earth 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:35.300
 here these two and now we will lay here 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:40.330
 such branches to the top and then again we will 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:44.590
 fall asleep here you have thrown such a layer 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:49.400
 branches and now we will continue to fall asleep 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.650
 with earth here they threw a little earth 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.700
 and now we will throw 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:59.920
 Here is the foliage and so on all the same 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:04.340
 there is straw that can be cast here 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:08.380
 this this foliage now we will 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.840
 throw this whole rest of the land and 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:14.739
 then another layer of straw and already 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.739
 fertile land 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.639
 covered up 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:34.189
 throwing a feast of straw 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:38.930
 he is here but now covered the feast of straw 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:38.930
 pelted I'll take it then no 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.700
 Here we have such a warm bed 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:02.580
 now we publish at least a week there 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:07.130
 stand on proyadyad and only then we 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.130
 we will plant something 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:20.150
 so until the next meeting here we have 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:23.430
 it turned out like that and the final touch 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:28.699
 we have this warm bed of ours 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:34.159
 garage i'm like that with such slate sheets 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:37.559
 the cipher is good and durable 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:42.469
 the bed will work for us no less 

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:46.309
 than ten years at least 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:52.259
 subsidence there will be formed 

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:53.599
 below muse and the earth will be everything every year 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:06:00.860
 better and better 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:06:04.699
 so use write call all 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:07.919
 it is necessary to protect 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:12.800
 slate and then we get this 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.800
 closed zone with warm beds
