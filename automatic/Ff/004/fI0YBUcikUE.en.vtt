00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
all about the digital watercolor

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.120 
all about the digital watercolor
rendering<00:00:20.730> technique<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.949> have<00:00:22.949> started

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
rendering technique I have started

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.920 
rendering technique I have started
learning<00:00:23.550> traditional<00:00:23.699> watercolor<00:00:24.390> painting

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
learning traditional watercolor painting

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.490 
learning traditional watercolor painting
back<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.439> 1998<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:27.239> over<00:00:27.450> time<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.840> switch<00:00:28.169> to

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
back in 1998 and over time I switch to

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.350 
back in 1998 and over time I switch to
painting<00:00:28.860> digitally<00:00:29.309> because<00:00:29.700> I<00:00:29.730> found<00:00:30.059> that

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 
painting digitally because I found that

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.869 
painting digitally because I found that
the<00:00:30.779> computer<00:00:31.140> was<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.469> lot<00:00:32.070> more<00:00:32.250> forgiving

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
the computer was a lot more forgiving

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.779 
the computer was a lot more forgiving
than<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.600> traditional<00:00:34.050> painting<00:00:34.410> tools<00:00:34.789> this

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:35.789 
than the traditional painting tools this

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:37.369 
than the traditional painting tools this
is<00:00:35.969> especially<00:00:36.329> important<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:36.930> architectural

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
is especially important in architectural

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.590 
is especially important in architectural
rendering<00:00:37.739> because<00:00:37.860> constant<00:00:38.850> revisions<00:00:39.329> to

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
rendering because constant revisions to

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.690 
rendering because constant revisions to
your<00:00:39.629> work<00:00:39.960> are<00:00:40.590> just<00:00:40.829> part<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.370> process

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
your work are just part of the process

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.960 
your work are just part of the process
so<00:00:42.680> let<00:00:43.680> me<00:00:43.800> discuss<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.489> boat<00:00:44.760> house

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
so let me discuss this boat house

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.960 
so let me discuss this boat house

I<00:01:05.149> happen<00:01:06.149> to<00:01:06.180> like<00:01:06.420> sketching<00:01:06.960> using<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.920> blue

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
I happen to like sketching using a blue

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.420 
I happen to like sketching using a blue
pencil<00:01:08.790> but<00:01:09.090> after<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:09.869> scan<00:01:10.320> my<00:01:10.350> drawing<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.130> did

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
pencil but after I scan my drawing I did

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.319 
pencil but after I scan my drawing I did
saturate<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.119> anyway<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:13.049> make<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.319> look<00:01:13.469> gray

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.329 
saturate it anyway to make it look gray

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:17.149 
saturate it anyway to make it look gray
at<00:01:15.329> this<00:01:15.539> point<00:01:15.929> I<00:01:16.139> am<00:01:16.289> applying<00:01:16.740> real

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
at this point I am applying real

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.340 
at this point I am applying real
watercolor<00:01:17.639> textures<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.359> I<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:18.990> scanned

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
watercolor textures that I have scanned

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.910 
watercolor textures that I have scanned
and<00:01:19.649> stored<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.579> my<00:01:20.759> texture<00:01:21.119> library<00:01:21.799> let<00:01:22.799> me

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
and stored in my texture library let me

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.859 
and stored in my texture library let me
talk<00:01:23.100> about<00:01:23.149> textures<00:01:24.149> for<00:01:24.329> a<00:01:24.389> minute<00:01:24.659> because

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
talk about textures for a minute because

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.230 
talk about textures for a minute because
this<00:01:25.709> is<00:01:25.889> the<00:01:26.009> key<00:01:26.189> step<00:01:26.219> that<00:01:26.759> makes<00:01:26.999> this

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
this is the key step that makes this

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.980 
this is the key step that makes this
look<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:28.079> a<00:01:28.139> watercolor<00:01:28.619> painting

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
look like a watercolor painting

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.809 
look like a watercolor painting

watercolor paint produces a variety of
irregular<00:01:33.420> textures<00:01:33.899> when<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.709> paint<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.130> a

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
irregular textures when you paint on a

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.819 
irregular textures when you paint on a

I<00:01:38.329> have<00:01:39.329> been<00:01:39.479> experimenting<00:01:40.289> with<00:01:40.319> Corel

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
I have been experimenting with Corel

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.519 
I have been experimenting with Corel
Painter<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.670> Adobe<00:01:42.060> Photoshop<00:01:42.509> trying<00:01:43.349> to

Painter and Adobe Photoshop trying to
create<00:01:43.770> irregular<00:01:44.520> textures<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.389> but

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
create irregular textures like this but

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.510 
create irregular textures like this but
I<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:46.319> couldn't<00:01:46.560> produce<00:01:46.979> convincing

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
I just couldn't produce convincing

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.419 
I just couldn't produce convincing
textures<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.149> decided<00:01:49.109> to<00:01:49.349> create<00:01:49.829> all<00:01:50.159> of

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
textures I decided to create all of

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.550 
textures I decided to create all of
these<00:01:50.579> textures<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.840> old-fashioned<00:01:52.439> way

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
these textures the old-fashioned way

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.069 
these textures the old-fashioned way
using<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.459> watercolor<00:01:53.700> paint<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.419> hot<00:01:54.779> press

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
using the watercolor paint and hot press

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.620 
using the watercolor paint and hot press
or<00:01:55.829> called<00:01:56.069> press<00:01:56.279> paper<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:57.329> will<00:01:57.450> get

or called press paper you will get

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.019 
or called press paper you will get
different<00:01:57.899> type<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.439> textures<00:01:59.039> depending<00:01:59.849> on

traditional watercolor paint and paper
as<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:18.360> can<00:02:18.480> see<00:02:18.720> this<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.380> not<00:02:19.560> very<00:02:19.890> pretty

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
as you can see this is not very pretty

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.630 
as you can see this is not very pretty
but<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.300> does

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
but it does

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.380 
but it does
have<00:02:21.819> to<00:02:22.000> be<00:02:22.150> after<00:02:23.110> you<00:02:23.530> adjust<00:02:23.650> value

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
have to be after you adjust value

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.820 
have to be after you adjust value
hue/saturation<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.630> apply<00:02:26.050> some<00:02:26.080> gradients

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
hue/saturation and apply some gradients

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.860 
hue/saturation and apply some gradients
you<00:02:26.980> can<00:02:27.700> end<00:02:27.940> up<00:02:28.090> with<00:02:28.150> something<00:02:28.930> like<00:02:29.050> this

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
you can end up with something like this

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.930 
you can end up with something like this
from<00:02:31.870> these<00:02:32.350> painted<00:02:32.770> textures<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:33.520> create

again<00:05:38.650> I<00:05:39.159> want<00:05:39.759> to<00:05:39.879> remind<00:05:40.150> you<00:05:40.300> that<00:05:40.389> all

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:40.689 
again I want to remind you that all

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:43.550 
again I want to remind you that all
layers<00:05:41.110> are<00:05:41.379> set<00:05:41.650> to<00:05:41.800> multiply<00:05:41.939> blending<00:05:42.939> mode

layers are set to multiply blending mode

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.529 
layers are set to multiply blending mode
at<00:05:44.560> this<00:05:44.830> point<00:05:45.250> I<00:05:45.490> will<00:05:45.669> use<00:05:45.879> the<00:05:46.089> painted

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
at this point I will use the painted

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:50.219 
at this point I will use the painted
areas<00:05:46.990> as<00:05:47.319> the<00:05:47.979> selection<00:05:48.339> to<00:05:49.089> make<00:05:49.270> a<00:05:49.479> copy<00:05:49.899> of

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
areas as the selection to make a copy of

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.459 
areas as the selection to make a copy of
the<00:05:50.379> people<00:05:50.740> on<00:05:50.919> the<00:05:51.610> sketch<00:05:51.879> layer<00:05:52.089> and<00:05:52.469> bring

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:53.469 
the people on the sketch layer and bring

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:57.480 
the people on the sketch layer and bring
it<00:05:53.649> to<00:05:53.949> the<00:05:54.099> top<00:05:54.310> of<00:05:54.520> my<00:05:54.789> layer<00:05:54.969> stack<00:05:56.339> for<00:05:57.339> this

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
it to the top of my layer stack for this

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.730 
it to the top of my layer stack for this
layer<00:05:57.759> I<00:05:58.029> am<00:05:58.149> using<00:05:58.479> normal<00:05:59.169> blending<00:05:59.560> mode

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
layer I am using normal blending mode

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.550 
layer I am using normal blending mode
because<00:06:00.729> this<00:06:00.939> layer<00:06:01.149> serves<00:06:01.539> as<00:06:01.810> a<00:06:01.839> mask<00:06:02.229> that

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
because this layer serves as a mask that

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.829 
because this layer serves as a mask that
allows<00:06:03.370> me<00:06:03.580> to<00:06:03.789> continue<00:06:04.240> to<00:06:04.270> paint<00:06:04.629> behind

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:04.839 
allows me to continue to paint behind

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:06.540 
allows me to continue to paint behind
the<00:06:05.139> people<00:06:05.439> without<00:06:05.740> having<00:06:05.949> to<00:06:06.250> worry<00:06:06.460> about

the people without having to worry about
the<00:06:07.149> edges<00:06:08.099> now<00:06:09.099> I<00:06:09.129> will<00:06:09.460> turn<00:06:09.699> back<00:06:09.729> on<00:06:10.270> all<00:06:10.689> of
