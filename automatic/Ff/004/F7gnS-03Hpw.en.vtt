00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.269
 yes 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.300
 bless them sir so that of our 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.330
 lips sprout words full of 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.180
 wisdom so that we never forget 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:46.059
 our great responsibility before the 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:50.110
 microphones to speak truthfully 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:53.379
 objectivity but above all with the 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:56.230
 heart and so I can give a word of 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.080
 breath in the midst of solitude to whom 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.000
 I needed it 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.770
 we help these means of 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.200
 communication more than being a fourth power 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:11.040
 be the first to serve each 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.040
 minute of the day carrying a message 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.460
 liberator 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.870
 Make a word never miss a 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:24.200
 picture a melody or just a 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:27.470
 smile that meets the needs of 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.000
 an audience that thinks and feels and like 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.180
 we 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.300
 we ask that the communication be 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.900
 our paramount value living the 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.600
 intensely with our families with 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.479
 our co -workers and with 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.369
 who listen to us without forgetting that 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.850
 for communicating 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:53.240
 both parties are needed and thus achieve 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:57.100
 with essence a true justice 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.380
 that motivates us every day to 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.289
 start it with joy 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.979
 grant us sir that our signal 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:09.769
 reach all the ends of the earth 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:13.209
 without any distinction transmitting a 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:16.489
 venturous message from these microphones 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:20.870
 so that our voice is humble 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:25.069
 carrier of love peace joy and 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:29.400
 hope as the voice of that one was 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:32.000
 pilgrim from the top of a mountain 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.000
 Amen
