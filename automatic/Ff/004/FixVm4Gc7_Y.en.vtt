now<00:01:14.400> there's<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.670> lot<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.910> games<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.270> which<00:01:15.480> I'm

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
now there's a lot of games in which I'm

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.660 
now there's a lot of games in which I'm
not<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.170> fan<00:01:16.410> of<00:01:16.440> because<00:01:16.680> there's<00:01:17.130> paper<00:01:17.400> and

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
not a fan of because there's paper and

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.450 
not a fan of because there's paper and
pencil<00:01:17.970> for<00:01:18.150> scoring<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:19.140> game<00:01:19.410> uses<00:01:19.980> a<00:01:20.010> card

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
pencil for scoring this game uses a card

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.400 
pencil for scoring this game uses a card
for<00:01:20.760> scoring<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.570> example<00:01:21.630> say<00:01:21.960> 1<00:01:22.110> 3<00:01:22.230> 3<00:01:22.260> 4

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
for scoring like for example say 1 3 3 4

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.790 
for scoring like for example say 1 3 3 4
5<00:01:22.530> 6<00:01:22.620> 7<00:01:22.740> 8<00:01:22.890> 9<00:01:23.010> 10<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.550> then<00:01:24.300> 11<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:25.290> know<00:01:25.410> really

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
5 6 7 8 9 10 and then 11 you know really

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.830 
5 6 7 8 9 10 and then 11 you know really
I'm<00:01:26.010> glad<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.790> guess<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.420> they<00:01:27.570> tried<00:01:27.810> to

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
I'm glad I guess that they tried to

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.640 
I'm glad I guess that they tried to
bring<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.260> method<00:01:28.620> in<00:01:28.710> but<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.550> just<00:01:30.650> it's

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
bring this method in but it's just it's

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.740 
bring this method in but it's just it's
so<00:01:31.860> annoying<00:01:32.190> to<00:01:33.000> be<00:01:33.030> playing<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:33.570> that

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
so annoying to be playing with that

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.390 
so annoying to be playing with that
scoring<00:01:34.050> method<00:01:34.410> the<00:01:34.500> cards<00:01:34.860> move<00:01:35.130> at<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
scoring method the cards move at the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.670 
scoring method the cards move at the
drop<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.850> hat<00:01:35.880> I'd<00:01:36.630> rather<00:01:36.930> write<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.440> score

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
drop of a hat I'd rather write the score

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.070 
drop of a hat I'd rather write the score
down<00:01:37.890> than<00:01:38.160> use<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.610> now<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> game

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080

enjoyed it the only negative thing I can

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.570 
enjoyed it the only negative thing I can
say<00:06:07.320> about<00:06:07.350> is<00:06:07.650> the<00:06:07.800> scoring<00:06:08.100> cards<00:06:08.430> and

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
say about is the scoring cards and

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.350 
say about is the scoring cards and
that's<00:06:08.640> no<00:06:08.820> big<00:06:09.000> deal

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
that's no big deal

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.560 
that's no big deal
you<00:06:09.630> don't<00:06:09.810> need<00:06:09.900> to<00:06:09.960> use<00:06:10.080> those<00:06:10.260> anyway<00:06:10.650> so

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
you don't need to use those anyway so

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.810 
you don't need to use those anyway so
