that situation so um oh this is another

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.399 
that situation so um oh this is another
cool<00:01:35.790> thing<00:01:35.820> they<00:01:36.479> have<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> list<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.990> hospitals

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
cool thing they have a list of hospitals

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.170 
cool thing they have a list of hospitals
that<00:01:37.799> are<00:01:37.860> nearby<00:01:38.189> which<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.729> think<00:01:38.909> it's<00:01:39.000> just

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
that are nearby which I think it's just

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.300 
that are nearby which I think it's just
incredible<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:39.900> if<00:01:40.020> you're<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.860> trying<00:01:41.220> to

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
incredible so if you're just trying to

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.609 
incredible so if you're just trying to
figure<00:01:41.460> out<00:01:41.640> where<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.810> nearest<00:01:42.930> hospital<00:01:43.530> is

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
figure out where the nearest hospital is

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.960 
figure out where the nearest hospital is
because<00:01:43.979> some<00:01:44.100> things<00:01:44.130> happen<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.820> want

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
because some things happen and you want

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.130 
because some things happen and you want
to<00:01:45.060> drive<00:01:45.210> yourself<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.720> don't<00:01:45.780> want<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.020> call

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
to drive yourself you don't want to call

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.569 
to drive yourself you don't want to call
for<00:01:46.259> an<00:01:46.350> ambulance<00:01:46.439> like<00:01:46.799> that's<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.460> really

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
for an ambulance like that's just really

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.620 
for an ambulance like that's just really
convenient<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.270> think<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.600> I

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
convenient I think and this is the the I

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.330 
convenient I think and this is the the I
need<00:01:51.930> assist<00:01:52.290> button<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:52.799> if<00:01:52.920> something<00:01:53.220> ever

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
need assist button so if something ever

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.770 
need assist button so if something ever
does<00:01:53.549> happen<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.090> all<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.450> do<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.720> you

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
does happen to you all you do is you

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.120 
does happen to you all you do is you
click<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.020> button<00:01:55.229> it's<00:01:55.470> really<00:01:55.710> easy<00:01:55.860> and

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
click that button it's really easy and

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.620 
click that button it's really easy and
then<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.700> one<00:01:56.850> if<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.119> need<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.360> for<00:01:57.479> somebody

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
then the one if you need it for somebody

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.420 
then the one if you need it for somebody
else<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:58.020> really<00:01:58.259> similar<00:01:58.500> looks<00:01:59.130> like<00:01:59.280> this

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
else is really similar looks like this

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.219 
else is really similar looks like this
it's<00:01:59.670> like<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.030> exact<00:02:00.329> same<00:02:00.509> thing<00:02:00.750> except

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
it's like the exact same thing except

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.929 
it's like the exact same thing except
you<00:02:01.350> can<00:02:01.500> add<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.770> location<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.700> description

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
you can add a location and a description

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.330 
you can add a location and a description
so<00:02:03.750> if<00:02:04.020> it's<00:02:04.200> for<00:02:04.409> someone<00:02:04.710> else<00:02:04.860> you're<00:02:05.189> like

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
so if it's for someone else you're like

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.419 
so if it's for someone else you're like
ok<00:02:05.729> they're<00:02:05.969> right<00:02:06.270> here<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:07.039> their<00:02:08.039> car

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
one looks heart or something like that I

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.729 
one looks heart or something like that I
don't<00:02:11.390> know<00:02:11.450> whatever<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.230> occasion<00:02:12.440> might

don't know whatever the occasion might

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.650 
don't know whatever the occasion might
be<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.519> input<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:13.940> little<00:02:14.209> bit<00:02:14.330> of<00:02:14.360> information

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
be you input a little bit of information

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.360 
be you input a little bit of information

email it's call the police whatever on

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.030 
email it's call the police whatever on
your<00:02:17.900> perhaps<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:18.379> you<00:02:18.440> don't<00:02:18.709> have<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:18.920> worry

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
your perhaps so you don't have to worry

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.770 
your perhaps so you don't have to worry
about<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.250> anymore<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.849> it's<00:02:19.970> it's<00:02:20.540> just<00:02:20.599> a

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
about it anymore and it's it's just a

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.630 
about it anymore and it's it's just a
really<00:02:21.050> cool<00:02:21.410> feature<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.010> think<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.400> if

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
really cool feature and I think that if

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.640 
really cool feature and I think that if
you<00:02:23.150> have<00:02:23.420> this<00:02:23.660> app<00:02:23.810> on<00:02:23.930> your<00:02:24.019> phone<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:24.379> kind

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
you have this app on your phone it kind

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.080 
you have this app on your phone it kind
of<00:02:24.709> gives<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:25.040> that<00:02:25.280> little<00:02:25.550> extra<00:02:25.760> bit<00:02:25.970> of

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
of gives you that little extra bit of

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.330 
of gives you that little extra bit of
security<00:02:26.629> like<00:02:26.810> if<00:02:27.019> something<00:02:27.379> ever<00:02:27.530> were<00:02:28.280> to

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
security like if something ever were to

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.610 
security like if something ever were to
happen<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.879> me<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.840> know<00:02:29.959> I<00:02:30.140> mean<00:02:30.349> who<00:02:30.470> goes
