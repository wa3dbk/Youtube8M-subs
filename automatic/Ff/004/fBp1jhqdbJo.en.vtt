00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:09.589
 for 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.010
 Hello today I have a park for 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.299
 tell you about a very important issue that 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.250
 is the food in the corridor 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.570
 lately it has become very fashionable and 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.070
 It is also very important to run 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.599
 because we release some hormones that we 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.300
 they generate happiness that are called 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.529
 endorphins I'm going to talk about what 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.360
 I would have to eat before the race 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.770
 during the race and after the 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.720
 career but always from a point of 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.100
 amateur view but then I make you a 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.559
 small subsection for people who 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.489
 dedicate to make marathons triathlon is 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.130
 say high intensity exercises 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.660
 first feeding point before 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.730
 I recommend running to people who 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.710
 they have a tendency to have their 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.630
 sugar or stress that does not go away with the 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.490
 empty stomach is to say a juice of 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.860
 orange or a nut a pair of nuts 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.350
 It is always interesting for people who 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.480
 what they will do after breakfast because 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.760
 that they let pass an hour is worth so that 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.110
 so that we have already done the digestion and 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.170
 since blood and oxygen are not 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.059
 focused on the belly in the case of 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.979
 the people who are going to make a 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.899
 marathon a triathlon ie exercises 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.310
 high intensity in this case in this case 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.710
 It is very important that they go out to 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.600
 run on an empty stomach in the morning so that 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.880
 their glycogen stores do not 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.200
 consume and pull more of the fatty deposit 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.030
 in the second place let's talk 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.979
 of feeding during the race 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.530
 well here we are going to differentiate people 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.810
 that run 30-40 minutillos is to say that 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.490
 it's not much to people who run more than 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.020
 one hour if we run more than one hour 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.240
 Well, it would be interesting to be able to 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.399
 consume gels or have drinks 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.049
 isotonic to replace carbohydrates 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.299
 carbon but in the case of people 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.500
 that they will run 30 to 40 minutes I eat 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.509
 I would very much advise them to drink a 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.149
 little liquid to rehydrate 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.310
 now let's talk about feeding 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.909
 after the race that's very 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.469
 important 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.729
 people as they run more than one 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.679
 time they have done a very intense 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.659
 strong then you have to take carbohydrates 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:53.890
 carbon and proteins to replenish the 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.869
 glycogen deposit that we have spent 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.159
 and in proteins what are we going to 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.289
 help is to rebuild the fiber 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.360
 muscle that we have crushed during 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.220
 the training and for people who 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.929
 also run less than an hour because 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.939
 good in this case if we are trying 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.590
 lose weight my advice is that as 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.750
 much we took a yogurt quoted a finite 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.950
 something very light or even nothing and 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.840
 We wait until it was 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.220
 snack or dinner and depending on the 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.140
 schedule that we have chosen to go out to 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.090
 run in both cases both the people who 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.950
 leaves to run more than an hour like - it's 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.540
 true that the subject of 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.290
 be able to take a potassium supplement and 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.879
 magnesium 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.069
 it will help us not to suffer cramps 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.260
 muscles since the congestion of 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.209
 our muscle mass stays much more 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.219
 tranquilita and we do not have there is a 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.840
 overload on the legs then very 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.489
 important potassium and magnesium very very 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.170
 recommended according and finally 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.180
 as we saw lario hydration 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.879
 It's very important for people who 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.319
 Run know how to hydrate properly 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.970
 both before and after the 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.379
 race if the body suffers a 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.329
 dehydration the performance in the 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.680
 career will be very affected so 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.959
 Beware of drinking 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.489
 you have to drink and replenish fluids before 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.920
 during and after the race and by 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.109
 Assuredly not forget to subscribe to my 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.819
 channel and write me an email if you have 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.379
 some doubt and, of course, my advice 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.299
 always if we want to keep 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.709
 thin do not take anything that comes out of the 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.400
 earth from five in the afternoon 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.400
 goodbye
