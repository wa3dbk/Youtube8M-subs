00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.530 

and<00:03:25.989> just<00:03:26.989> run<00:03:27.469> the<00:03:27.950> forge<00:03:28.310> installer<00:03:28.640> it'll

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
and just run the forge installer it'll

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.509 
and just run the forge installer it'll
install<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.079> client<00:03:30.500> it<00:03:30.680> does<00:03:31.099> everything

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
install the client it does everything

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.520 
install the client it does everything
automatically<00:03:32.209> it's<00:03:32.599> really<00:03:32.930> simple<00:03:33.200> and

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
automatically it's really simple and

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.490 
automatically it's really simple and
then<00:03:34.370> you<00:03:34.609> should<00:03:34.909> have<00:03:35.150> a<00:03:35.629> new<00:03:35.840> profile

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
then you should have a new profile

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.899 
then you should have a new profile
called<00:03:36.920> Forge<00:03:37.400> and<00:03:38.409> then<00:03:39.409> just<00:03:39.799> play<00:03:40.459> it<00:03:40.670> as

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:40.909 
called Forge and then just play it as

00:03:40.909 --> 00:04:02.680 
called Forge and then just play it as
you<00:03:41.329> can<00:03:41.420> see

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.200 

so<00:04:03.690> now<00:04:03.840> that<00:04:03.900> were<00:04:04.080> inside<00:04:04.380> of<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.590> game<00:04:05.210> um

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
so now that were inside of the game um

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.290 
so now that were inside of the game um
to<00:04:06.960> test<00:04:07.230> if<00:04:07.470> your<00:04:07.620> mod<00:04:07.830> is<00:04:08.010> working<00:04:08.460> all<00:04:08.850> you

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
to test if your mod is working all you

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.840 
to test if your mod is working all you
have<00:04:09.450> to<00:04:09.570> do<00:04:09.690> is<00:04:09.840> press<00:04:10.140> K<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.830> this<00:04:11.700> should

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
have to do is press K and this should

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.660 
have to do is press K and this should
come<00:04:12.120> up<00:04:12.300> I<00:04:12.540> have<00:04:13.350> a<00:04:13.620> bunch<00:04:13.890> of<00:04:14.040> models<00:04:14.340> in<00:04:14.520> here

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
come up I have a bunch of models in here

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.750 
come up I have a bunch of models in here
already<00:04:15.079> but<00:04:16.079> here's<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:17.190> one<00:04:17.340> that<00:04:17.459> we<00:04:17.609> just

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
already but here's the one that we just

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.850 
already but here's the one that we just
added<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:19.820> to<00:04:20.820> know<00:04:21.000> if<00:04:21.329> your<00:04:21.810> model<00:04:22.590> that<00:04:22.740> you

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
added and to know if your model that you

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.310 
added and to know if your model that you
downloaded<00:04:23.370> will<00:04:23.670> work<00:04:23.910> it<00:04:24.600> has<00:04:24.780> to<00:04:24.810> have<00:04:25.140> the

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
downloaded will work it has to have the

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.430 
downloaded will work it has to have the
bones<00:04:25.650> inside<00:04:26.220> of<00:04:26.430> him<00:04:26.670> already<00:04:27.570> so<00:04:27.960> it'll

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
bones inside of him already so it'll

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.620 
bones inside of him already so it'll
work<00:04:28.470> with<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:28.830> animations<00:04:29.490> so<00:04:30.150> you<00:04:30.240> can<00:04:30.420> kind

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
work with the animations so you can kind

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.880 
work with the animations so you can kind
of<00:04:30.690> see<00:04:30.870> them<00:04:31.020> moving<00:04:31.500> like<00:04:31.710> they're

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
of see them moving like they're

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.830 
of see them moving like they're
breathing<00:04:32.130> but<00:04:33.120> if<00:04:33.210> they're<00:04:33.360> just<00:04:33.390> really

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
breathing but if they're just really

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.520 
breathing but if they're just really
stiff<00:04:34.290> and<00:04:34.560> they<00:04:35.010> don't<00:04:35.190> move<00:04:35.480> then<00:04:36.480> it<00:04:37.290> will

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
stiff and they don't move then it will

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.060 
stiff and they don't move then it will
look<00:04:37.770> like<00:04:37.800> something<00:04:38.490> like<00:04:38.730> this

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
look like something like this

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.000 
look like something like this
and<00:04:42.020> it<00:04:43.020> doesn't<00:04:43.350> really<00:04:43.440> work<00:04:43.530> very<00:04:43.950> well

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
and it doesn't really work very well

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.720

Final Fantasy you'll remember this guy

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.210 
Final Fantasy you'll remember this guy
he<00:05:09.480> looks<00:05:09.690> pretty<00:05:09.810> cool<00:05:10.110> in<00:05:10.230> erisa<00:05:10.500> right<00:05:10.740> now

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.010 

but<00:05:14.220> that's<00:05:14.340> pretty<00:05:14.610> much<00:05:14.850> all<00:05:15.120> there<00:05:15.840> is<00:05:15.870> to

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
but that's pretty much all there is to

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.560 
but that's pretty much all there is to
adding<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:16.890> models<00:05:17.280> for<00:05:17.880> this<00:05:18.060> mod<00:05:18.300> it's

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
adding the models for this mod it's

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.450 
adding the models for this mod it's
really<00:05:18.810> simple<00:05:19.260> it's<00:05:20.220> pretty

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
really simple it's pretty

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.400 
really simple it's pretty
self-explanatory<00:05:20.880> once<00:05:21.690> you<00:05:21.810> guys<00:05:21.960> do<00:05:22.229> it<00:05:22.350> a

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
self-explanatory once you guys do it a
