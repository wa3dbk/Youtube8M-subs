00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.269
 fan boy who says the following no what 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.830
 interview that microsoft gave recently 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.800
 will win the next console war 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.750
 the infrastructure infrastructure of 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:39.620
 they are and we do talk about online services 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.840
 it's terrible is the most disastrous thing 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.340
 there is 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.310
 this was what he said in an interview 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.580
 today clarifying and he 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:51.160
 personally he says that microsoft is a 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:55.059
 is in a higher position than the 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.129
 Xbox 720 console is much better at 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.320
 playstation 4 console which is 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.890
 asked why you sir how do you 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.890
 you call your grandfather 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.500
 vos neil nicoll not white without the 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.080
 atari's founder was asked ok by 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.120
 that you say this sir why does it say 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.640
 that the xbox of 20 is going to be much better 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.820
 that playstation 4 and it's also 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.190
 saying that the infrastructure of sony 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.140
 it stinks or is horrible eye and said something 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.270
 so he said the following 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.030
 many developers are not going to want 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.010
 work with playstation 4 because of 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.010
 that this is made in Japan and 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.640
 obviously all the specifications and 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:40.650
 others come in Japanese and that gives you a 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.650
 advantage to microsoft so you can 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.499
 so you can take advantage due to 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.039
 that videogame developers 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:51.460
 They know English and obviously it's easier 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.609
 read the specifications and others in 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:59.319
 English because in 6 we speak english and 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:02:00.849
 the japanese or something like that was what 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.490
 he said truthfully a 

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:05.560
 comment at once super fan I'll 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.769
 first because I threw my left to the 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.660
 playstation 4 and second racist medium 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.489
 human being more than anything xenophobic when saying 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.950
 that videogame developers 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.890
 they do not understand Japanese and one or the other 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.640
 way they prefer a specification or 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.270
 more in English that's not what he said 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.000
 practically nolan bushnell 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.600
 to see 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.960
 so they see the truth so super super 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.210
 fast boy the electro water if you see this has 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.610
 caused negative comments in the 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.530
 community of gamers here in the US no longer 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.890
 that this gentleman is once again 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.560
 inducing console war 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.480
 and I think that's terrible to learn 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.220
 of the mistakes the gringos rules that 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.980
 the whole community that listens to me right now 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.650
 by not making these kind of comments I 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.540
 I can not say the play 4 is much better 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.370
 that the 720's positively is a 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.290
 shit for this yours or vice versa 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.000
 play 4 is junk because the 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.070
 bad internet connection I can not say 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.400
 that especially if you work in the 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.630
 world of the internet or if you are a person 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.520
 important more than anything how good 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.890
 not that he was a founder of atari but 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.730
 good is a super fanboy comment on 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.310
 which I am not in favor but there 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.500
 little people who respect him among 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.200
 them I 'm not there so I 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.790
 dismissal was ducsa there are favorites comments 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.010
 and obviously we'll see each other until 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.630
 next the big question is you are from 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.830
 according to what grandpa said 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.570
 I was not ashamed 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.120
 listen to the sluggards he said 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.600
 a hug people and we will not see myself but it's 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.600
 others too
