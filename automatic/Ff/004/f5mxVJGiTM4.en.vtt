all<00:00:11.809> right<00:00:11.960> today<00:00:12.320> I'm<00:00:12.830> checking<00:00:12.860> out<00:00:13.250> one<00:00:13.400> of

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430 
all right today I'm checking out one of

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.850 
all right today I'm checking out one of
the<00:00:13.550> new<00:00:13.580> bowls<00:00:13.880> from<00:00:14.030> Hawaii<00:00:14.469> vector<00:00:15.469> turbo

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
the new bowls from Hawaii vector turbo

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.280 
the new bowls from Hawaii vector turbo
it's<00:00:16.100> a<00:00:16.640> new<00:00:16.790> speed<00:00:17.090> boat<00:00:17.119> and<00:00:18.520> it's<00:00:19.520> Ibo<00:00:20.509> it's

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.290 
it's a new speed boat and it's Ibo it's

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.910 
it's a new speed boat and it's Ibo it's
at<00:00:21.410> 340<00:00:21.950> 340<00:00:22.310> 340<00:00:22.820> Ibo<00:00:23.270> so<00:00:24.200> it<00:00:24.290> is<00:00:24.380> the<00:00:24.500> fastest

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
at 340 340 340 Ibo so it is the fastest

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.850

that you expect from Hawaii they got a

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.000

new<00:00:55.610> new<00:00:55.910> cam<00:00:56.150> system<00:00:56.570> this<00:00:56.690> year<00:00:56.829> let<00:00:57.829> Dean

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
new new cam system this year let Dean

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.200 
new new cam system this year let Dean
talk<00:00:58.190> a<00:00:58.220> little<00:00:58.370> bit<00:00:58.490> about<00:00:58.520> that<00:00:58.790> it's<00:00:59.060> the

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
talk a little bit about that it's the

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.680 
talk a little bit about that it's the
it's<00:00:59.720> the<00:00:59.840> are<00:01:00.020> Katie<00:01:00.500> camp<00:01:00.829> and<00:01:01.329> which<00:01:02.329> if<00:01:02.600> you

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
it's the are Katie camp and which if you

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.630 
it's the are Katie camp and which if you
compare<00:01:03.050> a<00:01:03.079> fuel<00:01:03.320> cam<00:01:03.530> to<00:01:03.710> an<00:01:03.800> arcade<00:01:04.100> tee<00:01:04.369> cam

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
compare a fuel cam to an arcade tee cam

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.249 
compare a fuel cam to an arcade tee cam
there's<00:01:05.210> quite<00:01:05.420> a<00:01:05.449> bit<00:01:05.600> of<00:01:05.689> difference<00:01:06.049> in<00:01:06.140> the

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
there's quite a bit of difference in the

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.920 
there's quite a bit of difference in the
two<00:01:06.409> sounds<00:01:06.860> like<00:01:06.979> the<00:01:07.240> Hoyt<00:01:08.240> engineers<00:01:08.689> went

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
two sounds like the Hoyt engineers went

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.539 
two sounds like the Hoyt engineers went
to<00:01:09.049> school<00:01:09.290> a<00:01:09.320> little<00:01:09.470> bit<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:09.979> did<00:01:10.159> some<00:01:10.340> work

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
to school a little bit and did some work

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.090 
to school a little bit and did some work
with<00:01:10.610> respect<00:01:11.329> to<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:11.600> ergonomics<00:01:12.320> on<00:01:12.500> the

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
with respect to the ergonomics on the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.550 
with respect to the ergonomics on the
actual<00:01:13.340> muscle<00:01:13.579> how<00:01:14.210> a<00:01:14.240> person<00:01:15.080> reacts<00:01:15.290> to

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
actual muscle how a person reacts to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.190 
actual muscle how a person reacts to
pulling<00:01:15.830> a<00:01:15.920> bow<00:01:16.100> back<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:16.810> they've<00:01:17.810> kind<00:01:18.020> of

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
pulling a bow back and they've kind of

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.950 
pulling a bow back and they've kind of
designed<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.680> cam<00:01:18.890> to<00:01:19.190> optimise<00:01:19.700> about<00:01:20.690> the

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
designed the cam to optimise about the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.810 
designed the cam to optimise about the
amount<00:01:21.140> of<00:01:21.200> effort<00:01:21.380> taken<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.340> get<00:01:22.490> to<00:01:22.610> full

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
amount of effort taken to get to full

amount of effort taken to get to full
draw<00:01:23.150> and<00:01:23.750> so<00:01:23.870> that's<00:01:24.050> what<00:01:24.229> gives<00:01:24.320> it<00:01:24.560> that

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
draw and so that's what gives it that

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.760 
draw and so that's what gives it that
smooth<00:01:25.130> that<00:01:25.820> smooth<00:01:26.180> feeling<00:01:26.510> draw<00:01:26.870> that<00:01:27.680> you

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
smooth that smooth feeling draw that you

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.710 
smooth that smooth feeling draw that you
get<00:01:27.890> out<00:01:28.010> of<00:01:28.100> these<00:01:28.159> rkt<00:01:28.580> cams<00:01:28.970> so<00:01:29.090> certainly

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
get out of these rkt cams so certainly

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.570 
get out of these rkt cams so certainly
an<00:01:29.960> improvement<00:01:30.290> for<00:01:31.040> this<00:01:31.190> year<00:01:31.400> and

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
an improvement for this year and

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.190 
an improvement for this year and
obviously<00:01:32.360> they've<00:01:32.510> also<00:01:32.659> been<00:01:32.930> able<00:01:33.049> to

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
obviously they've also been able to

00:01:33.200 --> 00:02:22.150 
obviously they've also been able to
maintain<00:01:33.440> the<00:01:33.830> speed<00:01:34.070> which<00:01:34.250> is<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:34.430> good<00:01:34.670> thing

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.050 

well<00:02:23.160> we<00:02:23.250> just<00:02:23.280> got<00:02:23.550> done<00:02:23.700> shooting<00:02:23.910> the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
well we just got done shooting the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.120 
well we just got done shooting the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
valley and you know I think it's

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.240 
valley and you know I think it's
something<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:52.620> wouldn't<00:02:52.800> have<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:52.950> hard<00:02:53.130> time

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
six inch brace it-- they also have other

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.180

other<00:03:12.120> bows<00:03:12.480> in<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.750> white<00:03:12.930> line<00:03:13.170> a<00:03:13.470> little

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
other bows in the white line a little

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.290 
other bows in the white line a little
bit<00:03:14.069> bigger<00:03:14.220> brace<00:03:14.489> I'd<00:03:14.730> still<00:03:14.970> come<00:03:15.000> with<00:03:15.150> the

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
bit bigger brace I'd still come with the

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.840 
bit bigger brace I'd still come with the
rkt<00:03:15.810> cam<00:03:16.080> so<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:17.250> should<00:03:17.459> check<00:03:17.640> them<00:03:17.730> out

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
rkt cam so you should check them out

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.820 
rkt cam so you should check them out
there<00:03:18.090> they're<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.510> sweet<00:03:18.959> shooting<00:03:19.350> machine
