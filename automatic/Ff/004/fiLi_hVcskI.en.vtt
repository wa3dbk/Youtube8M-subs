better<00:00:44.969> than<00:00:45.059> snowmobile<00:00:45.539> racing<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.170> we've

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
better than snowmobile racing so we've

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.619 
better than snowmobile racing so we've
got<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> couple<00:00:47.489> other<00:00:47.579> races<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.210> one<00:00:48.420> here
