sets<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.980> know<00:00:50.100> they<00:00:50.219> know<00:00:50.340> how<00:00:50.579> could<00:00:50.760> have

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
sets you know they know how could have

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.020 
sets you know they know how could have
probably<00:00:51.420> what<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.719> felt<00:00:51.989> better<00:00:52.640> but<00:00:53.640> anyway<00:00:54.000> I

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
probably what I felt better but anyway I

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.810 
probably what I felt better but anyway I
mean<00:00:54.239> when<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> win<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:55.079> need<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.649> take<00:00:55.829> things

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
mean when is a win I need to take things

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.389 
mean when is a win I need to take things
the<00:00:56.969> way<00:00:57.149> they<00:00:57.329> are<00:00:57.360> accept<00:00:58.170> them<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:59.039> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
the way they are accept them and in the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.569 
the way they are accept them and in the
same<00:00:59.579> time<00:01:00.140> sort<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.770> fine<00:01:02.070> tuning<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.520> a

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
same time sort of the fine tuning in a

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.700 
same time sort of the fine tuning in a
last<00:01:02.789> second<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.239> think<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.930> only

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
last second I think this is the only

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.480 
last second I think this is the only
moment<00:01:04.920> for<00:01:05.309> me<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:06.170> that<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.250> can

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
moment for me that that I can that I can

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.980 
moment for me that that I can that I can
say<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.729> I've<00:01:08.939> really<00:01:09.240> done<00:01:09.540> some<00:01:09.780> good<00:01:09.930> work

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
say that I've really done some good work

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.770 
say that I've really done some good work
on<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.619> clay<00:01:10.830> right<00:01:11.729> after<00:01:12.030> Miami<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.450> start

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
on the clay right after Miami I start

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.109 
on the clay right after Miami I start
start<00:01:13.470> hitting<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:13.950> clay<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.460> knew<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.729> I

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
start hitting on clay so I knew that I

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.880 
start hitting on clay so I knew that I
have<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.570> good<00:01:15.689> preparation<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.619> can
