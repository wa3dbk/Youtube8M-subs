yeah this is what I think are the big
three<00:04:13.350> um<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:14.880> reason<00:04:15.000> why<00:04:15.269> I<00:04:15.329> didn't<00:04:15.750> include

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
three um the reason why I didn't include

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.500 
three um the reason why I didn't include
some<00:04:16.349> other<00:04:16.530> decks<00:04:16.769> maybe<00:04:17.669> grand<00:04:18.060> bleu<00:04:18.269> I

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
some other decks maybe grand bleu I

that<00:04:21.599> it<00:04:22.049> I<00:04:22.860> don't<00:04:23.190> consider<00:04:23.580> it<00:04:23.669> to<00:04:23.909> be<00:04:24.050> one<00:04:25.050> of

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
that it I don't consider it to be one of

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.899 
that it I don't consider it to be one of
the<00:04:25.199> big<00:04:25.349> three<00:04:25.560> but<00:04:26.190> it's<00:04:26.220> a<00:04:26.430> deck<00:04:26.610> that<00:04:26.639> can

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:26.909 
the big three but it's a deck that can

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:30.559 
the big three but it's a deck that can
definitely<00:04:27.120> win<00:04:27.539> um<00:04:28.580> next<00:04:29.580> one<00:04:29.699> Naruto<00:04:30.210> me<00:04:30.270> I

don't<00:04:30.870> really<00:04:31.199> feel<00:04:31.470> like<00:04:31.530> Naru<00:04:31.860> commies<00:04:32.250> can

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
don't really feel like Naru commies can

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.490 
don't really feel like Naru commies can
compete<00:04:32.759> they<00:04:33.060> just<00:04:33.270> don't<00:04:33.569> seem<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.080> me<00:04:34.470> like

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
compete they just don't seem to me like

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.589 
compete they just don't seem to me like
they<00:04:34.889> can<00:04:35.099> gain<00:04:35.280> enough<00:04:36.030> advantage

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
they can gain enough advantage

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.809 
they can gain enough advantage
especially<00:04:36.840> since<00:04:37.770> like<00:04:37.979> you're<00:04:38.430> kind<00:04:38.669> of

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:38.819 
especially since like you're kind of

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.140 
especially since like you're kind of
like<00:04:39.000> um<00:04:39.419> I<00:04:40.129> mean<00:04:41.129> it's<00:04:41.340> just<00:04:41.400> like<00:04:41.669> it's<00:04:41.909> it

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
like um I mean it's just like it's it

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.170 
like um I mean it's just like it's it
doesn't<00:04:42.270> get<00:04:42.629> as<00:04:42.840> much<00:04:42.870> advantage<00:04:43.409> as<00:04:43.849> it<00:04:44.849> what

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
doesn't get as much advantage as it what

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.540 
doesn't get as much advantage as it what
up<00:04:45.330> ho<00:04:45.569> as<00:04:45.930> it<00:04:46.139> you<00:04:46.530> know<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.830> deck<00:04:47.009> thinks<00:04:47.430> it

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
up ho as it you know the deck thinks it

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.439 
up ho as it you know the deck thinks it
can<00:04:47.729> so<00:04:48.120> you<00:04:48.840> know<00:04:49.310> it<00:04:50.310> definitely<00:04:50.759> swings<00:04:51.210> big

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
can so you know it definitely swings big

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.230 
can so you know it definitely swings big
but<00:04:52.440> in<00:04:52.740> my<00:04:53.280> opinion<00:04:53.400> can<00:04:53.819> garrow's<00:04:54.090> do<00:04:54.210> a

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
but in my opinion can garrow's do a

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.969 
but in my opinion can garrow's do a
better<00:04:54.419> job<00:04:54.539> of<00:04:54.719> doing<00:04:55.259> the<00:04:55.500> whole<00:04:55.620> minus

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
better job of doing the whole minus

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.809 
better job of doing the whole minus
thing<00:04:56.370> so<00:04:57.180> these<00:04:57.539> are<00:04:57.719> my<00:04:58.020> my<00:04:58.830> picks<00:04:59.099> for<00:04:59.340> this

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:14.969 
consistently being these guys all the

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:17.390 
consistently being these guys all the
time<00:05:15.000> like<00:05:15.539> they<00:05:15.780> don't<00:05:15.960> these<00:05:16.919> decks<00:05:17.280> have

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
time like they don't these decks have

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.119 
time like they don't these decks have
answers<00:05:17.940> and<00:05:18.330> they<00:05:18.810> do<00:05:18.870> they're<00:05:19.740> the<00:05:19.919> most

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:20.129 
answers and they do they're the most

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:22.909 
answers and they do they're the most
efficient<00:05:20.969> so<00:05:21.659> basically<00:05:22.199> they<00:05:22.409> get<00:05:22.590> the<00:05:22.740> most

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
efficient so basically they get the most

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.719 
efficient so basically they get the most
work<00:05:23.069> um<00:05:24.349> they<00:05:25.349> get<00:05:25.529> they<00:05:25.830> get<00:05:26.340> the<00:05:26.520> most

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
work um they get they get the most

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.580 
work um they get they get the most
results<00:05:27.270> for<00:05:27.479> the<00:05:27.569> least<00:05:27.779> amount<00:05:27.990> of<00:05:28.139> work<00:05:28.349> is

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
results for the least amount of work is

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.409 
results for the least amount of work is
what<00:05:28.949> I'm<00:05:29.039> trying<00:05:29.250> to<00:05:29.310> say<00:05:29.400> so<00:05:30.150> these<00:05:30.360> are

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
what I'm trying to say so these are
