have your own burial rites packaging

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.210 
have your own burial rites packaging
right<00:01:38.150> I<00:01:38.450> tested<00:01:39.440> grisly<00:01:39.710> salvage<00:01:39.860> in<00:01:40.160> the

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
right I tested grisly salvage in the

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.860 
right I tested grisly salvage in the
deck<00:01:40.400> and<00:01:40.580> I<00:01:41.240> actually<00:01:41.390> thought<00:01:41.600> it<00:01:41.690> was<00:01:41.780> going

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
deck and I actually thought it was going

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.090 
deck and I actually thought it was going
to<00:01:41.930> be<00:01:42.020> better<00:01:42.170> than<00:01:42.290> mulch<00:01:42.500> at<00:01:42.620> first<00:01:42.860> but

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
to be better than mulch at first but

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.620 
to be better than mulch at first but
then<00:01:43.160> in<00:01:43.370> testing<00:01:43.760> mulch<00:01:44.000> was<00:01:44.180> helping<00:01:44.420> me<00:01:44.510> hit

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
then in testing mulch was helping me hit

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.600 
then in testing mulch was helping me hit
my<00:01:44.750> lane<00:01:44.930> drops<00:01:45.170> it<00:01:45.710> was<00:01:45.860> doing<00:01:46.250> stuff<00:01:46.490> like

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
my lane drops it was doing stuff like

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.460 
my lane drops it was doing stuff like
finding<00:01:47.030> me<00:01:47.090> Gavin<00:01:47.390> Gavin<00:01:47.690> Township<00:01:48.260> while

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
finding me Gavin Gavin Township while

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.680 
finding me Gavin Gavin Township while
bending<00:01:48.710> lingering<00:01:49.100> souls<00:01:49.370> it<00:01:50.000> was<00:01:50.120> just<00:01:50.270> an

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
bending lingering souls it was just an

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.750 
bending lingering souls it was just an
excellent<00:01:51.170> card<00:01:51.440> whereas<00:01:52.070> grisly<00:01:52.580> salvage

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
excellent card whereas grisly salvage

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.320 
excellent card whereas grisly salvage
was<00:01:53.090> not<00:01:53.360> in<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.720> stick<00:01:54.790> risley<00:01:55.790> grisly

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
was not in the stick risley grisly

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.570 
was not in the stick risley grisly
salvage<00:01:56.510> made<00:01:56.990> me<00:01:57.200> like<00:01:57.620> have<00:01:57.830> a<00:01:57.890> early<00:01:58.100> Black

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
salvage made me like have a early Black

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.030 
salvage made me like have a early Black
Manta<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:59.480> be<00:01:59.600> effective<00:02:00.020> whereas<00:02:00.440> mulch<00:02:00.710> just

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
Manta to be effective whereas mulch just

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.650 
Manta to be effective whereas mulch just
needed<00:02:01.280> green<00:02:01.520> so<00:02:01.850> it's<00:02:02.000> much<00:02:02.150> much<00:02:02.510> more

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
needed green so it's much much more

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.310 
needed green so it's much much more
castable<00:02:03.170> on<00:02:03.260> turn<00:02:03.440> two<00:02:03.650> um<00:02:04.900> where's<00:02:05.900> yet

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
castable on turn two um where's yet

multiplying to be the black man aware as
physical<00:02:08.149> Salvage<00:02:08.420> requires<00:02:08.780> it<00:02:09.020> so<00:02:09.170> it's

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
physical Salvage requires it so it's

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.200 
physical Salvage requires it so it's
just<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.710> much<00:02:09.830> less<00:02:10.040> awkward<00:02:10.340> card<00:02:10.580> yeah

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
just a much less awkward card yeah

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.370 
just a much less awkward card yeah
they're<00:02:11.390> a<00:02:11.690> lot<00:02:11.780> more<00:02:11.840> different<00:02:12.200> than<00:02:12.230> they

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
they're a lot more different than they

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.080 
they're a lot more different than they

uh and and against those types of

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.710 
uh and and against those types of
strategies<00:02:25.610> they'll<00:02:26.030> usually<00:02:26.150> leave<00:02:26.450> in<00:02:26.570> some

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
later i'm still like milling a pile of

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.520 
later i'm still like milling a pile of
our<00:02:41.090> seats<00:02:41.330> but<00:02:41.450> i<00:02:41.510> don't<00:02:41.720> want<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.930> draw<00:02:42.080> like

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
our seats but i don't want to draw like

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.740 
our seats but i don't want to draw like
sure<00:02:42.890> is<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.310> generating<00:02:43.820> value<00:02:43.940> right<00:02:44.450> yeah

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
sure is it generating value right yeah

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.360 
sure is it generating value right yeah
it<00:02:45.080> prevents<00:02:45.410> you<00:02:45.470> from<00:02:45.500> milling<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.190> only

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
it prevents you from milling the only

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.740 
it prevents you from milling the only
card<00:02:46.610> in<00:02:46.760> this<00:02:46.850> deck<00:02:46.910> that<00:02:47.270> i<00:02:47.300> don't<00:02:47.540> want<00:02:47.570> to

card in this deck that i don't want to

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.210 
card in this deck that i don't want to
hit<00:02:47.870> off<00:02:48.020> of<00:02:48.050> mulch<00:02:48.410> is<00:02:48.620> like<00:02:48.770> garrett<00:02:49.040> crime

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
hit off of mulch is like garrett crime

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.449 
hit off of mulch is like garrett crime
want<00:02:49.459> a<00:02:50.080> fair<00:02:51.080> enough<00:02:51.260> right<00:02:51.680> well<00:02:52.220> you

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
want a fair enough right well you

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
mentioned when you sat down you really

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.850 
mentioned when you sat down you really
liked<00:02:53.810> your<00:02:53.900> sideboard<00:02:54.290> if<00:02:54.440> you've<00:02:54.560> got<00:02:54.680> down

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
liked your sideboard if you've got down

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.890 
liked your sideboard if you've got down
here<00:02:54.890> I<00:02:55.130> board<00:02:55.340> is<00:02:55.430> excellent<00:02:55.880> so<00:02:56.209> let's<00:02:56.750> go

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
here I board is excellent so let's go

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.540 
here I board is excellent so let's go
through<00:02:56.930> what<00:02:57.140> makes<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.680> sideboard<00:02:58.070> so<00:02:58.220> exit

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
through what makes the sideboard so exit

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.710 
through what makes the sideboard so exit
I<00:02:58.640> guess<00:02:58.790> we'll<00:02:58.940> start<00:02:59.120> with<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.270> nevermore

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
I guess we'll start with the nevermore

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.540 
I guess we'll start with the nevermore

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.590 
hard to lose a control metric post board
it's<00:03:30.490> almost<00:03:30.640> like<00:03:30.970> you<00:03:31.120> have<00:03:31.150> spaces

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
it's almost like you have spaces

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.710 
it's almost like you have spaces
revelation<00:03:32.110> they<00:03:32.260> don't<00:03:32.470> write<00:03:32.860> exactly<00:03:33.280> yeah

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
revelation they don't write exactly yeah

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.700 
revelation they don't write exactly yeah
so<00:03:34.720> obviously<00:03:34.960> you<00:03:35.050> have<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.320> fourth<00:03:35.530> care

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
so obviously you have the fourth care

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.110 
so obviously you have the fourth care
which<00:03:35.860> mention<00:03:36.190> there<00:03:36.310> and<00:03:36.490> staff<00:03:36.790> up<00:03:36.970> in

which mention there and staff up in
which<00:03:37.300> I<00:03:37.420> guess<00:03:37.570> functions<00:03:37.960> almost<00:03:38.170> like<00:03:38.440> a

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
which I guess functions almost like a

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.040
