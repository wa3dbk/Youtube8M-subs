00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959

are<00:02:36.170> really<00:02:36.860> really<00:02:37.370> thin

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
are really really thin

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.839 
are really really thin
I've<00:02:38.900> actually<00:02:39.410> compared<00:02:39.800> it<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:39.980> my<00:02:40.489> other

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
I've actually compared it to my other

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.440 
I've actually compared it to my other
Spartans<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:41.860> yeah<00:02:42.860> they<00:02:43.069> are<00:02:43.450> significantly

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
thinner than the original Spartans so I

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.260 
thinner than the original Spartans so I
don't<00:02:49.190> know<00:02:49.510> but<00:02:50.770> still<00:02:51.770> a<00:02:52.190> very<00:02:52.550> cool<00:02:53.000> looking

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
ODST which is really cool and why

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.590 
ODST which is really cool and why
