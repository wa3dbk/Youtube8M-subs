get point 26 ounces in each of these so
quite<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> bit<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.460> product<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.509> it's<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.780> really

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
quite a bit of product but it's a really

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.880 
quite a bit of product but it's a really
good<00:01:25.049> product<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:27.200> as<00:01:28.200> far<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:28.710> being

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
good product to have as far as being

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.980 
good product to have as far as being
conditioning<00:01:29.520> these<00:01:29.759> aren't<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.600> most

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
conditioning these aren't the most

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.660 
conditioning these aren't the most
creamy<00:01:32.509> kind<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.659> formulas<00:01:34.170> ever<00:01:34.670> they're

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
creamy kind of formulas ever they're

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.630 
creamy kind of formulas ever they're
definitely<00:01:36.180> not<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:37.110> same<00:01:37.439> consistency<00:01:37.979> as<00:01:38.130> I

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
definitely not the same consistency as I

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.090 
definitely not the same consistency as I
don't<00:01:38.850> know<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> chap<00:01:39.329> stick<00:01:39.659> or<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> carmax<00:01:40.740> kind

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
don't know a chap stick or a carmax kind

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.039 
don't know a chap stick or a carmax kind
of<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.340> thing<00:01:41.579> they're<00:01:42.210> definitely<00:01:42.420> not<00:01:42.689> that

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
of a thing they're definitely not that

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.480 
of a thing they're definitely not that
they're<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.290> little<00:01:43.500> bit<00:01:43.680> thicker<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.159> little

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
they're a little bit thicker a little

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.480 
they're a little bit thicker a little
bit<00:01:44.610> more<00:01:45.060> dry<00:01:45.390> less<00:01:45.720> moisturizing<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.369> if

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
bit more dry less moisturizing so if

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.460 
bit more dry less moisturizing so if
you're<00:01:47.610> going<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.790> use<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:49.320> have

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
you're going to use this and you have

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.100 
you're going to use this and you have
like<00:01:49.500> dry<00:01:50.040> your<00:01:50.189> lips<00:01:50.369> or<00:01:50.790> lips<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.930> need

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
like dry your lips or lips that need

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.870 
like dry your lips or lips that need
moisturization<00:01:52.890> definitely<00:01:53.310> put<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> lip

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
moisturization definitely put on a lip

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.359 
moisturization definitely put on a lip
