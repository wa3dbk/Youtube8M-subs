protect him in his mobile state just

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.640 
protect him in his mobile state just
because<00:00:03.270> vein<00:00:03.750> isn't<00:00:04.110> one<00:00:04.200> of<00:00:04.259> those<00:00:04.350> people

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
because vein isn't one of those people

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.690 
because vein isn't one of those people
who<00:00:04.740> can<00:00:04.950> build<00:00:05.069> protection<00:00:05.609> around

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
who can build protection around

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.730 
who can build protection around
maintains<00:00:06.150> protection<00:00:06.600> as<00:00:06.690> she<00:00:06.810> goes<00:00:06.990> in<00:00:07.259> so

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
maintains protection as she goes in so

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.839 
maintains protection as she goes in so
you<00:00:07.830> need<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.010> build<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.220> lot<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.429> shields<00:00:08.730> for

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
you need to build a lot of shields for

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.549 
you need to build a lot of shields for
that<00:00:09.000> because<00:00:09.660> you'd<00:00:09.870> normally<00:00:10.080> don't<00:00:10.410> pick

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
that because you'd normally don't pick

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.900 
that because you'd normally don't pick
lool<00:00:10.710> unless<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:11.010> have<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.160> strong<00:00:11.460> tanker

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
lool unless you have a strong tanker

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.400 
lool unless you have a strong tanker
mainly<00:00:12.240> but<00:00:12.360> think<00:00:12.570> kind<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:12.990> fits<00:00:13.230> that

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
mainly but think kind of fits that

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.379 
mainly but think kind of fits that
she'll<00:00:13.790> not<00:00:14.790> sure<00:00:14.940> how<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.120> rest<00:00:15.269> of

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
she'll not sure how the rest of

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.550 
she'll not sure how the rest of
lemondogs<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.839> going<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.020> be<00:00:16.109> working<00:00:16.289> against

and<00:06:00.460> did<00:06:00.669> and<00:06:01.360> I<00:06:01.750> guess<00:06:01.930> that's<00:06:02.080> what<00:06:02.290> you<00:06:02.380> do

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
and did and I guess that's what you do

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.780 
and did and I guess that's what you do
when<00:06:02.620> you<00:06:02.710> surrender<00:06:02.949> your<00:06:03.130> its<00:06:03.370> discussion

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
when you surrender your its discussion

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.610 
when you surrender your its discussion
mode<00:06:04.060> already<00:06:04.240> because<00:06:04.840> you've<00:06:04.990> decided<00:06:05.410> the

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
mode already because you've decided the

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.290 
mode already because you've decided the
game<00:06:05.770> is<00:06:05.889> over<00:06:06.010> yeah<00:06:06.460> I<00:06:06.490> think<00:06:06.669> once<00:06:06.970> that<00:06:07.120> team

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
game is over yeah I think once that team

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.580 
game is over yeah I think once that team
fired<00:06:07.510> finished<00:06:07.870> they'd<00:06:07.990> already<00:06:08.169> started
