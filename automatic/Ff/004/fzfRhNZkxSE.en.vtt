microphone<00:00:12.509> techniques<00:00:12.990> recording<00:00:13.769> drums<00:00:14.009> is

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
microphone techniques recording drums is

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.519 
microphone techniques recording drums is
more<00:00:14.700> fun<00:00:14.940> than<00:00:14.969> most<00:00:15.299> people<00:00:15.660> think<00:00:15.870> most

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
more fun than most people think most

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.439 
more fun than most people think most
people<00:00:16.830> think<00:00:16.980> it's<00:00:17.190> like<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.550> huge<00:00:18.000> setup

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
people think it's like this huge setup

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.019 
people think it's like this huge setup
that<00:00:18.990> involves<00:00:19.410> complicated<00:00:20.100> mic<00:00:20.310> setups<00:00:20.820> and

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
that involves complicated mic setups and

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.090 
that involves complicated mic setups and
routings<00:00:21.480> but<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.140> think<00:00:22.470> we<00:00:22.590> can<00:00:22.740> simplify

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
routings but I think we can simplify

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.500 
routings but I think we can simplify
that<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.580> show<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.939> couple<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.330> cool

first thing I want to talk about today

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.200 
first thing I want to talk about today
is<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.949> general<00:00:29.310> setup<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.000> drum

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
is the general setup of the drum

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.990 
is the general setup of the drum
recording<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.990> chose<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.859> go<00:00:32.219> with<00:00:32.250> four

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
recording I chose to go with four

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.330 
recording I chose to go with four
overheads<00:00:33.989> here<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.500> do<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:35.070> for<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> very

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
overheads here I do that for a very

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.639 
overheads here I do that for a very
specific<00:00:35.730> reason<00:00:36.059> number<00:00:36.600> one<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.110> whenever<00:00:37.410> I

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
specific reason number one is whenever I

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.799 
specific reason number one is whenever I
use<00:00:37.980> hi-hat<00:00:38.430> microphones<00:00:38.969> they<00:00:39.210> never<00:00:39.450> do<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
use hi-hat microphones they never do the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.869 
use hi-hat microphones they never do the
job<00:00:40.050> for<00:00:40.260> me<00:00:40.290> they<00:00:41.129> kind<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.460> feel<00:00:41.640> isolated

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
job for me they kind of feel isolated

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.170 
job for me they kind of feel isolated
and<00:00:42.629> what<00:00:43.350> my<00:00:43.739> goal<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.309> as<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.640> recording

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
and what my goal is as a recording

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.600 
and what my goal is as a recording

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
engineer is to kind of like paint a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.940 
engineer is to kind of like paint a
picture<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.270> make<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.930> drums<00:00:49.230> as<00:00:49.530> live<00:00:49.739> as

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950

possible<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.670> picked<00:00:51.149> for<00:00:51.780> sure<00:00:52.230> KSM<00:00:53.039> 44<00:00:53.610> they

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
possible I picked for sure KSM 44 they

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.779 
possible I picked for sure KSM 44 they
are<00:00:54.570> large<00:00:54.899> diaphragm<00:00:55.379> condenser

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
are large diaphragm condenser

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.979 
are large diaphragm condenser
microphones<00:00:56.789> what<00:00:57.239> large<00:00:57.539> diaphragm

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
microphones what large diaphragm

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.349 
microphones what large diaphragm
condenser<00:00:58.250> microphones<00:00:59.250> do<00:00:59.489> really<00:00:59.820> well<00:01:00.059> is

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
condenser microphones do really well is

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.270 
condenser microphones do really well is
they<00:01:00.539> pick<00:01:00.840> up<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.199> lot<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.559> overall

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
they pick up a lot of overall

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.429 
they pick up a lot of overall
characteristics<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.449> sound<00:01:03.719> these<00:01:04.170> have

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
characteristics of a sound these have

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.890 
characteristics of a sound these have
like<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.920> very<00:01:05.280> big<00:01:05.610> bottom<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> very<00:01:06.600> big

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
like a very big bottom and a very big

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.950 
like a very big bottom and a very big
top<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.439> they'll<00:01:07.979> allow<00:01:08.369> us<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.720> catch<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
top and they'll allow us to catch the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.649 
top and they'll allow us to catch the
snare<00:01:10.229> drum<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.890> kick<00:01:11.100> drum<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.790> Tom's<00:01:12.090> two

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
cymbals the height of the microphones is

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.090

about three and a half to four feet that

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.010 
about three and a half to four feet that
gives<00:01:17.340> us<00:01:17.520> enough<00:01:17.820> room<00:01:18.150> for<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.570> drummer<00:01:18.810> not

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
gives us enough room for the drummer not

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.929 
gives us enough room for the drummer not
to<00:01:19.200> destroy<00:01:19.560> one<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.920> these<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.640> want<00:01:20.880> to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
to destroy one of these so I want to

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.429 
to destroy one of these so I want to
make<00:01:21.060> sure<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.390> I'm<00:01:21.540> kind<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.840> like<00:01:22.020> parallel

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
make sure that I'm kind of like parallel

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.749 
make sure that I'm kind of like parallel
to<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.920> symbols<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:25.170> tilting<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.700> a

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
to the symbols so tilting it in is a

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.730 
to the symbols so tilting it in is a
good<00:01:27.150> idea<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.689> can<00:01:27.900> also<00:01:28.080> tilt<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.680> a

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
good idea but you can also tilt it a

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.679 
good idea but you can also tilt it a
little<00:01:28.950> bit<00:01:29.130> towards<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.579> drummer<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.570> I'm

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
little bit towards the drummer so I'm

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:54.030 
little bit towards the drummer so I'm
going<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.140> reco<00:01:31.560> play<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.009> cymbals<00:01:32.220> Foss

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.770 

one<00:01:55.040> unusual<00:01:55.370> thing<00:01:55.640> that<00:01:56.090> a<00:01:56.120> lot<00:01:56.330> of<00:01:56.480> people

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
one unusual thing that a lot of people

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.990 
one unusual thing that a lot of people
don't<00:01:57.050> do<00:01:57.320> that<00:01:57.830> is<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.130> little<00:01:58.640> bit<00:01:58.850> more

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
don't do that is a little bit more

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.570 
don't do that is a little bit more

need<00:02:08.210> the<00:02:08.390> shells<00:02:08.660> to<00:02:08.960> make<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.320> tunnel<00:02:09.649> you

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
need the shells to make the tunnel you

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.710 
need the shells to make the tunnel you
can<00:02:09.800> use<00:02:10.130> anything<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:11.060> build<00:02:11.270> a<00:02:11.360> little<00:02:11.540> bit

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
can use anything to build a little bit

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.750 
can use anything to build a little bit
of<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:12.020> tunnel<00:02:12.290> so<00:02:12.800> right<00:02:13.040> here<00:02:13.250> we<00:02:13.400> have<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.520> bed

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
of a tunnel so right here we have a bed

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.090 
of a tunnel so right here we have a bed
of<00:02:13.880> 52<00:02:14.390> which<00:02:14.660> is<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:14.840> dynamic<00:02:15.380> mic<00:02:15.560> right<00:02:15.950> at

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
of 52 which is a dynamic mic right at

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.070 
of 52 which is a dynamic mic right at
the<00:02:16.220> hole<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.670> kick<00:02:16.850> drum<00:02:17.090> facing<00:02:17.780> towards

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
the hole of the kick drum facing towards

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.680 
the hole of the kick drum facing towards
the<00:02:18.230> beat<00:02:18.560> of<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:19.220> kick<00:02:19.550> drum<00:02:19.820> that<00:02:20.270> will<00:02:20.480> give

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
the beat of the kick drum that will give

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.350 
the beat of the kick drum that will give
us<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.990> initial<00:02:21.470> attack<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.760> little<00:02:23.240> bit

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
us the initial attack and a little bit

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.600 
us the initial attack and a little bit
of<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.690> low<00:02:23.840> end<00:02:23.870> but<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.650> very<00:02:24.890> deep<00:02:25.190> low<00:02:25.430> end

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
of the low end but the very deep low end

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.490 
of the low end but the very deep low end
of<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.940> kick<00:02:26.150> drum<00:02:26.390> we're<00:02:26.750> going<00:02:26.959> to<00:02:27.050> actually

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
of the kick drum we're going to actually

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.640 
of the kick drum we're going to actually
capture<00:02:27.770> four<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.640> five<00:02:28.880> feet<00:02:29.240> ahead<00:02:29.990> of<00:02:30.380> the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
capture four to five feet ahead of the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.680 
capture four to five feet ahead of the
kick<00:02:30.860> drum<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.730> reason<00:02:32.120> why<00:02:32.240> I<00:02:32.270> put<00:02:32.630> a

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
kick drum the reason why I put a

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.660 
kick drum the reason why I put a
microphone<00:02:33.140> outside<00:02:33.560> of<00:02:33.950> this<00:02:34.130> tunnel<00:02:34.400> is

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
microphone outside of this tunnel is

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.000 
microphone outside of this tunnel is
because<00:02:35.060> that<00:02:35.360> low<00:02:35.690> frequency<00:02:36.020> since<00:02:36.830> they

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
because that low frequency since they

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.430 
because that low frequency since they
have<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.190> longer<00:02:37.940> wavelength<00:02:38.240> they<00:02:38.959> just<00:02:39.230> need

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
have a longer wavelength they just need

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.520 
have a longer wavelength they just need
more<00:02:39.470> distance<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.459> translate<00:02:41.420> so<00:02:42.110> in<00:02:42.260> order

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
more distance to translate so in order

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.410 
more distance to translate so in order
for<00:02:42.709> me<00:02:42.800> to<00:02:42.980> actually<00:02:43.130> correctly<00:02:43.850> pick<00:02:44.239> up

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
for me to actually correctly pick up

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.720 
for me to actually correctly pick up
that<00:02:44.600> low<00:02:44.900> end<00:02:44.930> of<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.470> kick<00:02:45.739> drum<00:02:45.769> I<00:02:46.280> actually

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
that low end of a kick drum I actually

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.820 
that low end of a kick drum I actually
need<00:02:47.209> to<00:02:47.360> make<00:02:47.540> sure<00:02:47.570> that<00:02:47.989> I<00:02:48.019> place<00:02:48.380> my<00:02:48.590> kick

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
need to make sure that I place my kick

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.830 
need to make sure that I place my kick
drum<00:02:48.860> like<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.250> little<00:02:49.640> bit<00:02:49.760> farther<00:02:50.030> away<00:02:50.209> if<00:02:50.720> I

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
drum like a little bit farther away if I

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.720 
drum like a little bit farther away if I
want<00:02:51.019> to<00:02:51.140> capture<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.620> low<00:02:51.769> frequencies<00:02:52.430> and

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
want to capture the low frequencies and

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.750 
want to capture the low frequencies and
for<00:02:53.090> that<00:02:53.209> I<00:02:53.269> use<00:02:53.420> a<00:02:53.600> Mojave<00:02:54.110> real<00:02:54.800> one<00:02:55.220> fit

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
for that I use a Mojave real one fit

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.060 
for that I use a Mojave real one fit
it's<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.420> condenser<00:02:57.080> microphone<00:02:57.290> that<00:02:57.860> has<00:02:58.040> a

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
it's a condenser microphone that has a

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.729 
it's a condenser microphone that has a
low<00:02:58.610> frequency<00:02:59.180> response<00:02:59.330> from<00:02:59.900> 20<00:03:00.350> Hertz<00:03:00.380> to

low frequency response from 20 Hertz to
20<00:03:01.130> kilohertz<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.910> I'm<00:03:02.660> facing<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.230> kind<00:03:03.530> of

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
20 kilohertz and I'm facing it kind of

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.370 
20 kilohertz and I'm facing it kind of
like<00:03:03.830> towards<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.940> center<00:03:05.540> of<00:03:05.570> the<00:03:05.690> kick<00:03:06.080> drum

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
like towards the center of the kick drum

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.380 
like towards the center of the kick drum
and<00:03:06.590> what<00:03:07.160> I'm<00:03:07.280> going<00:03:07.459> to<00:03:07.519> do<00:03:07.640> later<00:03:07.940> is<00:03:08.209> I'm

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
and what I'm going to do later is I'm

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.540 
and what I'm going to do later is I'm
going<00:03:08.570> to<00:03:08.690> filter<00:03:08.989> all<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.769> high<00:03:09.980> end<00:03:10.010> off<00:03:10.519> so

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
going to filter all the high end off so

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.610 
going to filter all the high end off so
all<00:03:10.940> that<00:03:11.420> I'm<00:03:11.540> going<00:03:11.690> to<00:03:11.810> be<00:03:11.900> left<00:03:12.110> with<00:03:12.260> is

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
all that I'm going to be left with is

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.590 
all that I'm going to be left with is
the<00:03:12.830> low<00:03:13.040> end<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:13.519> that's<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.030> kind<00:03:14.300> of<00:03:14.420> low

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
the low end and that's the kind of low

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:35.270 
the low end and that's the kind of low
end<00:03:14.870> that<00:03:15.110> I<00:03:15.290> want<00:03:15.650> to<00:03:15.890> shake<00:03:16.130> my<00:03:16.160> subwoofer

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.380 

all<00:03:36.280> right<00:03:36.489> now<00:03:36.670> that<00:03:36.879> we<00:03:36.970> come<00:03:37.180> at<00:03:37.299> the

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
all right now that we come at the

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.000 
all right now that we come at the
kick-drum<00:03:37.569> let's<00:03:38.290> take<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.500> look<00:03:38.769> at<00:03:38.920> the

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
kick-drum let's take a look at the

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.179 
kick-drum let's take a look at the
scenario<00:03:39.430> on<00:03:39.579> the<00:03:39.670> top<00:03:40.239> we<00:03:40.450> use<00:03:40.599> the<00:03:40.810> sm57<00:03:41.500> we

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:42.189 
scenario on the top we use the sm57 we

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.399 
scenario on the top we use the sm57 we
kind<00:03:42.430> of<00:03:42.549> angled<00:03:42.970> it<00:03:43.090> towards<00:03:43.599> the<00:03:43.750> side<00:03:44.110> of

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:44.409 
kind of angled it towards the side of

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.770 
kind of angled it towards the side of
the<00:03:44.590> head<00:03:44.829> slightly<00:03:45.340> pointing<00:03:46.060> towards<00:03:46.569> the

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
the head slightly pointing towards the

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.720 
the head slightly pointing towards the
middle<00:03:47.140> of<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.470> head<00:03:47.680> we're<00:03:48.129> trying<00:03:48.489> to

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
middle of the head we're trying to

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.119 
middle of the head we're trying to
actually<00:03:48.849> get<00:03:49.299> pretty<00:03:49.810> close<00:03:50.110> to<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.680> head<00:03:50.890> to

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129 
actually get pretty close to the head to

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.520 
actually get pretty close to the head to
really<00:03:51.610> capture<00:03:51.909> that<00:03:52.120> attack<00:03:52.659> and<00:03:52.930> on<00:03:53.319> the

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
really capture that attack and on the

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.839 
really capture that attack and on the
bottom<00:03:54.129> we<00:03:54.579> are<00:03:54.610> using<00:03:55.109> anointment<00:03:56.109> km<00:03:56.849> 184

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
bottom we are using anointment km 184

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.869 
bottom we are using anointment km 184
and<00:03:58.180> that's<00:03:58.450> a<00:03:58.569> small<00:03:58.900> diaphragm<00:03:59.260> condenser

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
and that's a small diaphragm condenser

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.789 
and that's a small diaphragm condenser
having<00:04:00.879> it<00:04:01.000> face<00:04:01.239> towards<00:04:02.019> the<00:04:02.170> brushes<00:04:02.650> of

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
having it face towards the brushes of

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.979 
having it face towards the brushes of
the<00:04:02.950> snare<00:04:03.220> drum<00:04:03.489> it<00:04:03.909> will<00:04:04.209> give<00:04:04.420> us<00:04:04.569> a<00:04:04.720> very

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
the snare drum it will give us a very

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.890 
the snare drum it will give us a very
crispy<00:04:05.890> top<00:04:06.250> and<00:04:06.549> sound<00:04:06.909> that<00:04:07.060> we<00:04:07.299> can<00:04:07.569> then

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
crispy top and sound that we can then

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.500 
crispy top and sound that we can then
later<00:04:08.170> on<00:04:08.500> slightly<00:04:09.069> mix<00:04:09.549> into<00:04:10.090> the<00:04:10.239> fat

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
later on slightly mix into the fat

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:29.670 
later on slightly mix into the fat
attack<00:04:10.900> that<00:04:11.109> we<00:04:11.230> get<00:04:11.409> from<00:04:11.590> this<00:04:11.799> and<00:04:12.040> 57<00:04:28.680> so

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
attack that we get from this and 57 so

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.140 
attack that we get from this and 57 so
let's<00:04:29.889> take<00:04:30.070> a<00:04:30.100> look<00:04:30.310> at<00:04:30.490> what<00:04:30.639> we<00:04:30.760> got<00:04:30.880> set<00:04:31.120> up

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
let's take a look at what we got set up

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.870 
let's take a look at what we got set up
here<00:04:31.270> on<00:04:31.539> the<00:04:31.690> Tom's<00:04:31.960> we<00:04:32.470> got<00:04:32.620> two<00:04:32.800> md<00:04:33.250> 4/20

Tom mics a couple of inches away from
the<00:04:41.410> rooms<00:04:41.740> this<00:04:42.070> way<00:04:42.250> they<00:04:42.610> are<00:04:42.729> out<00:04:42.849> of<00:04:42.880> the

the rooms this way they are out of the

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.089 
the rooms this way they are out of the
way<00:04:43.210> of<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.510> drummer<00:04:43.750> sitting<00:04:44.229> and<00:04:44.410> I<00:04:44.889> can

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:45.099 
way of the drummer sitting and I can

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:47.070 
way of the drummer sitting and I can
also<00:04:45.280> catch<00:04:45.610> up<00:04:45.849> a<00:04:45.880> full<00:04:46.120> frequency<00:04:46.419> range<00:04:46.930> of

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
also catch up a full frequency range of

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.810 
also catch up a full frequency range of
the<00:04:47.229> tongue<00:04:47.470> so<00:04:48.010> we<00:04:48.160> want<00:04:48.340> to<00:04:48.430> point<00:04:48.639> the

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
the tongue so we want to point the

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.120 
the tongue so we want to point the
microphone<00:04:49.419> straight<00:04:50.289> towards<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:50.740> center

microphone straight towards the center
off<00:04:51.190> the<00:04:51.400> drum<00:04:51.639> because<00:04:51.970> that's<00:04:52.240> ways<00:04:52.479> going

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
off the drum because that's ways going

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.420 
off the drum because that's ways going
to<00:04:52.870> be<00:04:52.960> hitting<00:04:53.169> it<00:04:53.380> and<00:04:53.530> since<00:04:54.099> we<00:04:54.280> have<00:04:54.400> a

to be hitting it and since we have a

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.070 
to be hitting it and since we have a
little<00:04:54.639> bit<00:04:54.880> of<00:04:55.000> distance<00:04:55.180> we're<00:04:55.840> going<00:04:56.020> to

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
little bit of distance we're going to

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:19.070 
little bit of distance we're going to
catch<00:04:56.260> that<00:04:56.500> full<00:04:56.830> entire<00:04:57.160> sound
