let's<00:00:17.820> look<00:00:17.970> at<00:00:18.090> our<00:00:18.180> objectives<00:00:18.779> for<00:00:18.810> this

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
let's look at our objectives for this

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.550 
let's look at our objectives for this
video<00:00:20.930> you're<00:00:21.930> going<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.170> be<00:00:22.289> able<00:00:22.380> to

video you're going to be able to

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.439 
video you're going to be able to
differentiate<00:00:22.949> between<00:00:23.220> type<00:00:23.760> 1<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.000> type<00:00:24.150> 2

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
differentiate between type 1 and type 2

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.660 
differentiate between type 1 and type 2
diabetes

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
diabetes

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.890 
diabetes
you're<00:00:26.670> also<00:00:26.820> going<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.210> understand<00:00:27.630> how<00:00:27.689> each

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
you're also going to understand how each

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.210 
you're also going to understand how each
of<00:00:27.930> these<00:00:28.080> conditions<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.710> be<00:00:28.740> controlled

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
of these conditions can be controlled

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.580 
of these conditions can be controlled
and<00:00:29.730> then<00:00:30.599> finally<00:00:30.990> we're<00:00:31.410> going<00:00:31.529> to

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
and then finally we're going to

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.440 
and then finally we're going to
interpret<00:00:32.009> some<00:00:32.219> graphs<00:00:32.430> showing<00:00:32.640> data<00:00:32.940> from

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
interpret some graphs showing data from

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.979 
interpret some graphs showing data from
diabetic<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.170> non-diabetic<00:00:34.430> individuals

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
diabetic and non-diabetic individuals

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.319 
diabetic and non-diabetic individuals
let's<00:00:36.989> get<00:00:37.110> started<00:00:37.910> diabetes<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.149> a

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
forms of diabetes that you need to be

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.340 
forms of diabetes that you need to be
aware<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.899> type<00:00:52.500> 1<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.920> type<00:00:53.010> 2<00:00:53.960> type<00:00:54.960> 1<00:00:55.230> is

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
aware of type 1 and type 2 type 1 is

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.740 
aware of type 1 and type 2 type 1 is
also<00:00:55.620> known<00:00:55.739> as<00:00:55.829> insulin<00:00:56.250> dependent<00:00:56.370> diabetes

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
also known as insulin dependent diabetes

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.450 
also known as insulin dependent diabetes
whereas<00:00:57.750> type<00:00:57.930> 2<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.440> known<00:00:58.920> as<00:00:59.070> insulin

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
independent diabetes and the reason for

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.280 
independent diabetes and the reason for
these<00:01:01.710> names<00:01:01.949> will<00:01:02.100> become<00:01:02.370> clear<00:01:03.110> so<00:01:04.110> let's

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
these names will become clear so let's

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.920 
these names will become clear so let's
look<00:01:04.379> at<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.559> symptoms<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.040> diabetes<00:01:05.930> we've

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
look at the symptoms of diabetes we've

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.590 
look at the symptoms of diabetes we've
got<00:01:07.110> high<00:01:07.290> blood<00:01:07.530> glucose<00:01:07.920> levels<00:01:08.600> glucose

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
got high blood glucose levels glucose

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.899 
got high blood glucose levels glucose
and<00:01:09.750> urine<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.229> both<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.130> these<00:01:11.369> symptoms

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
and urine and both of these symptoms

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.789 
and urine and both of these symptoms
indicate<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.900> glucose<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.409> not<00:01:13.560> being

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
indicate the glucose is not being

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.030 
indicate the glucose is not being
absorbed<00:01:14.130> into<00:01:14.369> cells<00:01:14.640> correctly<00:01:15.890> then<00:01:16.890> we've

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
absorbed into cells correctly then we've

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.850 
absorbed into cells correctly then we've
got<00:01:17.220> increased<00:01:17.520> thirst<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.970> hunger<00:01:18.860> frequent

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.030 

now<00:01:33.990> we're<00:01:34.140> going<00:01:34.260> to<00:01:34.350> look<00:01:34.500> at<00:01:34.620> the<00:01:34.710> different

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
now we're going to look at the different

be secreted remember how earlier in the
video<00:02:04.200> said<00:02:04.620> that<00:02:04.740> type<00:02:04.920> 1<00:02:05.130> diabetes<00:02:05.550> was<00:02:05.970> also

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
video said that type 1 diabetes was also

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.109 
video said that type 1 diabetes was also
known<00:02:06.390> as<00:02:06.509> insulin<00:02:06.960> dependent<00:02:07.140> diabetes<00:02:08.119> this

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
known as insulin dependent diabetes this

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.550 
known as insulin dependent diabetes this
is<00:02:09.300> because<00:02:09.600> type<00:02:09.840> 1<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.140> controlled<00:02:10.500> by

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
is because type 1 is controlled by

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.220 
is because type 1 is controlled by

regular insulin injections the insulin
must<00:02:13.410> be<00:02:13.530> injected<00:02:13.980> because<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.430> protein<00:02:14.850> so

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
must be injected because of protein so

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.790 
must be injected because of protein so
if<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:15.390> was<00:02:15.480> taken<00:02:15.600> orally<00:02:15.989> it<00:02:16.530> would<00:02:16.709> be

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.180 
let's move on to type 2 diabetes type 2
diabetes<00:02:36.959> occurs<00:02:37.290> when<00:02:37.560> receptors<00:02:37.980> on<00:02:38.070> the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.930 
is type 2 diabetes controlled it's
important<00:03:14.070> to<00:03:14.130> regulate<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.640> amount<00:03:14.730> of

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
of insulin but the drugs can also slow

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.020

the absorption of glucose in the small
intestines<00:03:28.640> okay<00:03:29.640> so<00:03:30.000> our<00:03:30.120> final<00:03:30.450> objective

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600
