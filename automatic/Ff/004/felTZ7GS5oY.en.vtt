00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.130
 isomorphism which is isomorphism and its love 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.489
 physical is the one that seeks to capture the idea 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.120
 of having the same structures that is 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:36.659
 both graphs are and are more fast and are 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.570
 mathematically the same only vary from 

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:43.110
 that is to say, they maintain the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.540
 adjacency the structures and roads of 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.230
 cycles 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.090
 so that both graphs are and are morph 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.010
 they must comply with certain 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:57.260
 properties today we will be listing 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:01.970
 each of these properties that should 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:05.710
 to own the graphics so that they are and 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.770
 zoomorfas to start 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.470
 both graphs must have numbers of 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.530
 equal vertices let's start 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.070
 listing the number 1 chart for 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:22.479
 observe that the number of vertices has 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:27.340
 let's start vertex 1 vertex 2 27 3 26 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:30.640
 426 5 vertices 6 vertices 7 and vertices 8 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.229
 graph number one has vertex 8 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.450
 now 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.520
 let's list graph number 2 which 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.770
 must have the same number of vertices 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:46.289
 that complies with said property 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:50.399
 let's start vertex 127 227 3 vertex 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:54.329
 four vertices 5 vertices 6 26 7 and 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:57.750
 vertices 8 that is to say both graphs 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.390
 have an equal number of vertex vertices 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.080
 8 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.200
 now 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.570
 let's look at the second property that should 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.450
 have both graphs 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.180
 that is, both graphs must possess 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.340
 equal number of edges 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.599
 let's begin to enumerate in the graph 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:22.790
 number 1 the number of edges it has 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:27.900
 let's start edge 1 corner edge 2 edge 3 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:33.209
 edge 4 edge 5 and edge 6 edge 7 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:37.139
 edge 8 and edge 9 edge 10 and edge 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.780
 11 that is, the number one graph has 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:44.069
 edge 11 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:48.019
 now we list the graph number 2 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:53.909
 let's see edge 1 edge two edges 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:58.739
 3rd view 4 edges 5 edges 6 edges 7 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:03:02.909
 up to 8 edge 9 edge 10 and edge 11 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:06.469
 that is , both graphs have a number of 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.469
 edge 11 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.290
 now let's continue with the third point or 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.900
 the third property 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.359
 that speaks about the great the degree of 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.629
 vertices ie both graphs should 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:24.489
 have the same degree of the vertices we go 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:29.560
 to start enumerating in the graph 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:32.300
 number one and successively we compare 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:37.530
 with the graphic number 2 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:42.240
 we started the graph number 1 possesses in 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:45.300
 the vertex to grade 1 grade 2 grade 3 in 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.780
 the graph number 2 the vertex to possess 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:53.069
 grade 1 grade 2 and grade 3 both have 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:56.129
 grade 3 in the vertex p 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:59.579
 we can see that it contains grade 1 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:04.560
 grade 2 grade 3 on graph number 2 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:06.390
 the vertex b possesses degree 1 grade 2 and 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.819
 3rd grade 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:14.770
 in graph 1 the vertex c has degree 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:17.920
 1 grade 2 and 3 grade 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:22.600
 in graph number 2 the vertex is 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:25.750
 Contains grade 1 grade 2 grade 3 and grade 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.710
 4 is to say 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.590
 this shows that the graphs are not and 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.920
 they are morphic since both graphs must 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.750
 own both the number of vertices and 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.140
 the number of edges and the degree of 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:45.810
 vertices must be equal so 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.810
 the degree of the edges do not match 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.680
 there are other types of properties that 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.150
 they must also comply but in view 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.140
 that one of the properties does not 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:00.340
 coincide, it is not necessary to list the 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.340
 following properties
