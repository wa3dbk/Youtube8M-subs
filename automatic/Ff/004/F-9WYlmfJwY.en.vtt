for like five minutes and then you know
I<00:01:26.580> wet<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.000> down<00:01:27.149> again<00:01:27.539> and<00:01:27.780> let<00:01:28.410> it<00:01:28.530> set<00:01:28.740> for<00:01:28.770> a

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
I wet it down again and let it set for a

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
minute or two and then I light it up

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.910 
minute or two and then I light it up
with<00:01:30.690> you<00:01:30.960> know<00:01:31.050> three<00:01:31.229> or<00:01:31.350> four<00:01:31.380> pieces<00:01:31.679> of

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
with you know three or four pieces of

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.410 
with you know three or four pieces of
wood<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.100> there<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:33.000> then<00:01:33.119> when<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.330> gets

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
wood in there and then when it gets

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.229 
wood in there and then when it gets
going<00:01:34.009> slide<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.160> latch<00:01:35.340> over<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.910> then<00:01:36.000> shut

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:36.239 
going slide the latch over and then shut

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:38.029 
going slide the latch over and then shut
the<00:01:36.270> door<00:01:36.539> so<00:01:36.899> the<00:01:37.080> doors<00:01:37.349> will<00:01:37.560> stay<00:01:37.770> open

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
the door so the doors will stay open

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.729 
the door so the doors will stay open
about<00:01:38.459> a<00:01:38.520> quarter<00:01:38.940> of<00:01:38.970> an<00:01:39.149> inch<00:01:39.300> on<00:01:39.959> both<00:01:40.229> sides

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:40.739 
about a quarter of an inch on both sides

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:43.309 
about a quarter of an inch on both sides
so<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.160> got<00:01:41.580> good<00:01:41.819> air<00:01:42.060> flow<00:01:42.090> I'll<00:01:42.989> let<00:01:43.289> it

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:43.319 
so it's got good air flow I'll let it

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:46.150 
so it's got good air flow I'll let it
burn<00:01:43.890> like<00:01:44.160> that<00:01:44.399> for<00:01:44.550> like<00:01:44.670> 45<00:01:45.300> minutes<00:01:45.330> or<00:01:45.780> so

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
burn like that for like 45 minutes or so

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.979 
burn like that for like 45 minutes or so
then<00:01:47.160> I'll<00:01:47.280> open<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.819> doors<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.360> or<00:01:48.569> open<00:01:48.899> the

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:48.989 
then I'll open the doors and or open the

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:51.499 
then I'll open the doors and or open the
door<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.410> I'll<00:01:49.890> put<00:01:50.179> three<00:01:51.179> or<00:01:51.209> four<00:01:51.390> more

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
door and I'll put three or four more

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.969 
door and I'll put three or four more
pieces<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.989> wood<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.170> there<00:01:52.440> and<00:01:52.649> then<00:01:52.770> that's

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
pieces of wood in there and then that's

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.919 
pieces of wood in there and then that's
when<00:01:53.160> I'll<00:01:53.310> go<00:01:54.119> ahead<00:01:54.209> and<00:01:54.390> shut<00:01:54.599> the<00:01:54.750> back
