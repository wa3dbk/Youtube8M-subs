00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.660
 or the good friend of youtube in this 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.120
 video I will bring as 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.990
 his minister and me medications for 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.720
 treat it colibacillosis coincided and 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.630
 salmonellosis as I mentioned in a 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.630
 video before I sometimes have to 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:27.170
 there was this disease in the aviary 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.810
 because good they were apparent that what of 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.809
 all the eggs that were put almost all 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:37.070
 they died inside the chicken before leaving 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:39.500
 then to eradicate this and that the 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.989
 breeding season because at least the 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.129
 last answer come out good because I've 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.590
 had to risk and do the 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.320
 treatment then 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.630
 what product the muse for being and flower 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.590
 so that the being and flower especially for 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.860
 the alcohol and hesitated yes 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.780
 and then the pediatric setting declared 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.239
 pediatric says this is human 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.820
 It is effectively a treatment for 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.820
 human worth very little is worth two euros or 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.270
 well in the pharmacy and come 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.870
 100 milliliters then it is destined 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.600
 salmonellosis and it is also intended 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.720
 to urinary tract infections and all 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.540
 what is related to the apparatus of 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.930
 secretion of substances 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.350
 then as supplies well 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.350
 the sheriff 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.800
 comes in a boat as if it were a 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.460
 eye drops and threw three drops 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:43.430
 in a 40 milliliter drinker as I know 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.230
 me that a drinker of 40 milliliters or 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.580
 I'm measuring the sprue well with 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:51.880
 very easy as the density of the water 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:55.329
 it's a great match of the cubic centimeter 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:00.850
 because I would come with the rule and I 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:02.870
 I would say 44 centimeters that's what is going to 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.190
 be 40 milliliters 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:09.170
 more or less in a tube sprue would be 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.260
 something less 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.780
 something more than half of the sprue 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.970
 of tube but we go more or less so that 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.459
 have a reference then they would be 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.670
 three drops of being and flower in a sprue 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:26.210
 of 40 milliliters changing the water 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.160
 every day for a week 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.110
 because what we want to eradicate it 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.790
 complete and it's not a treatment 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.990
 preventive to a treatment because 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.960
 we have the account that the parents are 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.770
 sick then then I'm also going to 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.660
 use the pediatric the c trim so that is 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.850
 very easy for salmonellosis like now 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.040
 had said before and to prevent another 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.439
 type of diseases then 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.090
 well in this boat and what I do is 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:56.360
 that brings this shovel the big shovel here 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.930
 I 'll see it - 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:04.070
 the 5- milliliter large shovel and shovel 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:07.040
 girl is this is two and a half I do 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.050
 I fill the big word, that is, the 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.360
 shovel girl and done half in a 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.650
 drinker and half in another how much 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.040
 time, I'll give it to you 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.230
 five days something less than the sheriff what 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.600
 and I hope that the truth will work for me 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.580
 it's a bet 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.650
 but good everything is to save the 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.170
 bet that I 'll see if I can have 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.820
 better results and that way the thing 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.650
 go better then nothing if you have any 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.080
 doubt the products you used or of 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.270
 how I have supplied it, you only have to 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.310
 tell me and I will try to resolve 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.840
