 very well and I bring you green makeup and 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.660
 by the lips more road is thus strong 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.270
 intense perfect for the true autumn and 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.770
 when I had never dared to use 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.480
 this type of makeup as well as that 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.610
 he was lucky now I will soon 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.039
 is especially charming the lips 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.529
 do not see me had come to approve with 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.800
 these things that I did not do before I did not 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.199
 Forget thinking that maybe look at me the 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.170
 hand the bass and I do not know but friend and if not 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.850
 do not try if you do not dare him or 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.489
 will not know if it's right or wrong 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.449
 is good or bad I do not expect you to like it 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.449
 enjoy it 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.570
 well let's start by applying a 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.789
 I'm going to be using black prebase 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.230
 this peak theme in black ground but 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.570
 you can also use 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.309
 any normal black eyeliner and what 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.260
 we are going to apply on all the eyelid mobile 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.890
 so that the shadows are a little bit more 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.890
 striking 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.540
 we will not be blurring very well 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.689
 and we will also apply it in the part 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.689
 lower eye 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.350
 now we are going to be using this 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.659
 pale green color of the pallet 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.490
 wet and wild conversion and we're going to 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.430
 apply in the first half of the eyelid 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.950
 mobile 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.950
 and doing the same at the bottom 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.720
 of the eye ok now let's catch this 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.960
 iridescent green and we are going to apply it 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.490
 in the part of the center of the eye 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.220
 blurring it also with the shadow that 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.530
 we previously applied this color to me 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.780
 fascinates because depending on the angle 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.150
 that you look at it you can see different 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.280
 colors blue green up brown can 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.130
 that in a beautiful color 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.170
 we keep blurring 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.150
 and we will also apply it in the part 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.310
 lower eye 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.290
 now we are going to be eating this green 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.880
 stop here and we'll go 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.680
 applying from the outside of the eye 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.140
 towards the account in order to define a 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.490
 little bit more the logo and also give it a 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.490
 smoked touch that look 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.370
 we will be doing the same in the 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.740
 lower part of the eye making a 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.450
 small but do not worry about 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.930
 make it perfect because we will be 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.930
 discriminating 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.010
 more or less well ok now we will be 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.900
 taking this color creampie that you 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.880
 come here and we will be applying it in 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.950
 the eyebrow bone to illuminate that 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.900
 area and also for us to make a 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.610
 It's a little easier to blur this color 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.460
 mole that you see here that we are going to 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.420
 be applying between the bone of the 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.420
 eyebrow and the basin 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.170
 let's blur 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.170
 we keep blurring, blurring 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.170
 important 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.720
 well now we will be using 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.849
 this delineador de l'orÃ©al that I 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.709
 fascinates and we will be delineating the 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:08.220
 water line up and down to 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.990
 intensify even more the makeup 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.110
 and in this part if you do not have much 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.850
 experience with much careful also 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.940
 we are going to be defining the part 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.670
 superior exterior of the eye only that 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.980
 We're not going to take it deep inside and 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.780
 doing a little bit but we're not going 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.950
 to worry too much because what 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.950
 we are going to be blurring 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.800
 the same in the lower part of the eye the 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.800
 same delineated 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.079
 ok now let's blur these 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.810
 outlined that we just did now 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.080
 same and we will discriminate 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.320
 thanks 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.970
 and we're also going to extend the fast what 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.330
 let's extend a little bit more 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.330
 outside 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.130
 the same in the lower eye 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.810
 ok now we are going to be using the 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.640
 same shadow that we use to illuminate the 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.190
 eyebrow bone we will do it for 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.950
 illuminate the lacrimal and we're also going to 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.360
 apply a little bit below all those 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.980
 shadows that we apply in the part 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.269
 lower eye but just a little 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.769
 almost nothing and we will also blur it 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.280
 now we are going to be applying my mask 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.690

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.949
 superior and inferior 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.980
 and she finished our eyes now let's 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.800
 be using this eyeliner 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.510
 of Jordanian in dark brown and we're going to 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.230
 use to outline the lips 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.230
 up and down 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.140
 make sure when you are going to use it 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.480
 new in the eyes because it disinfected 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.640
 fairly good 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.650

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.090
 but you can also use a 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.220
 brush 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.990

 double fiber to control a 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.270
 little bit more the color since we have 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.430
 a lot of color in the eyes and on the lips 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.170
 and so as not to overload , 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.170
