could get it I think I couldn't make the

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.490 
could get it I think I couldn't make the
whole<00:03:14.910> castle<00:03:15.239> because<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:16.140> didn't<00:03:16.350> have

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
whole castle because I didn't have

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.470

goes around it that weird rocky part
where<00:03:25.470> kind<00:03:25.650> of<00:03:25.709> went<00:03:25.860> down<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.100> a<00:03:26.130> grid<00:03:26.489> I

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970
