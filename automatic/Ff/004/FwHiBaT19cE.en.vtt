00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.510 
hair dye think that's what it's called I

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.150 
hair dye think that's what it's called I
just<00:00:09.510> use<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:10.019> walnuts<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.469> highlights<00:00:10.860> on<00:00:11.010> it

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
just use the walnuts of highlights on it

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.339 
just use the walnuts of highlights on it
so<00:00:11.730> if<00:00:11.790> i'm<00:00:11.880> not<00:00:12.030> mistaken<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.750> the

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
so if i'm not mistaken this is the

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.160 
so if i'm not mistaken this is the
second<00:00:14.210> this<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.509> lightest<00:00:15.870> or<00:00:16.049> the

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
second this is the lightest or the

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.620 
second this is the lightest or the
second<00:00:16.650> two<00:00:17.039> lightest<00:00:17.369> shade<00:00:17.400> i<00:00:17.850> think<00:00:18.539> the

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
second two lightest shade i think the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.510 
second two lightest shade i think the
other<00:00:18.660> one<00:00:18.990> has<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.590> just<00:00:19.890> as<00:00:20.039> light<00:00:20.250> but<00:00:20.460> it

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
other one has is just as light but it

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.939 
other one has is just as light but it
has<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.670> copper<00:00:21.359> in<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.840> i'm<00:00:22.590> just<00:00:22.800> going<00:00:22.920> to

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
better this way um I do use a 30

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.940 
better this way um I do use a 30
developer<00:01:24.810> with<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.290> don't<00:01:25.500> use<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.799> whole

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
developer with it I don't use the whole

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.859 
developer with it I don't use the whole
thing<00:01:26.159> because<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.939> tube<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.390> only<00:01:27.570> need

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
thing because the tube you only need

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.280 
thing because the tube you only need
half<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.530> little<00:01:28.829> thing<00:01:29.040> um<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:30.290> didn't

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
half of this little thing um I didn't

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.380 
half of this little thing um I didn't
want<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.470> go<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.680> 40<00:01:32.040> because<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:33.060> red<00:01:33.240> that

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
want to go to a 40 because the red that

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.050 
want to go to a 40 because the red that
I<00:01:33.479> chose<00:01:33.750> was<00:01:34.049> already<00:01:34.200> pretty<00:01:34.560> bright<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.970> I

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
I chose was already pretty bright and I

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.249 
I chose was already pretty bright and I
feel<00:01:36.270> like<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.390> 40<00:01:36.750> would<00:01:36.869> make<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.140> look

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
feel like a 40 would make it look

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.200 
feel like a 40 would make it look
brighter<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:38.460> would<00:01:38.579> probably<00:01:38.820> damaged

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
brighter and it would probably damaged

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.210 
brighter and it would probably damaged
my<00:01:39.360> hair<00:01:39.540> even<00:01:39.780> more<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.770> didn't<00:01:41.159> really

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
my hair even more so I didn't really

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.990 
my hair even more so I didn't really
want<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.610> do<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.790> um<00:01:43.340> this<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.790> third

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000

L'Oreal<00:01:47.850> died<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.560> i<00:01:49.560> think<00:01:50.310> it's<00:01:50.460> worked

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
L'Oreal died and i think it's worked

L'Oreal died and i think it's worked
pretty<00:01:51.390> well<00:01:51.930> for<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.320> I've<00:01:52.590> had<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:53.070> prolly

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
pretty well for it I've had this prolly

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.530 
pretty well for it I've had this prolly
for<00:01:53.729> like<00:01:53.909> three<00:01:54.299> weeks<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:55.530> even<00:01:55.680> my<00:01:56.009> roots

for like three weeks and even my roots

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.230 
for like three weeks and even my roots
like<00:01:57.540> they're<00:01:58.079> not<00:01:58.229> really<00:01:58.640> even<00:01:59.640> close<00:02:00.210> to

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240
