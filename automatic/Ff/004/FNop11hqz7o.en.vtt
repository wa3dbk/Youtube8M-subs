down<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:18.050> you<00:02:18.340> staple<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.610> like<00:02:19.760> that<00:02:19.970> so<00:02:20.750> that

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
down and you staple it like that so that

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.450 
down and you staple it like that so that
way<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.140> have<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.410> smooth<00:02:21.800> side<00:02:22.780> right<00:02:23.780> here

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
way you have the smooth side right here

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.510 
way you have the smooth side right here
