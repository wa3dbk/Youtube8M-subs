00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.180
 I will not go deep into the 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.299
 subject not that I already have a video on 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.250
 channel on that and there has to be 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.429
 the missions to gain respect and 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.659
 going from level to dare but new 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:08.479

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.400
 holdouts that is not unique to the case of 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:16.069
 Survival that has there have the stores 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.630
 where food stores thing 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.420
 you will need in the middle of the game of 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.830
 remedies chosen 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.880
 This is making me lesson to win. 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.819
 money 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.260
 i the level crossing in the middle of the emission 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.280
 you will find play the others 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.940
 players in the middle of the field and so can 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.860
 be that they help only have no beginning 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.150
 mess up because he does not have them 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.159
 to kill 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.939
 still good because otherwise they would kill the 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:47.939
 unless you are in the arena 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.950
 pvp within the local network of 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:54.120
 resistance 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.189
 so this is us is a really cool game is 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.159
 the best you will need is only the 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:06.299
 plugin for unite web player 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:08.879
 It is a zombie dm rpg game that is already 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:12.090
 good and also has elements of survival 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:15.150
 horror and it's free, right? 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:20.190

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.379
 play and then it's just that people 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.409
