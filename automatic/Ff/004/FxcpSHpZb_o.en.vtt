00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.640 
there but I ended up having to edit out
a<00:01:42.320> lot<00:01:42.590> of<00:01:42.740> this<00:01:43.030> also<00:01:44.030> because

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
a lot of this also because

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.070 
a lot of this also because
just<00:01:47.550> because<00:01:47.730> it<00:01:47.910> does<00:01:48.090> really<00:01:48.360> crappy<00:01:48.870> at

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
just because it does really crappy at

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.430 
just because it does really crappy at
like<00:01:50.010> non<00:01:50.280> multi<00:01:51.210> combat<00:01:51.630> zones<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.230> whenever

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
like non multi combat zones and whenever

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.380 
like non multi combat zones and whenever
I<00:01:52.650> was<00:01:52.800> recording<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.310> I'd<00:01:53.520> forgotten<00:01:54.210> that

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
I was recording this I'd forgotten that

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.750 
I was recording this I'd forgotten that
so<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.380> figured<00:01:55.800> what<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.130> heck<00:01:56.400> I'll<00:01:56.580> just

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
so I figured what the heck I'll just

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.340 
so I figured what the heck I'll just
finish<00:01:56.970> it<00:01:57.270> but<00:01:57.680> yeah<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.800> does<00:01:59.010> pretty<00:01:59.220> crappy

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
finish it but yeah it does pretty crappy

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.170 
finish it but yeah it does pretty crappy
anyways<00:02:01.460> right<00:02:02.460> here<00:02:03.560> will<00:02:04.560> be<00:02:04.890> white<00:02:05.880> knights

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
anyways right here will be white knights

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.660 
anyways right here will be white knights
I've<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:07.140> think<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.680> white<00:02:07.830> knights<00:02:08.040> are<00:02:08.220> 61

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
I've I think the white knights are 61

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.770 
I've I think the white knights are 61
level<00:02:09.509> 61<00:02:10.880> it<00:02:11.880> does<00:02:12.060> some<00:02:12.240> pretty<00:02:12.360> good<00:02:12.570> hits

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
level 61 it does some pretty good hits

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.720 
level 61 it does some pretty good hits
on<00:02:12.960> them<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.410> had<00:02:13.590> added<00:02:13.980> out<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.130> lot<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.370> time

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
on them I had added out a lot of time

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.970 
on them I had added out a lot of time
good<00:02:15.000> but<00:02:15.360> because<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.500> fact<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.800> there

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
good but because of the fact that there

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.370 
good but because of the fact that there
was<00:02:17.070> only<00:02:17.190> like<00:02:17.340> two<00:02:17.490> or<00:02:17.820> three<00:02:17.850> there<00:02:18.270> so<00:02:19.050> it

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
was only like two or three there so it

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.010 
was only like two or three there so it
was<00:02:19.500> kind<00:02:19.740> of<00:02:19.770> hard<00:02:19.950> for<00:02:20.240> like<00:02:21.240> them<00:02:21.660> waiting

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
was kind of hard for like them waiting

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.470 
was kind of hard for like them waiting
for<00:02:22.320> them<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.470> come<00:02:22.709> back<00:02:22.920> like<00:02:23.910> constantly

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
for them to come back like constantly

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.230 
for them to come back like constantly
but<00:02:25.140> on<00:02:25.800> here<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.250> just<00:02:26.459> get<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.700> awesomeness

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
but on here you just get the awesomeness

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.830 
but on here you just get the awesomeness
of<00:02:27.290> having<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.380> immediately<00:02:28.770> come<00:02:29.840> anyways

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
of having it immediately come anyways

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.240 
of having it immediately come anyways
it's<00:02:31.830> some<00:02:32.100> pretty<00:02:32.220> good<00:02:32.459> hits<00:02:32.730> on

was<00:04:20.430> I<00:04:20.700> was<00:04:20.910> trying<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.180> look<00:04:21.390> at<00:04:21.480> him<00:04:21.660> there

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
was I was trying to look at him there

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.740 
was I was trying to look at him there
were<00:04:22.260> some<00:04:22.610> ice<00:04:23.610> guards<00:04:24.210> that<00:04:24.390> I<00:04:24.450> was<00:04:24.600> shooting

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
were some ice guards that I was shooting

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.340 
were some ice guards that I was shooting
at<00:04:25.080> and<00:04:25.350> I<00:04:25.470> figured<00:04:25.970> mmm<00:04:26.970> like<00:04:27.810> I<00:04:27.990> had<00:04:28.110> to<00:04:28.170> run

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
at and I figured mmm like I had to run

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.660 
at and I figured mmm like I had to run
off<00:04:28.530> to<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.740> side<00:04:28.950> to<00:04:29.160> see<00:04:29.340> what<00:04:29.490> it<00:04:29.580> was

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
off to the side to see what it was

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.130 
off to the side to see what it was
hitting<00:04:29.940> on<00:04:30.030> them<00:04:30.180> which<00:04:30.450> I<00:04:30.600> didn't<00:04:30.870> record

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
hitting on them which I didn't record

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.570 
hitting on them which I didn't record
that<00:04:31.410> though<00:04:31.620> just<00:04:31.950> because<00:04:32.130> I<00:04:32.340> would<00:04:32.490> have

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
that though just because I would have

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.030 
that though just because I would have
been<00:04:32.670> done<00:04:32.790> like<00:04:33.030> right<00:04:33.270> there<00:04:33.420> was<00:04:33.750> but<00:04:34.680> so<00:04:34.980> I

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
been done like right there was but so I

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.650 
been done like right there was but so I
figured<00:04:35.460> what<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:35.880> heck<00:04:36.120> I'll<00:04:36.300> go<00:04:36.450> to<00:04:36.510> these

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
figured what the heck I'll go to these

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.570 
figured what the heck I'll go to these
guys<00:04:36.870> and<00:04:36.930> then<00:04:37.290> I<00:04:37.320> actually<00:04:37.620> recorded<00:04:38.220> a<00:04:38.310> lot

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
guys and then I actually recorded a lot

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.520 
guys and then I actually recorded a lot
more<00:04:38.820> than<00:04:39.030> I<00:04:39.060> put<00:04:39.300> on<00:04:39.420> here<00:04:39.630> just<00:04:40.230> because<00:04:40.380> the

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
more than I put on here just because the

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.390 
more than I put on here just because the
video<00:04:40.680> is<00:04:40.860> getting<00:04:41.220> kind<00:04:41.490> of<00:04:41.550> long<00:04:43.010> but<00:04:44.010> yeah

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
video is getting kind of long but yeah

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.550 
video is getting kind of long but yeah
it<00:04:44.550> did<00:04:44.730> some<00:04:44.940> pretty<00:04:45.060> good<00:04:45.240> hits<00:04:45.450> right<00:04:45.600> um<00:04:45.960> I

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
it did some pretty good hits right um I

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.600 
it did some pretty good hits right um I
don't<00:04:46.920> know<00:04:47.040> if<00:04:47.100> you've<00:04:47.220> seen<00:04:47.250> it<00:04:47.430> or<00:04:47.490> not

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
don't know if you've seen it or not

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.300 
don't know if you've seen it or not
there's<00:04:47.880> a<00:04:47.940> 30<00:04:48.240> before<00:04:48.480> the<00:04:48.870> switch<00:04:49.310> they're

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
there's a 30 before the switch they're

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.100 
there's a 30 before the switch they're
just<00:04:50.340> because<00:04:50.910> it<00:04:51.210> does<00:04:51.390> a<00:04:51.420> couple<00:04:51.660> randoms

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
just because it does a couple randoms

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.380 
just because it does a couple randoms
which<00:04:52.290> is<00:04:52.440> just<00:04:52.620> as<00:04:52.800> I<00:04:52.920> tried<00:04:53.130> putting<00:04:53.340> up<00:04:53.580> just

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
times where it was hitting a lot more

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.810 
times where it was hitting a lot more
than<00:04:57.000> not<00:04:57.180> hitting<00:04:57.510> instead<00:04:58.440> of<00:04:58.730> just<00:04:59.730> putting

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820
