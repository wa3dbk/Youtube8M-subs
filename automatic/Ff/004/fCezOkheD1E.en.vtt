but<00:00:43.270> for<00:00:43.300> this<00:00:43.480> demo<00:00:43.810> I'm<00:00:43.930> going<00:00:43.960> to<00:00:44.170> go<00:00:44.500> ahead

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
but for this demo I'm going to go ahead

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.620 
but for this demo I'm going to go ahead
and<00:00:44.860> turn<00:00:45.100> on<00:00:45.280> the<00:00:45.880> MIDI<00:00:46.060> controls

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
and turn on the MIDI controls

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.810 
and turn on the MIDI controls
there's<00:00:47.020> also<00:00:47.200> help<00:00:47.560> available<00:00:47.860> but<00:00:48.550> we<00:00:48.640> won't

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
there's also help available but we won't

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.810 
there's also help available but we won't
need<00:00:48.910> it<00:00:48.970> for<00:00:49.210> this<00:00:49.300> demo<00:00:49.510> so<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:51.730> the

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
need it for this demo so in the

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:52.350 
need it for this demo so in the
background

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
background

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.900 
background
I<00:00:52.450> have<00:00:52.960> thumbjam<00:00:53.620> running<00:00:54.190> and<00:00:54.340> I<00:00:54.700> have<00:00:54.880> a

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
I have thumbjam running and I have a

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.670 
I have thumbjam running and I have a
Scottish<00:00:55.360> small<00:00:55.630> pipe<00:00:55.870> sample<00:00:56.380> selected

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
Scottish small pipe sample selected

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.970 
Scottish small pipe sample selected
therefore<00:00:57.190> both<00:00:57.280> the<00:00:57.550> chanter<00:00:58.360> and<00:00:58.510> drones

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
therefore both the chanter and drones

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:21.600 
therefore both the chanter and drones
and<00:00:59.980> we'll<00:01:00.130> go<00:01:00.220> ahead<00:01:00.490> and<00:01:00.790> start<00:01:01.300> playing

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.190 

now<00:01:22.610> we're<00:01:22.820> not<00:01:22.940> limited<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.420> just<00:01:23.540> bagpipe

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
now we're not limited to just bagpipe

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.680 
now we're not limited to just bagpipe
sounds<00:01:24.680> any<00:01:25.130> sound<00:01:25.729> from<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.210> synthesizer

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
sounds any sound from the synthesizer

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.289 
sounds any sound from the synthesizer
can<00:01:27.049> be<00:01:27.140> played<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:28.190> at<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.430> same<00:01:28.640> time<00:01:28.909> I<00:01:29.150> have

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
can be played so at the same time I have

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.600 
can be played so at the same time I have
SampleTank<00:01:29.750> running<00:01:30.290> in<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.500> background<00:01:30.680> it

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
SampleTank running in the background it

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.080 
SampleTank running in the background it
has<00:01:31.640> a<00:01:32.150> string<00:01:32.659> patch<00:01:32.990> for<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:33.740> drones<00:01:34.220> and<00:01:34.520> a

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
has a string patch for the drones and a

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.300 
has a string patch for the drones and a
synthesizer<00:01:35.600> lead<00:01:35.930> patch<00:01:36.229> for<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:36.890> chanter

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
synthesizer lead patch for the chanter

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.080 
synthesizer lead patch for the chanter
so<00:01:38.030> we'll<00:01:38.149> switch<00:01:38.360> back<00:01:38.390> to<00:01:39.350> MIDI<00:01:40.190> chanter<00:01:40.670> I'm

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
so we'll switch back to MIDI chanter I'm

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.940 
so we'll switch back to MIDI chanter I'm
going<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:41.360> just<00:01:41.540> change<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:42.110> output<00:01:42.590> channel

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
going to just change the output channel

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.950 
going to just change the output channel
of<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.159> app<00:01:43.280> from<00:01:43.970> channels<00:01:44.330> 1<00:01:44.509> and<00:01:44.659> 2<00:01:44.810> that

00:01:48.670 --> 00:02:13.059 
and 4 that are being used by SampleTank
and<00:01:49.670> we'll<00:01:49.790> go<00:01:49.880> ahead<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:50.149> start<00:01:50.330> the<00:01:50.450> drones

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.300 

so<00:02:14.069> there<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.250> go<00:02:14.569> that's<00:02:15.569> Nidhi<00:02:16.200> chanter<00:02:16.680> the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
so there you go that's Nidhi chanter the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.190 
so there you go that's Nidhi chanter the
