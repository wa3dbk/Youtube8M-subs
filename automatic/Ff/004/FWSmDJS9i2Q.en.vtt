00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.960 
not really yeah even if he's joking two
at<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.140> time<00:00:28.230> there<00:00:28.740> are<00:00:28.769> what<00:00:29.039> eight<00:00:29.519> hundred

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
at a time there are what eight hundred

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.790 
at a time there are what eight hundred
guys<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.570> room<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:31.199> that's<00:00:31.380> four<00:00:31.769> hundred

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
guys in that room so that's four hundred

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.459 
guys in that room so that's four hundred
times<00:00:32.399> whatever<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.910> mean<00:00:33.090> jerk<00:00:33.390> time<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
times whatever the mean jerk time is the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.650 
times whatever the mean jerk time is the
one<00:00:34.649> mean<00:00:35.309> jerk<00:00:35.670> time<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.210> mean<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.510> doesn't

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
one mean jerk time I mean it doesn't

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.170 
one mean jerk time I mean it doesn't
matter<00:00:36.899> but<00:00:37.260> hypothetically<00:00:38.219> time<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.910> equal

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
matter but hypothetically time is equal

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.680 
matter but hypothetically time is equal
to<00:00:39.300> four<00:00:39.540> total<00:00:39.960> jerks<00:00:40.290> at<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> two<00:00:40.710> dick<00:00:41.010> rate

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
to four total jerks at a two dick rate

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.630 
to four total jerks at a two dick rate
unless<00:00:42.690> Erlich<00:00:43.260> jerks<00:00:43.559> off<00:00:43.770> four<00:00:44.129> guys<00:00:44.340> at<00:00:44.579> a

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
unless Erlich jerks off four guys at a

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.770 
unless Erlich jerks off four guys at a
time<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.059> then<00:00:45.149> we<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.329> cut<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.750> half

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
time and then we can cut that in half

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.290 
time and then we can cut that in half
how<00:00:46.410> would<00:00:46.530> he<00:00:46.590> do<00:00:46.739> four<00:00:47.039> guys<00:00:47.520> he's<00:00:47.850> got<00:00:48.030> two

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
how would he do four guys he's got two

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.119 
how would he do four guys he's got two
hands<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.750> that's<00:00:48.930> two<00:00:49.320> dicks<00:00:49.620> at<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> time

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
hands so that's two dicks at a time

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.889 
hands so that's two dicks at a time
right<00:00:50.340> look<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.760> have<00:00:50.879> two<00:00:51.149> guys<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.690> either

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
right look you have two guys on either

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.290 
right look you have two guys on either
side<00:00:52.320> with<00:00:52.680> their<00:00:52.890> decks<00:00:53.190> tip<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.760> tip<00:00:54.000> so

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
side with their decks tip to tip so

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.150 
side with their decks tip to tip so
you're<00:00:54.420> going<00:00:54.809> full<00:00:55.079> length<00:00:55.670> for<00:00:56.670> c/o<00:00:58.160> from

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
you're going full length for c/o from

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.709 
you're going full length for c/o from
the<00:00:59.280> middle<00:00:59.520> out<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.969> does<00:01:00.149> make<00:01:00.300> sense

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
the middle out that does make sense

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.720 
the middle out that does make sense
time<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.020> shake<00:01:01.199> weights<00:01:01.680> yeah<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.309> what<00:01:02.550> we're

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
time to shake weights yeah so what we're

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.060 
time to shake weights yeah so what we're
trying<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.120> do<00:01:03.300> hypothetically<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.409> minimize

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
trying to do hypothetically is minimize

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.320 
trying to do hypothetically is minimize
time<00:01:05.489> which<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.330> 800<00:01:06.750> dudes<00:01:07.590> x<00:01:08.250> mean<00:01:08.610> jerk<00:01:09.030> time

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
time which is 800 dudes x mean jerk time

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.660 
time which is 800 dudes x mean jerk time
divided<00:01:09.960> by<00:01:10.080> four<00:01:10.439> dicks<00:01:10.740> at<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> time<00:01:11.340> of

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
divided by four dicks at a time of

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.140 
divided by four dicks at a time of
course

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
course

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.300 
course
Orlick<00:01:12.390> would<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.869> presort<00:01:13.470> guys<00:01:13.740> behind

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
Orlick would have to presort guys behind

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.609 
Orlick would have to presort guys behind
so<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.580> their<00:01:14.970> dicks<00:01:15.330> lined<00:01:15.720> up<00:01:15.930> not<00:01:16.200> by<00:01:16.409> high

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
so that their dicks lined up not by high

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.469 
so that their dicks lined up not by high
technically<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.850> measurement<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.360> we're

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
technically the measurement that we're

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.920 
technically the measurement that we're
looking<00:01:18.570> for<00:01:18.900> really<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.530> dicta<00:01:20.340> floor<00:01:20.930> call

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
looking for really is dicta floor call

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.880 
looking for really is dicta floor call
that<00:01:22.140> D<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.560> F<00:01:22.770> huh<00:01:23.759> oh<00:01:24.060> my<00:01:24.840> god<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.680> know<00:01:25.770> if<00:01:25.830> a

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
that D to F huh oh my god you know if a

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.370 
that D to F huh oh my god you know if a
guy's<00:01:26.070> dick<00:01:26.490> was<00:01:27.119> long<00:01:27.420> enough<00:01:27.750> he<00:01:28.170> would<00:01:28.290> be

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
guy's dick was long enough he would be

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.560 
guy's dick was long enough he would be
able<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.590> reach<00:01:28.799> up<00:01:29.040> or<00:01:29.340> down<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:30.090> another<00:01:30.299> guy

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
able to reach up or down to another guy

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.690 
able to reach up or down to another guy
with<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> different<00:01:31.259> D<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.530> F<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.250> longer<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
with a different D to F the longer the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.200 
with a different D to F the longer the
dick

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
dick

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.080 
dick
the<00:01:33.720> greater<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.290> D<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.650> F<00:01:34.829> bridge<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.549> would

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
the greater the D to F bridge I would

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.030 
the greater the D to F bridge I would
still<00:01:36.329> be<00:01:36.450> able<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.720> jerk<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.140> off<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:37.650> one

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
still be able to jerk it off in one

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.850 
still be able to jerk it off in one
smooth<00:01:38.340> motion<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:39.200> would<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.619> jerk

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
smooth motion I would just have to jerk

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.100 
smooth motion I would just have to jerk
it<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.040> an<00:01:41.159> angle<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.670> D<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.060> F<00:01:42.180> sub<00:01:42.360> one<00:01:42.600> needs

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
it on an angle so D to F sub one needs

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.109
