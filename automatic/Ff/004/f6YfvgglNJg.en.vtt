00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello dear friends of curiosity today 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.890
 I present you eight funny and 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.559
 also interesting facts about the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.559
 human body so let's go 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.400
 first fact the length of the evening 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.859
 corresponds approximately to the foot length 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.539
 so if we have the forearm of 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.000
 here from the wrist to the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.619
 elbow goes and thus the foot 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.239
 compare length I have here easy 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.920
 times a sandal taken from me that 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.559
 make it a little easier to get me 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.840
 then you can see that pretty much 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.890
 the foot length corresponds to i hold that 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.140
 here a bit more in the camera 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.570
 so that you see something like that, too 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.629
 her bottom is the elbow and above 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.399
 the true root of this fact is indeed 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.230
 pretty pointless but I think completely 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.910
 interesting and indeed that's it 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.530
 regardless of whether someone is big or small 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.360
 that should suit everyone 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.579
 try it out of fact always the two 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.770
 length of the hand corresponds approximately to 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.199
 size of the face I'll show you this 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.240
 and if her hand to the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.150
 face lays down when we realize that 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.729
 she pretty much from the child to the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.619
 Hairline is synonymous with everyone 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.890
 people actually different 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.320
 but should all fit exactly find 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.090
 I'm actually pretty interesting 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.070
 I did not think that that's it 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.670
 There are similarities in the body for the body 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.390
 it thought 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.280
 fact number three is actually no 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.590
 more factual, but almost he is so 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.799
 a trick and if that on the go 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.720
 you want to measure something and it helps 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.880
 if you have the time span 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.400
 between the little finger and the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:47.700
 I measured it from thumb to thumb 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:49.740
 that's just me with 21 cm at the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.060
 Most people are about 20 cm 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.070
 You can do that too easily 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.630
 Remember and if you are somewhere since and 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.409
 what you want to know the outside can you 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.780
 just hand in and do it easy 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.189
 calculate and do not have the extra 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.020
 For example, if you pick kainz for years 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.700
 thus it could now approximately pi 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.860
 time to estimate how big 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.390
 that's number four in men 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.289
 the ring finger longer than that 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.090
 index finger 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.190
 you see that here with me is the 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.950
 ring finger and here is the index finger 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.170
 and if you think well that's right 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.060
 that can be but what is it 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.430
 interesting the interesting is that 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.959
 for women, the index finger is longer 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.970
 as the ring finger pretty much 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.670
 vice versa and that is almost all 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.560
 humans so scientists conduct that 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.440
 of the testosterone mirror from 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.780
 Testosterone is the male 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.209
 Sex hormone and if you have a lot 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.569
 Testosterone has a longer lasting impact 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.799
 ring finger out as a forefinger 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.209
 Women, for example, have a long one 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.489
 ring finger or respectively 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.290
 which is longer than the index finger 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:53.670
 are also considered very assertive 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.739
 and mostly not as emotional as 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.150
 It is actually known by women 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.040
 so they are more masculine 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.900
 characteristics and vice versa is that 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.040
 actually in men the one 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.690
 longer forefinger than one 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.420
 So you can ring finger have it 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.200
 read a lot as the person so 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.880
 it's a bit 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.590
 besides, scientists still have 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.690
 other things found out the man 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.470
 read on the basis of this finger 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.910
 and somehow the heart attack risk 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.510
 spelling weaknesses and many more 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.639
 other things 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.799
 hello I did not think that 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.359
 our fingers betray so much about us 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.739
 just look at my fingers yours 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.500
 fellow men to be amazed 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.810
 that's almost always on the people 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.760
 number five is true you can 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.240
 Do not hold your nose while doing so 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:44.320
 at the same time for five seconds 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:46.330
 make that just try it out 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.920
 you will notice for yourself that is 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.870
 Of course not quite serious but meant 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.760
 I still think it's funny 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.990
 the next fact is actually like that 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:59.410
 Similarly you can not with the 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:04:03.220
 nose on your elbows is easy 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.900
 no human is not so mobile and 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.300
 if it did send a photo of it 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.370
 I would like to see that fact 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.230
 number 7 toothpaste linter the 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.300
 hunger feeling and if you are one 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.320
 bit of toothpaste on euro zone plays 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.840
 and that a little more and 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.570
 you have less hunger distributed that is 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.100
 of course not useful for one 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.750
 healthy eating knows I think 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.980
 not recommended everyone everything if you 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.080
 really hungry or lose weight 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.210
 Wanted to pretend that would not be there 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.920
 it is a much healthier way but me 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.390
 find it interesting that this little one 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.850
 I believe there is menthol in this 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.750
 taste that self me that 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.700
 hungry feeling 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.040
 where we are just eating, we come 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.930
 once made to facts without nose 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.860
 or smell you can 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.810
 do not taste it 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.090
 this is especially handy if you want to 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.010
 what have to eat especially disgusting because 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.030
 you might have succeeded in the jungle camp 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.980
 with side or something 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.419
 and if you just have my nose 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.790
 to hold or not by the nose 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.840
 breathe but only through the mouth 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.480
 she tastes almost nothing 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.510
 and that is also the one or 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:04.450
 other nasty ones down so act 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.550
 Simply nose to keep so light eyes 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.400
 to and through but nose to and through 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.520
 so that was a few times now 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.850
 interesting facts tricks and so on 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.590
 completely around your body once 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.790
 very funny change how did you find 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.540
 it always writes down in the 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.160
 Comments 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.810
 if you liked the video, please 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.360
 Of course, as always, I'm talking about one 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.110
 Thumbs up and if you yours 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.880
 human 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.260
 Under control is easy 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.630
 times down on the button 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.640
 so you do not miss anything more 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.950
 I have videos up in the 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.330
 info at linked you know that so well 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.380
 I 'm looking forward to the next time
