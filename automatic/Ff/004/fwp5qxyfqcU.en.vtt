we'll<00:04:33.479> complete<00:04:33.809> the<00:04:33.839> profile<00:04:42.709> so<00:04:43.709> here's<00:04:43.949> a

we'll complete the profile so here's a

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:49.729 
we'll complete the profile so here's a
snipe<00:04:44.399> on<00:04:44.729> the<00:04:44.909> lower<00:04:46.099> rail<00:04:47.509> and<00:04:48.509> I've<00:04:49.319> set<00:04:49.619> up

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:49.739 
snipe on the lower rail and I've set up

00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:55.129 
snipe on the lower rail and I've set up
to<00:04:49.949> go<00:04:50.099> ahead<00:04:50.339> and<00:04:50.879> cut<00:04:51.360> that<00:04:51.389> one<00:04:51.779> out<00:04:54.139> there's

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
to go ahead and cut that one out there's

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.749 
to go ahead and cut that one out there's
a<00:04:55.229> minor<00:04:55.589> one<00:04:55.919> that<00:04:56.069> will<00:04:56.189> probably<00:04:56.309> try<00:04:56.729> to

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 
a minor one that will probably try to

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.850 
a minor one that will probably try to
putty<00:04:57.119> and<00:04:58.079> here's<00:04:58.289> the<00:04:58.439> one<00:04:58.589> that<00:04:58.739> I've<00:04:58.829> just

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
putty and here's the one that I've just

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.239 
putty and here's the one that I've just
patched<00:04:59.279> in<00:04:59.809> there's<00:05:00.809> a<00:05:00.899> sharp<00:05:01.199> contrast<00:05:01.439> and

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:02.249 
patched in there's a sharp contrast and

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:04.969 
patched in there's a sharp contrast and
unfinished<00:05:02.610> wood<00:05:03.029> color<00:05:03.649> but<00:05:04.649> through<00:05:04.889> the

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
unfinished wood color but through the

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:06.739 
unfinished wood color but through the
magic<00:05:05.399> of<00:05:05.519> what<00:05:05.729> a<00:05:05.759> good<00:05:05.999> painter<00:05:06.360> can<00:05:06.539> do

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:06.749 
magic of what a good painter can do

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:09.529 
magic of what a good painter can do
he'll<00:05:07.019> match<00:05:07.289> up<00:05:07.619> this<00:05:08.429> one<00:05:08.789> its<00:05:08.939> stained<00:05:09.209> and

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
he'll match up this one its stained and

he'll match up this one its stained and
this<00:05:10.289> one<00:05:10.499> it's<00:05:10.619> stained<00:05:10.919> and<00:05:11.249> if<00:05:11.399> you<00:05:11.519> look

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
this one it's stained and if you look

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.589 
this one it's stained and if you look
real<00:05:11.879> close<00:05:12.119> you'll<00:05:12.449> probably<00:05:12.629> see<00:05:13.169> the<00:05:13.949> patch

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:14.599 
real close you'll probably see the patch

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:18.159 
real close you'll probably see the patch
but<00:05:15.599> we're<00:05:15.749> forceful<00:05:16.199> thinking<00:05:16.619> about<00:05:16.889> how

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
but we're forceful thinking about how

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.569 
but we're forceful thinking about how
how<00:05:19.169> this<00:05:19.379> rail<00:05:19.679> will<00:05:19.949> live<00:05:20.129> for<00:05:20.339> the<00:05:20.429> next

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:20.579 
how this rail will live for the next

00:05:20.579 --> 00:05:24.319 
how this rail will live for the next
eighty-five<00:05:21.149> years<00:05:22.459> we<00:05:23.459> could<00:05:23.610> just<00:05:23.819> putty<00:05:24.149> in

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:24.329 
eighty-five years we could just putty in

00:05:24.329 --> 00:05:26.839 
eighty-five years we could just putty in
these<00:05:24.569> areas<00:05:24.989> down<00:05:25.199> here<00:05:25.739> like<00:05:26.429> was<00:05:26.639> done

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
these areas down here like was done

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:29.419 
these areas down here like was done
before<00:05:27.379> but<00:05:28.379> they<00:05:28.529> didn't<00:05:28.799> live<00:05:28.949> eighty-five

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:29.429 
before but they didn't live eighty-five

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:31.100 
before but they didn't live eighty-five
years<00:05:29.699> and<00:05:29.999> now<00:05:30.089> when<00:05:30.239> somebody<00:05:30.479> runs<00:05:30.839> their

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
years and now when somebody runs their

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.439 
years and now when somebody runs their
hand<00:05:31.349> down<00:05:31.649> this<00:05:31.860> rail<00:05:32.159> they<00:05:32.669> risked<00:05:33.059> picking

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
hand down this rail they risked picking

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.769 
hand down this rail they risked picking
up<00:05:33.569> a<00:05:33.659> sliver<00:05:34.789> so<00:05:35.789> we've<00:05:35.879> got<00:05:36.059> a<00:05:36.089> balance<00:05:36.539> what

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:36.779 
up a sliver so we've got a balance what

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:39.199 
up a sliver so we've got a balance what
we<00:05:36.899> do<00:05:37.079> historically<00:05:37.800> with<00:05:38.550> the<00:05:38.639> practical

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:39.209 
we do historically with the practical

00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:41.899 
we do historically with the practical
aspect<00:05:39.659> of<00:05:39.809> it<00:05:39.929> as<00:05:40.019> well<00:05:40.429> you<00:05:41.429> can<00:05:41.610> run<00:05:41.759> your

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
aspect of it as well you can run your

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.379 
aspect of it as well you can run your
hand<00:05:42.300> over<00:05:42.899> this<00:05:43.050> rail<00:05:43.439> and<00:05:44.149> with<00:05:45.149> your<00:05:45.329> eyes

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
hand over this rail and with your eyes

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:47.449 
hand over this rail and with your eyes
closed<00:05:45.779> you<00:05:45.809> can't<00:05:46.319> tell<00:05:46.559> where<00:05:46.739> it's<00:05:46.889> at<00:05:47.189> at

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:47.459 
closed you can't tell where it's at at
