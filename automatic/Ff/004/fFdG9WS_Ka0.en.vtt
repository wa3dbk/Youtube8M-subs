00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:08.150
 good because you asked for it did not ask 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.230
 Today I'm going to show you how to style your hair 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:14.339
 dita von teese 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:18.779
 you have to separate a part of the lock 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:22.050
 front in order to reach to win 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:27.320
 longer layers and that separate them 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.320
 they will go making anchovies 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.759
 well let's make rolls that go to 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.260
 turn on our house you have to deserve a 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.030
 little and all in little hair and 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.260
 they are like placing all life in the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.260
 jail 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
 so 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.650
 A) Yes 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.650
 roll down 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.970
 and then turn it on 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.700
 against the head of our animals 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.820
 we thought between the head 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.420
 and they love it 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.630
 and those are going to be with all the hair 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.630
 loose 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.630
 Y 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.630
 back 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:39.460
 and with good pins since they did 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.990
 that now with this part of the front 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.329
 let's do finger waves 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.070
 there are thousands of tutorials where they are made 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.930
 with the hair straightener to me not 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.970
 let's use the iron because my 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.740
 hair is badly treated with the 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.570
 hot 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.450
 but you can do us with the 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.030
 iron if they want this is how the way 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.460
 vintage of making them then you have to 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.740
 than to give them more or less a match 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.270
 on the way side I like to throw up 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.970
 back because then I do not know what to do with 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.229
 this part 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.790
 I do not like it though 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.790
 then the same 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:21.700
 you have to deserve a little hair 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:26.640
 I feel simpson homero when the 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.640
 accountant is little 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.770
 they catch 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.480
 and now what they are going to do 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.910
 is to give them the shape of the wave that 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.990
 they want and tie it with pins then 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:46.230
 First 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:48.890
 this part with up and back 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.890
 and there 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.560
 to all 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.220
 and later 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.180
 this death for the front 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:12.640
 if they see it like that a wave 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.640
 from this part forward 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.530
 and silver in that direction 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.280
 okay 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.280
 and then this part of the back 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.010
 come 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.540
 Well, if you do not see any way to get it right 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.840
 tutorials and you know I do not have 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.840
 camera 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.290
 good and so 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.069
 well, you can not see it, but everything was like this 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.999
 A) Yes 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.999
 like a 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.290
 if he gets up a lot 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.770
 crush 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:15.030
 ok and this 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.030
 the longest part 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.420
 let's be myself 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.420
 make 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.220
 well one s 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:37.230
 yes 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.230
 if so 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.650
 Oh 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.650
 and we're going to take it with racks 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.750
 and already this last male cited 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.750
 well 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.880
 in the turn 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.229
 so that it is already as 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.229
 part of the floor 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:10.670
 glamorous ok since that's how they leave it 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.430
 there you can have a rose for a while 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:16.520
 nor heels for hair something like the 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:19.820
 dryer until it dries out now 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:23.900
 he taught them how good while this thing 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.440
 it dries I'm going to vote and I'm going to go 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.440
 making up 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.850
 and I 'm going to show you how to make up the 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.520
 makeup I'm going to do is for a 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.650
 photo session that has nothing to do with 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.160
 go lengthened 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:41.210
 as a ballad stage pair 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.210
 for that 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.540
 it makes it clear the color more 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.110
 similar to his 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.090
 with the skin 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.230
 and now I apply with my fingers because 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.230
 give roe using a brush 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:04.750
 if they do not find a base of their color of 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:07.950
 skin mix two and no longer 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.950
 has science 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:14.060
 then with the corrector I left my 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.100
 makeup where we are doing the 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.980
 burlesque sun glasses then 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:22.600
 I'm going to use old things that a thousand years ago 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.600
 years not 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:33.060
 and blur in any spot or part 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:36.690
 red or whatever 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:41.740
 we put on the concealer after 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:44.240
 this the first thing that I do 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:48.610
 and put my eyebrows 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.610
 with a brush 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:59.150
 and put some dust in here if it falls 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.240
 but now you see me 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.330
 then you have to start drawing the 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.870
 eyebrows 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.870
 with 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:13.039
 movements so small simulating 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.039
 the ponies 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:20.339
 and you have to start 

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:20.339
 up and inside out 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:33.240
 I'm going to extend it a little beyond 

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.700
 my eyebrows natural 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.270
 so that they look 

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.270
 yes 

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:46.889
 and if it were to be for show I would do a little 

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.889
 plus 

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.660
 in the other side
