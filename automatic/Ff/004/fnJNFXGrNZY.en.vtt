00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.910
 hello I am and marianne ducret 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.860
 east atmosphere at butterfly papers and 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.630
 I will show you how to achieve 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.190
 a fake piece mounted for your table 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.200
 of easter to realize this false 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.940
 mounted piece you need the blocks of 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.520
 floral foam of different colors 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.060
 three different colors if possible 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.730
 ribbon of two different colors of the 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.820
 aluminum wire of a single 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.000
 color in door plastic parts 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:34.809
 or metal of small quail eggs and 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.110
 duff is emptied of two colors of pines 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:41.770
 scissors of scissors notched hours of 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.980
 floral glue of cutting pliers of a 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.490
 pretty big felt of a ruler and a 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.530
 big knife 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.079
 so first step we are going to stick 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.840
 floral mosses between them 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.800
 starting with the one from the bottom so with 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:04.000
 the floral foam is worth putting 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:08.259
 many necks you want to superimpose 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.889
 well, that's it without much support compare 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:21.240
 shapes and then we stick them 

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:21.240
 two foams duo for centers on 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.170
 and once the last 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.079
 so the first step you take everything 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.750
 first the brown ribbon that wants me 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.049
 will place between the two foams 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.509
 debates went around for good 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:50.490
 check you have the right dimension and 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:57.720
 you cut profitable then you put 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:02:06.179
 floral lace all around you 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:08.310
 then apply the ribbon this is the 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.560
 first ribbon and then place I 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.530
 take my second doing the same 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:18.420
 way we measure the dimension of which 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:21.239
 I will need and I run to his 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:28.980
 profitable hosts I then apply the 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:31.010
 sticks so I then apply the ribbon to 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.120
 the place where I positioned maccoll 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.440
 soon turn around my room you will do 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.329
 so next step let's do 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.239
 small flowers with 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:45.239
 cookie cutters in our white foam 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:49.010
 that I already cut in half with the 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.010
 knife we reduce the thickness 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:00.270
 I will take a first part and 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:10.140
 I'm going with my cookie cutter to make a 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:14.940
 first little cloud that I 'm going to cut 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:20.400
 in two finally a room much more 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:23.370
 fine and I will repeat this operation 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.460
 again twice so I'm going now 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:30.690
 place my little clouds with the 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.490
 jungles so I sting in the city center and 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:38.820
 my cloud and I'm going to poke on my 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:47.910
 ribbon alternately but these famous 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:52.440
 documents all the way around my 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:58.520
 piece up we're going now 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:02.300
 discover the basis of our cake 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:07.500
 so with the big felt you go 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.970
 wrapped wire on a pretty 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.410
 great length because you have to do 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.930
 all the way around the room 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.950
 I do well I felt all my draws 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.950
 to be able to measure 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.210
 it's like a kind of spring 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.410
 in fact we will come to place it here 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.200
 rounds on the mounted piece 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.060
 so I see I can do it again I 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.460
 can do again the length of a 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.140
 pen once your spring has well 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.480
 been measured that you saw who does the 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.330
 turn of your climb piece you go the 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.190
 tightened in order to insert at 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.190
 inside with soft wood brandy 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.420
 so once the twigs are 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.070
 inserted I will be able to open my 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.070
 spring 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:00.400
 so we will see by transparency of 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.400
 braziers 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:09.710
 I will be able to place it around the 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:12.680
 piece climb then we go 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.560
 now do the top part of 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.290
 the mounted piece thus carving a 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.640
 new foam in half to make 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:25.130
 small flowers with 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:32.960
 euro cookie cutters so I take the 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:37.870
 bigger cookie cutters and I'm going 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:41.120
 create a support for my obvious 9 is 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:44.240
 largest size in the center 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.480
 I will redo a hole for afld 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.480
 can 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:00.270
 and then you place it where 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:03.150
 anchor with glue so you can 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.980
 then position your fact empty and 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.900
 then we will finish the piece 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:12.930
 climb by making small wins 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:17.010
 piece shaped flower we will place in 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:24.900
 of the piece that this time I'm going 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:27.270
 cut in half that it is finer with 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.950
 the very small cookie cutter you make 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.430
 a center hole that will allow us 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:37.710
 then sticking it to place your 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:40.890
 quail eggs and emptied all around I 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.570
 placed my twelve little eggs on top of 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.370
 my piece mounted she is now 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.410
 finished you have all the tips 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:49.340
 to succeed a false mounted piece 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.340
 for your easter table 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.650
 it is
