00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
you also want to think about how that

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.770

means<00:00:39.280> you<00:00:39.489> need<00:00:39.640> to<00:00:39.699> strike<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.299> ball<00:00:40.479> up

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
means you need to strike the ball up

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.140 
means you need to strike the ball up
above<00:00:41.199> so<00:00:41.979> if<00:00:42.070> I'm<00:00:42.190> standing<00:00:42.460> here<00:00:42.940> and<00:00:43.000> it's

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
above so if I'm standing here and it's

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.119 
above so if I'm standing here and it's
the<00:00:43.299> first<00:00:43.540> point<00:00:43.870> of<00:00:43.960> a<00:00:44.080> game<00:00:44.260> and<00:00:44.589> singles

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
the middle follow it to the net so you

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.049 
the middle follow it to the net so you
have<00:00:53.170> to<00:00:53.320> make<00:00:53.500> a<00:00:53.530> plan<00:00:53.949> before<00:00:54.309> you<00:00:54.640> start<00:00:54.940> to

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
have to make a plan before you start to

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.910 
have to make a plan before you start to
serve<00:00:55.299> otherwise<00:00:55.780> you<00:00:55.989> don't<00:00:56.170> have<00:00:56.440> anything

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920

to think about when you're going up to

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.960 
to think about when you're going up to
hit<00:00:59.290> the<00:00:59.409> ball<00:00:59.589> if<00:01:00.129> I'm<00:01:00.339> hitting<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:00.790> ball

down<00:01:01.299> the<00:01:01.479> middle<00:01:01.720> on<00:01:01.930> my<00:01:02.140> serve<00:01:02.500> I'll<00:01:03.040> be

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
down the middle on my serve I'll be

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.979 
down the middle on my serve I'll be
turning<00:01:03.610> my<00:01:03.640> rapid<00:01:04.210> and<00:01:04.360> meeting<00:01:04.659> it<00:01:04.780> like

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
turning my rapid and meeting it like

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.929 
turning my rapid and meeting it like
this<00:01:05.320> if<00:01:05.860> I<00:01:06.070> were<00:01:06.189> going<00:01:06.400> to<00:01:06.490> hit<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:06.760> ball

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
this if I were going to hit the ball

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.270 
this if I were going to hit the ball
wide<00:01:07.299> to<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.900> left<00:01:08.140> side<00:01:08.440> of<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:08.770> court<00:01:09.070> I

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
wide to the left side of the court I

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.220 
wide to the left side of the court I
would<00:01:09.550> be<00:01:09.820> turning<00:01:10.090> my<00:01:10.240> racket<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:10.930> hit<00:01:10.960> the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
would be turning my racket to hit the

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.410 
would be turning my racket to hit the
right<00:01:11.410> side<00:01:11.680> of<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:11.980> ball<00:01:12.160> over<00:01:12.520> here<00:01:12.790> so

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
right side of the ball over here so

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.690 
right side of the ball over here so
really<00:01:13.780> when<00:01:13.960> you're<00:01:14.110> serving<00:01:14.590> your<00:01:15.100> target

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
really when you're serving your target

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.030 
really when you're serving your target
was<00:01:15.910> the<00:01:15.940> ball<00:01:16.360> it's<00:01:17.020> not<00:01:17.290> the<00:01:17.530> court<00:01:17.800> over

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
was the ball it's not the court over

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.800 
was the ball it's not the court over
there<00:01:18.280> but<00:01:18.550> you<00:01:18.580> still<00:01:18.730> want<00:01:19.180> to<00:01:19.240> visualize

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
there but you still want to visualize

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.600 
there but you still want to visualize
the<00:01:20.050> flight<00:01:20.350> of<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.530> ball<00:01:20.770> you<00:01:20.830> want<00:01:21.220> to<00:01:21.340> send

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
the flight of the ball you want to send

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.970 
the flight of the ball you want to send
it<00:01:21.790> across<00:01:22.120> the<00:01:22.360> net<00:01:22.570> so<00:01:23.290> I'm<00:01:23.500> gonna<00:01:23.620> serve

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
it across the net so I'm gonna serve

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.630 
it across the net so I'm gonna serve
this<00:01:24.160> ball<00:01:24.400> down<00:01:24.730> the<00:01:24.970> middle<00:01:25.260> hopefully<00:01:26.260> and

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
this ball down the middle hopefully and

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.980 
this ball down the middle hopefully and
I<00:01:27.640> would<00:01:27.790> have<00:01:27.910> planned<00:01:28.240> to<00:01:28.420> do<00:01:28.570> that<00:01:28.780> by

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
I would have planned to do that by

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:36.149 
I would have planned to do that by
reaching<00:01:29.290> up<00:01:29.590> and<00:01:29.830> turning<00:01:30.190> my<00:01:30.340> racket

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.950 

now<00:01:37.159> if<00:01:37.400> I<00:01:37.520> want<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:37.820> serve<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.210> ball<00:01:38.360> off<00:01:38.690> to

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
now if I want to serve the ball off to

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.680 
now if I want to serve the ball off to
the<00:01:39.140> wide<00:01:39.950> side<00:01:40.340> of<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.580> court<00:01:40.850> I'm<00:01:41.300> gonna<00:01:41.540> be

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
the wide side of the court I'm gonna be

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.600 
the wide side of the court I'm gonna be
thinking<00:01:42.170> about<00:01:42.200> hitting<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.860> right<00:01:43.100> side<00:01:43.430> of

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
thinking about hitting the right side of

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.030 
thinking about hitting the right side of
the<00:01:43.700> ball<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.270> if<00:01:44.360> I<00:01:44.540> go<00:01:44.750> up<00:01:44.960> I'm<00:01:45.740> thinking

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
the ball so if I go up I'm thinking

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.800 
the ball so if I go up I'm thinking
about<00:01:46.340> reaching<00:01:46.790> up<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:47.270> hitting<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.570> right

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
about reaching up and hitting the right
