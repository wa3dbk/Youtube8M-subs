stopped we would bring everybody down to
the<00:00:32.189> floor<00:00:32.460> see<00:00:32.669> what<00:00:32.820> they<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:33.059> do<00:00:33.149> to

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
the floor see what they can do to

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.910 
the floor see what they can do to
resolve<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.809> get<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.170> airplane<00:00:34.440> back<00:00:34.710> up

resolve it to get the airplane back up

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.430 
resolve it to get the airplane back up
and<00:00:35.100> moving<00:00:35.340> again<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.809> final<00:00:37.050> leg

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
and moving again this is the final leg

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.680 
and moving again this is the final leg
of<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.710> long<00:00:37.950> journey<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.700> program<00:00:39.149> to

of a long journey for this program to

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.479 
of a long journey for this program to
see<00:00:39.870> why<00:00:40.050> we'd<00:00:40.379> have<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.649> travel<00:00:40.890> back<00:00:41.160> several

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
see why we'd have to travel back several

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.119 
see why we'd have to travel back several
years<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.989> how<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.200> factory<00:00:43.649> used<00:00:43.950> to

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
years this is how the factory used to

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.619 
years this is how the factory used to
look<00:00:44.309> like<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> parking<00:00:45.300> lot

factory<00:00:50.370> every<00:00:50.550> other<00:00:51.300> plane<00:00:51.629> then<00:00:51.930> moves<00:00:52.260> up

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
factory every other plane then moves up

a<00:00:52.559> spot<00:00:52.590> we<00:00:53.280> tend<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.640> have<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> lot<00:00:54.360> of

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
a spot we tend to have a lot of

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.110 
a spot we tend to have a lot of
equipment<00:00:54.750> in<00:00:55.140> parts<00:00:55.620> showing<00:00:56.399> up<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.760> support

that position and then if you don't use
them<00:00:59.399> you've<00:00:59.609> got<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.910> move<00:01:00.000> them<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> next

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719
