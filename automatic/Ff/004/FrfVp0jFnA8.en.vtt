00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:03.839
 disabling unused services 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:09.769
 one of the easiest ways 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:11.279
 increase in speed 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:13.240
 your computer 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.669
 dovish explay 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.029
 is disconnecting from unused 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:18.539
 services 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.220
 Often it helps to boost overall 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.380
 work speed 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.780
 operating system and not least 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.090
 reduce time 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.300
 which is required to run 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.200
 to disconnect from unused services 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.230
 press the key combination 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.580
 wines boards latin apr 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.960
 and then in the resulting window execute 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.630
 enter a yamal fig 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.740
 and press a key a year 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.360
 in the window that appears, select the tab 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.550
 by service 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.230
 the first thing following checking service 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.770
 that run on system startup but 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.470
 does not apply to Microsoft services 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.850
 To do this, check the box or show 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.220
 Microsoft services 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.360
 only services left in the list 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.350
 third party developers 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.080
 as well as services that do not affect 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.080
 work operating systems in general 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.700
 you can disable some of them or 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.850
 all but should do it carefully 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.289
 and if you don't understand the destination 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:28.890
 one or another service 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.890
 it is better to leave everything in its place 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.950
 after disabling third-party services 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.820
 developers can go to disable 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.830
 unnecessary services 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.820
 microsoft company 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.140
 for this, remove the checkbox 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.830
 Microsoft services 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:46.940
 and go to edit 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.170
 list 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.030
 the list is enough volume of minutes and we are not 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.850
 we will talk and every service 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.900
 separately 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.560
 but we note that there are services without which 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.640
 full use 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.520
 operating system is impossible and there is 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.790
 secondary or unnecessary services 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.029
 for example 

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:12.859
 disabling the windows service and you turn off the case 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:15.739
 system sounds and you can return it 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.169
 will be only after reboot 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:21.389
 disabling the indexing service you 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:22.839
 lose opportunity 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:25.689
 perform a faster search among 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.929
 files and folders 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:30.699
 disabling unnecessary and unused 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:31.479
 services 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:33.049
 click the button 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:33.889
 from her 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.339
 and in the window that appears, select 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:38.489
 reboot 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.399
 be careful 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:42.609
 if after reboot not 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.279
 Some component works 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:46.739
 operating systems you can always 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.129
 select item 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.249
 normal launch 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:52.559
 this will be done 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:55.039
 download all drivers wb devices 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:56.709
 and running all services
