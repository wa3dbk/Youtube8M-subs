00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 that you are going to meet now 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.380
 be part of those who did not hesitate 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.130
 to give up everything to live fully 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.720
 their passion 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.490
 daniel orange that's his name so 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.080
 decided a nice day to leave the city 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.040
 and his job as an architect to go 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.019
 to live in the countryside 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.030
 since they make guitars there 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.779
 do not live very well but at least that 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.520
 like him look at old ideas 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.500
 concerning the rural exodus will take 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.570
 a finished shot the born people who over the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.580
 campaigns he's finally going back not all 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.990
 but this is the case of daniel yesterday he 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.820
 was living at 200 an hour today he 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.619
 has switched to another risk that of 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.630
 daniel guitars and luthier in the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.770
 desert or almost a factory of 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.340
 guitars for classical musicians 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.340
 known 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.790
 we teach is a bit anecdotal but 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.990
 finally let's say that it's effective and a 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.450
 way to make me see I'm in 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.460
 full crossroads in this old farmhouse 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.120
 and so I'm luthier had to silence the 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.120
 concert here 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:05.380
 I'm 17 years old interior architect 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.170
 at 40 and at 40 I'm having a crisis 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.480
 it seems, but who make the crises to 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.700
 40 years old and the guitar was my passion 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.490
 since the age of 15 crisis that eats 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:20.470
 bring his image or change of medicine 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.360
 complicated crisis let's say it's my 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.160
 passion it's my it's my girlfriend the 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.550
 guitar since the age of 15 I play 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.790
 it's my universe and then I have a 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.860
 golden woman who helped me and who has 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.190
 today boils the pot 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.960
 since I earn very little money and 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.270
 who has me a little to eject out of 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.610
 system I was dynamic at 40 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.610
 and I went from dynamic frames to 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.170
 crazy luthier in a lost corner is a 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.170
 adventure a little crazy 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.820
 what's the corner if we came 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.790
 exactly here we are unofficial it's a 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.649
 small village that is located online 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.900
 right enters exactly in the middle in 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.540
 sawing aix the baths on the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.260
 commune of saint sisvel annecy is here 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.710
 aix the baths and there it is a small 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.710
 quiet hamlet 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.330
 modest studio sober atmosphere almost 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.390
 monastic for a work of a final 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.470
 surgical and voluntary exile in 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.630
 a world of calm 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.510
 daniel has forgotten the words 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.680
 as productivity productivity stress it 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.580
 is having a honeymoon with her guitars 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.290
 they consume 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.650
 finally a passion that consumes him is 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.650
 for a long time 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.349
 here is a soundboard this is the 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.150
 essential piece on a guitar is 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.549
 the engine of the guitar but the problem 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.000
 is that the ropes shot 40 kg on a 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.890
 soundboard and then we stuck 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.450
 behind this soundboard a 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.180
 framework that is called in a violin 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.540
 dam and we also realized that 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.670
 the provisions of this dam modifies 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.310
 the sound for simplicity we can say 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.900
 that we have to reduce the treble side is 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:17.989
 let float the bass side and here 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.060
 you have the chopper to what comes 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.160
 strengthen the soundboard at the level 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.730
 rosette since the rosa was 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.799
 recessed in the soundboard good the 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.510
 rosette has no impact on the sound 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.129
 but let's say it's the signature of the 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.620
 luthier and then we have fun with 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.750
 it recognizes the lanes and 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.040
 great luthiers their rosas the majority 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.750
 rosettes are geometric patterns 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.310
 while I made small 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.030
 dancers dancing around the world 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.030
 it's in my head 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:49.040
 I do not play classical guitar but 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.940
 I chose that for not having 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.090
 how how what might 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.730
 say obsession because I play the 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.770
 folk and jazz guitar and guitar 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.570
 classic is the version of the guitar 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.340
 the most sensitive to stop in this 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.860
 guitar where we can most express ourselves in 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.990
 him neither and then I have no preconceived idea 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.459
 it's a virgin ground for me it's 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.459
 here it's more exciting 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:29.849
 this is a small flat unique meal 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:32.279
 of course google have opted by me 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.990
 because in fact I'm also my mom 

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:36.150
 do mum I do lÃ¼thi and I do 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.479
 many things since my wife 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.860
 work and boil the pot 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.060
 it's me who takes care of it 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.289
 evening she sets foot under the table 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.029
 it really is 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.029
 I assure including really 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.560
 so here I am at a very operation 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.110
 important that is going to be the closure of 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.590
 the guitar and then I take a lot of 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.940
 time she closed because I know the 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.260
 last time I'm going to have them 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.450
 are as beautiful lace 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.160
 the outside mediterr so I'm not 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.830
 very profitable on this operation I 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.330
 take a few days at the 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.920
 look before you say because we do not 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.170
 will never see again after one time she 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:25.400
 is closed it's over it's not a 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:26.660
 demountable instrument a guitar I 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.340
 put about three months to make a 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:33.050
 instrument and I would like it to be the 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.530
 country that is the most beautiful the flaws 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.360
 of the world 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.330
 so she swears it's still a 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.130
 passion so I prefer to make a living 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.140
 making guitar settings we feel 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.960
 repairs and guitars from 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:49.130
 concert it's really something about 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.020
 which I do not try to 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.180
 make profitable anything I do not 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.419
 do not try to mechanize anything 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.270
 I am really looking to be the most 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.830
 happy by doing them what 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.229
 like game produced very little and I am 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.450
 very slow, a lot of things are happening 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:08.450
 between the year are to start 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.250
 and his birth so gives them a name 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.140
 this one is called the orange merchant 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:16.060
 in Spanish I do not know the 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:18.650
 pronunciation this will not arrange ra ra and 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.860
 they have a last story that 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.120
 I did it like there lagoy doral the 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.460
 carrying water because she had a 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.500
 its a bit fruity an auch road sound 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.690
 Finally, it's a bit crazy but it all 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.880
 it's nice and when you make a guitar 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.710
 job street lesson to the most fruity yes 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.120
 so I'm kidding here yes we can 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.230
 to say that it has a slightly more fruity sound 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.230
 badly and to believe that they were 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.680
 so often Thursday before I won my 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.190
 life without the live now xavi without 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.470
 win it 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.840
 it's really yeah it's a little tasteful 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:54.880
 provocative but 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.880
 but that's exactly what 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.280
 we 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.960
 I think he has a little air of 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.180
 patrick bouchitey you do not find 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.860

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.470
 confuse the two all kinds of 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.880
 guitars hold for example the guitar 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.430
 electric hard rockers hold look
