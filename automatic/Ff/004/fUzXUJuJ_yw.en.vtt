one of I think it was the hottest day of
the<00:05:33.010> summer<00:05:33.130> I<00:05:33.960> spent<00:05:34.960> a<00:05:35.289> good<00:05:36.099> portion<00:05:36.310> of<00:05:36.580> the

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
the summer I spent a good portion of the

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.390 
the summer I spent a good portion of the
evening<00:05:36.970> outside<00:05:37.659> the<00:05:38.169> humidity<00:05:38.680> as<00:05:39.039> you<00:05:39.250> can

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
evening outside the humidity as you can

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.960 
evening outside the humidity as you can
tell<00:05:39.610> kind<00:05:39.880> of<00:05:39.940> got<00:05:40.090> to<00:05:40.270> my<00:05:40.419> hair<00:05:40.659> a<00:05:40.690> little<00:05:40.900> bit

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
but I think that overall my makeup looks

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.300 
but I think that overall my makeup looks
it<00:05:49.900> still<00:05:50.320> looks<00:05:50.530> flawless<00:05:50.800> like<00:05:51.130> the

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
it still looks flawless like the

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.860 
it still looks flawless like the
foundation<00:05:51.729> is<00:05:52.060> what<00:05:52.180> I'm<00:05:52.270> something<00:05:52.510> I'm<00:05:52.630> not

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
foundation is what I'm something I'm not

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.620

like<00:05:53.080> the<00:05:53.229> lipstick<00:05:53.650> or<00:05:53.770> anything

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
like the lipstick or anything

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.410 
like the lipstick or anything
but<00:05:55.290> they<00:05:56.190> just<00:05:56.430> I<00:05:56.580> just<00:05:56.640> have<00:05:57.030> like<00:05:57.150> a<00:05:57.270> little

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:57.420 
but they just I just have like a little

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.120 
but they just I just have like a little
bit<00:05:57.600> of<00:05:57.720> oil<00:05:57.840> coming<00:05:58.290> through<00:05:58.530> but<00:05:58.740> it's<00:05:58.890> like

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
bit of oil coming through but it's like

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.210 
bit of oil coming through but it's like
gives<00:05:59.880> me<00:06:00.000> more<00:06:00.510> like<00:06:00.660> a<00:06:00.780> doing<00:06:01.200> duty<00:06:01.920> finish

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
gives me more like a doing duty finish

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.040 
gives me more like a doing duty finish
and<00:06:02.550> it<00:06:02.640> doesn't<00:06:03.000> make<00:06:03.120> me<00:06:03.330> look<00:06:03.510> like<00:06:03.570> I'm

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
and it doesn't make me look like I'm

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.460 
and it doesn't make me look like I'm
really<00:06:04.320> really<00:06:04.560> oily<00:06:04.920> and<00:06:05.340> I<00:06:05.430> need<00:06:05.640> supply

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
any other primer this would be probably

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.890 
any other primer this would be probably
like<00:06:12.930> two<00:06:13.380> hours<00:06:13.830> into<00:06:14.160> the<00:06:14.730> evening<00:06:14.810> so<00:06:15.810> the
