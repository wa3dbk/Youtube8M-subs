little arrow video this you see is

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.729 
little arrow video this you see is
put<00:01:00.239> into<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.600> three<00:01:00.809> o'clock<00:01:01.079> position<00:01:01.140> and

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
put into the three o'clock position and

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.240 
put into the three o'clock position and
this<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.879> left<00:01:03.120> hand<00:01:03.239> side<00:01:06.950> and<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.130> ever

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
this is the left hand side and you ever

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.530 
this is the left hand side and you ever
think<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.729> have<00:01:08.909> done<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.420> replaced<00:01:11.270> then<00:01:12.270> take

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
think I have done is replaced then take

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.080 
think I have done is replaced then take
off<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.200> old<00:01:13.920> engine<00:01:14.130> because<00:01:14.820> all<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
off the old engine because all the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.460 
off the old engine because all the
injection<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.040> other<00:01:17.040> one<00:01:17.310> was<00:01:17.610> missing

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
injection on the other one was missing

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.749 
injection on the other one was missing
so<00:01:19.470> all<00:01:19.590> I've<00:01:19.680> done<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.860> basically<00:01:20.100> unplugged

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
so all I've done is basically unplugged

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.899 
so all I've done is basically unplugged
the<00:01:21.450> plugs<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.960> unbolt<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.400> put<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.729> one

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
the plugs and unbolt it and put that one

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.330 
the plugs and unbolt it and put that one
on<00:01:27.080> it's<00:01:28.080> fair<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.680> I'll<00:01:28.770> start<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.280> and

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
on it's fair that so I'll start it and

00:01:29.340 --> 00:02:42.890 
on it's fair that so I'll start it and
you<00:01:29.400> can<00:01:29.579> listen<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.299> works<00:01:30.540> here's<00:01:30.810> why

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900

so here's you can hear it doesn't sound
like<00:02:46.120> running<00:02:46.540> on<00:02:46.629> all<00:02:46.840> four<00:02:47.500> cylinders<00:02:47.980> of

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
like running on all four cylinders of

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.839 
like running on all four cylinders of
changed<00:02:50.769> all<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:50.950> leads<00:02:51.159> changed<00:02:51.670> all<00:02:51.760> the

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
changed all the leads changed all the

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.920 
changed all the leads changed all the
plugs<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:53.610> done<00:02:54.610> all<00:02:54.849> the<00:02:55.060> electronic

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
plugs and done all the electronic

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.900 
plugs and done all the electronic
connectors<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:57.069> done<00:02:57.340> them<00:02:57.430> all<00:02:57.519> up<00:02:57.640> again

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
connectors and done them all up again

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.809 
connectors and done them all up again
and<00:02:58.299> she's<00:02:58.780> still<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.110> same<00:02:59.319> so<00:02:59.819> me

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
something's odd the so what are you

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.299 
something's odd the so what are you
reckon
