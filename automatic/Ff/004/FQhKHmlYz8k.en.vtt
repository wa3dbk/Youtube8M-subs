00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
who know a bit about the specs know that

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.229 
who know a bit about the specs know that

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:22.239 
they are vastly different cameras if you

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:24.390 
they are vastly different cameras if you

with<00:00:50.949> the<00:00:51.010> tank<00:00:51.309> it's<00:00:51.489> going<00:00:51.640> to<00:00:51.699> be<00:00:51.789> fine<00:00:52.030> but

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
with the tank it's going to be fine but

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.310 
with the tank it's going to be fine but
they<00:00:53.140> both<00:00:53.499> share<00:00:53.949> the<00:00:54.370> same<00:00:55.079> autofocus<00:00:56.079> motor

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320

and<00:00:56.589> metering<00:00:56.949> which<00:00:57.429> big<00:00:58.269> things<00:00:58.570> for<00:00:58.780> me

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
and metering which big things for me

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.169 
and metering which big things for me
because<00:00:59.499> the<00:00:59.710> d4<00:01:00.100> is<00:01:00.190> so<00:01:00.579> good<00:01:00.850> on<00:01:00.969> both<00:01:01.120> of

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179 
because the d4 is so good on both of

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.689 
because the d4 is so good on both of
those<00:01:01.449> things<00:01:01.749> so<00:01:02.379> knowing<00:01:02.800> that<00:01:02.949> the<00:01:03.010> d800

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
those things so knowing that the d800

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.060 
those things so knowing that the d800
shares<00:01:03.999> those<00:01:04.239> chips<00:01:04.659> is<00:01:05.019> a<00:01:05.260> really<00:01:05.590> big<00:01:05.740> plus

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
shares those chips is a really big plus

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.700 
shares those chips is a really big plus

optimal conditions and the interface is
just<00:01:18.490> gorgeous<00:01:18.760> to<00:01:19.090> use<00:01:19.270> I<00:01:19.300> love<00:01:19.690> it<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
just gorgeous to use I love it and the

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.030 
just gorgeous to use I love it and the
d800<00:01:21.640> is<00:01:21.850> number<00:01:22.300> one<00:01:22.540> so<00:01:23.140> how<00:01:23.500> can<00:01:23.560> you<00:01:23.830> go

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
d800 is number one so how can you go

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.890 
d800 is number one so how can you go
wrong<00:01:24.070> number<00:01:24.700> one<00:01:24.730> and<00:01:25.060> two<00:01:25.120> you<00:01:25.600> want<00:01:25.750> to<00:01:25.810> ask

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
wrong number one and two you want to ask

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.050 
wrong number one and two you want to ask
why<00:01:26.260> would<00:01:26.530> you<00:01:26.620> get<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.890> second<00:01:27.250> one<00:01:27.310> that's

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
why would you get the second one that's

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.000 
why would you get the second one that's
a<00:01:28.150> good<00:01:28.270> enough<00:01:28.450> reason<00:01:28.600> I<00:01:28.960> reckon<00:01:29.320> now<00:01:29.770> that

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
a good enough reason I reckon now that

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.460 
a good enough reason I reckon now that
said<00:01:30.280> I<00:01:30.520> was<00:01:31.060> actually<00:01:31.270> you<00:01:31.810> know<00:01:31.900> asked<00:01:32.290> it<00:01:32.380> I

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
said I was actually you know asked it I

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.410 
said I was actually you know asked it I
want<00:01:32.650> to<00:01:32.740> get<00:01:32.890> the<00:01:33.010> d800<00:01:33.670> when<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:33.910> d4<00:01:34.270> is

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
want to get the d800 when the d4 is

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.140 
want to get the d800 when the d4 is
coming<00:01:34.720> out<00:01:34.870> then<00:01:35.560> and<00:01:35.890> I<00:01:36.010> decided<00:01:36.400> not<00:01:36.610> to<00:01:36.910> and

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
coming out then and I decided not to and

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.540 
coming out then and I decided not to and
you<00:01:37.960> can<00:01:38.110> see<00:01:38.290> the<00:01:38.440> video<00:01:38.530> i<00:01:38.710> recently<00:01:39.130> put<00:01:39.430> up

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
you can see the video i recently put up

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.540 
you can see the video i recently put up
about<00:01:39.870> why<00:01:40.870> i<00:01:40.900> got<00:01:41.230> this<00:01:41.380> one<00:01:41.620> for<00:01:41.680> that<00:01:42.400> little

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
about why i got this one for that little

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.270 
about why i got this one for that little
backflip<00:01:43.090> but<00:01:43.720> that<00:01:43.930> said<00:01:44.260> having<00:01:44.500> seen<00:01:45.010> how

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
backflip but that said having seen how

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.890 
backflip but that said having seen how
well<00:01:45.490> this<00:01:45.640> one<00:01:45.850> performs<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:46.540> being<00:01:46.660> blown

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
well this one performs and being blown

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.240 
well this one performs and being blown
away<00:01:47.230> by<00:01:47.710> how<00:01:47.920> good<00:01:47.950> its<00:01:48.310> iso<00:01:48.730> performance<00:01:49.330> is

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
away by how good its iso performance is

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.010 
away by how good its iso performance is
if<00:01:51.250> this<00:01:51.610> performs<00:01:52.210> as<00:01:52.360> well<00:01:52.510> as<00:01:52.600> I<00:01:52.690> think<00:01:52.900> of

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
if this performs as well as I think of

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.350 
if this performs as well as I think of

concerts and that sort of thing where

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.420 
concerts and that sort of thing where
I'll<00:02:31.240> be<00:02:31.270> really<00:02:31.630> missing<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.620> grip<00:02:32.860> so

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
I'll be really missing the the grip so

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.280 
I'll be really missing the the grip so
we'll<00:02:34.120> just<00:02:34.270> see<00:02:34.390> how<00:02:34.540> it<00:02:34.570> plays<00:02:34.660> out<00:02:35.080> but

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
we'll just see how it plays out but

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.840 
we'll just see how it plays out but
that's<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.770> reason<00:02:36.070> I<00:02:36.160> got<00:02:36.340> it<00:02:36.490> I<00:02:36.610> think

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
that's the reason I got it I think

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.850 
that's the reason I got it I think
they're<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.150> killer<00:02:37.450> combo<00:02:37.960> and<00:02:38.200> I<00:02:38.620> really

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
they're a killer combo and I really

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.200 
they're a killer combo and I really
don't<00:02:39.040> think<00:02:39.100> you<00:02:39.280> can<00:02:39.430> go<00:02:39.490> wrong<00:02:39.670> with<00:02:39.850> it<00:02:40.000> if

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
don't think you can go wrong with it if

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.610 
don't think you can go wrong with it if
you've<00:02:40.330> got<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.660> budget<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.170> if<00:02:41.320> you've<00:02:41.440> got

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
you've got the budget and if you've got

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.990 
you've got the budget and if you've got
