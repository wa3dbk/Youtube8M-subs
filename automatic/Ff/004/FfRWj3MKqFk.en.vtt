cut you'll end up with the ferrule and

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.990 
cut you'll end up with the ferrule and
eraser<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.070> other<00:00:38.280> end<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.790> pencil

now it's time to clean out the inside of
the<00:00:41.250> ferrule<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.910> easiest<00:00:42.239> way<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.510> do

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
the ferrule so the easiest way to do

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.650 
the ferrule so the easiest way to do
that<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.440> use<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.640> 3/16<00:00:44.640> inch<00:00:44.850> drill<00:00:45.270> bit<00:00:45.480> I

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
that is to use a 3/16 inch drill bit I

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.229 
that is to use a 3/16 inch drill bit I
place<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.230> furl<00:00:46.440> eraser<00:00:47.070> side<00:00:47.309> down<00:00:47.640> into<00:00:47.940> my

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.720 
place the furl eraser side down into my
vise<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.840> tightened<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.590> up<00:00:49.710> then<00:00:50.039> slowly<00:00:50.460> and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
vise and tightened it up then slowly and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.700 
vise and tightened it up then slowly and
carefully<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.270> drilled<00:00:51.809> out<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.020> center<00:00:52.530> of

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
carefully I drilled out the center of

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.200 
carefully I drilled out the center of
the<00:00:52.890> ferrule<00:00:53.370> now<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.640> don't<00:00:53.789> want<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.030> go<00:00:54.149> too

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
the ferrule now you don't want to go too

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.240 
the ferrule now you don't want to go too
deep<00:00:54.390> because<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.110> don't<00:00:55.260> want<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.530> eat<00:00:55.710> into

the<00:00:56.430> rubber<00:00:56.699> eraser<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.539> other<00:00:57.690> side<00:00:58.020> once

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
the rubber eraser on the other side once

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.139 
the rubber eraser on the other side once
you<00:00:58.680> think<00:00:58.800> you've<00:00:59.010> drilled<00:00:59.340> far<00:00:59.670> enough<00:00:59.910> it's

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
you think you've drilled far enough it's

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.910 
you think you've drilled far enough it's
time<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.510> use<00:01:00.629> your<00:01:00.660> sharp<00:01:01.109> cutting<00:01:01.379> tool<00:01:01.680> and

inside<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> ferrule<00:01:04.920> now<00:01:05.070> when<00:01:05.250> you're<00:01:05.400> done

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
inside the ferrule now when you're done

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.640 
inside the ferrule now when you're done
you'll<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.360> hollow<00:01:06.780> ferrule<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.409> you

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
you'll have a hollow ferrule and you

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.109 
you'll have a hollow ferrule and you
could<00:01:07.770> see<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.040> eraser<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.729> other<00:01:08.880> end

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
of our pencil and I'll be using a 5/32

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.620 
of our pencil and I'll be using a 5/32
inch<00:01:13.860> drill<00:01:14.369> bit<00:01:14.430> for<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:15.060> now<00:01:15.360> here<00:01:15.600> I

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
inch drill bit for this one now here I

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.330 
inch drill bit for this one now here I
used<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.990> small<00:01:16.259> piece<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.530> paper<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.189> protect

in<00:01:20.040> place<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.549> my<00:01:20.670> vise<00:01:20.880> now<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.720> part<00:01:21.930> is

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
in place in my vise now this part is

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.020 
in place in my vise now this part is
crucial<00:01:22.229> using<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.950> square<00:01:23.310> tool<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.790> want<00:01:23.909> to

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
straight in the vise and then tighten it

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.230 
straight in the vise and then tighten it
up<00:01:28.229> I'll<00:01:28.470> be<00:01:28.770> using<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.100> drill<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.670> my<00:01:29.820> portable

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
some cotton swabs I peeled some cotton

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.010 
some cotton swabs I peeled some cotton
away<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.250> make<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.640> fit<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.060> then<00:01:54.630> clean<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
inside of the pencil out you may have to

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.670 
inside of the pencil out you may have to
do<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.060> few<00:01:57.180> times<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.960> get<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.170> completely

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
do this a few times to get it completely

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.530 
do this a few times to get it completely
clean<00:01:58.920> for<00:01:59.369> this<00:01:59.490> last<00:01:59.759> step<00:02:00.000> I'm<00:02:00.180> gonna<00:02:00.360> be

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
clean for this last step I'm gonna be

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.270 
clean for this last step I'm gonna be
using<00:02:00.659> some<00:02:01.020> fishing<00:02:01.500> line<00:02:01.530> but<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.130> could

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
using some fishing line but you could

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.100 
using some fishing line but you could
probably<00:02:02.369> use<00:02:02.850> dental<00:02:03.210> floss<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.840> fishing

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
probably use dental floss the fishing

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.450 
probably use dental floss the fishing
lines<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.409> little<00:02:04.530> bit<00:02:04.649> better<00:02:04.950> because<00:02:05.310> it's

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
lines a little bit better because it's

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.789 
lines a little bit better because it's
stiffer<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:06.030> cut<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> piece<00:02:06.390> twice<00:02:06.990> as<00:02:07.290> long<00:02:07.500> as

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
stiffer I cut a piece twice as long as

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.770 
stiffer I cut a piece twice as long as
the<00:02:08.039> depth<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.670> hole<00:02:08.879> in<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.239> pencil<00:02:09.629> and

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
the depth of the hole in the pencil and

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.809 
the depth of the hole in the pencil and
then<00:02:09.959> folded<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.709> half<00:02:10.739> now<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:11.610> time<00:02:11.790> for

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
then folded it in half now it's time for

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.250 
then folded it in half now it's time for
the<00:02:12.000> magic<00:02:12.209> ingredient

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the magic ingredient

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.470

drop<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.920> hot<00:02:14.190> glue<00:02:14.430> then<00:02:14.879> take<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.269> fishing

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
drop of hot glue then take the fishing

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.539 
drop of hot glue then take the fishing
line<00:02:15.599> with<00:02:16.019> the<00:02:16.140> open<00:02:16.590> ends<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.159> place<00:02:17.370> it

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
line with the open ends and place it

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.460 
line with the open ends and place it
down<00:02:17.790> in<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.180> hot<00:02:18.360> glue<00:02:18.659> and<00:02:18.900> hold<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.319> until

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.470 
down in the hot glue and hold it until
it<00:02:19.739> hardens<00:02:19.920> now<00:02:20.459> it's<00:02:20.670> time<00:02:20.879> for<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.120> small
