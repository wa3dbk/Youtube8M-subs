 hello you tube friends today I bring you a new video where I will show you 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:10.509
 what kind of games plays the famous pmp psp mp5 that is misnamed mp5 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:13.139
 good comment 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.910
 the games that plays tones spin games is gbc smt dyn r kate the 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.289
 chiqui some table games or geo in flash format 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.089
 the format in that means nintendo entertainment system but to do it 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.140
 shorter are the console games family 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.079
 the gipsy ips format means to imbue if they ever had any 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.079
 had a lot of luck and long hours of entertainment 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.560
 the gbc format means bimbo and color this means that some of the 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.100
 games were black and white and very few were in color so I've 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.760
 seen so far 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.190
 the smd format means sega megadrive this means it was a console 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.820
 sega genesis as we know her that almost half of her games were good and 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.220
 as far as I know I found out they had many hours 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.110
 the vinyl format I know very well what it means but almost all its games 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.250
 they are pretty good 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.280
 the format and recate is one of those that a few days ago I had learned that 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.120
 they enter the pmp psp mp5 and I do not know yet how are the games because I have 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.040
 found very few 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.270
 the flash format can only be found on many websites as 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.470
 in free games dotcom games 10 com and many more pages 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.130
 and finally there are some console games I look at that are passed to 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.790
 flash format and they are almost the same nothing more that they lowered a little 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.190
 graphics but they are good the same as the metal is lucquin osfae kers and so on 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.560
 good friends that's all I know so far what I'm trying is 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.450
 how can I put nintendo 64 and nintendo ds games that I almost have but I 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.200
 lack of doing something 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.909
 and finally I'm trying to download the graphics to the games 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.250
 playstation 1 and transform them to be able to put them on this console once 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.250
 The first thing I will do is share it with you 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.930
 good many thanks for watching the video and I hope you enjoyed it
