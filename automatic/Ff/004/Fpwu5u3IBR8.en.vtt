00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.380
 via reed via this record i well that's me 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.380
 via this cat task to that is my opponent 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.459
 in the first game of this episode we have left because me 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:15.519
 will be opened 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:16.450
 unfortunately 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.450
 at least to the extent of vi from looking like vj to viva beautiful this series 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.230
 in which I 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.669
 often contradictory 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.230
 But despite that ordinary vision and trying to come there is time again 

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:30.899
 for your daily portion of viva and not because see this club 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.170
 but luckily I do not know why it is on my side 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.060
 I also like to meet my opponent I don't like to complain 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.729
 I think they made an EP 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:47.249
 but luckily in the very last minute already the last minute of the match 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:51.009
 comes the emanuelson through the corpses through a defender next to the 

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.190
 goalkeeper in the goal within set 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.859
 where they equal and almere but actually also finish for the 3 one 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:00.569
 for this victory and of course for the next three points that are back in the 

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:01.339
 be in place 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.339
 in the following manner you must have been around ten years and in this 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.340
 match I immediately get a penalty against 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.250
 and I must honestly say if you look at it and then it becomes nothing but the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.250
 ball hit maja 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.850
 with this march paul taylor the one behind, I just enter this competition 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.700
 In emergency situations we always have one 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.790
 who solves all problems and of course he makes the duck 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.890
 the world 7 oh what would it be without him 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.000
 but then they end up in the one one and I wasn't that whole there 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.259
 happy with it actually it just drew a damn box 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.909
 and unfortunately also the starting position to take the title even more difficult 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.600
 the vi six is ​​increasingly difficult 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.460
 I am not brilliant, but I have listened to your suggestions 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.159
 this episode because you came up with good suggestions from mattie why please 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.409
 you don't just have a second team 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.210
 so you can switch through and then I thought 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.580
 tulip or box were in a festive mood 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.900
 faes recognizable box 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.900
 tip of apple vs palm why didn't I think about that before and that's why I went 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.760
 I do that I just grab a new team 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.020
 3 5 2 can be a lot cheaper but put the boules riyani plurk in it 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.020
 then you miss another player on one 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:15.989
 judy salt the scope i only have 400 collyns maybe i need another one 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.129
 Suggestions for you to look at which player to really see in this one 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.219
 series 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:22.789
 No 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:25.929
 and a not even so many points 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:27.709
 well luckily just couldn't 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.959
 very little mornie and can I still pay him to put a team and such 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.250
 I suddenly have two teams so I'm going to play with my second standard 10 against the 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:40.139
 next team and this match starts not bad because you see it 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.319
 a great attack and the end of the short ball also finished 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.319
 and most goals from 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:49.150
 never heard of it 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.560
 unfortunately, the opponent nevertheless takes a comic view of the weakness of the 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.519
 defender of mine 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:54.319
 mar 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.339
 believe it or don't believe it at the end of the game 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.829
 I just score one here 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.039
 horn and I really win the competition 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:06.029
 the impossible happens miracles are just not out of the world and therefore 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:09.359
 I am this way that actually still at the last minute with two and and we go 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.499
 of course straight to the next game against a team with yes no me 

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:16.139
 dont go skip making this shit but unfortunately that is real in this match 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:17.230
 weakness of the team 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.019
 painfully clear and especially at the moment especially the keeper 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.269
 he tells the keeper as if he had taken our partner in the dressing room 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.429
 is becoming 

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:30.009
 it was these that do not make me happy report ede one and then I make 

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:31.879
 fortunately for us also the two one 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.549
 but at this moment another corner of the opponent grab a keeper who does not 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:41.269
 it just got to know after they had been as the chrome was later one 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.730
 accept orientation but it is precisely in this acceptance of his orientation that the 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:45.510
 zone 2 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.949
 so I leave this point in the package only one point 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:51.099
 and there are still four games with 8 points to get what incidents do 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.409
 to grab this title but I decide but the other team white suits also 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.459
 have a little more certainty of the winnings because the ass against this team is like 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.719
 you see that I made a 0 to ten as you see now in the end 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:05.509
 I this match with a part like your music etc only three points like you now 

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:09.559
 and the circle is round number two again zoer they always say like me 

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:13.229
 just keep playing with this team against this team we get it 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:17.720
 just speed and reunions curling line in the flew 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.029
 no the hague 8 

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.029
 to make the one up 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:25.629
 terry 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:29.180
 I share to be back French president prior to this game against it 

00:04:29.179 --> 00:04:30.370
 is more than seven hungry 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.570
 every kohl you make treats a whole population with chicken 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.449
 the eye in that row added value again afraid of seeing this but once it happen 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.340
 his first fantastic goal is only one here is the second in the 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.509
 even though this is fantastic but those times 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.080
 Machelen also knew what he sees 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.750
 Go here and grab the ball on all right 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.350
 and there she goes defenders looking for new elections but I become 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.750
 the framework of pas tom bean is just way too strong forwards 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.300
 this diet 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.020
 gt r and then you only get stronger from zijlstra has indicated this series 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.560
 but at least escort 3 but the week 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.220
 three busy of the copa reading is a 20 euro each so japan goes sir 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.530
 years or so but I am happy because I want this competition 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.750
 of course again because my opponent directly and two more at this time 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.940
 competitions to win one and if I do not win then I will take the title 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.060
 in divisions 6 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.980
 and let's be right but played that match and come this way 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:21.930
 against a team with a 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.830
 in unwise 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.089
 avéro content 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:30.089
 the table is just newspaper 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:35.840
 This match is only really describe if one goes it said this goal 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.680
 that is normal from ameerah bit 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.630
 utrecht a normal city event the drunken play the men on this 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.550
 for that stop fish shop 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.809
 because after 4 

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:49.510
 we are then be because look here the nrf a cunning he has the kickoff of his 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.890
 as a free kick the isaf yes how you give yourself in what kind of an idiot 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.290
 who would look realistic in a year, this is happening 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.610
 every game has its own performance that is pretty much the only one 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.069
 but then it comes here 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:05.149
 yes 4 yes this is necessary to add the device it is just yes 

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:06.550
 yes what to 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.370
 de jong wants the other company 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.180
 but then moes said it needed autistic do with seconds because where does this go 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.630
 look over and then you hope it doesn't go there 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:19.690
 but he will 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.909
 that is typically a free kick from emanuelson really 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:24.719
 this new project brilliant 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:26.590
 this first did in the ad 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.520
 bake against the keeper the metal 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.520
 the real reason leaves job seekers 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.330
 he thought so too 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.930
 we believe that don't believe through another corner but it doesn't blow it over 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.389
 they achieved avro and became a goal that this way that idea comes 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:43.110
 ma 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.690
 I'm going this we are in the 4 3 year diploma as soon as it only two hours 

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:50.689
 prayed for your cards for three of my defenders 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:51.560
 that ex prof 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.940
 catch and yes then we grab the title a divisions 6 through which this is blowing 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.380
 10 9 8 7 6 have only had to pass a 5 4 3 2 result of it 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.590
 theoretically already halfway and about this episode not yet done and then 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.120
 after these profits we could get the lesson cockerel I thought that was true 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.340
 place in the washed companies at this episode above seven minutes 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.810
 a record I think kind of yes I also want something we would 25 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.040
 education at tiv completes 8 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.930
 it says if we are as on this tradeoff over 2008 so can catch up 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.560
 at least I have two pieces of fruit a day because that is healthy
