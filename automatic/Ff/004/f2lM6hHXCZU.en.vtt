you how to solve a megaminx um this
megaminx<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.460> chinese<00:00:09.300> megamix<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.730> it's

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
megaminx the chinese megamix and it's

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.120 
megaminx the chinese megamix and it's
not<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.120> greatest<00:00:12.269> not<00:00:12.690> as<00:00:12.809> good<00:00:12.960> as<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.410> must

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
start it up alright so this will be a

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.260 
start it up alright so this will be a
part<00:00:29.369> 1<00:00:29.519> i'll<00:00:30.449> make<00:00:30.720> probably<00:00:31.940> three<00:00:32.940> parts

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
part 1 i'll make probably three parts

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.470 
part 1 i'll make probably three parts
all<00:00:33.450> right<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.750> let's<00:00:33.930> get<00:00:34.140> started<00:00:34.320> first

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
all right so let's get started first

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.490 
all right so let's get started first
step<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:37.309> make<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.520> cross<00:00:39.170> just<00:00:40.170> like<00:00:40.260> on

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
step is to make it cross just like on

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.500 
step is to make it cross just like on
the<00:00:40.620> three<00:00:40.800> by<00:00:41.010> three<00:00:41.219> but<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.149> three<00:00:42.329> by

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the three by three but the three by

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.979 
the three by three but the three by
three<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.260> cross<00:00:43.530> just<00:00:44.250> consists<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.989> four

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
three of the cross just consists of four

three of the cross just consists of four
of<00:00:46.289> these<00:00:46.860> pieces<00:00:47.480> but<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.899> megamix<00:00:49.469> it's

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
of these pieces but on the megamix it's

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.580 
of these pieces but on the megamix it's
all<00:00:50.219> five<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.870> same<00:00:51.899> thing<00:00:52.140> i'm<00:00:52.440> just

good<00:01:48.320> I<00:01:48.580> did<00:01:49.580> that<00:01:49.790> side<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:50.860> so<00:01:51.860> um<00:01:52.659> next<00:01:53.659> part

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
good I did that side and so um next part

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.700 
good I did that side and so um next part
of<00:01:54.409> this<00:01:55.130> is<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:55.550> tus<00:01:56.330> to<00:01:56.930> get<00:01:57.110> filling<00:01:57.590> these

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
of this is a tus to get filling these

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.030 
of this is a tus to get filling these
pieces<00:01:58.010> all<00:01:58.430> these<00:01:58.970> pieces<00:01:59.440> so<00:02:00.440> really<00:02:00.950> you're

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
pieces all these pieces so really you're

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.460 
pieces all these pieces so really you're
just<00:02:01.100> going<00:02:01.400> to<00:02:01.550> start<00:02:01.940> with<00:02:02.150> any<00:02:02.750> side<00:02:03.110> and

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
just going to start with any side and

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.460 
just going to start with any side and
right<00:02:04.460> now<00:02:04.670> I<00:02:04.729> see<00:02:05.090> that<00:02:05.119> these<00:02:05.509> are<00:02:05.750> opposite

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
right now I see that these are opposite

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.730 
right now I see that these are opposite
sides<00:02:06.800> like<00:02:07.780> you<00:02:08.780> can't<00:02:09.020> really<00:02:09.350> have<00:02:09.530> that

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
sides like you can't really have that

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.490 
sides like you can't really have that
because<00:02:10.190> uh<00:02:10.690> those<00:02:11.690> have<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:11.930> be<00:02:12.020> switched<00:02:12.320> so

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
because uh those have to be switched so

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.120 
because uh those have to be switched so
what<00:02:12.650> I<00:02:12.680> do<00:02:12.770> is<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:13.190> just<00:02:13.430> randomly<00:02:14.980> chosen<00:02:15.980> on

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
what I do is I just randomly chosen on

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.530 
what I do is I just randomly chosen on
the<00:02:16.220> face<00:02:16.489> I<00:02:16.819> let's<00:02:17.300> start<00:02:17.660> so<00:02:19.300> this<00:02:20.300> is<00:02:20.330> just

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
the face I let's start so this is just

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.080 
the face I let's start so this is just
like<00:02:20.690> on<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:20.989> three<00:02:21.170> by<00:02:21.380> three<00:02:21.650> filling<00:02:22.250> these

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
like on the three by three filling these

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.080 
like on the three by three filling these
pieces<00:02:23.480> on<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:26.290> one<00:02:27.290> side<00:02:27.320> so<00:02:27.820> what<00:02:28.820> you<00:02:28.940> want

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
pieces on the one side so what you want

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.810 
pieces on the one side so what you want
to<00:02:29.180> do<00:02:29.269> is<00:02:29.420> you<00:02:29.450> want<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:30.430> put<00:02:31.430> your<00:02:31.550> piece

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
to do is you want to put your piece

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.270 
to do is you want to put your piece
right<00:02:32.330> next<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:32.959> it<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:33.860> left<00:02:34.070> or<00:02:34.250> the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
right next to it to the left or the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.530 
right next to it to the left or the
right<00:02:34.370> like<00:02:34.700> sometimes<00:02:34.940> this<00:02:35.239> will<00:02:35.390> be

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
right like sometimes this will be

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.080 
right like sometimes this will be
flipped<00:02:35.959> over<00:02:36.200> so<00:02:36.590> that<00:02:36.709> it's<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.400> green

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
flipped over so that it's the green

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.910 
flipped over so that it's the green
purple<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.690> then<00:02:38.840> put<00:02:39.170> over<00:02:39.260> here<00:02:39.440> doesn't

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
purple and then put over here doesn't

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.680 
purple and then put over here doesn't
make<00:02:40.160> difference<00:02:40.459> what<00:02:41.180> you<00:02:41.300> do<00:02:41.420> is<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:41.570> want

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
make difference what you do is you want

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.590 
make difference what you do is you want
to<00:02:41.780> hold<00:02:41.989> it<00:02:42.170> like<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:43.130> you<00:02:44.000> want<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.300> bring

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
to hold it like that you want to bring

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.479 
to hold it like that you want to bring
the<00:02:44.959> bottom<00:02:45.350> away<00:02:46.450> down<00:02:47.709> towards<00:02:48.709> it<00:02:48.890> back

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
the bottom away down towards it back

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.090 
the bottom away down towards it back
over<00:02:49.820> bring<00:02:50.570> this<00:02:50.720> up<00:02:50.989> and<00:02:51.350> then<00:02:52.090> up<00:02:53.090> this<00:02:53.750> away
