00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
reason so we still use the old style of

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
top you know what does that do to the

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.090 
top you know what does that do to the
bread<00:00:55.460> as<00:00:55.580> a<00:00:55.610> whole<00:00:56.260> all<00:00:57.260> it<00:00:57.440> does<00:00:57.619> is<00:00:57.680> you<00:00:57.979> know

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
bread as a whole all it does is you know

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.799 
bread as a whole all it does is you know
your<00:00:58.250> french<00:00:58.519> braid<00:00:58.610> you<00:00:58.940> take<00:00:59.119> a<00:00:59.150> razor<00:00:59.449> new

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
your french braid you take a razor new

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.960 
your french braid you take a razor new
put<00:01:00.019> cuts<00:01:00.260> across<00:01:00.589> it<00:01:00.979> well<00:01:01.309> we<00:01:01.430> don't<00:01:01.610> do<00:01:01.790> that

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
put cuts across it well we don't do that

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.750 
put cuts across it well we don't do that
we<00:01:02.210> actually<00:01:02.780> put<00:01:02.989> a<00:01:03.019> leaf<00:01:03.320> and<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:03.650> water<00:01:04.489> on

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
we actually put a leaf and the water on

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.760 
we actually put a leaf and the water on
the<00:01:04.850> leaf<00:01:05.059> allows<00:01:05.479> it<00:01:05.720> to<00:01:05.750> split<00:01:06.260> instead<00:01:06.650> of

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
the leaf allows it to split instead of

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.620 
the leaf allows it to split instead of
with<00:01:06.890> a<00:01:06.920> razor<00:01:07.220> we<00:01:07.520> use<00:01:07.700> a<00:01:07.729> weak<00:01:08.060> spot<00:01:08.210> with<00:01:08.600> the

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
with a razor we use a weak spot with the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.710 
with a razor we use a weak spot with the
water<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:09.320> that<00:01:10.189> allows<00:01:10.760> it<00:01:11.000> open<00:01:11.360> up<00:01:11.479> a<00:01:11.600> lot

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
water and that allows it open up a lot

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.590 
water and that allows it open up a lot
more<00:01:11.869> uniform<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:13.670> other<00:01:13.820> thing<00:01:14.090> is<00:01:14.299> that<00:01:14.330> in

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
more uniform the other thing is that in

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.260 
more uniform the other thing is that in
Miami<00:01:14.900> they're<00:01:15.170> all<00:01:15.350> mostly<00:01:15.970> automated<00:01:16.970> and

other when it hits that heart that's
what<00:01:26.600> it<00:01:26.719> gets<00:01:26.840> across<00:01:27.229> that<00:01:27.649> opens<00:01:28.009> up<00:01:28.189> and

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
what it gets across that opens up and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.580 
what it gets across that opens up and
becomes<00:01:28.729> a<00:01:28.850> beautiful<00:01:29.270> loaf<00:01:29.420> of<00:01:29.539> bread<00:01:29.810> well

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
escape I don't know what it does instead

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.109 
escape I don't know what it does instead
of<00:01:57.499> being<00:01:57.679> real<00:01:57.920> tight<00:01:58.249> and<00:01:58.460> heavy<00:01:58.700> it<00:01:58.880> allows

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
of being real tight and heavy it allows

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.840 
of being real tight and heavy it allows
to<00:01:59.329> the<00:01:59.450> blossom<00:01:59.990> out<00:02:00.139> split<00:02:00.740> up<00:02:00.979> and<00:02:01.189> let's

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
to the blossom out split up and let's

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.539 
to the blossom out split up and let's
see<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.539> gas<00:02:02.749> inside<00:02:03.259> open<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.859> bread<00:02:04.100> up<00:02:04.310> so

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
see the gas inside open the bread up so

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.879 
see the gas inside open the bread up so
it<00:02:04.639> becomes<00:02:04.880> a<00:02:05.060> lot<00:02:05.240> area<00:02:05.479> inside<00:02:06.200> make

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:06.889 
it becomes a lot area inside make

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:08.700 
it becomes a lot area inside make

the<00:02:45.050> pan<00:02:45.320> does<00:02:45.860> that<00:02:45.980> trap<00:02:46.340> moisture

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
the pan does that trap moisture

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.460 
the pan does that trap moisture
underneath<00:02:47.180> it<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.690> is<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:48.020> why<00:02:48.170> it<00:02:48.230> makes

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
underneath it and is that why it makes

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.830 
underneath it and is that why it makes
it<00:02:48.620> so<00:02:48.800> much<00:02:48.920> more<00:02:48.980> well<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.150> pan<00:02:50.390> actually

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
it so much more well the pan actually

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.630 
it so much more well the pan actually
draws<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.380> heat<00:02:51.590> away<00:02:51.710> from<00:02:52.130> it<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:52.370> by<00:02:52.520> the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
draws the heat away from it and by the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.760 
draws the heat away from it and by the
time<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:53.060> gets<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.480> bread<00:02:53.720> it's<00:02:54.170> lost<00:02:54.470> that

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
time it gets to the bread it's lost that

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.920 
time it gets to the bread it's lost that
intensive<00:02:55.640> heat<00:02:55.850> that<00:02:56.030> makes<00:02:56.240> it<00:02:56.390> gives<00:02:56.780> it

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
intensive heat that makes it gives it

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.500 
intensive heat that makes it gives it
the<00:02:57.050> bounce<00:02:57.290> so<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:58.310> becomes<00:02:58.580> a<00:02:58.790> pan<00:02:59.030> bread<00:02:59.240> or

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
the bounce so it becomes a pan bread or

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.199 
the bounce so it becomes a pan bread or
a<00:02:59.600> soft<00:02:59.900> like<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.320> hamburger<00:03:00.920> bun<00:03:01.430> or<00:03:01.700> a<00:03:01.820> hoagie

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
a soft like a hamburger bun or a hoagie

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.380 
a soft like a hamburger bun or a hoagie
or<00:03:02.720> hot<00:03:03.020> dogs<00:03:03.050> by<00:03:03.500> now<00:03:03.740> okay<00:03:04.370> well<00:03:04.970> most<00:03:05.120> of<00:03:05.270> the

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
or hot dogs by now okay well most of the

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.660 
or hot dogs by now okay well most of the
in<00:03:05.780> Miami<00:03:06.470> there<00:03:06.770> they're<00:03:07.100> interested<00:03:07.580> in

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
in Miami there they're interested in

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.220 
in Miami there they're interested in
high<00:03:07.910> volume<00:03:08.420> and<00:03:08.600> they're<00:03:08.750> interested<00:03:09.200> in

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
high volume and they're interested in

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.050 
high volume and they're interested in
the<00:03:09.320> profit<00:03:09.800> part<00:03:10.040> which<00:03:10.220> i<00:03:10.370> can<00:03:10.520> understand

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
the profit part which i can understand

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.420 
the profit part which i can understand
so<00:03:11.690> most<00:03:11.959> of<00:03:12.110> their<00:03:12.260> bread<00:03:12.500> is<00:03:12.530> machine<00:03:13.190> made

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
so most of their bread is machine made

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.550 
so most of their bread is machine made
and<00:03:13.730> it's<00:03:14.330> put<00:03:14.540> on<00:03:14.570> pants<00:03:15.050> because<00:03:15.260> they<00:03:15.410> can

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
and it's put on pants because they can

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.620 
and it's put on pants because they can
automate<00:03:15.950> a<00:03:16.010> pen<00:03:16.340> here<00:03:17.209> we<00:03:17.390> take<00:03:17.420> each

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
automate a pen here we take each

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.050 
automate a pen here we take each
individual<00:03:18.410> loaf<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:18.890> they<00:03:19.370> put<00:03:19.640> it<00:03:19.730> in<00:03:19.820> one

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
individual loaf and they put it in one

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.030 
individual loaf and they put it in one
at<00:03:20.209> a<00:03:20.270> time<00:03:20.510> into<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.990> hearth<00:03:21.230> it<00:03:21.470> just<00:03:21.890> like

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
at a time into the hearth it just like

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.330 
at a time into the hearth it just like
baking<00:03:22.459> on<00:03:22.550> a<00:03:22.970> pizza<00:03:23.360> someone<00:03:23.930> a<00:03:23.959> hot<00:03:24.410> hearth

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
baking on a pizza someone a hot hearth

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.580 
baking on a pizza someone a hot hearth
well<00:03:26.240> they<00:03:26.390> don't<00:03:26.600> they<00:03:26.930> they<00:03:27.230> do<00:03:27.290> high

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
well they don't they they do high

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.160 
well they don't they they do high
production<00:03:28.010> with<00:03:28.310> pans<00:03:28.610> and<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.750> Machine

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
production with pans and the Machine

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.900 
production with pans and the Machine
make<00:03:30.380> it<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:30.740> they<00:03:31.040> don't<00:03:31.160> put<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.490> leaf<00:03:31.700> on

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
make it and they don't put the leaf on

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.820 
make it and they don't put the leaf on
it<00:03:31.940> so<00:03:32.660> a<00:03:32.690> lot<00:03:32.870> of<00:03:32.900> their<00:03:33.110> bread<00:03:33.290> is<00:03:33.320> not<00:03:33.590> even

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
it so a lot of their bread is not even

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.410 
it so a lot of their bread is not even
split<00:03:34.100> on<00:03:34.280> top<00:03:34.550> but<00:03:34.730> just<00:03:34.910> like<00:03:35.000> a<00:03:35.060> giant

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
split on top but just like a giant

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.370 
split on top but just like a giant
hoagie<00:03:35.930> so<00:03:36.560> it<00:03:36.709> comes<00:03:36.860> a<00:03:37.010> lot<00:03:37.160> softer<00:03:37.610> and

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
hoagie so it comes a lot softer and

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.840 
hoagie so it comes a lot softer and
doesn't<00:03:39.380> have<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:39.620> texture<00:03:40.070> it's<00:03:40.340> completely

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
doesn't have the texture it's completely

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.330 
doesn't have the texture it's completely
different<00:03:41.050> that's<00:03:42.050> why<00:03:42.320> we<00:03:42.530> shipped<00:03:42.860> to<00:03:43.040> Miami

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
different that's why we shipped to Miami

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.130 
different that's why we shipped to Miami
lot<00:03:43.580> of<00:03:43.640> people<00:03:43.880> come<00:03:44.030> down<00:03:44.060> from<00:03:44.450> my<00:03:44.600> up<00:03:44.810> from

think<00:03:52.459> is<00:03:52.580> gfs<00:03:53.150> or<00:03:53.360> whatever<00:03:53.630> in<00:03:53.930> Miami<00:03:54.380> that

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
think is gfs or whatever in Miami that

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.250 
think is gfs or whatever in Miami that
actually<00:03:55.100> picks<00:03:55.340> up<00:03:55.519> Brett<00:03:55.760> here<00:03:56.110> frozen<00:03:57.110> and

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
actually picks up Brett here frozen and

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.430 
actually picks up Brett here frozen and
redistributes<00:03:57.950> it<00:03:58.100> in<00:03:58.220> Miami<00:03:58.549> okay<00:03:59.299> now<00:04:00.200> it

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
redistributes it in Miami okay now it

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.670 
redistributes it in Miami okay now it

again<00:04:23.750> like<00:04:24.020> I<00:04:24.050> said<00:04:24.169> it<00:04:24.530> gives<00:04:25.370> us<00:04:25.550> a<00:04:25.580> niche<00:04:25.880> in

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
again like I said it gives us a niche in

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.730 
again like I said it gives us a niche in
the<00:04:26.120> market<00:04:26.210> that<00:04:26.660> they<00:04:26.960> can't<00:04:27.260> fill<00:04:27.560> because

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
the market that they can't fill because

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.420 
the market that they can't fill because
their<00:04:28.130> bread<00:04:28.370> does<00:04:28.580> not<00:04:28.790> compare<00:04:29.240> to<00:04:29.270> ours<00:04:29.540> I

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
their bread does not compare to ours I

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.710
