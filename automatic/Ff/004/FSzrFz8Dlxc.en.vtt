weapon all players have at this stage is

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.810 
weapon all players have at this stage is
the<00:00:13.019> threat<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.559> taking<00:00:14.099> another<00:00:14.340> player<00:00:14.639> out

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
the threat of taking another player out

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.840 
the threat of taking another player out
of<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.000> money<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.929> that<00:00:16.199> sense<00:00:16.590> stack<00:00:17.279> sizes

of the money in that sense stack sizes

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.550 
of the money in that sense stack sizes
are<00:00:18.029> even<00:00:18.420> more<00:00:18.630> important<00:00:19.109> now<00:00:19.170> than

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
are even more important now than

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.950 
are even more important now than
profiling<00:00:20.220> your<00:00:20.369> opponents<00:00:20.820> because<00:00:20.960> whether

you are a big or a short stack your

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.859 
you are a big or a short stack your
inherent<00:00:25.260> playing<00:00:25.680> style<00:00:26.160> must<00:00:26.849> change<00:00:27.539> now

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
inherent playing style must change now

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.919 
inherent playing style must change now
to<00:00:27.930> become<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.500> successful<00:00:28.980> sit<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.460> go<00:00:29.580> player

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
to become a successful sit and go player

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.720 
to become a successful sit and go player
short<00:00:30.929> stacks<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.529> big<00:00:32.009> stacks<00:00:32.340> will<00:00:32.610> be

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
short stacks and big stacks will be

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.760 
short stacks and big stacks will be
playing<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.300> wider<00:00:33.660> range<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.200> hands<00:00:34.620> and

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
playing a wider range of hands and

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.190 
playing a wider range of hands and
medium<00:00:35.640> stacks<00:00:35.969> will<00:00:36.239> generally<00:00:36.750> be<00:00:36.899> trying

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
medium stacks will generally be trying

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.040 
medium stacks will generally be trying
to<00:00:37.380> avoid<00:00:37.550> situations<00:00:38.690> so<00:00:39.690> it's<00:00:39.870> also

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
to avoid situations so it's also

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.350 
to avoid situations so it's also
important<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:41.070> know<00:00:41.489> which<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.820> these<00:00:42.090> players

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
important to know which of these players

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.830 
important to know which of these players
are<00:00:42.660> yet<00:00:42.960> tacked<00:00:43.230> behind<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.160> every<00:00:44.670> hand

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.240 

so<00:00:48.840> like<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.140> was<00:00:49.289> saying<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.680> last<00:00:49.770> video

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
so like I was saying in the last video

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.119 
so like I was saying in the last video
the<00:00:50.789> player<00:00:51.000> here<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.690> now<00:00:52.079> too<00:00:52.140> short<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.920> a

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
the player here is now too short of a

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.860 
the player here is now too short of a
stack<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.699> threaten<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.120> survival<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
stack to threaten the survival of the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.560 
stack to threaten the survival of the
remaining<00:00:55.199> players<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:56.489> whenever<00:00:57.059> he<00:00:57.270> gets<00:00:57.390> a

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
remaining players so whenever he gets a

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.540 
remaining players so whenever he gets a
decent<00:00:57.719> hand<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.199> shove<00:00:58.500> with<00:00:58.800> he's<00:00:59.100> likely

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
decent hand to shove with he's likely

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.180 
decent hand to shove with he's likely
going<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.940> get<00:01:00.090> called<00:01:00.329> now<00:01:01.230> even<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:01.920> he<00:01:02.039> is

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
going to get called now even if he is

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.310 
going to get called now even if he is
ahead<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.789> hand<00:01:03.059> anybody<00:01:03.809> else<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.140> going

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
ahead in the hand anybody else is going

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.929 
ahead in the hand anybody else is going
to<00:01:04.439> have<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.710> odds<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.129> call<00:01:05.369> him<00:01:05.580> like<00:01:05.729> in

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
to have the odds to call him like in

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.719 
to have the odds to call him like in
this<00:01:06.060> situation<00:01:06.619> where<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.650> am<00:01:08.070> holding<00:01:08.340> Queen

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
this situation where I am holding Queen

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.660 
this situation where I am holding Queen
9<00:01:08.939> offsuit<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.020> big<00:01:10.170> blind<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.740> everyone

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
9 offsuit in the big blind and everyone

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.450 
9 offsuit in the big blind and everyone
falls<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.390> small<00:01:12.720> stack<00:01:12.990> shove<00:01:13.350> but<00:01:14.250> look

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
falls to the small stack shove but look

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.359 
falls to the small stack shove but look
at<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.030> only<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.900> call<00:01:16.080> 500<00:01:16.860> into<00:01:17.340> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
at this I only have to call 500 into a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.840 
at this I only have to call 500 into a
1250<00:01:18.270> pot<00:01:18.479> which<00:01:18.689> means<00:01:18.960> I'm<00:01:19.350> getting<00:01:19.799> 2.5<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
1250 pot which means I'm getting 2.5 to

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.060 
1250 pot which means I'm getting 2.5 to
one<00:01:21.000> pot<00:01:21.270> odds<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.720> make<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.049> call<00:01:22.350> with

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
one pot odds to make this call with

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.130 
one pot odds to make this call with
those<00:01:23.340> odds<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.119> minimal<00:01:24.509> risk<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.020> will

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
those odds and the minimal risk it will

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.560 
those odds and the minimal risk it will
have<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.500> my<00:01:25.650> stack<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.280> should<00:01:26.909> make<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.299> call

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
have to my stack I should make this call

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.100 
have to my stack I should make this call
holding<00:01:28.020> virtually<00:01:28.710> any<00:01:29.009> two<00:01:29.430> cards<00:01:29.840> Queen<00:01:30.840> 9

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
holding virtually any two cards Queen 9

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.859 
holding virtually any two cards Queen 9
offsuit<00:01:31.439> definitely<00:01:32.220> qualifies<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.689> do

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
offsuit definitely qualifies so I do

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.230 
offsuit definitely qualifies so I do
make<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.439> call<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.070> look<00:01:35.640> at<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.970> I

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
make the call and look at that I

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.920 
make the call and look at that I
eliminate<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.680> small<00:01:37.920> stack<00:01:38.360> now<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.600> player

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
eliminate the small stack now a player

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.660 
eliminate the small stack now a player
like<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.590> probably<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.159> cursing

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
like that is probably just cursing

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.030 
like that is probably just cursing
himself<00:01:42.210> at<00:01:42.360> home<00:01:42.540> right<00:01:42.810> now<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.619> he<00:01:43.740> didn't

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
himself at home right now that he didn't

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.830 
himself at home right now that he didn't
do<00:01:44.159> better<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.700> who<00:01:44.939> knows<00:01:45.149> his<00:01:45.450> hand<00:01:45.689> was

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
do better and who knows his hand was

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.389 
do better and who knows his hand was
probably<00:01:46.259> better<00:01:46.500> than<00:01:46.680> mine<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.040> start<00:01:47.130> I

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
probably better than mine to start I

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.730 
probably better than mine to start I
didn't<00:01:47.640> even<00:01:47.729> bother<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.149> check<00:01:48.479> his<00:01:49.049> problem

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
didn't even bother to check his problem

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.700 
didn't even bother to check his problem
was<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.399> he<00:01:50.820> waited<00:01:51.210> too<00:01:51.540> long<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.560> game

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
was that he waited too long in the game

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.810 
was that he waited too long in the game
to<00:01:52.920> get<00:01:53.040> aggressive

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
to get aggressive

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.440 
to get aggressive
all<00:01:54.659> right<00:01:55.049> then<00:01:55.259> next<00:01:55.470> hand<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.670> now<00:01:57.090> we<00:01:57.149> are

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
all right then next hand so now we are

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.090 
all right then next hand so now we are
on<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.750> bubble<00:01:57.899> which<00:01:58.200> means<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.920> next

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
on the bubble which means that the next

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.370 
on the bubble which means that the next
player<00:01:59.369> eliminated<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.240> going<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:00.930> out<00:02:01.170> of

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
player eliminated is going to be out of

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.590 
player eliminated is going to be out of
the<00:02:01.469> money<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.920> everyone<00:02:02.640> else<00:02:02.880> will<00:02:03.329> make

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
the money and everyone else will make

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.190 
the money and everyone else will make
the<00:02:03.840> money<00:02:03.990> 6<00:02:04.979> 3<00:02:05.219> suited<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:06.030> could<00:02:06.450> raise<00:02:06.780> here

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
the money 6 3 suited I could raise here

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.960 
the money 6 3 suited I could raise here
but<00:02:07.439> since<00:02:07.680> everyone<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.369> saw<00:02:08.550> me<00:02:08.759> make<00:02:08.940> a

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
but since everyone just saw me make a

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.540 
but since everyone just saw me make a
couple<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.539> questionable<00:02:10.050> plays<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.709> decide<00:02:11.520> to

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
couple of questionable plays I decide to

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.580 
couple of questionable plays I decide to
fold<00:02:12.030> because<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.599> don't<00:02:12.930> really<00:02:13.230> want<00:02:13.440> to

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
fold because I don't really want to

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.190 
fold because I don't really want to
play<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.739> flop<00:02:14.040> with<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.430> hand<00:02:14.670> but<00:02:15.390> this<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:16.170> a

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
play a flop with this hand but this is a

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.130 
play a flop with this hand but this is a
potential<00:02:16.830> raising<00:02:17.160> situation<00:02:17.790> now<00:02:18.629> here

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
potential raising situation now here

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.080 
potential raising situation now here
with<00:02:19.319> ace<00:02:19.530> aide<00:02:19.800> in<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.190> small<00:02:20.430> blind<00:02:20.640> I

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
with ace aide in the small blind I

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.910 
with ace aide in the small blind I
decide<00:02:21.599> to<00:02:21.629> raise<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.200> big<00:02:22.349> blind<00:02:22.590> here

decide to raise the big blind here
assuming<00:02:23.190> that<00:02:23.849> I<00:02:23.879> have<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.330> best<00:02:24.510> starting

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
assuming that I have the best starting

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.369 
assuming that I have the best starting
hand<00:02:25.250> if<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.670> remember<00:02:27.090> earlier<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.780> have<00:02:28.200> been

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
hand if you remember earlier I have been

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.920 
hand if you remember earlier I have been
taking<00:02:28.739> a<00:02:28.830> few<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.099> his<00:02:29.340> big<00:02:29.550> blinds<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:30.150> this

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
taking a few of his big blinds and this

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.600 
taking a few of his big blinds and this
hand<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.349> strong<00:02:31.620> enough<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:32.040> continue<00:02:32.340> that

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
hand is strong enough to continue that

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.390 
hand is strong enough to continue that
strategy<00:02:32.970> however<00:02:33.599> he<00:02:34.530> actually<00:02:34.890> flat<00:02:35.099> calls

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
strategy however he actually flat calls

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.449 
strategy however he actually flat calls
my<00:02:35.580> preflop<00:02:36.090> in<00:02:36.390> this<00:02:36.510> situation<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:38.069> flop

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
my preflop in this situation the flop

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.390 
my preflop in this situation the flop
completely<00:02:39.360> misses<00:02:39.720> me<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:40.769> know<00:02:40.890> what<00:02:41.220> I

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
completely misses me so you know what I

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.880 
completely misses me so you know what I
decide<00:02:41.849> to<00:02:41.879> simply<00:02:42.299> check<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.599> flop<00:02:42.959> since<00:02:43.620> he

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
decide to simply check the flop since he

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.490 
decide to simply check the flop since he
did<00:02:44.190> flat<00:02:44.519> call<00:02:44.879> me<00:02:45.090> now<00:02:45.360> because<00:02:46.019> of<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.319> I

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
did flat call me now because of that I

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.890 
did flat call me now because of that I
figure<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:46.950> may<00:02:47.340> very<00:02:47.549> well<00:02:47.790> be<00:02:47.970> behind<00:02:48.329> and<00:02:48.690> I

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
figure I may very well be behind and I

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.750 
figure I may very well be behind and I
don't<00:02:48.959> want<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.290> play<00:02:49.440> for<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.709> big<00:02:49.920> pot<00:02:50.160> in<00:02:50.430> this

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
don't want to play for a big pot in this

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.630 
don't want to play for a big pot in this
hand<00:02:51.030> against<00:02:51.630> this<00:02:51.720> player<00:02:52.079> he<00:02:52.769> bets<00:02:53.010> out<00:02:53.250> but

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
hand against this player he bets out but

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.400 
hand against this player he bets out but
it's<00:02:53.880> only<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.180> quarter<00:02:54.630> of<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.750> pot<00:02:54.959> that's

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
it's only a quarter of the pot that's

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.069 
it's only a quarter of the pot that's
still<00:02:55.829> enough<00:02:56.160> for<00:02:56.430> me<00:02:56.630> even<00:02:57.630> though<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:57.900> looks

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
still enough for me even though it looks

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.140 
still enough for me even though it looks
like<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.260> weak<00:02:58.530> bat<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.190> there's<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.819> slight

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
like a weak bat and there's a slight

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.720 
like a weak bat and there's a slight
chance<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.780> may<00:03:01.140> still<00:03:01.560> be<00:03:01.590> ahead<00:03:01.950> in<00:03:02.069> this<00:03:02.190> hand

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
chance I may still be ahead in this hand

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.940 
chance I may still be ahead in this hand
unlike<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.390> scenario<00:03:03.870> earlier<00:03:04.560> in<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.799> game

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
unlike the scenario earlier in the game

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.710 
unlike the scenario earlier in the game
when<00:03:05.160> I<00:03:05.190> rearranged<00:03:05.760> all<00:03:05.910> in<00:03:06.120> with<00:03:06.329> a<00:03:06.360> paired

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
when I rearranged all in with a paired

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.110 
when I rearranged all in with a paired
three<00:03:07.140> on<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.410> board<00:03:07.620> I<00:03:07.890> am<00:03:08.129> NOT<00:03:08.519> short<00:03:08.790> stack

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
three on the board I am NOT short stack

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.600 
three on the board I am NOT short stack
anymore<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:10.110> also<00:03:10.349> recognize<00:03:11.040> that<00:03:11.069> some

anymore and I also recognize that some

anymore and I also recognize that some
of<00:03:11.730> my<00:03:11.760> opponents<00:03:12.120> might<00:03:12.629> be<00:03:12.810> making<00:03:12.989> some

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
of my opponents might be making some

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.069 
of my opponents might be making some
critical<00:03:13.560> errors<00:03:14.099> that<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.480> can<00:03:15.900> take

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
critical errors that I can take

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.860 
critical errors that I can take
advantage<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.769> later<00:03:17.099> on<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:18.150> I'm<00:03:18.450> just<00:03:18.690> going

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
advantage of later on so I'm just going

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
to fold this and cut my losses in this

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:21.890 
to fold this and cut my losses in this
hand<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.150> wait<00:03:21.389> for<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.660> better<00:03:21.810> opportunity

hand and wait for a better opportunity
in<00:03:22.889> this<00:03:23.160> hand<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.579> short<00:03:23.790> stack<00:03:24.000> shoves<00:03:24.359> all

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
in this hand the short stack shoves all

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.910 
in this hand the short stack shoves all
in<00:03:24.840> making<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.560> pot<00:03:25.940> 2815<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:27.450> have<00:03:27.920> 2065

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
in making the pot 2815 and I have 2065

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.030 
in making the pot 2815 and I have 2065
to<00:03:29.160> call<00:03:29.480> those<00:03:30.480> are<00:03:30.780> not<00:03:31.079> good<00:03:31.349> pot<00:03:31.620> odds<00:03:31.799> to

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
to call those are not good pot odds to

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.770 
to call those are not good pot odds to
call<00:03:32.250> with<00:03:32.519> this<00:03:32.639> weak<00:03:32.910> hand<00:03:33.209> so<00:03:33.450> I<00:03:33.480> will

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
call with this weak hand so I will

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.910 
call with this weak hand so I will
simply<00:03:34.019> give<00:03:34.200> that<00:03:34.530> up

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
simply give that up

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.949 
simply give that up
even<00:03:35.400> if<00:03:35.549> my<00:03:35.730> opponent<00:03:36.000> is<00:03:36.299> pushing<00:03:36.690> with<00:03:36.780> any

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
even if my opponent is pushing with any

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.900 
even if my opponent is pushing with any
two<00:03:37.170> cards<00:03:37.620> which<00:03:37.829> he<00:03:38.130> really<00:03:38.459> should<00:03:38.730> be

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
two cards which he really should be

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.569 
two cards which he really should be
those<00:03:39.750> any<00:03:39.989> two<00:03:40.200> cards<00:03:40.470> are<00:03:40.859> very<00:03:41.280> likely

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
those any two cards are very likely

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.930 
those any two cards are very likely
better<00:03:42.000> than<00:03:42.209> my<00:03:42.389> 9/4<00:03:43.169> with<00:03:43.919> hands<00:03:44.220> like<00:03:44.340> this

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
better than my 9/4 with hands like this

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.089 
better than my 9/4 with hands like this
I<00:03:44.970> want<00:03:45.599> to<00:03:45.690> be<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.900> one<00:03:46.019> betting<00:03:46.440> or<00:03:46.650> stealing

I want to be the one betting or stealing

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.819 
I want to be the one betting or stealing
but<00:03:47.760> certainly<00:03:48.269> not<00:03:48.630> calling<00:03:49.260> knowing<00:03:49.680> I'm

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
but certainly not calling knowing I'm

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.000 
but certainly not calling knowing I'm
behind<00:03:50.130> this<00:03:50.849> is<00:03:51.000> a<00:03:51.030> clear<00:03:51.450> fold<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:52.260> couple<00:03:52.889> of

behind this is a clear fold a couple of
hands<00:03:53.310> later<00:03:53.609> that<00:03:54.299> same<00:03:54.599> opponent<00:03:55.169> pushes

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
hands later that same opponent pushes

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.009

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
called from the big blind holding a

Stein<00:03:59.940> offsuit<00:04:00.450> both<00:04:00.900> players<00:04:01.290> make<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.620> good

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
Stein offsuit both players make a good

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.099 
Stein offsuit both players make a good
play<00:04:02.069> here<00:04:02.099> and<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.819> ace<00:04:02.940> 9<00:04:03.239> was<00:04:03.480> fortunate<00:04:03.989> to

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
play here and the ace 9 was fortunate to

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.650 
play here and the ace 9 was fortunate to
win<00:04:04.200> this<00:04:04.410> hand<00:04:04.680> yes<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.519> player<00:04:05.760> holding<00:04:06.239> 8<00:04:06.419> 9

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
win this hand yes the player holding 8 9

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.050 
win this hand yes the player holding 8 9
could<00:04:07.349> have<00:04:07.500> very<00:04:07.799> well<00:04:08.130> been<00:04:08.160> thinking<00:04:08.940> what

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
could have very well been thinking what

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.300 
could have very well been thinking what
I<00:04:09.120> was<00:04:09.419> thinking<00:04:09.810> that<00:04:09.840> this<00:04:10.260> opponent<00:04:10.620> could

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
I was thinking that this opponent could

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.129 
I was thinking that this opponent could
really<00:04:11.489> be<00:04:11.669> pushing<00:04:11.910> with<00:04:12.209> any<00:04:12.359> two<00:04:12.569> cards<00:04:12.870> and

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
really be pushing with any two cards and

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.319 
really be pushing with any two cards and
ace<00:04:13.440> 9<00:04:13.769> is<00:04:13.950> definitely<00:04:14.430> a<00:04:14.459> calling<00:04:15.000> hand<00:04:15.209> in

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
ace 9 is definitely a calling hand in

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.349 
ace 9 is definitely a calling hand in
that<00:04:15.480> situation<00:04:16.200> so<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.489> short<00:04:17.789> stack<00:04:18.060> and

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
that situation so the short stack and

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.060 
that situation so the short stack and
the<00:04:18.419> big<00:04:18.570> blind<00:04:18.840> actually<00:04:19.169> doubled<00:04:19.709> up<00:04:19.799> here

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
the big blind actually doubled up here

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.159 
the big blind actually doubled up here
and<00:04:20.280> that<00:04:20.849> means<00:04:21.060> we're<00:04:21.239> still<00:04:21.479> four<00:04:21.750> handed

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
and that means we're still four handed

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.740 
and that means we're still four handed
however<00:04:22.919> then<00:04:23.490> comes<00:04:23.909> this<00:04:24.090> hand<00:04:24.390> with<00:04:24.570> ace

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
however then comes this hand with ace

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.250 
however then comes this hand with ace

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
king on the button here I decide to make

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.710 
king on the button here I decide to make
preflop<00:04:27.650> raise<00:04:27.950> and<00:04:28.250> I<00:04:28.310> get<00:04:28.520> called<00:04:28.820> by<00:04:29.660> the

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
preflop raise and I get called by the

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.740 
preflop raise and I get called by the
small<00:04:30.050> blind<00:04:30.380> yet<00:04:30.740> again<00:04:31.040> this<00:04:31.850> time<00:04:32.210> I<00:04:32.450> was

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
small blind yet again this time I was

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.450 
small blind yet again this time I was
prepared<00:04:33.170> to<00:04:33.230> play<00:04:33.500> a<00:04:33.530> bigger<00:04:33.800> pot<00:04:34.070> with<00:04:34.280> him

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
prepared to play a bigger pot with him

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.860 
prepared to play a bigger pot with him
in<00:04:34.640> this<00:04:34.790> hand<00:04:35.030> because<00:04:35.180> I<00:04:35.360> really<00:04:35.690> had

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
in this hand because I really had

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.040 
in this hand because I really had
something<00:04:36.190> however<00:04:37.210> before<00:04:38.210> we<00:04:38.510> could<00:04:38.780> get<00:04:38.930> to

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
something however before we could get to

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.810 
something however before we could get to
that<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.350> big<00:04:39.530> blind<00:04:39.770> decided<00:04:40.370> to<00:04:40.490> re-raise

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
that the big blind decided to re-raise

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.690 
that the big blind decided to re-raise
all<00:04:41.120> in<00:04:41.480> now<00:04:41.990> since<00:04:42.530> the<00:04:42.680> small<00:04:42.830> blind<00:04:43.280> just

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
all in now since the small blind just

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.060 
all in now since the small blind just
flat<00:04:43.970> called<00:04:44.420> me<00:04:44.720> I<00:04:44.960> don't<00:04:45.410> believe<00:04:45.560> he<00:04:46.040> is

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
flat called me I don't believe he is

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.240 
flat called me I don't believe he is
going<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:46.640> call<00:04:46.940> this<00:04:47.210> rear<00:04:47.540> ace<00:04:47.720> so<00:04:48.080> now<00:04:48.350> I<00:04:48.710> am

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
going to call this rear ace so now I am

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.460 
going to call this rear ace so now I am
solely<00:04:49.700> concerned<00:04:50.300> about<00:04:50.630> the<00:04:50.750> big<00:04:50.930> blind<00:04:51.170> and

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
solely concerned about the big blind and

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.490 
solely concerned about the big blind and
his<00:04:51.890> shove<00:04:52.310> so<00:04:53.030> I<00:04:53.060> should<00:04:53.420> re-raise<00:04:53.840> all<00:04:54.140> in

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
his shove so I should re-raise all in

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.860 
his shove so I should re-raise all in
here<00:04:54.890> to<00:04:55.280> make<00:04:55.430> sure<00:04:55.460> this<00:04:55.850> opponent<00:04:56.240> gets<00:04:56.690> out

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
here to make sure this opponent gets out

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.750 
here to make sure this opponent gets out
of<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:57.050> hand<00:04:57.290> even<00:04:57.860> though<00:04:58.010> my<00:04:58.220> opponent<00:04:58.640> is

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
of the hand even though my opponent is

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.180 
of the hand even though my opponent is
likely<00:04:59.060> to<00:04:59.360> have<00:04:59.540> a<00:04:59.780> pair<00:05:00.170> which<00:05:00.560> is<00:05:00.800> ahead<00:05:00.950> of

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
likely to have a pair which is ahead of

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.430 
likely to have a pair which is ahead of
my<00:05:01.340> ace<00:05:01.490> king<00:05:01.880> I<00:05:02.090> am<00:05:02.810> also<00:05:03.140> of<00:05:03.260> the<00:05:03.410> opinion

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
my ace king I am also of the opinion

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.010 
my ace king I am also of the opinion
that<00:05:03.770> he<00:05:04.130> may<00:05:04.460> very<00:05:04.850> well<00:05:05.210> be<00:05:05.390> trying<00:05:05.690> to<00:05:05.810> steal

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
that he may very well be trying to steal

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.470 
that he may very well be trying to steal
a<00:05:06.080> pot<00:05:06.380> here<00:05:06.620> since<00:05:06.920> he<00:05:07.130> has<00:05:07.370> witnessed<00:05:07.700> myself

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
a pot here since he has witnessed myself

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.500 
a pot here since he has witnessed myself
and<00:05:08.780> this<00:05:09.560> other<00:05:09.770> player<00:05:10.130> playing<00:05:10.970> moderate

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
and this other player playing moderate

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.050 
and this other player playing moderate
strength<00:05:11.900> hands<00:05:12.500> in<00:05:12.680> fact<00:05:13.460> he<00:05:13.730> could<00:05:13.940> be

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
strength hands in fact he could be

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.640 
strength hands in fact he could be
attempting<00:05:14.510> a<00:05:14.600> squeeze<00:05:14.900> play<00:05:15.110> here<00:05:15.470> with

attempting a squeeze play here with
weaker<00:05:16.040> hands<00:05:16.280> than<00:05:16.550> mine<00:05:16.700> with<00:05:17.600> ace<00:05:17.750> king

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
weaker hands than mine with ace king

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.040 
weaker hands than mine with ace king
there<00:05:18.650> is<00:05:18.920> never<00:05:19.400> a<00:05:19.670> reason<00:05:19.730> to<00:05:20.240> not<00:05:20.510> play<00:05:20.810> this

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
there is never a reason to not play this

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.500 
there is never a reason to not play this
hand<00:05:21.350> in<00:05:21.680> this<00:05:22.010> situation<00:05:22.700> in<00:05:22.940> a<00:05:23.060> sit<00:05:23.270> and<00:05:23.300> go

hand in this situation in a sit and go

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.040 
hand in this situation in a sit and go
tournament

tournament

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.670 
tournament
therefore<00:05:24.590> I<00:05:24.860> rear<00:05:25.580> a<00:05:25.790> saul<00:05:26.180> in<00:05:26.450> the<00:05:27.440> small

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
therefore I rear a saul in the small

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.190

for him that way

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.820 
for him that way
this<00:05:58.880> time<00:05:59.150> but<00:05:59.480> I<00:05:59.510> have<00:05:59.720> no<00:06:00.020> problem<00:06:00.530> with<00:06:00.680> his

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
this time but I have no problem with his

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.040 
this time but I have no problem with his
aggressive<00:06:01.070> play<00:06:01.550> there<00:06:01.820> well<00:06:02.510> those<00:06:02.840> are

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
aggressive play there well those are

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.600 
aggressive play there well those are
some<00:06:03.080> hands<00:06:03.470> that<00:06:03.590> I<00:06:03.740> played<00:06:03.980> on<00:06:04.010> the<00:06:04.160> bubble

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
some hands that I played on the bubble

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.350 
some hands that I played on the bubble
in<00:06:04.730> this<00:06:04.880> tournament

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
in this tournament

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.690 
in this tournament
remember<00:06:06.080> these<00:06:06.350> are<00:06:06.500> high<00:06:06.650> risk<00:06:06.890> situations

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700 
remember these are high risk situations

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.340 
remember these are high risk situations
which<00:06:07.970> aren't<00:06:08.210> always<00:06:08.480> going<00:06:08.810> to<00:06:08.900> work<00:06:09.140> out

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
which aren't always going to work out

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.590 
which aren't always going to work out
like<00:06:09.380> they<00:06:09.710> did<00:06:09.770> for<00:06:10.190> me<00:06:10.310> here<00:06:10.670> the<00:06:11.300> idea

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 
like they did for me here the idea

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.240 
like they did for me here the idea
behind<00:06:11.780> playing<00:06:12.260> around<00:06:12.530> the<00:06:12.620> bubble<00:06:12.770> is<00:06:13.040> to

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
behind playing around the bubble is to

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.280 
behind playing around the bubble is to
consistently<00:06:13.880> make<00:06:14.180> profitable<00:06:14.690> decisions

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
consistently make profitable decisions

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.100 
consistently make profitable decisions
no<00:06:15.500> matter<00:06:15.770> what<00:06:16.220> the<00:06:16.460> outcome<00:06:16.910> is<00:06:16.990> when<00:06:17.990> you

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
no matter what the outcome is when you

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.630 
no matter what the outcome is when you
have<00:06:18.290> three<00:06:18.530> or<00:06:18.650> four<00:06:18.680> of<00:06:18.920> these<00:06:19.070> tables<00:06:19.460> going

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640
