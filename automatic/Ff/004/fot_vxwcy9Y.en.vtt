00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
and then you have your tremolo either

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.860 
and then you have your tremolo either
always<00:00:43.110> on<00:00:43.500> or<00:00:43.950> footswitch<00:00:44.610> use<00:00:45.539> your<00:00:45.690> foot

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
switch to turn on and off and then

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.619 
switch to turn on and off and then
here's<00:00:49.590> your<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:49.920> standby<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.149> then<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.510> took

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
here's your on standby and then it took

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.799 
here's your on standby and then it took
me<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.809> while<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.020> figure<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.590> out<00:00:52.829> because

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
me a while to figure this out because

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.850 
me a while to figure this out because
there's<00:00:54.809> kind<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.230> bunch<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.530> different

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
there's kind of a bunch of different

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.000 
there's kind of a bunch of different
options<00:00:56.010> depending<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.789> how<00:00:57.260> you<00:00:58.260> run<00:00:58.739> this

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
options depending on how you run this

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.520 
options depending on how you run this
amp<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.820> found<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.510> best<00:01:00.660> way<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.899> do<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.320> is

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
amp but I found the best way to do it is

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.420 
amp but I found the best way to do it is
to<00:01:02.059> I<00:01:03.470> used<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.559> just<00:01:04.739> leave<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> rhythm

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
to I used to just leave it on the rhythm

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.219 
to I used to just leave it on the rhythm
and<00:01:05.700> then<00:01:05.760> use<00:01:05.970> all<00:01:06.150> my<00:01:06.299> pedals<00:01:06.689> for

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
and then use all my pedals for

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.770 
and then use all my pedals for
OverDrive's<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.920> whatnot<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.939> now<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.150> leave

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
OverDrive's and whatnot but now I leave

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.640 
OverDrive's and whatnot but now I leave
it<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.170> foot<00:01:10.409> switch<00:01:10.880> mode<00:01:12.320> so<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.350> can

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
it on the foot switch mode so you can

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.270 
it on the foot switch mode so you can
toggle<00:01:13.979> between<00:01:14.189> rhythm<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.270> not<00:01:16.170> rhythm<00:01:16.560> or

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
toggle between rhythm and not rhythm or

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.660 
toggle between rhythm and not rhythm or
rhythm<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.700> overdrive<00:01:18.290> so<00:01:19.340> here's<00:01:20.340> your<00:01:20.430> foot

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
rhythm and overdrive so here's your foot

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.719 
rhythm and overdrive so here's your foot
switch<00:01:20.939> -<00:01:21.320> this<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.500> pretty<00:01:22.740> cool<00:01:23.040> because<00:01:23.100> you

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
switch - this is pretty cool because you

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.320 
switch - this is pretty cool because you
can<00:01:23.909> switch<00:01:24.650> from<00:01:25.650> your<00:01:26.070> rhythm<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:27.299> your

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
can switch from your rhythm to your

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.480 
can switch from your rhythm to your
overdrive<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.140> guess<00:01:28.290> they<00:01:28.470> call<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.860> contour

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
overdrive I guess they call that contour

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.880 
overdrive I guess they call that contour
but<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.030> know<00:01:30.119> whatever<00:01:31.049> that's<00:01:31.470> weird<00:01:31.710> but

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
but you know whatever that's weird but

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.149 
but you know whatever that's weird but
so<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.520> keep<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.790> on<00:01:32.850> rhythm<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.420> then<00:01:33.479> boost

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
so you keep it on rhythm and then boost

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.340 
so you keep it on rhythm and then boost
and<00:01:35.159> then<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.579> also<00:01:35.790> turn<00:01:36.780> your<00:01:36.960> reverb

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
and then you can also turn your reverb

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.530 
and then you can also turn your reverb
on<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.009> off<00:01:38.130> doesn't<00:01:38.820> have<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.970> light<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.450> you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
on and off doesn't have a light so you

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.359 
on and off doesn't have a light so you
got<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.750> use<00:01:39.780> your<00:01:39.930> ears<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.650> then<00:01:41.220> your

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
got to use your ears and then your

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.480 
got to use your ears and then your
tremolo<00:01:41.759> on<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.210> off<00:01:42.409> so<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.500> best<00:01:43.710> way<00:01:44.430> I

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
tremolo on and off so the best way I

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.490 
tremolo on and off so the best way I
have<00:01:44.759> found<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.090> use<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.509> amp<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.200> always

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
have found to use the amp is to always

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.800 
have found to use the amp is to always
leave<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.799> reverb<00:01:47.159> on<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.700> either<00:01:48.509> you

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
leave the reverb on and either you

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.300 
leave the reverb on and either you
always<00:01:49.020> leave<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.200> little<00:01:49.439> bit<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.710> tremolo<00:01:50.070> on

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
always leave a little bit of tremolo on

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.100 
always leave a little bit of tremolo on
which<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> cool<00:01:50.909> kind<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.240> throbbing<00:01:51.750> effect

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
which is a cool kind of throbbing effect

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.200 
which is a cool kind of throbbing effect
or<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.619> can<00:01:52.799> make<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.159> super<00:01:53.579> radical<00:01:54.060> and

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
or you can make it super radical and

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.450 
or you can make it super radical and
turn<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.509> on<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.720> off<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.920> I'll<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.250> go

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
turn that on and off but I'll just go

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.760 
turn that on and off but I'll just go
through<00:01:57.710> just<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.780> reverb<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.079> trim<00:02:01.409> and

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
through just the reverb the trim and

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.850 
through just the reverb the trim and
then<00:02:01.860> both<00:02:02.100> channels<00:02:02.460> real<00:02:02.820> quick<00:02:03.090> for<00:02:03.329> you

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
then both channels real quick for you

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:47.550 
then both channels real quick for you
let<00:02:04.860> me<00:02:05.009> find<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.369> good<00:02:05.549> spot<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:06.119> sit<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.630> day

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:56.670
