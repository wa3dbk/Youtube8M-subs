it but you can still see there's plenty
of<00:02:05.819> barbed<00:02:06.060> expose<00:02:07.130> what<00:02:08.130> you<00:02:08.220> need<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.520> do<00:02:08.640> now

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
of barbed expose what you need to do now

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.020 
of barbed expose what you need to do now
is<00:02:10.110> hold<00:02:10.440> them<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:11.130> so<00:02:11.640> they<00:02:11.760> sort<00:02:11.940> of

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
is hold them in so they sort of

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.790 
is hold them in so they sort of
triangulate<00:02:12.840> really<00:02:15.200> get<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.230> bit<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.620> a

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
triangulate really get a bit of a

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.570 
triangulate really get a bit of a
plastic<00:02:18.620> start<00:02:19.620> at<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.800> bottom

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580
