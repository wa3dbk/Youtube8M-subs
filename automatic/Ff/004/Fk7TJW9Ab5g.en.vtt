this program will come with a virus and

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.390 
this program will come with a virus and

that my PC status is at risk now again

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.090 
that my PC status is at risk now again
once<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.540> download<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.960> program<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.890> can

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
once you download the program you can

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.999 
once you download the program you can
obviously<00:02:02.549> save<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.360> tell<00:02:03.780> your<00:02:04.560> program

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
obviously save it and tell your program

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.490 
obviously save it and tell your program
that<00:02:05.250> it's<00:02:05.490> not<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.759> virus<00:02:06.320> excluded<00:02:07.320> for

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
that it's not a virus excluded for

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.949 
that it's not a virus excluded for
whatever<00:02:07.740> whatever<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.759> gotta<00:02:08.879> do<00:02:09.030> but

whatever whatever you gotta do but
at<00:02:11.260> first<00:02:11.530> I<00:02:11.680> suggest<00:02:11.849> sipping<00:02:12.849> it<00:02:13.590> then<00:02:14.590> go<00:02:14.769> to

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
at first I suggest sipping it then go to

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.009 
at first I suggest sipping it then go to
his<00:02:14.950> link<00:02:15.310> in<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.489> description<00:02:15.939> and<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.900> can

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
his link in the description and you can

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.039 
his link in the description and you can
just<00:02:17.170> download<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.650> file<00:02:18.129> all<00:02:19.090> I<00:02:19.150> do<00:02:19.689> is<00:02:19.810> save

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
just download the file all I do is save

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.199 
just download the file all I do is save
it<00:02:20.170> or<00:02:20.260> open<00:02:20.500> it<00:02:20.560> when<00:02:20.709> I<00:02:20.769> want<00:02:21.129> and<00:02:21.549> it's<00:02:22.150> a

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
it or open it when I want and it's a

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:32.059 
it or open it when I want and it's a
small<00:02:22.450> file<00:02:24.150> open<00:02:25.150> it<00:02:25.299> up<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.900> here<00:02:29.260> we<00:02:29.290> go

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.679 

so<00:02:33.069> it's<00:02:33.250> called<00:02:33.430> low<00:02:34.150> over<00:02:34.510> tile<00:02:34.750> ion<00:02:35.620> cannon

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
so it's called low over tile ion cannon

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.190 
so it's called low over tile ion cannon
when<00:02:37.689> harpoons<00:02:38.260> air<00:02:38.590> strikes<00:02:38.980> in<00:02:39.159> nooks<00:02:39.549> fail

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
when harpoons air strikes in nooks fail

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.030 
when harpoons air strikes in nooks fail
basically<00:02:41.200> this<00:02:41.319> program<00:02:41.530> comes<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:41.950> an

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
basically this program comes to an

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.339 
basically this program comes to an
effect<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:43.180> it's<00:02:43.329> got<00:02:43.480> a<00:02:43.510> cool<00:02:43.750> little<00:02:43.840> symbol

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
effect so it's got a cool little symbol

Google<00:04:23.250> it's<00:04:24.250> gonna<00:04:24.400> hard<00:04:24.639> to<00:04:24.759> flood<00:04:24.970> Google

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
Google it's gonna hard to flood Google

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:27.320 
Google it's gonna hard to flood Google
because<00:04:25.690> Google<00:04:25.720> is<00:04:26.050> a<00:04:26.110> big<00:04:26.259> server<00:04:26.500> so

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
because Google is a big server so

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.490 
because Google is a big server so
obviously<00:04:28.330> it's<00:04:28.479> not<00:04:28.570> gonna<00:04:28.720> work<00:04:28.900> on<00:04:29.080> those

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
obviously it's not gonna work on those

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.879 
obviously it's not gonna work on those
you<00:04:30.190> may<00:04:30.310> be<00:04:30.460> web<00:04:30.610> sites<00:04:30.849> but<00:04:31.590> if<00:04:32.590> you<00:04:32.710> get

computers attacking one server and can

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.710 
computers attacking one server and can
crash<00:04:38.050> it<00:04:38.259> now<00:04:39.130> again<00:04:39.490> I<00:04:39.580> shut<00:04:40.030> it<00:04:40.060> off<00:04:40.270> so<00:04:40.539> I

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
crash it now again I shut it off so I

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.620 
crash it now again I shut it off so I
don't<00:04:40.960> want<00:04:41.139> to<00:04:41.289> be<00:04:41.380> get<00:04:41.590> in<00:04:41.710> trouble<00:04:42.009> here

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.150 
don't want to be get in trouble here
here's<00:04:43.630> a<00:04:43.720> couple<00:04:43.900> other<00:04:43.990> methods<00:04:44.410> to<00:04:44.620> seeing

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
here's a couple other methods to seeing

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.610 
here's a couple other methods to seeing
go<00:04:45.280> here<00:04:45.550> send<00:04:46.300> it<00:04:46.479> and<00:04:46.949> on<00:04:48.300> HTTP<00:04:49.300> if<00:04:50.289> you<00:04:50.410> click

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
go here send it and on HTTP if you click

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.439 
go here send it and on HTTP if you click
you<00:04:50.830> actually<00:04:51.160> get<00:04:51.250> more<00:04:51.400> results<00:04:51.669> so<00:04:52.150> you<00:04:52.270> get

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
you actually get more results so you get

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:53.790 
you actually get more results so you get
downloading<00:04:53.020> stuff<00:04:53.199> like<00:04:53.380> that

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
downloading stuff like that

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.760 
downloading stuff like that
and<00:04:54.720> that's<00:04:55.720> about<00:04:55.840> if<00:04:56.050> it's<00:04:56.229> for<00:04:56.680> this

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
and that's about if it's for this
