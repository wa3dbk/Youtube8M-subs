another<00:03:41.560> kind<00:03:41.950> of<00:03:42.130> side<00:03:43.620> maybe<00:03:44.620> come<00:03:45.010> up<00:03:45.100> when

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
another kind of side maybe come up when

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.490 
another kind of side maybe come up when
I<00:03:45.459> see<00:03:45.790> them<00:03:48.660> what's<00:03:49.660> going<00:03:49.930> on<00:03:50.050> the<00:03:50.140> side<00:03:50.380> up

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
I see them what's going on the side up

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.990 
I see them what's going on the side up
stage<00:03:50.860> with<00:03:51.160> us<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:51.670> get<00:03:52.300> the<00:03:53.370> notes<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.730> the

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
stage with us I get the notes and the

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.610 
stage with us I get the notes and the
nitrate<00:03:55.660> levels<00:03:56.010> sit<00:03:57.010> so<00:03:57.250> angry<00:03:58.320> I'll<00:03:59.320> take<00:03:59.560> a

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
nitrate levels sit so angry I'll take a

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.009 
nitrate levels sit so angry I'll take a
few<00:03:59.860> weeks<00:04:00.130> or<00:04:00.430> disproven<00:04:01.180> with<00:04:01.420> it<00:04:01.540> then<00:04:01.750> I

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
few weeks or disproven with it then I

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:08.259 
few weeks or disproven with it then I
don't<00:04:02.320> levels<00:04:02.799> up<00:04:02.950> to<00:04:02.980> where<00:04:03.310> they<00:04:03.459> should<00:04:03.489> be

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.229 

and<00:04:09.470> once<00:04:10.470> with<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.739> background<00:04:11.340> for

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
and once with the background for

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.259 
and once with the background for
implanting<00:04:13.200> our<00:04:13.379> for<00:04:14.159> the<00:04:14.220> plant<00:04:14.519> so<00:04:14.849> stay
