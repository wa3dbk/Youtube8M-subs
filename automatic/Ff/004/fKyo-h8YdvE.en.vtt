00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
cheese really ties the soup together so

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.940 
cheese really ties the soup together so
give<00:02:39.000> everything<00:02:39.360> one<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.930> final<00:02:40.290> stir<00:02:40.590> here

give everything one the final stir here

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.069

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
let it come back to a simmer and then

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.690 
let it come back to a simmer and then
just<00:02:43.260> let<00:02:43.409> it<00:02:43.500> cook<00:02:43.620> for<00:02:43.860> about<00:02:43.950> five<00:02:44.459> minutes

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
just let it cook for about five minutes

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.309 
just let it cook for about five minutes
or<00:02:44.910> so<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.209> doesn't<00:02:45.540> take<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.720> long<00:02:46.019> time<00:02:46.260> you
