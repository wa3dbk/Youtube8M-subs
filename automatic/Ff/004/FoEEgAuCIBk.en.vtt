end<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.470> cuts<00:01:59.679> very<00:01:59.979> structured<00:02:00.729> it's<00:02:01.000> very

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
end the cuts very structured it's very

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.789 
end the cuts very structured it's very
shaped<00:02:01.659> definitely<00:02:02.349> a<00:02:02.380> little<00:02:02.530> bit<00:02:02.619> more<00:02:02.740> on

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
shaped definitely a little bit more on

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.460 
shaped definitely a little bit more on
the<00:02:02.830> edgy<00:02:03.009> side<00:02:03.479> Kelly's<00:02:04.479> also<00:02:04.780> very<00:02:04.959> young<00:02:05.200> so

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
the edgy side Kelly's also very young so

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.679 
the edgy side Kelly's also very young so
she<00:02:05.649> can<00:02:05.890> pull<00:02:06.099> out<00:02:06.220> very<00:02:06.490> edgy<00:02:06.909> and<00:02:07.360> I<00:02:07.479> think

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
she can pull out very edgy and I think

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.389 
she can pull out very edgy and I think
it's<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:08.049> total<00:02:08.200> look<00:02:08.410> is<00:02:08.679> really<00:02:08.709> suitable

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
it's the total look is really suitable

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.859 
it's the total look is really suitable

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
for her that's something that she would

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.559 
for her that's something that she would
actually<00:02:11.170> wear<00:02:11.380> outside<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.849> shoot
