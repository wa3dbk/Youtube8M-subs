00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:07.350
 Good evening Mass will always remain 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.990
 surprised by juventus this evening 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.650
 normally after the holidays 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.690
 Christmas ones excuse me for being a 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.350
 fear scares the fear of not having 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.260
 the team 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.769
 a team in short at the height of 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.600
 situation and if then these eight points 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:27.359
 they can still give a little more than 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.599
 tranquility to maybe then stretch into 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.860
 future the advantage over the second 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:38.250
 thank you but inevitable that when you do 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:43.020
 resumes later after a stop than then one 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:49.800
 stop as in my opinion to review a little 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:53.969
 of everything because it is a stop to a feint 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.550
 time this year despite this has 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.379
 had to give seven days of vacation 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:04.320
 football players and then hope that in 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.159
 transoceanic trips you could 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:13.760
 train so many things then not 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:16.590
 definitely not a little anxiety there was 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.799
 because then it was due we had to 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.369
 prepare work for it to have 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.200
 worked also because it's not us 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.100
 we are used to working by virtue also 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.900
 of the three commitments we have therefore 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.150
 some definitely a bit of anxiety 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.070
 were there because not after seven days of 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.750
 holiday 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.030
 put the players back on track 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.760
 let him train him even 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.600
 perhaps important is never simple 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.850
 were good at working to succeed too 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.000
 to dispose of the work but this 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.310
 group of guys who work with me for 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.100
 the third year therefore from this point of 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.420
 view are only also used but they are 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.690
 happy because we won one 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.060
 match against a direct competitor 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:11.840
 for the scudetto and we also worked 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:12.350
 very good this week but i 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.950
 eight points 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.239
 I said it yesterday at the conference 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.670
 the eight points certainly represent 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:23.239
 a nice advantage 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.200
 needless to say but they must represent is 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:29.300
 a nice advantage and not an illusion 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.610
 because if these eight points owe us 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.290
 to deceive something that still is 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.630
 we don't have and let us lose 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.360
 concentration agonistic wickedness the 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.030
 want to train dedication desire to 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.610
 make ourselves available to the team 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.910
 then I say these eight points c talking about 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.799
 bad as we have recovered in the 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.160
 within a month and a half 13 points to the 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.250
 Rome 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.750
 we also stretched on the napoli 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.400
 the others can do very well 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.780
 with us here is ciao antonio to ask 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.920
 since we have been used for two years and 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.290
 half 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.209
 always does to the game I ask you what you have 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.160
 told your players at least that 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.569
 a first half hour of the first half is 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.520
 it seemed that you played in a manner 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.510
 different if it was something due if then 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:23.120
 explain that it looked like he was waiting for 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:27.530
 roma thanks you know not every game comes 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:30.530
 always studied in all long and 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.970
 wide in all the details and therefore it is not 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.180
 true that we heard the game 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.550
 because it also happened with Naples 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:45.350
 that we have taken an attitude 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:47.319
 different than usual even when 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.150
 we played with madrid 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.790
 here it is not true that there is a single one 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.850
 attitude we choose the games 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.030
 we study the teams we study it I repeat a 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:02.510
 table just to look then during 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:06.100
 the game of limiting the merits of the 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.000
 opposing teams and to skip defects 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.590
 but I think this task 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:19.180
 of the coach who does it however in a few 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:20.750
 two things are collected, the first is antonio 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.150
 the attention with which you have 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.890
 developed set-up schemes 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.910
 a chance pump went to the very shooting 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.460
 dangerous has been returned 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.000
 by chance on the second scheme you have 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.289
 made goal 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.330
 because everyone is moved in a way 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.380
 Bonucci a high so it was just one 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.320
 of the keys he had interpreted 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.010
 waiting to maybe the game 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.930
 the speech of the 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.210
 preparing everything so it is for 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.990
 particularly exploit these 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.789
 game situations 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.140
 the second thing in a time when yes 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.210
 a lot has been spoken there have been many 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.039
 also beaten from the beginning of the year 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:53.650
 after this victory principal will come 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:57.210
 put the church back on the sides of the village 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:01.949
 but I think that by continuing to 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:05.849
 in the speech before and on my part e 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:09.569
 from my staff who thank him 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:12.360
 but they deserve I always do it at the end 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:18.330
 that's what happened and what was more beautiful 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:21.660
 but here is me and my staff and we study 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:25.880
 we analyze all that is that 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.880
 concerns the opponent's game 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.169
 we are paid for this for 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.370
 put the players in the conditions 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:36.240
 in the best conditions to suffer 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.520
 at least the positive aspects of the 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.599
 team to skip the flaws and also 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:45.349
 in the kick-off phases e 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:48.080
 we prepare everything both in the phase of 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:53.210
 possession that the non-possession phase 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.210
 I repeat this must be a coach 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:59.970
 this is my role 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:02.370
 here not only is there no coach not 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:06.500
 just give training so quit 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:08.849
 and I feel it is more a broader discourse 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.039
 and from there there are better coaches 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:14.460
 and the most capable milo capable are less good 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:16.120
 highest paid the least paid for what 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:25.340
 it concerns 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:29.800
 it does n't happen here mom was talking 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.800
 however of a city â€‹â€‹fact here 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.240
 many questions 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:49.860
 okay here thanks big story 

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:52.219
 white love hugging in black 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.219
 Now 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.500
 Yup
