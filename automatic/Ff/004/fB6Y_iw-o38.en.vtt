00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.940
 crochet a simple daisy we need 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.900

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.710
 yellow and white hook and scissors 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:20.270
 starting knitting yellow thread 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.270
 I make a ring around my fingers 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:40.469
 crochet pull the eyelet see the first 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.250
 air loop 1 is now in the ring 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:56.420
 knit 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:56.420
 6 single crochet 1 2 3 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.050
 456 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:18.869
 pulling the tail and tightening the ring 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:23.070
 so the first row of 6 posts without nakida 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.590
 finished second row consists of 12 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.869
 nakidov columns that is, we are about 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:34.020
 knit 2 columns in each of the loops 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:37.909
 I enter the hook in the first column without nakida 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:42.090
 previous row here are 2 half loops 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:45.569
 I pull out a loop I knit 1 column 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:50.220
 the second column is no crochet next 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:02:14.329
 the loop is similar, I see two columns without 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:02:14.329
 nakida so it is 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:28.939
 1112 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:34.099

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:36.700
 12 columns without nakida now enter 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:41.709
 first crochet hook 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:45.019
 pulling out a loop and pulling through 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:50.620
 last get connecting 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.620
 the thread is cropped yellow 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:03:04.579
 I tighten the loop now I insert the hook into 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:07.180
 hole and pull the thread on the front 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.180
 the side 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.790
 knit chamomile will purse 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:18.590
 side because it looks more like 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.370
 structure on chamomile will now 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.769
 attach 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:27.319
 white thread start knitting white 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.889
 threads are better elsewhere that is not in 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:34.449
 the place where we finished the work 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:39.769
 retreat a few loops and enter the hook 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:42.530
 behind the back wall 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:47.780
 half loop is not for 2 half loop how to fit 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.699
 usually just behind the back and start 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.949
 knitting 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:58.009
 air loops so 1 air loop 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:04:01.639
 tightened petal consists of 10 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:04.540
 air loop knit 10 air 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.540
 loops 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.440
 Well, fathers . 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:19.310
 I put the hook in the same place where I started 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:24.260
 knitting do not do the connecting column 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:32.520
 Now I enter the hook in the back half 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:36.320
 next loop do the connecting 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:42.500
 a column that is I pull a loop and 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.500
 dialing a chain of 10 air loops 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.630
 I attach it to the same place 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:53.630
 connecting stub 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.860
 I knit the next petal pay 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:13.980
 attention to the connecting bar 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.520
 yellow petals do not attach to it 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.750
 need to 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.790
 we fasten petals to 12 loops of the main 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.320
 the circle 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:27.150
 likewise you have to knit the third and 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:28.470
 the subsequent petals are only 12 and so 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:35.400
 looks back 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:45.990
 the wrong side of our flower and so daisy 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:47.180
 almost finished 12 petals now need 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.930
 to tie 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:53.430
 connecting stub to first petal 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:59.479
 so that the petals do not fall apart 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:06:03.000
 and pull the thread on the wrong side 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:06.419
 fasten with a needle all the threads and this 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.470
 daisy turns out in the end thank you
