a day this can actually be relatively

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.089 
a day this can actually be relatively
easy<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.490> achieve<00:00:11.820> if<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:12.750> use<00:00:13.290> water<00:00:13.620> bottles

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
easy to achieve if you use water bottles

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.790 
easy to achieve if you use water bottles
that<00:00:14.219> have<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:15.389> amount<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.929> ounces<00:00:16.139> written

that have the amount of ounces written

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.710 
that have the amount of ounces written
on<00:00:16.890> them<00:00:17.130> for<00:00:17.310> example<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.789> can<00:00:17.970> buy<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.180> lot<00:00:18.510> of

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
on them for example you can buy a lot of

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.140 
on them for example you can buy a lot of
the<00:00:18.980> portable<00:00:19.980> water<00:00:20.189> bottles<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.730> are<00:00:20.880> the

the portable water bottles that are the

the portable water bottles that are the
size<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.660> 32<00:00:21.990> ounces<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.880> easiest<00:00:24.269> way<00:00:24.480> to

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
size of 32 ounces and the easiest way to

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.960 
size of 32 ounces and the easiest way to
do<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.170> just<00:00:25.279> basically<00:00:26.279> sip<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.820> your

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
necessarily need an entire gallon of

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.920 
necessarily need an entire gallon of
water<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.100> day<00:01:14.189> your<00:01:14.909> fluid<00:01:15.299> needs<00:01:15.479> are<00:01:15.689> based

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
water a day your fluid needs are based

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.450 
water a day your fluid needs are based
on<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> couple<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.560> things<00:01:16.770> they're<00:01:17.070> based<00:01:17.280> on

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
on a couple of things they're based on

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.880 
on a couple of things they're based on
your<00:01:17.610> body<00:01:17.939> weight<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.689> they're<00:01:19.200> also<00:01:19.409> based

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
your body weight and they're also based

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.070 
your body weight and they're also based
on<00:01:20.189> your<00:01:20.369> level<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.850> physical<00:01:21.240> activity<00:01:21.840> as

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
on your level of physical activity as

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.370 
on your level of physical activity as
well<00:01:22.860> as<00:01:22.920> weather<00:01:23.490> conditions<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.960> rough

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
well as weather conditions so a rough

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.350 
well as weather conditions so a rough
rule<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.799> thumb<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.460> take<00:01:26.970> your<00:01:27.180> body

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
rule of thumb is to take your body

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.080 
rule of thumb is to take your body
weight<00:01:27.619> divide<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:28.950> half<00:01:28.979> that's<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
weight divide it in half that's the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.940 
weight divide it in half that's the
number<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.479> ounces<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.140> water<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.590> need

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
number of ounces of water that you need

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.760 
number of ounces of water that you need
on<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> daily<00:01:32.369> basis<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.540> course<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:34.229> very<00:01:34.500> hot

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
on a daily basis of course it's very hot

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.170 
on a daily basis of course it's very hot
outside<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.549> you're<00:01:35.729> doing<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.030> lot<00:01:36.150> of

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
outside and you're doing a lot of

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.149 
outside and you're doing a lot of
activity<00:01:36.780> outside<00:01:36.930> you're<00:01:37.530> probably<00:01:37.799> going

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
activity outside you're probably going

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.160 
activity outside you're probably going
to<00:01:38.220> need<00:01:38.400> more<00:01:38.670> water<00:01:38.970> than<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:40.020> again

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
to need more water than that so again

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.200 
to need more water than that so again
really<00:01:40.470> spend<00:01:41.130> some<00:01:41.280> time<00:01:41.460> looking<00:01:41.790> at<00:01:41.970> how

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
really spend some time looking at how

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.399 
really spend some time looking at how
much<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.509> weigh<00:01:42.659> how<00:01:43.020> much<00:01:43.229> physical

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
much you weigh how much physical

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.560 
much you weigh how much physical
activity<00:01:43.740> you're<00:01:44.369> doing<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.970> whether<00:01:45.390> you're

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
activity you're doing and whether you're

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.120 
activity you're doing and whether you're
sweating<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.079> lot<00:01:46.259> because<00:01:46.439> it's<00:01:46.710> very<00:01:46.890> hot

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
sweating a lot because it's very hot

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.340 
sweating a lot because it's very hot
outside<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.820> use<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.780> gauge<00:01:48.990> whether

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
outside and use that to gauge whether

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.710 
outside and use that to gauge whether
you<00:01:49.560> really<00:01:49.770> need<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:50.040> gallon<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.520> water<00:01:50.720> maybe

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
you really need a gallon of water maybe

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.530 
you really need a gallon of water maybe
you<00:01:51.869> need<00:01:52.020> more<00:01:52.229> maybe<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.040> need<00:01:53.220> less<00:01:53.460> but<00:01:54.270> a

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
you need more maybe you need less but a

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.780 
you need more maybe you need less but a
method<00:01:55.110> for<00:01:55.229> achieving<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:55.950> again<00:01:56.579> to

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
method for achieving that is again to

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.389 
method for achieving that is again to
use<00:01:56.939> 32<00:01:57.450> ounce<00:01:57.659> bottles<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.409> work<00:01:59.040> your<00:01:59.189> way

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
use 32 ounce bottles and work your way

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.520 
use 32 ounce bottles and work your way
up<00:01:59.670> to<00:02:00.000> having<00:02:00.210> four<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.689> those<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.290> that

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
up to having four of those and that

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.270 
up to having four of those and that
would<00:02:01.710> get<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.280> gallon<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.790> water<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.149> day
