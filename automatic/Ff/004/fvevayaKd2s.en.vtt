of<00:02:00.119> plain<00:02:00.479> suit<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.229> was<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.380> little<00:02:01.649> bit<00:02:01.800> more

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
of plain suit it was a little bit more

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.580 
of plain suit it was a little bit more
athletic<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.789> style<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.600> like<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.140> we<00:02:04.229> opened

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
athletic and style I like that we opened

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.499 
athletic and style I like that we opened
up<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.860> neckline<00:02:05.280> on<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.119> think<00:02:06.360> that

up the neckline on you and I think that

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.219
