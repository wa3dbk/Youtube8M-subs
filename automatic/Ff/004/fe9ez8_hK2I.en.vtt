00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.560 
updated to its current state but as soon
as<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.570> started<00:01:30.930> career<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:32.100> sets<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.210> default

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
as I started career it it sets a default

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.510 
as I started career it it sets a default
so<00:01:33.780> I'm<00:01:33.869> not<00:01:34.020> sure<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.350> that's<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.740> thing<00:01:35.460> that

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
so I'm not sure if that's a thing that

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.460 
so I'm not sure if that's a thing that
FIFA<00:01:35.820> does<00:01:36.119> but<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.780> explains<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.320> but

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
FIFA does but and that explains that but

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.870 
FIFA does but and that explains that but
anyway<00:01:37.710> I'm<00:01:37.770> just<00:01:37.860> messing<00:01:38.579> about<00:01:38.640> with<00:01:38.759> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
I think it is if that before yeah yes so

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.649 
I think it is if that before yeah yes so
whatever<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.130> formation<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.729> now<00:02:02.939> forget<00:02:03.450> but
