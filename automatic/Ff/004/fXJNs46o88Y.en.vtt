Hendrix chord alright this is the

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.960 
Hendrix chord alright this is the
dominant<00:01:04.739> seventh<00:01:05.009> sharp<00:01:05.190> line<00:01:05.369> chord<00:01:05.670> that

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
dominant seventh sharp line chord that

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.249 
dominant seventh sharp line chord that
you<00:01:06.119> find<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:08.060> public<00:01:09.060> haze<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.630> jangula

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
you find in public haze this jangula

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.760 
you find in public haze this jangula
kind<00:01:10.440> of<00:01:10.500> edgy<00:01:10.649> cool

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.590 

it's<00:01:15.770> that<00:01:15.979> one<00:01:16.130> there<00:01:16.159> and<00:01:16.549> there<00:01:17.180> are<00:01:17.329> lots

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
it's that one there and there are lots

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.660 
it's that one there and there are lots
of<00:01:17.750> other<00:01:17.930> scenarios<00:01:18.860> in<00:01:19.009> music<00:01:19.310> where<00:01:19.490> that

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
of other scenarios in music where that

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.850 
of other scenarios in music where that
quarters<00:01:20.030> use<00:01:20.240> and<00:01:20.840> we<00:01:21.020> will<00:01:21.170> touch<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.439> few<00:01:21.799> of

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
quarters use and we will touch a few of

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.660 
quarters use and we will touch a few of
those<00:01:22.149> shortly<00:01:23.350> but<00:01:24.350> first<00:01:24.590> of<00:01:24.770> all<00:01:24.860> I'm<00:01:25.610> not

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
those shortly but first of all I'm not

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.609 
those shortly but first of all I'm not
going<00:01:25.939> to<00:01:26.000> go<00:01:26.090> deep<00:01:26.450> into<00:01:26.689> the<00:01:26.869> theory<00:01:27.350> of<00:01:27.380> this

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
going to go deep into the theory of this

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.820 
going to go deep into the theory of this
chord<00:01:28.000> because<00:01:29.000> that<00:01:29.210> requires<00:01:30.110> really<00:01:30.500> an

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
chord because that requires really an

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.410 
chord because that requires really an
understanding<00:01:31.430> of<00:01:31.490> functional<00:01:31.939> harmony<00:01:32.149> and

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
understanding of functional harmony and

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.940 
understanding of functional harmony and
5:1<00:01:32.810> resolutions<00:01:33.439> and<00:01:33.619> things<00:01:33.799> of<00:01:33.920> that

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
5:1 resolutions and things of that

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.039 
5:1 resolutions and things of that
nature<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:35.060> I'm<00:01:35.149> not<00:01:35.270> going<00:01:35.390> to<00:01:35.450> go<00:01:35.659> there<00:01:35.780> too

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
nature so I'm not going to go there too

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.460 
nature so I'm not going to go there too
much<00:01:36.200> I<00:01:36.350> will<00:01:36.470> just<00:01:36.890> touch<00:01:37.100> on<00:01:37.420> it<00:01:38.420> briefly<00:01:38.659> for

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
much I will just touch on it briefly for

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.660 
much I will just touch on it briefly for
those<00:01:39.590> of<00:01:39.710> you<00:01:39.799> who<00:01:39.890> already<00:01:39.920> understand<00:01:40.549> that

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
those of you who already understand that

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.580 
those of you who already understand that
this<00:01:41.420> understanding<00:01:42.080> is<00:01:42.140> not<00:01:42.259> so<00:01:42.439> necessary

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
this understanding is not so necessary

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.649 
this understanding is not so necessary
to<00:01:42.979> use<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.280> chord<00:01:43.520> but<00:01:43.759> here<00:01:44.270> it<00:01:44.360> is<00:01:44.450> anyway

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
to use the chord but here it is anyway

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.620 
to use the chord but here it is anyway
so<00:01:45.560> it's<00:01:45.679> a<00:01:45.710> dominant<00:01:46.100> 7<00:01:46.280> sharp<00:01:46.580> 9<00:01:46.789> chord<00:01:47.090> the

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
so it's a dominant 7 sharp 9 chord the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.960 
so it's a dominant 7 sharp 9 chord the
spelling<00:01:48.229> of<00:01:48.289> the<00:01:48.380> formula<00:01:48.770> is<00:01:48.799> root<00:01:49.220> major

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
spelling of the formula is root major

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.600 
spelling of the formula is root major
third<00:01:50.330> perfect<00:01:50.899> fifth<00:01:51.289> flat<00:01:51.830> seven<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:52.369> then

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
third perfect fifth flat seven and then

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.580 
third perfect fifth flat seven and then
you<00:01:52.700> have<00:01:52.789> the<00:01:52.880> sharp<00:01:53.149> nine<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:54.110> that<00:01:54.289> sharp

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
you have the sharp nine and that sharp

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.980 
you have the sharp nine and that sharp
nine<00:01:54.920> is<00:01:55.190> one<00:01:55.819> of<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.000> altered<00:01:56.420> notes<00:01:56.659> from

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
nine is one of the altered notes from

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.059 
nine is one of the altered notes from
you<00:01:57.110> know<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.350> four<00:01:57.920> different

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
you know the four different

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:59.800 
you know the four different
possibilities<00:01:58.759> of<00:01:59.030> an<00:01:59.119> altered<00:01:59.509> note<00:01:59.659> you

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
possibilities of an altered note you

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.080 
possibilities of an altered note you
might<00:01:59.959> add<00:02:00.170> to<00:02:00.409> a<00:02:00.470> chord<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:00.979> it<00:02:01.670> creates

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
might add to a chord and it creates

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.749 
might add to a chord and it creates
tension<00:02:02.390> its<00:02:02.840> usual<00:02:03.830> function<00:02:04.250> is<00:02:04.369> to<00:02:04.490> create

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
tension its usual function is to create

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.789 
tension its usual function is to create
tension<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:05.750> you<00:02:05.780> maybe<00:02:06.020> throw<00:02:06.500> that<00:02:06.649> on<00:02:06.740> a

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
tension so you maybe throw that on a

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.009 
tension so you maybe throw that on a
five<00:02:07.130> chord<00:02:07.490> so<00:02:07.670> that<00:02:07.819> when<00:02:07.939> you<00:02:08.060> resolve<00:02:08.660> back

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
five chord so that when you resolve back

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:14.420 
five chord so that when you resolve back
to<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.259> one<00:02:09.440> chord<00:02:09.470> like<00:02:10.340> jasmine

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.259 

you<00:02:15.430> could<00:02:15.610> just<00:02:15.760> go<00:02:17.069> sure<00:02:18.099> but<00:02:18.519> sometimes<00:02:18.940> in

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
you could just go sure but sometimes in

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.720 
you could just go sure but sometimes in
jazz<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:19.780> all<00:02:20.650> sorts<00:02:20.950> of<00:02:20.980> music<00:02:21.280> we<00:02:21.430> like<00:02:21.580> to

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
jazz and all sorts of music we like to

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.520 
jazz and all sorts of music we like to
create<00:02:22.060> more<00:02:22.300> tension<00:02:22.629> on<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.900> Firefall<00:02:23.349> make

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
create more tension on the Firefall make

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.460 
create more tension on the Firefall make
it<00:02:23.650> even<00:02:24.040> more<00:02:24.069> unsettled<00:02:24.879> and<00:02:25.420> weird<00:02:25.660> so<00:02:26.349> that

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
it even more unsettled and weird so that

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.960 
it even more unsettled and weird so that
when<00:02:26.620> you<00:02:26.739> eventually<00:02:27.040> do<00:02:27.370> resolve<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.879> the

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
when you eventually do resolve to the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.240 
when you eventually do resolve to the
one<00:02:28.150> chord<00:02:28.390> it's<00:02:28.840> like<00:02:29.110> our<00:02:29.319> I<00:02:29.830> feel<00:02:30.040> really

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
one chord it's like our I feel really

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.309 
one chord it's like our I feel really
good<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.459> know

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
good you know

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.380 
good you know
so<00:02:32.319> more<00:02:33.129> tension<00:02:33.549> creates<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.120> more

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
so more tension creates a more

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.839 
so more tension creates a more
satisfying<00:02:34.930> resolution<00:02:35.830> generally<00:02:36.670> within

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849
