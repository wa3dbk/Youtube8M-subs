my macbook pro by our place so that's

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.000

why<00:02:53.519> it<00:02:53.580> says<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.870> that's<00:02:55.080> how<00:02:55.170> we<00:02:55.290> access

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
why it says that so that's how we access

an<00:04:02.850> app<00:04:03.030> open<00:04:03.450> so<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:04.560> might<00:04:04.739> find<00:04:05.010> that<00:04:05.220> if

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
an app open so you might find that if

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.099 
an app open so you might find that if
you're<00:04:05.880> playing<00:04:06.150> games<00:04:06.390> or<00:04:06.690> something<00:04:07.019> like

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
you're playing games or something like

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.830 
you're playing games or something like
that<00:04:07.170> that<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:08.430> control<00:04:08.760> center<00:04:09.150> gesture<00:04:09.600> is

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
that that the control center gesture is

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.900 
that that the control center gesture is
conflicting<00:04:10.829> with<00:04:10.859> the<00:04:11.220> gesture<00:04:11.609> that<00:04:11.790> you're

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
conflicting with the gesture that you're

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.910 
conflicting with the gesture that you're
using<00:04:12.090> in<00:04:12.329> that<00:04:12.359> game<00:04:12.720> for<00:04:13.019> example<00:04:13.410> so<00:04:13.829> you

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
using in that game for example so you

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.279 
using in that game for example so you
might<00:04:14.070> decide<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.609> turn<00:04:15.420> off<00:04:15.570> control<00:04:15.959> center

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
might decide to turn off control center

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.440 
might decide to turn off control center
while<00:04:16.950> an<00:04:17.160> app<00:04:17.310> is<00:04:17.489> open<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:18.030> if<00:04:18.209> you<00:04:18.299> do<00:04:18.419> that

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
while an app is open and if you do that

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.360 
while an app is open and if you do that
you're<00:04:19.410> still<00:04:19.650> have<00:04:19.769> access<00:04:19.859> to<00:04:20.130> control

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
you're still have access to control

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.680 
you're still have access to control
center<00:04:20.700> on<00:04:20.850> your<00:04:21.000> homescreen<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.630> lockscreen

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
so that's up to you if you decide that's

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.230 
so that's up to you if you decide that's
useful<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:25.200> you<00:04:25.289> or<00:04:25.440> not

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240
