and<00:00:03.180> stag<00:00:03.540> have<00:00:03.810> changed<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.290> manufacturing

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
and stag have changed the manufacturing

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.830 
and stag have changed the manufacturing
techniques<00:00:05.640> used<00:00:06.000> on<00:00:06.240> their<00:00:06.420> symbols<00:00:06.750> they

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:06.840 
techniques used on their symbols they

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.440 
techniques used on their symbols they
now<00:00:06.990> roll<00:00:07.319> all<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.830> metal<00:00:08.130> which<00:00:09.120> gives<00:00:09.330> a

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
now roll all the metal which gives a

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.770 
now roll all the metal which gives a
much<00:00:09.690> more<00:00:09.900> consistent<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.740> flat<00:00:11.099> symbol

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:11.780 
much more consistent and a flat symbol

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.360 
much more consistent and a flat symbol
so<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.959> high<00:00:13.139> hats<00:00:13.379> are<00:00:13.650> much<00:00:13.830> cleaner<00:00:14.099> and

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
so the high hats are much cleaner and

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.160 
so the high hats are much cleaner and
crisper<00:00:14.790> for<00:00:15.150> instance<00:00:15.450> these<00:00:15.629> are<00:00:15.710> 15<00:00:16.710> inch

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
crisper for instance these are 15 inch

look at are the stands which are
uncrowned<00:02:21.300> steel<00:02:21.920> so<00:02:22.920> it's<00:02:23.040> much<00:02:23.220> better<00:02:23.370> for

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
uncrowned steel so it's much better for

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.060

strong a slightly different feel and you

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.370 
strong a slightly different feel and you
wouldn't<00:02:30.600> even<00:02:30.660> notice<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.140> look<00:02:31.260> is

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
wouldn't even notice the look is
