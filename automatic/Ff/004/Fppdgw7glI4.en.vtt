turn the base down turn the travel up

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:49.340 
turn the base down turn the travel up
you<00:01:38.890> get<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.009> nice<00:01:39.189> Jackie

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.280 

and<00:01:50.010> a<00:01:50.190> let's<00:01:50.400> turn<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.850> voltage<00:01:51.690> sack

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
and a let's turn on the voltage sack

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.230 
and a let's turn on the voltage sack
you'll<00:01:52.500> see<00:01:52.710> as<00:01:52.800> the<00:01:52.890> pedal<00:01:53.159> goes<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.580> that<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
you'll see as the pedal goes on that the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.050 
you'll see as the pedal goes on that the
indicator<00:01:55.200> light<00:01:55.500> on<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.920> overdrive<00:01:56.400> starts

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
indicator light on the overdrive starts

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.510 
indicator light on the overdrive starts
to<00:01:57.210> dim<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:58.080> is<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.410> just<00:01:58.680> regular<00:01:59.100> voltage

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
to dim this is it just regular voltage

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.230 
to dim this is it just regular voltage
and<00:02:00.420> as<00:02:00.600> we<00:02:00.750> turn<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.080> down<00:02:01.970> I'll<00:02:02.970> see<00:02:03.150> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
and as we turn it down I'll see the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.780 
and as we turn it down I'll see the
light<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.690> overdrive<00:02:04.020> get<00:02:04.320> dimmer<00:02:04.790> about

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
light on the overdrive get dimmer about

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.910 
light on the overdrive get dimmer about
halfway<00:02:06.119> down<00:02:06.510> got<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.110> turn<00:02:07.290> up<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.530> game<00:02:07.740> to

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
halfway down got to turn up the game to

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:19.100 
halfway down got to turn up the game to
really<00:02:08.190> get<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.640> benefits<00:02:09.630> of<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:17.870> you<00:02:18.870> turn

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
really get the benefits of this you turn

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.860 
really get the benefits of this you turn
it<00:02:19.260> right<00:02:19.470> down<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.709> get<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.010> lovely

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
it right down and get that lovely

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:55.330 
it right down and get that lovely
crunchy<00:02:21.900> Clippy<00:02:22.500> fuzz<00:02:22.830> effect

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.340 

so<00:02:56.340> just<00:02:56.550> by<00:02:56.700> adding<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.330> voltage<00:02:57.900> sag

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
so just by adding the voltage sag

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.390 
so just by adding the voltage sag
between<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.310> power<00:02:59.700> to<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:01.200> regular<00:03:01.830> overdrive

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
between the power to a regular overdrive

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.180 
between the power to a regular overdrive
pedal<00:03:02.850> just<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.720> note<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.080> usually<00:03:04.560> works<00:03:04.800> best

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
pedal just a note it usually works best

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.160 
pedal just a note it usually works best
on<00:03:05.570> true<00:03:06.570> bypass<00:03:08.210> pedals<00:03:09.210> that<00:03:09.420> don't<00:03:09.780> have

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
on true bypass pedals that don't have

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.980 
on true bypass pedals that don't have
voltage<00:03:10.980> regulators<00:03:11.880> because<00:03:12.120> otherwise<00:03:12.660> as

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
voltage regulators because otherwise as

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.420 
voltage regulators because otherwise as
you<00:03:13.110> turn<00:03:13.320> it<00:03:13.470> down<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.920> will<00:03:14.040> stay<00:03:14.220> at<00:03:14.340> the

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
you turn it down it will stay at the

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.040 
you turn it down it will stay at the
regular<00:03:14.760> power<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.270> then<00:03:15.390> it'll<00:03:15.720> just<00:03:15.750> die

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
regular power and then it'll just die

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.470 
regular power and then it'll just die
you<00:03:16.080> won't<00:03:16.470> get<00:03:16.650> an<00:03:16.770> either<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.700> cool<00:03:17.910> battery

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
you won't get an either the cool battery

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.110 
you won't get an either the cool battery
