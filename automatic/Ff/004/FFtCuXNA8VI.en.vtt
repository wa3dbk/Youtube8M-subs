shiny not it's raining and we're in

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.550 
shiny not it's raining and we're in
Portland<00:00:06.029> actually<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.990> sun's<00:00:07.200> starting<00:00:07.379> to

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
Portland actually the sun's starting to

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.200 
Portland actually the sun's starting to
come<00:00:07.680> out<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.799> little<00:00:07.950> bit<00:00:08.160> we're<00:00:08.910> down<00:00:09.059> in<00:00:09.090> the

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
come out a little bit we're down in the

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.720 
come out a little bit we're down in the
Portland<00:00:09.630> store<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.170> we<00:00:10.769> just<00:00:11.040> were<00:00:11.250> kind<00:00:11.580> of

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
Portland store and we just were kind of

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.370 
Portland store and we just were kind of
doing<00:00:11.880> some<00:00:12.090> filming<00:00:12.300> down<00:00:12.509> here<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.110> said

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
doing some filming down here and I said

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.829 
doing some filming down here and I said
well<00:00:13.500> why<00:00:13.679> don't<00:00:13.740> we<00:00:14.150> since<00:00:15.150> we<00:00:15.269> got<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:15.630> all

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
well why don't we since we got this all

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.620 
well why don't we since we got this all
set<00:00:16.049> up<00:00:16.080> we'll<00:00:16.320> show<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:17.190> two<00:00:17.430> Sylvia's<00:00:18.210> the

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
set up we'll show the two Sylvia's the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.160 
set up we'll show the two Sylvia's the
difference<00:00:18.990> between<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.560> PID<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
difference between the PID and the

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.090 
difference between the PID and the
conventional<00:00:22.170> as<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.619> comes<00:00:22.800> from<00:00:22.920> the

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
conventional as it comes from the

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.080 
conventional as it comes from the
factory<00:00:24.140> as<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.320> can<00:00:25.439> see<00:00:25.619> we<00:00:26.369> put<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.760> PID

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
factory as you can see we put this PID

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.179 
factory as you can see we put this PID
on<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.720> what<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.439> temperature

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
on and what this is is a temperature

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.979 
on and what this is is a temperature

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
control device for the boiler you can

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.110 
control device for the boiler you can
control<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.200> temperature<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.640> boiler

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
control the temperature of the boiler

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.600 
control the temperature of the boiler
within<00:00:37.020> one<00:00:37.230> degree<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.680> whatever<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.250> set

within one degree of whatever you set

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.209 
within one degree of whatever you set
this<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:39.200> also<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.440> machine<00:00:40.829> will<00:00:41.010> do<00:00:41.190> a

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
this for also this machine will do a

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.060 
this for also this machine will do a
timed<00:00:41.989> pre-infusion<00:00:42.989> putting<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> little<00:00:43.980> bit

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
of water on the coffee grounds do a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.920 
of water on the coffee grounds do a
timed<00:00:46.829> wait<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.730> between<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.180> pre<00:00:48.390> infusion

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
timed wait in between the pre infusion

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.479 
timed wait in between the pre infusion
and<00:00:49.079> then<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.770> goes<00:00:49.920> into<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.280> brew<00:00:50.460> and

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
and then it goes into the brew and

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.340 
and then it goes into the brew and
that's<00:00:50.850> time<00:00:51.120> as<00:00:51.300> well<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.840> can<00:00:52.079> control

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
that's time as well so you can control

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.400 
that's time as well so you can control
all<00:00:52.620> those<00:00:52.800> parameters<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.789> machine

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
all those parameters on this machine

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.619 
all those parameters on this machine
pre-infusion<00:00:55.410> wait<00:00:55.890> time<00:00:56.160> brew<00:00:56.820> time<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
pre-infusion wait time brew time and the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.930 
pre-infusion wait time brew time and the
temperature<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> boiler<00:00:58.590> on<00:00:58.940> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
temperature of the boiler on the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.770 
temperature of the boiler on the
conventional<00:01:00.980> silvia<00:01:01.980> from<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.399> factory<00:01:02.879> you

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
conventional silvia from the factory you

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.390 
conventional silvia from the factory you
won't<00:01:04.049> have<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.290> control<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
won't have that control of the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.980 
won't have that control of the
temperature<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.299> have<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> variance

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
temperature so you can have a variance

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.500 
temperature so you can have a variance
of<00:01:07.200> when<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.650> boiler<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.250> cold<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.240> kicks

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
of when the boiler is cold and it kicks

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.170 
of when the boiler is cold and it kicks
in<00:01:09.750> there's<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.170> thermostat<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.460> there<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
in there's a thermostat in there on the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.570 
in there's a thermostat in there on the
boiler<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.830> senses<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.100> boiler<00:01:14.430> has

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
boiler that senses that the boiler has

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.490 
boiler that senses that the boiler has
reached<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:15.090> temperature<00:01:15.630> that's<00:01:15.659> too<00:01:16.259> low

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
reached a temperature that's too low

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.859 
reached a temperature that's too low
maybe<00:01:16.979> 185<00:01:17.850> or<00:01:17.880> something<00:01:18.450> like<00:01:18.570> that

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
maybe 185 or something like that

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.990 
maybe 185 or something like that
an<00:01:19.200> ideal<00:01:19.920> temperature<00:01:20.430> for<00:01:20.460> brewing<00:01:20.909> is

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
an ideal temperature for brewing is

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.990 
an ideal temperature for brewing is
between<00:01:21.390> 195<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.200> 204<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:25.670> you're<00:01:26.670> gonna<00:01:26.790> have

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
between 195 and 204 so you're gonna have

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.840 
between 195 and 204 so you're gonna have
a<00:01:27.030> variance<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.869> when<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.350> kicks<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.829> at<00:01:29.250> 185

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
a variance of when it kicks in at 185

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.179 
a variance of when it kicks in at 185
and<00:01:30.240> it's<00:01:30.390> gonna<00:01:30.479> rise<00:01:30.689> up<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.020> about<00:01:31.200> 211<00:01:31.860> 212

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
and it's gonna rise up to about 211 212

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.069 
and it's gonna rise up to about 211 212
right<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.820> through<00:01:33.030> there<00:01:33.180> you're<00:01:33.659> going<00:01:33.930> from

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
right in through there you're going from

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.920 
right in through there you're going from
too<00:01:34.290> cold<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.950> too<00:01:35.159> hot<00:01:35.369> if<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.299> happen<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.720> hit

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.810 
too cold to too hot if you happen to hit
it<00:01:37.020> right<00:01:37.610> great

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
it right great

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.120 
it right great

here stainless steel casing single
boiler<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.690> you're<00:02:03.900> doing<00:02:04.320> one<00:02:04.560> function<00:02:05.160> at<00:02:05.280> a

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
boiler so you're doing one function at a

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.550 
boiler so you're doing one function at a
time<00:02:05.610> you're<00:02:05.880> either<00:02:06.030> brewing<00:02:06.690> or<00:02:06.900> steaming

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
time you're either brewing or steaming

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.340 
time you're either brewing or steaming
you<00:02:07.950> can't<00:02:08.220> do<00:02:08.400> both<00:02:08.580> at<00:02:08.760> the<00:02:08.850> same<00:02:09.090> time<00:02:09.350> the

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
you can't do both at the same time the

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.380 
you can't do both at the same time the
one<00:02:10.530> with<00:02:10.650> the<00:02:10.740> PID<00:02:11.070> I'm<00:02:11.580> going<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.180> show<00:02:12.330> you

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
one with the PID I'm going to show you

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.110 
one with the PID I'm going to show you
the<00:02:12.630> inside<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.710> can<00:02:13.980> see<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:15.660> wiring<00:02:15.990> and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
the inside so you can see the wiring and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.190 
the inside so you can see the wiring and
just<00:02:18.120> kind<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.390> see<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.630> boiler<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.080> I

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
just kind of see the boiler and I

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.300 
just kind of see the boiler and I
thought<00:02:19.380> well<00:02:19.560> we'll<00:02:19.650> just<00:02:19.710> show<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.190> one

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
thought well we'll just show the one

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.650 
thought well we'll just show the one
with<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.580> PID<00:02:20.850> so<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.210> can<00:02:21.300> see<00:02:21.450> all<00:02:21.570> that

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
with the PID so you can see all that

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.780 
with the PID so you can see all that
wiring<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.230> there<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:24.150> here<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.630> all<00:02:25.790> of

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
wiring in there so here it is all of

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.560 
wiring in there so here it is all of
these<00:02:27.060> connectors<00:02:27.870> here<00:02:28.520> are<00:02:29.520> going<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.390> the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
these connectors here are going to the

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.540 
these connectors here are going to the
thermostats<00:02:31.080> on<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.410> boiler<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.070> so<00:02:32.340> this

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
thermostats on the boiler and so this

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.970 
thermostats on the boiler and so this
has<00:02:32.700> all<00:02:32.970> been<00:02:33.000> wired<00:02:33.450> into<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.990> PID<00:02:34.320> so<00:02:34.710> this

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
has all been wired into the PID so this

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.610 
has all been wired into the PID so this
controls<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.240> thermostats<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.230> boiler

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
controls the thermostats and the boiler

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.420 
controls the thermostats and the boiler
coming<00:02:38.130> on<00:02:38.250> off<00:02:39.260> that<00:02:40.260> one<00:02:40.530> if<00:02:40.800> I<00:02:40.980> opened<00:02:41.340> it

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
coming on off that one if I opened it

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.240 
coming on off that one if I opened it
wouldn't<00:02:41.820> have<00:02:42.060> all<00:02:42.240> this<00:02:42.360> extra<00:02:42.750> wiring<00:02:43.250> so

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
wouldn't have all this extra wiring so

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.380 
wouldn't have all this extra wiring so
that's<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:45.030> brass<00:02:45.240> boiler<00:02:45.720> right<00:02:45.990> here<00:02:47.390> that

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
that's the brass boiler right here that

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.120 
that's the brass boiler right here that
they<00:02:48.510> all<00:02:48.690> come<00:02:48.960> with<00:02:49.020> we<00:02:49.410> don't<00:02:49.530> change<00:02:49.830> that

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
they all come with we don't change that

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.500 
they all come with we don't change that
that<00:02:50.430> remains<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.940> same

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
that remains the same

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.620 
that remains the same
brass<00:02:51.990> boiler<00:02:52.620> steam<00:02:53.460> arm<00:02:53.790> going<00:02:54.060> along<00:02:54.390> right

different<00:03:36.630> knob<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.260> then<00:03:37.800> they<00:03:37.950> made<00:03:38.190> this

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
different knob and then they made this

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.290 
different knob and then they made this
steam<00:03:39.690> arm<00:03:39.989> it<00:03:40.170> used<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.560> just<00:03:40.620> go<00:03:41.090> side<00:03:42.090> to

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
steam arm it used to just go side to

steam arm it used to just go side to
side<00:03:42.540> like<00:03:42.570> that<00:03:43.050> now<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:43.830> goes<00:03:44.040> it

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
side like that now it goes it

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
articulates on a ball valve so that's

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.250 
articulates on a ball valve so that's
the<00:03:47.820> lineup<00:03:48.270> and<00:03:48.510> then<00:03:48.660> you<00:03:48.780> got<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.050> rocky

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
the lineup and then you got the rocky

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260 
the lineup and then you got the rocky
