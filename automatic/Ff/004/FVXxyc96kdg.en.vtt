00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300

were<00:00:51.329> gonna<00:00:51.539> do<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:51.930> because<00:00:52.969> if<00:00:53.969> she<00:00:54.180> has<00:00:54.300> a

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
were gonna do this because if she has a

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.319 
were gonna do this because if she has a
brand-new<00:00:54.809> sculpt<00:00:55.910> body<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.239> everything

brand-new sculpt body and everything

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.750

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
because obviously she's not like his

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.070 
because obviously she's not like his
buff<00:01:00.059> as<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:01.350> cog<00:01:01.710> soldiers<00:01:02.420> so<00:01:03.420> here<00:01:03.870> she<00:01:03.899> is

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
mean she's a smaller figure so her

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.300 
mean she's a smaller figure so her
articulation<00:02:31.440> is<00:02:31.500> going<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.709> be<00:02:31.769> a<00:02:31.799> bit<00:02:32.160> more

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
articulation is going to be a bit more

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.470 
articulation is going to be a bit more
fragile<00:02:32.610> our<00:02:33.030> arms<00:02:33.599> are<00:02:33.750> very<00:02:33.780> flimsy<00:02:34.349> and<00:02:35.480> you

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480

fragile our arms are very flimsy and you
know<00:02:36.599> very<00:02:36.840> there's<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.590> good<00:02:37.709> amount<00:02:37.830> of

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
know very there's a good amount of

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.150 
know very there's a good amount of
articulation<00:02:38.819> very<00:02:39.629> similar<00:02:40.019> to<00:02:40.129> the<00:02:41.129> other

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
articulation very similar to the other

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.600 
articulation very similar to the other
figures<00:02:42.090> in<00:02:42.239> this<00:02:42.360> series<00:02:42.629> but<00:02:43.489> you<00:02:44.489> know

seems<00:03:12.359> to<00:03:12.480> be<00:03:12.569> very<00:03:12.599> fond<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.379> these<00:03:13.590> because

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
seems to be very fond of these because

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.610 
seems to be very fond of these because
the<00:03:14.670> older<00:03:15.090> Assassin's<00:03:15.599> Creed<00:03:15.959> figures<00:03:16.379> had

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.680 
the older Assassin's Creed figures had
these<00:03:16.829> and<00:03:17.099> you<00:03:17.250> would<00:03:17.370> have<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.639> twist<00:03:18.000> the

these and you would have to twist the

these and you would have to twist the

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
ball joint in side here to make the leg

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.990

bigger as you can tell so she does fit

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:47.529 
bigger as you can tell so she does fit
the<00:05:39.960> i<00:05:40.650> guess<00:05:41.490> she<00:05:41.639> fits<00:05:41.849> the<00:05:41.969> size<00:05:43.669> now<00:05:44.669> here's

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:53.540 

Marcus<00:05:49.069> as<00:05:50.069> well<00:05:50.550> this<00:05:51.300> is<00:05:51.830> her<00:05:52.830> counterpart

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
Marcus as well this is her counterpart

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.899 
Marcus as well this is her counterpart
in<00:05:53.789> the<00:05:53.940> series<00:05:54.330> here<00:05:55.189> just<00:05:56.189> fix<00:05:56.430> them<00:05:56.580> up<00:05:56.669> real

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:56.909 
in the series here just fix them up real

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:03.320 
in the series here just fix them up real
quick<00:05:59.060> so<00:06:01.039> so<00:06:02.039> I<00:06:02.430> do<00:06:02.550> think<00:06:02.909> that<00:06:03.029> they<00:06:03.300> have

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
quick so so I do think that they have

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:10.070 
quick so so I do think that they have
shrunken<00:06:04.259> down<00:06:04.319> scale<00:06:05.039> a<00:06:05.250> little<00:06:06.120> bit<00:06:08.750> not<00:06:09.750> by

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
shrunken down scale a little bit not by

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.990 
shrunken down scale a little bit not by
too<00:06:10.139> much<00:06:10.500> and<00:06:10.860> it<00:06:11.250> doesn't<00:06:11.490> really<00:06:11.580> make<00:06:11.789> too

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
too much and it doesn't really make too

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.629 
too much and it doesn't really make too
much<00:06:12.089> of<00:06:12.150> a<00:06:12.330> difference<00:06:12.719> but<00:06:13.430> they<00:06:14.430> have

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
much of a difference but they have

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:21.730 
much of a difference but they have
shrunken<00:06:15.150> down<00:06:15.210> slightly<00:06:15.870> I<00:06:17.750> do<00:06:18.750> think<00:06:19.259> that<00:06:19.379> I

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
shrunken down slightly I do think that I

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.429 
shrunken down slightly I do think that I
do<00:06:22.740> think<00:06:23.039> they're<00:06:23.159> still<00:06:23.370> great<00:06:23.520> figures

00:06:24.429 --> 00:06:24.439 
do think they're still great figures

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:28.279 
do think they're still great figures
Clayton<00:06:25.439> is<00:06:25.500> definitely<00:06:25.979> a<00:06:26.009> lot<00:06:26.189> bigger<00:06:27.289> he's

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.289 
Clayton is definitely a lot bigger he's

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:29.899 
Clayton is definitely a lot bigger he's
actually<00:06:28.500> like<00:06:28.830> one<00:06:28.979> of<00:06:29.009> the<00:06:29.189> biggest<00:06:29.400> in<00:06:29.729> this

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:29.909 
actually like one of the biggest in this

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:33.050 
actually like one of the biggest in this
whole<00:06:30.089> group<00:06:30.330> here<00:06:31.009> so<00:06:32.009> maybe<00:06:32.550> it's<00:06:32.759> just<00:06:32.879> the

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
whole group here so maybe it's just the

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.939 
whole group here so maybe it's just the
size<00:06:33.839> comparison<00:06:34.409> there<00:06:34.500> might<00:06:34.649> be<00:06:34.680> a<00:06:34.800> little

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:34.949 
size comparison there might be a little

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:36.800 
size comparison there might be a little
bit<00:06:35.099> off<00:06:35.219> the<00:06:35.250> scale<00:06:35.669> of<00:06:35.880> the<00:06:36.149> characters<00:06:36.569> but

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
bit off the scale of the characters but

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.230 
bit off the scale of the characters but
