00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
hey guys what is up magic decks over

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.309 
hey guys what is up magic decks over
here<00:00:02.340> with<00:00:02.520> another<00:00:02.790> new<00:00:03.030> video<00:00:03.210> this<00:00:04.110> video

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
here with another new video this video

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.309 
here with another new video this video
is<00:00:04.680> going<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:04.950> be<00:00:05.160> an<00:00:05.279> explanation<00:00:05.670> for<00:00:06.450> the

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
is going to be an explanation for the

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.950 
is going to be an explanation for the
pinkie<00:00:07.740> count<00:00:08.010> which<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.820> one<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.750> most

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
pinkie count which is one of the most

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.690 
pinkie count which is one of the most
essential<00:00:10.580> card<00:00:11.580> slides<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:12.240> my<00:00:12.929> opinion<00:00:13.469> I

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
essential card slides in my opinion I

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.640 
essential card slides in my opinion I
find<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:14.880> so<00:00:15.179> practical<00:00:15.809> as<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:15.990> use<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.440> in

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
find this so practical as I use it in

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.250 
find this so practical as I use it in
most<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.130> my<00:00:17.310> routines<00:00:17.820> so<00:00:18.690> now<00:00:18.810> let's<00:00:19.080> get

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
most of my routines so now let's get

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.220 
most of my routines so now let's get
into<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.890> explanation<00:00:20.640> so<00:00:20.930> guys<00:00:21.930> basically

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
into the explanation so guys basically

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.910 
into the explanation so guys basically
the<00:00:22.769> pink<00:00:23.010> account<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.580> substitute<00:00:24.210> for

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
the pink account is a substitute for

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.679 
the pink account is a substitute for
many<00:00:25.920> methods<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.580> getting<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.180> break<00:00:27.420> under

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
many methods of getting a break under

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.790 
many methods of getting a break under
whatever<00:00:28.320> number<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.949> cards<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.550> want<00:00:30.199> it<00:00:31.199> is

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
whatever number of cards you want it is

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.479 
whatever number of cards you want it is
commonly<00:00:32.189> used<00:00:33.530> what<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.710> commonly<00:00:35.010> used<00:00:35.070> is

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
commonly used what is commonly used is

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.150 
commonly used what is commonly used is
this<00:00:36.000> method<00:00:36.390> which<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.899> push<00:00:37.260> over<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.980> that

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
this method which is a push over to that

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.360 
this method which is a push over to that
a<00:00:38.340> break<00:00:38.670> under<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.030> couple<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.540> cards<00:00:39.840> or

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
a break under a couple of cards or

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.209 
a break under a couple of cards or
riffling<00:00:42.020> just<00:00:43.020> like<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.620> get<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.829> break

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
riffling just like that to get a break

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.630 
riffling just like that to get a break
under<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.360> top<00:00:45.719> two<00:00:45.930> cracks<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:47.190> guys<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
under the top two cracks so guys the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.740 
under the top two cracks so guys the
print<00:00:47.940> account<00:00:48.210> actually<00:00:48.510> looks<00:00:49.289> like<00:00:49.590> this

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
print account actually looks like this

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.930 
print account actually looks like this
done<00:00:51.750> I've<00:00:51.960> got<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.440> break<00:00:52.739> under<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.489> top<00:00:53.699> two

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
done I've got a break under the top two

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.760 
done I've got a break under the top two
types<00:00:54.180> as<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.079> see<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.320> could<00:00:55.500> do<00:00:55.590> it

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
types as you can see you could do it

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.630 
types as you can see you could do it
with<00:00:55.949> only<00:00:56.129> one<00:00:56.280> hand<00:00:56.690> no<00:00:58.340> moves

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
with only one hand no moves

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.599 
with only one hand no moves
no<00:00:59.910> no<00:01:00.300> strange<00:01:00.660> moves<00:01:00.989> done<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.219> will<00:01:02.430> be

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
no no strange moves done so it will be

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.219 
no no strange moves done so it will be
almost<00:01:02.879> 100%<00:01:03.830> invisible<00:01:04.830> for<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.280> spectator

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
almost 100% invisible for the spectator

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.840 
almost 100% invisible for the spectator
so<00:01:07.229> guys<00:01:07.380> let's<00:01:07.650> get<00:01:07.799> into<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.340> mechanics<00:01:08.729> of

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
so guys let's get into the mechanics of

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.450 
so guys let's get into the mechanics of
this<00:01:09.090> move<00:01:09.500> basically<00:01:10.500> you're<00:01:11.010> going<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.250> be

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
this move basically you're going to be

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.280 
this move basically you're going to be
holding<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> deck<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:13.020> a

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
holding the deck just like that in a

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.870 
holding the deck just like that in a
mechanic's<00:01:13.799> grip<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:15.799> the<00:01:16.799> key<00:01:17.189> fingers<00:01:17.580> for

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
mechanic's grip and the key fingers for

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.149 
mechanic's grip and the key fingers for
this<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.390> move<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.049> basically<00:01:19.650> no<00:01:19.830> are

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
this a move is basically no are

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.240 
this a move is basically no are
basically<00:01:20.759> your<00:01:21.090> thumb<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.780> your<00:01:22.200> pinkie<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
basically your thumb and your pinkie the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.460 
basically your thumb and your pinkie the
rest<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> fingers<00:01:24.060> will<00:01:24.360> not<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.869> as<00:01:25.140> much

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
rest of the fingers will not do as much

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.030 
rest of the fingers will not do as much
as<00:01:25.650> both<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.040> these<00:01:26.310> fingers<00:01:26.759> do<00:01:27.470> so<00:01:28.470> guys<00:01:28.650> what

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
as both of these fingers do so guys what

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.010 
as both of these fingers do so guys what
you're<00:01:29.220> going<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.430> do<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:30.150> basically<00:01:30.570> start

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
you're going to do it is basically start

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.050 
you're going to do it is basically start
off<00:01:31.110> by<00:01:31.350> beveling<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.189> deck<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.369> like<00:01:32.790> that

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
off by beveling the deck just like that

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.539 
off by beveling the deck just like that
as<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:33.990> see<00:01:34.170> from<00:01:34.470> here<00:01:34.710> straight<00:01:35.100> to

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
as you can see from here straight to

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.660 
as you can see from here straight to
beveled<00:01:36.180> which<00:01:37.020> means<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.890> edge<00:01:38.070> just

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
beveled which means that the edge just

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.929 
beveled which means that the edge just
like<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.060> tool<00:01:39.299> will<00:01:40.170> be<00:01:40.200> kind<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.950> angle

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
like that tool will be kind of angle

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.910 
like that tool will be kind of angle
just<00:01:42.329> like<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:43.049> help<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.350> riffle<00:01:43.890> down

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
just like that to help you riffle down

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.880 
just like that to help you riffle down
the<00:01:44.880> cards<00:01:45.270> if<00:01:45.420> it's<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.560> will<00:01:46.829> be

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
the cards if it's like this it will be

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.120 
the cards if it's like this it will be
clunky<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:48.060> you'll<00:01:48.990> not<00:01:49.200> get<00:01:49.380> an<00:01:49.560> accurate

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
clunky and you'll not get an accurate

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.219 
clunky and you'll not get an accurate
break<00:01:50.460> under<00:01:50.729> single<00:01:51.659> cards<00:01:51.990> as<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.170> want

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
break under single cards as you want

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.980 
break under single cards as you want
so<00:01:54.130> guys<00:01:54.340> what<00:01:55.119> you're<00:01:55.299> going<00:01:55.479> to<00:01:55.539> do<00:01:55.689> is<00:01:55.840> just

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
so guys what you're going to do is just

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.690 
so guys what you're going to do is just
basically<00:01:56.140> use<00:01:56.680> your<00:01:56.890> pinkie<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.340> go<00:01:57.610> ahead

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
basically use your pinkie to go ahead

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.179 
basically use your pinkie to go ahead
and<00:01:57.969> push<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:59.079> cards<00:01:59.409> just<00:01:59.469> like<00:01:59.710> that<00:02:00.009> when

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
and push the cards just like that when

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:01.319 
and push the cards just like that when
you're<00:02:00.310> starting<00:02:00.670> off<00:02:00.820> you<00:02:01.030> want<00:02:01.180> to

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
you're starting off you want to

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.499 
you're starting off you want to
exaggerate<00:02:02.140> that<00:02:02.350> bubble<00:02:02.740> and<00:02:03.329> you're<00:02:04.329> going

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
exaggerate that bubble and you're going

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.450 
exaggerate that bubble and you're going
to<00:02:04.659> be<00:02:04.810> placing<00:02:05.229> your<00:02:05.380> thumb<00:02:05.439> just<00:02:05.920> like<00:02:06.159> that

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
to be placing your thumb just like that

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.969 
to be placing your thumb just like that
on<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.939> top<00:02:07.149> right<00:02:07.689> I<00:02:07.960> saw<00:02:08.379> it<00:02:08.530> on<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.769> top

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
on the top right I saw it on the top

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.250 
on the top right I saw it on the top
left<00:02:09.399> corner<00:02:09.729> or<00:02:10.599> in<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.780> top<00:02:11.019> right<00:02:11.230> corner

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
left corner or in the top right corner

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.699 
left corner or in the top right corner
if<00:02:11.769> you<00:02:12.040> are<00:02:12.250> left-handed<00:02:12.849> okay<00:02:13.540> so<00:02:14.500> basically

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
if you are left-handed okay so basically

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.040 
if you are left-handed okay so basically
just<00:02:15.190> like<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.880> you're<00:02:16.120> going<00:02:16.269> to<00:02:16.360> riffle<00:02:16.690> I

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
just like that you're going to riffle I

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.009 
just like that you're going to riffle I
saw<00:02:17.560> you're<00:02:17.769> going<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.130> bevel<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.760> cards<00:02:19.090> now

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
saw you're going to bevel the cards now

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.390 
saw you're going to bevel the cards now
what<00:02:20.290> you<00:02:20.410> are<00:02:20.440> going<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.830> do<00:02:20.950> is<00:02:21.190> just

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
what you are going to do is just

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.670 
what you are going to do is just
basically<00:02:21.720> pull<00:02:22.720> down<00:02:22.900> with<00:02:23.110> your<00:02:23.290> pinkie

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
basically pull down with your pinkie

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.770 
basically pull down with your pinkie
down<00:02:23.830> words<00:02:24.129> which<00:02:24.580> will<00:02:24.879> Bend<00:02:25.269> attack<00:02:25.599> as

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
down words which will Bend attack as

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.110 
down words which will Bend attack as
well<00:02:26.140> as<00:02:26.200> placing<00:02:26.890> your<00:02:27.040> thumb<00:02:27.370> just<00:02:27.730> like

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
well as placing your thumb just like

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.900 
well as placing your thumb just like
that<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.590> will<00:02:29.830> create<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.340> lot<00:02:30.700> of

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
that so that will create a lot of

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.990 
that so that will create a lot of
tension<00:02:31.000> as<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:31.900> can<00:02:32.049> see<00:02:32.610> just<00:02:33.610> like<00:02:33.819> that

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
tension as you can see just like that

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.960 
tension as you can see just like that
the<00:02:34.150> cards<00:02:34.450> are<00:02:34.510> bent<00:02:34.900> so<00:02:35.590> what<00:02:35.980> if<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:36.670> actually

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
the cards are bent so what if I actually

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.870 
the cards are bent so what if I actually
start<00:02:37.599> releasing<00:02:38.170> this<00:02:38.680> pressure<00:02:39.040> slow<00:02:39.459> sorry

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
start releasing this pressure slow sorry

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.569 
start releasing this pressure slow sorry
this<00:02:40.120> tension<00:02:40.420> slowly<00:02:41.019> what<00:02:41.980> will<00:02:42.160> happen<00:02:42.430> is

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
this tension slowly what will happen is

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.050 
this tension slowly what will happen is
that<00:02:42.880> top<00:02:43.090> card<00:02:43.390> will<00:02:43.569> simply<00:02:43.930> pop<00:02:44.140> out<00:02:45.060> here

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
that top card will simply pop out here

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.170 
that top card will simply pop out here
then<00:02:46.299> that<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.590> one<00:02:47.980> crack<00:02:48.220> I<00:02:48.400> could<00:02:48.700> go<00:02:48.849> two

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
then that is one crack I could go two

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.410 
then that is one crack I could go two
three<00:02:49.209> four<00:02:50.019> five<00:02:50.410> six<00:02:50.769> seven<00:02:51.190> eight

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
three four five six seven eight

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.390 
three four five six seven eight
I<00:02:52.450> could<00:02:53.019> actually<00:02:53.200> come<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.680> whole<00:02:53.890> deck<00:02:54.160> or

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
I could actually come the whole deck or

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.920 
I could actually come the whole deck or
almost<00:02:54.880> half<00:02:55.209> of<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.540> at<00:02:56.519> quickly<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.780> that's

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
almost half of it at quickly so that's

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.229 
almost half of it at quickly so that's
it<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.560> counting<00:03:00.100> of<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.280> cards<00:03:00.940> will<00:03:01.209> go

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
it the counting of the cards will go

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.770 
it the counting of the cards will go
with<00:03:01.660> your<00:03:01.810> practice<00:03:02.319> you<00:03:02.440> could<00:03:02.620> actually

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
with your practice you could actually

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.479 
with your practice you could actually
practice<00:03:04.780> by<00:03:04.930> doing<00:03:05.170> multiple<00:03:05.769> by<00:03:06.100> getting

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
practice by doing multiple by getting

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.000 
practice by doing multiple by getting
multiple<00:03:07.030> by<00:03:07.690> sorry<00:03:07.900> counting<00:03:08.440> multiple

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
multiple by sorry counting multiple

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.830 
multiple by sorry counting multiple
cards<00:03:09.340> so<00:03:09.910> there's<00:03:10.090> one<00:03:10.299> more<00:03:10.420> time<00:03:10.630> again

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
cards so there's one more time again

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.720 
cards so there's one more time again
you're<00:03:11.290> going<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.590> go<00:03:11.739> ahead<00:03:11.829> and<00:03:12.100> push<00:03:12.549> your

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
you're going to go ahead and push your

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.819 
you're going to go ahead and push your
pinkie<00:03:13.090> just<00:03:13.269> like<00:03:13.450> that<00:03:13.660> to<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.380> side<00:03:14.590> so

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
pinkie just like that to the side so

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.890 
pinkie just like that to the side so
you'll<00:03:14.980> get<00:03:15.100> a<00:03:15.310> bevel<00:03:15.639> in<00:03:15.819> the<00:03:15.910> deck<00:03:16.060> place

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
you'll get a bevel in the deck place

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.930 
you'll get a bevel in the deck place
your<00:03:17.049> thumb<00:03:17.260> just<00:03:17.290> like<00:03:17.560> that<00:03:17.859> and<00:03:18.340> simply<00:03:18.670> use

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
your thumb just like that and simply use

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.569 
your thumb just like that and simply use
your<00:03:19.480> pinkie<00:03:19.959> to<00:03:20.079> go<00:03:20.230> ahead<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.530> pull<00:03:20.829> down

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
your pinkie to go ahead and pull down

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.280 
your pinkie to go ahead and pull down
just<00:03:22.030> like<00:03:22.209> that<00:03:22.420> this<00:03:22.630> will<00:03:22.840> require<00:03:23.170> some

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
just like that this will require some

you're going to go ahead and push
using<00:04:02.319> your<00:04:02.650> pinky<00:04:03.400> just<00:04:03.730> like<00:04:03.909> that<00:04:04.090> which

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
using your pinky just like that which

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.390 
using your pinky just like that which
will<00:04:04.599> bevel<00:04:04.930> the<00:04:05.049> cards<00:04:05.319> place<00:04:05.980> your<00:04:06.159> thumb

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
will bevel the cards place your thumb

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.369 
will bevel the cards place your thumb
right<00:04:06.879> over<00:04:07.090> here<00:04:07.329> on<00:04:07.480> the<00:04:07.569> top<00:04:07.750> left<00:04:07.780> corner

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
right over here on the top left corner

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.170 
right over here on the top left corner
and<00:04:08.530> what<00:04:09.400> you're<00:04:09.549> going<00:04:09.700> to<00:04:09.790> do<00:04:09.969> it<00:04:10.150> just

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
and what you're going to do it just

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.479 
and what you're going to do it just
basically<00:04:10.480> apply<00:04:11.109> pressure<00:04:11.439> band<00:04:12.219> attack

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
basically apply pressure band attack

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.940 
basically apply pressure band attack
just<00:04:13.000> like<00:04:13.180> that<00:04:13.359> create<00:04:13.750> tension<00:04:14.260> and<00:04:14.709> going

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
just like that create tension and going

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.569 
just like that create tension and going
to<00:04:15.099> slowly<00:04:15.459> slide<00:04:16.060> your<00:04:16.600> pinky<00:04:17.350> down<00:04:17.579> the

again<00:04:47.610> with<00:04:48.610> all<00:04:48.789> the<00:04:48.880> cards

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
again with all the cards

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.800 
again with all the cards
normally<00:04:50.070> double<00:04:51.070> them<00:04:51.389> placed<00:04:52.389> your<00:04:52.750> hand

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810

just like that apply pressure create

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.820 
just like that apply pressure create
tension<00:04:55.650> riffle

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
tension riffle

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.260 
tension riffle
one<00:04:57.180> two<00:04:58.180> and<00:04:58.419> that<00:04:58.990> is<00:04:59.199> it<00:04:59.699> actually<00:05:00.699> by<00:05:00.970> time

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
one two and that is it actually by time

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.570 
one two and that is it actually by time
the<00:05:02.050> bevel<00:05:02.500> will<00:05:02.740> go<00:05:02.979> ahead<00:05:03.039> and<00:05:03.400> decrease

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
the bevel will go ahead and decrease

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.510 
the bevel will go ahead and decrease
you'll<00:05:04.479> go<00:05:05.080> in<00:05:05.229> full<00:05:05.500> from<00:05:05.740> this<00:05:05.979> to<00:05:06.280> this<00:05:06.460> to

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
you'll go in full from this to this to

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.909 
you'll go in full from this to this to
this<00:05:06.909> to<00:05:06.970> this<00:05:07.210> and<00:05:07.599> almost<00:05:08.139> the<00:05:08.380> deck<00:05:08.680> will

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
this to this and almost the deck will

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.540 
this to this and almost the deck will
look<00:05:09.190> completely<00:05:09.639> straight<00:05:10.150> and<00:05:11.039> the<00:05:12.039> gap<00:05:12.310> of

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
look completely straight and the gap of

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.550 
look completely straight and the gap of
the<00:05:12.760> card<00:05:13.030> I<00:05:13.210> think<00:05:13.419> when<00:05:13.570> I<00:05:13.599> started<00:05:13.690> off<00:05:14.139> the

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
the card I think when I started off the

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.890 
the card I think when I started off the
cards<00:05:14.889> really<00:05:15.159> popped<00:05:15.580> out<00:05:15.880> a<00:05:16.120> lot<00:05:16.360> because<00:05:16.539> I

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
cards really popped out a lot because I

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.140 
cards really popped out a lot because I
really<00:05:17.440> really<00:05:17.470> applied<00:05:18.099> a<00:05:18.280> lot<00:05:18.639> of<00:05:18.699> tension

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
really really applied a lot of tension

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.409 
really really applied a lot of tension
and<00:05:19.479> that<00:05:20.169> is<00:05:20.349> great<00:05:20.740> so<00:05:21.370> it<00:05:21.580> was<00:05:21.820> a<00:05:22.060> little<00:05:22.330> bit

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
and that is great so it was a little bit

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.899 
and that is great so it was a little bit
of<00:05:22.599> like<00:05:22.930> pinky<00:05:23.409> practice<00:05:23.830> and<00:05:24.039> this<00:05:24.610> allowed

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909 
of like pinky practice and this allowed

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:28.050 
of like pinky practice and this allowed
me<00:05:25.060> to<00:05:25.090> take<00:05:25.389> control<00:05:25.720> of<00:05:26.310> the<00:05:27.310> deck<00:05:27.490> when<00:05:27.820> I

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
me to take control of the deck when I

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.189 
me to take control of the deck when I
applied<00:05:28.570> lower<00:05:29.820> less<00:05:30.820> tension<00:05:31.120> sorry<00:05:31.539> so

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 
applied lower less tension sorry so

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:36.330 
applied lower less tension sorry so
you're<00:05:32.590> going<00:05:32.770> to<00:05:32.919> go<00:05:33.099> from<00:05:33.400> this<00:05:34.180> pop<00:05:34.770> to<00:05:35.770> this

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
you're going to go from this pop to this

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.270 
you're going to go from this pop to this
one<00:05:37.139> which<00:05:38.139> will<00:05:38.349> be<00:05:38.380> very<00:05:38.889> small

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
one which will be very small

will make most out sorry I almost every

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.280 
will make most out sorry I almost every
cartridge<00:06:07.570> that<00:06:07.840> requires<00:06:08.259> using<00:06:08.710> breaks
