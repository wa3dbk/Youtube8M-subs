00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.360
 and we are now in the couple's suite 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.699
 You have to have a very 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.060
 cozy because it's where you sleep a 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.910
 Relaxation moment, then cool is 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.029
 you always wear neutral tones on the wall 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.230
 so he has a little dog that pulls to 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.019
 the ivory 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.329
 the colors are punctual so I used the 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.850
 color on the head of the bed I put a 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.290
 wallpaper on the headboard then you 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.200
 has a wallpaper in a shade of blue 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.570
 which is a neutral color that you're you 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.510
 You can always change your outfit ever 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.730
 will compromise your trousseau and furthermore 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.430
 It's a role that you take and place. 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.800
 you can do it yourself then you 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.260
 may want to change the color of the room you 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.699
 change the bedding yourself 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.920
 after a while on the wallpaper 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.890
 for two people to use this room 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.439
 In the same cool way you give a corner 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.930
 the face on each side so the face 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.630
 of the woman she likes what you like 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.130
 You sleep well , have a cup of tea. 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.890
 She likes a flower so you can 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.390
 identify your side you have a 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.590
 lamp and thence 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.750
 at bedtime which is to have a 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.890
 reading another wants to sleep you light the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.290
 your lamp 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.060
 on the other side the same thing man can 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.860
 identify in its own way 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.659
 You have the priests and you can bring the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.119
 picture of your family then you have 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.490
 your children you can put moments 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.770
 travel times that are important 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.390
 for you a cool way you can 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.329
 have a screen that you can always be 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.640
 changing the photo to practice monic 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.890
 need a space where you almost 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.710
 a panel then my idea was this 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.780
 to create a cabinet that had the function of 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.450
 cabinet but with a panel face then 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.280
 that I did I looked for a cabinet that 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.509
 had an opening in touch 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.240
 This is really cool because you do not 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.579
 need a nice handle on the tv 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.920
 which was also a point that I had to 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.020
 put this tv inside to leave mauro 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.030
 so I centralized it divided into panels 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.860
 equal sluices I took the central shaft 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.319
 I made a built-in TV and tried to 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.630
 panel for you to bring this tv to 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.600
 in front of her 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.910
 come on the side she does not see her out 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.680
 of the closet and there I created the niches for 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.330
 you put device dvd 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.010
 the couple's suite I think is one of the 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.620
 main house environments 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.780
 because it is a place of relaxation of 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.720
 Tranquility is a place of much 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.840
 very warm affection so he has 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.530
 You pass that one like it there is more 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.530
 so watch
