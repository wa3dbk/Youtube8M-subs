00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.940
 I would have already welcomed this shove writer Hans and schools that very much 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.900
 focuses on the personal belongings of the student I have 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.609
 chosen for this training is requested 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:14.099
 just now that it stays that way 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.119
 problem was here and then people solve it 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.039
 in the first year 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:19.550
 at wil jennefer 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.820
 cleared before time 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.249
 be the teacher at this school 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:25.319
 bert heyvaert 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:26.470
 also a bit crazy 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.550
 in the nice cozy are mh 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.550
 very much 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.800
 they don't know they are going to be people people 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.230
 considering my age and 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.380
 anp six teams 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.280
 I expect that iPad is over twenty 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.570
 to be with to learn 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.000
 no one dares to give it is a very large schools are exloo 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.960
 students in Alkmaar I have the impression that students still feel at home 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.790
 to request personal attention 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.630
 a major theme in yesterday's study career guidance 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.099
 according to personal development, the focus is on that 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.230
 and ends in 0 0 equal to him next to a small group 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.040
 that makes the biggest secret a safe atmosphere can be made I have 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.920
 about that 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.920
 However, that is the chance that the soap will yield to the taste 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.560
 say to get rid of that uncertainty and go away 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.759
 this also has to be in the shoes 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.649
 at a quarter of the startup phase there were even after the circumstances occurred 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:41.570
 difficult to respond 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.539
 dominant lifestyle of very many students of the school 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.430
 to do 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.430
 the eleven-year-old six-day internship 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.820
 to keep the students as much as possible 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.840
 we try to get everything 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.860
 as far as they themselves are in control 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.860
 I need your own plantation company for three years 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.270
 9 with to stand still 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.610
 what does a student need? 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.089
 the good intentions 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:13.429
 because your internship is going to be better with contacts in the series other than 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:16.499
 psv i find fc twente 3 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:20.289
 But it won't get the US indexed so busy 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.659
 I myself am not so much about members but remain stuck but action 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:30.320
 we went to youth center 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.310
 Relatives are for the youth when I move in hence I have a conversation 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.160
 with the on 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.279
 initially with st 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:39.959
 keep talking about it for a while and help if necessary 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.489
 besides the fact that he is very large so that young people work to get started it is possible 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.089
 he also broaden it 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:46.709
 diverse creativity 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:47.700
 a newspaper 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.749
 I already have one myself 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:50.579
 the project prepared 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.569
 and it was just like in May last year that something was wrong and not wrong 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.569
 just tell one thing in advance what you shouldn't do 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:00.879
 my training 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.309
 I have chosen myself once 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:06.039
 a good basis for a year at 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:09.099
 and that my goal comes to the end to the graduates 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:10.629
 a very good basis 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.039
 and the old one was once said to me 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:16.039
 granddaughter is one within two years 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:19.899
 that typifies the students a bit 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:23.499
 powerful personality 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:24.159
 to be stronger
