firmware as you can see by the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.930 
firmware as you can see by the
background<00:00:32.369> there<00:00:33.320> general<00:00:34.320> about<00:00:34.940> don't

know<00:00:36.059> if<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.239> can<00:00:36.329> see<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.890> but<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.160> does<00:00:38.399> say

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
know if you can see that but it does say

four<00:00:39.809> point<00:00:40.140> oh<00:00:40.320> eight<00:00:40.790> a<00:00:42.559> 230<00:00:43.559> m<00:00:45.050> so<00:00:46.050> i<00:00:46.079> guess

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
four point oh eight a 230 m so i guess

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.479 
four point oh eight a 230 m so i guess
you<00:00:46.620> could<00:00:46.739> kind<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.070> not<00:00:47.730> make<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.059> out<00:00:48.210> but

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
you could kind of not make that out but

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.189 
you could kind of not make that out but
alright<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.539> running<00:00:51.780> for<00:00:51.930> photo

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
alright so this is running for photo

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.600 
alright so this is running for photo
firmware<00:00:53.300> this<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.480> not<00:00:54.690> packed<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:56.340> reason

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
firmware this is not packed the reason

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.959 
firmware this is not packed the reason
why<00:00:56.699> there's<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.969> user<00:00:57.149> wallpaper<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:58.050> because

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
why there's a user wallpaper is because

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.250 
why there's a user wallpaper is because
it<00:00:59.969> was<00:01:00.180> hacked<00:01:00.390> before<00:01:00.780> but<00:01:00.989> then<00:01:01.109> i<00:01:01.199> just

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
it was hacked before but then i just

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.560 
it was hacked before but then i just
restored<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.309> put<00:01:02.550> all<00:01:02.579> my<00:01:02.670> apps<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.359> stuff

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
restored and put all my apps and stuff

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.320 
restored and put all my apps and stuff
on<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.369> if<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.729> restore<00:01:06.030> from<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.299> backup

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
on it and if you restore from a backup

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.859 
on it and if you restore from a backup
it<00:01:06.869> takes<00:01:07.290> here<00:01:09.560> takes<00:01:10.560> your<00:01:10.830> itouch<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.180> it

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
it takes here takes your itouch and it

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.679 
it takes here takes your itouch and it
allows<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.350> wallpaper<00:01:13.890> without<00:01:14.420> having<00:01:15.420> to

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
allows the wallpaper without having to

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.590 
allows the wallpaper without having to
change<00:01:16.680> any<00:01:16.860> strings<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> beginning<00:01:17.880> so

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
device turned off in order for this to

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:36.920 
device turned off in order for this to
work<00:02:24.210> so<00:02:24.650> let's<00:02:25.650> just<00:02:25.920> turn<00:02:26.370> off<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.640> device

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.000 

alright<00:02:37.930> so<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.200> device<00:02:38.470> is<00:02:38.650> turning<00:02:38.890> off

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
alright so the device is turning off

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.309 
alright so the device is turning off
right<00:02:39.250> now<00:02:39.459> and<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:41.620> device<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.250> turned<00:02:42.610> off

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
right now and the device is turned off

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.339 
right now and the device is turned off
so<00:02:44.319> right<00:02:44.500> now<00:02:44.530> we're<00:02:45.220> going<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:46.049> use<00:02:47.049> this

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
so right now we're going to use this

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.199 
so right now we're going to use this
application<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:49.890> hone<00:02:50.890> our<00:02:51.190> device<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:52.000> what

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
application to hone our device and what

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.589 
application to hone our device and what
it<00:02:52.299> does<00:02:52.450> is<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:52.750> takes<00:02:53.049> an<00:02:53.290> exploit<00:02:53.769> and<00:02:54.599> it

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
it does is it takes an exploit and it

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.869 
it does is it takes an exploit and it
judge<00:02:56.260> injects<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.160> into<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.720> device<00:02:58.720> so<00:02:59.879> how

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
judge injects it into the device so how

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.619 
judge injects it into the device so how
any<00:03:01.150> further<00:03:01.480> ado<00:03:01.660> we<00:03:02.379> are<00:03:02.560> going<00:03:02.829> to<00:03:03.010> press

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
any further ado we are going to press

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.710 
any further ado we are going to press
the<00:03:04.629> poem<00:03:04.900> button<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:06.090> let's<00:03:07.090> get<00:03:07.239> this<00:03:07.299> show

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
the poem button and let's get this show

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.559 
the poem button and let's get this show
started<00:03:07.780> so<00:03:08.650> nothing<00:03:09.430> really<00:03:09.610> happens<00:03:09.940> but<00:03:10.360> if

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
started so nothing really happens but if

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.440 
started so nothing really happens but if
you<00:03:10.599> look<00:03:10.780> at<00:03:10.930> our<00:03:10.989> touch<00:03:11.849> it<00:03:12.849> has<00:03:13.030> a<00:03:13.060> white

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
you look at our touch it has a white

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.780 
you look at our touch it has a white
screen<00:03:15.299> and<00:03:16.299> it<00:03:16.420> looks<00:03:16.569> like<00:03:16.660> it's<00:03:16.750> doing<00:03:17.019> sing

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
downloading jailbreak data at this point

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:22.740 
downloading jailbreak data at this point
in<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.760> application<00:03:22.299> we<00:03:22.450> would<00:03:22.569> have<00:03:22.720> a

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
in the application we would have a

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.349 
in the application we would have a
little<00:03:22.989> popup<00:03:23.200> message<00:03:23.530> saying<00:03:24.329> thanks<00:03:25.329> for

jailbreaking<00:03:33.280> our<00:03:33.579> ipod<00:03:34.060> touch<00:03:34.769> it<00:03:35.769> is<00:03:35.950> still

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
jailbreaking our ipod touch it is still

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:46.920 
jailbreaking our ipod touch it is still
a<00:03:37.200> second<00:03:38.200> generation<00:03:40.380> making<00:03:41.380> all<00:03:41.530> clear<00:03:45.930> so

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
a second generation making all clear so

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:54.490 
a second generation making all clear so
let's<00:03:47.109> just<00:03:47.349> let<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:47.530> do<00:03:47.709> its<00:03:47.859> thing

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.190 

and<00:03:55.070> I<00:03:55.190> would<00:03:55.340> cut<00:03:55.550> to<00:03:55.730> it<00:03:55.760> but<00:03:56.600> since<00:03:56.870> this<00:03:57.020> is

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
and I would cut to it but since this is

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.290 
and I would cut to it but since this is
a<00:03:57.640> kind<00:03:58.640> of<00:03:58.760> a<00:03:58.850> proof<00:03:59.150> video<00:04:00.100> will<00:04:01.100> let<00:04:02.090> it<00:04:02.210> do

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
a kind of a proof video will let it do

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.840 
a kind of a proof video will let it do
its<00:04:02.420> thing

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.240 

just<00:04:09.420> remember<00:04:09.750> this<00:04:09.870> is<00:04:10.050> beta<00:04:10.500> software<00:04:10.770> so

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
just remember this is beta software so

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.240 
just remember this is beta software so
if<00:04:11.340> it<00:04:11.430> doesn't<00:04:11.730> work<00:04:11.850> this<00:04:12.060> time<00:04:16.130> that<00:04:17.130> would

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
if it doesn't work this time that would

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:58.420 
if it doesn't work this time that would
suck<00:04:17.459> but<00:04:17.910> happen<00:04:18.540> a<00:04:18.600> lot<00:04:18.750> so

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.270 

all<00:04:58.940> right<00:04:59.170> now<00:05:00.170> it<00:05:00.410> shows<00:05:00.680> the<00:05:00.920> running

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
all right now it shows the running

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.050 
all right now it shows the running
pineapple<00:05:01.820> and<00:05:02.030> it<00:05:02.930> is<00:05:03.050> flashing<00:05:03.470> our<00:05:04.190> NR

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
pineapple and it is flashing our NR

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:40.390 
pineapple and it is flashing our NR
right<00:05:05.660> now<00:05:06.280> let's<00:05:07.280> just<00:05:07.550> let<00:05:07.850> it<00:05:07.970> do<00:05:08.180> that

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.330 

once<00:05:41.240> again<00:05:41.540> it<00:05:41.780> is<00:05:41.960> rebooting<00:05:42.410> this<00:05:43.040> is<00:05:43.190> an

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
once again it is rebooting this is an

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.490 
once again it is rebooting this is an
untethered<00:05:43.910> jailbreak<00:05:45.190> so<00:05:47.139> since<00:05:48.139> this<00:05:48.259> is<00:05:48.380> an

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
untethered jailbreak so since this is an

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.370 
untethered jailbreak so since this is an
ipod<00:05:48.860> touch<00:05:49.100> 2nd<00:05:49.550> generation<00:05:50.110> hasn't<00:05:51.110> been

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:11.580 

looks<00:06:02.840> like<00:06:03.020> it's<00:06:03.169> still<00:06:03.350> booting<00:06:03.680> up
