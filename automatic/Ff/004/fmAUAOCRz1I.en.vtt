00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
at are the EF 42 and the EF X 20 now the

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.740 
at are the EF 42 and the EF X 20 now the
X<00:00:17.740> 20<00:00:18.160> was<00:00:18.340> brought<00:00:18.610> out<00:00:18.640> specifically<00:00:19.390> for

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
X 20 was brought out specifically for

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.950 
X 20 was brought out specifically for
the<00:00:19.930> X<00:00:20.080> Pro<00:00:20.350> 1<00:00:20.650> and<00:00:20.920> it's<00:00:21.610> smaller<00:00:22.000> and<00:00:22.180> it's<00:00:22.780> in

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
the X Pro 1 and it's smaller and it's in

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.140 
the X Pro 1 and it's smaller and it's in
line<00:00:23.320> with<00:00:23.350> that<00:00:23.740> kind<00:00:23.980> of<00:00:24.040> rangefinder<00:00:24.790> style

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
line with that kind of rangefinder style

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.510 
line with that kind of rangefinder style
of<00:00:25.420> camera<00:00:25.870> and<00:00:26.050> style<00:00:26.770> of<00:00:26.920> features<00:00:27.310> and

42 has a guide number of 42 surprisingly
which<00:00:47.260> is<00:00:47.920> not<00:00:48.609> hugely<00:00:49.059> powerful<00:00:49.359> but<00:00:49.839> for<00:00:50.170> its

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:50.409 
which is not hugely powerful but for its

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:52.979 
which is not hugely powerful but for its
price<00:00:50.800> point<00:00:50.829> in<00:00:51.249> the<00:00:51.339> market<00:00:51.789> it's<00:00:52.569> not<00:00:52.690> too

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
price point in the market it's not too

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.809 
price point in the market it's not too
bad<00:00:53.260> this<00:00:53.859> one<00:00:54.039> comes<00:00:54.280> with<00:00:54.429> a<00:00:54.460> big<00:00:54.640> old

now<00:00:58.809> this<00:00:59.170> is<00:00:59.969> for<00:01:00.969> this<00:01:01.300> kind<00:01:01.600> of<00:01:01.690> a<00:01:01.780> flash

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
now this is for this kind of a flash

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.530 
now this is for this kind of a flash
it's<00:01:02.409> reasonably<00:01:03.159> small<00:01:03.879> it's<00:01:04.210> about<00:01:04.239> the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
it's reasonably small it's about the

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.860 
it's reasonably small it's about the
size<00:01:04.750> of<00:01:04.930> an<00:01:05.050> SB<00:01:05.440> 700<00:01:06.220> I'd<00:01:06.340> say<00:01:06.610> and<00:01:06.880> a<00:01:07.510> very

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
size of an SB 700 I'd say and a very

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.230 
size of an SB 700 I'd say and a very
very<00:01:08.110> basic<00:01:08.320> interface<00:01:09.010> on<00:01:09.250> the<00:01:09.370> back<00:01:09.610> it

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
very basic interface on the back it

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.270 
very basic interface on the back it
takes<00:01:10.570> four<00:01:10.930> double<00:01:11.350> A<00:01:11.439> batteries<00:01:11.469> we'll<00:01:12.130> give

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
takes four double A batteries we'll give

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.899 
takes four double A batteries we'll give
you<00:01:12.369> a<00:01:12.399> close-up<00:01:12.670> on<00:01:13.000> that<00:01:13.180> one<00:01:14.460> okay<00:01:15.460> so<00:01:15.520> the

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
you a close-up on that one okay so the

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.580 
you a close-up on that one okay so the
EF<00:01:16.270> 42<00:01:17.189> has<00:01:18.189> a<00:01:18.219> guide<00:01:18.490> number<00:01:18.729> as<00:01:19.030> I<00:01:19.060> say<00:01:19.390> old<00:01:19.689> 42

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
EF 42 has a guide number as I say old 42

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.010 
EF 42 has a guide number as I say old 42
it<00:01:21.130> does<00:01:21.369> full<00:01:21.640> TTL

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
it does full TTL

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.260 
it does full TTL
it's<00:01:23.320> got<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.680> bounce<00:01:23.860> head<00:01:24.280> it's<00:01:24.610> got<00:01:24.880> the

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
it's got the bounce head it's got the

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.840 
it's got the bounce head it's got the
built-in<00:01:25.479> diffuser<00:01:26.170> card<00:01:26.560> in<00:01:26.770> there<00:01:27.009> and<00:01:27.219> the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
built-in diffuser card in there and the

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.529 
built-in diffuser card in there and the
head<00:01:28.060> will<00:01:28.270> rotate<00:01:28.920> 300<00:01:29.920> degrees<00:01:30.280> in<00:01:30.610> total<00:01:31.060> so

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
head will rotate 300 degrees in total so

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.020 
head will rotate 300 degrees in total so
that's<00:01:31.750> quite<00:01:32.020> good<00:01:32.049> just<00:01:32.619> past<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.670> side

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
that's quite good just past the side

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.319 
that's quite good just past the side
direction<00:01:34.600> in<00:01:34.750> that<00:01:34.899> angle<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:36.340> is<00:01:36.640> a<00:01:36.670> plastic

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
direction in that angle it is a plastic

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:38.039 
direction in that angle it is a plastic
construction

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
construction

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.789 
construction
it<00:01:38.259> doesn't<00:01:38.680> feel<00:01:38.859> super<00:01:39.520> strong<00:01:40.590> but<00:01:41.590> it

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
it doesn't feel super strong but it

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.590 
it doesn't feel super strong but it
feels<00:01:42.039> like<00:01:42.189> about<00:01:42.609> the<00:01:42.759> same<00:01:43.000> as<00:01:43.299> something

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
feels like about the same as something

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.560 
feels like about the same as something
like<00:01:43.869> an<00:01:44.229> SB<00:01:44.799> 700<00:01:45.609> so<00:01:46.030> it<00:01:46.119> doesn't<00:01:46.390> feel

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
like an SB 700 so it doesn't feel

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.440 
like an SB 700 so it doesn't feel
exactly<00:01:47.170> flimsy<00:01:47.950> just<00:01:48.549> comparing<00:01:49.030> it<00:01:49.180> to<00:01:49.240> the

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
exactly flimsy just comparing it to the

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.330 
exactly flimsy just comparing it to the
X<00:01:49.659> 20<00:01:50.109> and<00:01:50.289> there's<00:01:50.439> a<00:01:50.530> noticeable<00:01:50.979> difference

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
X 20 and there's a noticeable difference

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.880 
X 20 and there's a noticeable difference
and<00:01:52.299> also<00:01:52.570> takes<00:01:52.960> four<00:01:53.409> double<00:01:53.740> A<00:01:53.859> batteries

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
and also takes four double A batteries

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.399 
and also takes four double A batteries
which<00:01:54.520> is<00:01:54.670> quite<00:01:54.969> standard<00:01:55.359> but<00:01:56.049> they're<00:01:56.200> in<00:01:56.320> a

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
which is quite standard but they're in a

which is quite standard but they're in a
little<00:01:56.530> bit<00:01:56.740> of<00:01:56.829> an<00:01:56.920> unusual<00:01:57.219> configuration<00:01:58.439> 3

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
little bit of an unusual configuration 3

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.080 
little bit of an unusual configuration 3

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
all of those kind of options it is still

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.210 
all of those kind of options it is still
full<00:03:52.269> TTL<00:03:53.049> and<00:03:53.229> it's<00:03:53.769> going<00:03:53.949> to<00:03:54.009> work

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
full TTL and it's going to work

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.849 
full TTL and it's going to work

thing<00:03:57.069> I'm<00:03:57.189> not<00:03:57.430> a<00:03:57.459> huge<00:03:57.759> fan<00:03:57.790> of<00:03:58.090> though<00:03:58.509> this

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
thing I'm not a huge fan of though this

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.619 
thing I'm not a huge fan of though this
one<00:03:59.229> actually<00:03:59.590> uses<00:03:59.829> triple-a<00:04:00.790> batteries<00:04:01.359> not

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
one actually uses triple-a batteries not

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.199 
one actually uses triple-a batteries not
doublea's<00:04:02.199> so<00:04:02.859> it<00:04:02.979> only<00:04:03.099> takes<00:04:03.400> two<00:04:03.790> triple

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
doublea's so it only takes two triple

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.569 
doublea's so it only takes two triple
a's<00:04:04.359> but<00:04:05.079> still<00:04:05.379> for<00:04:05.680> me<00:04:05.829> that's<00:04:06.069> a<00:04:06.220> little<00:04:06.459> bit

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
a's but still for me that's a little bit

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.569 
a's but still for me that's a little bit
of<00:04:06.669> a<00:04:06.759> pain<00:04:07.030> because<00:04:07.629> I<00:04:08.199> travel<00:04:09.040> with<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.340> lot<00:04:09.549> of

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
of a pain because I travel with a lot of

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.149 
of a pain because I travel with a lot of
devices<00:04:09.939> that<00:04:10.180> use<00:04:10.479> double<00:04:10.930> A's<00:04:11.079> and<00:04:11.379> I<00:04:11.919> have

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.770 
you know a big stash of them and a good
charger<00:04:14.949> for<00:04:15.129> them<00:04:15.340> but<00:04:16.060> I<00:04:16.090> don't<00:04:16.449> carry

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780

triple<00:04:17.229> A's<00:04:17.380> ordinarily<00:04:17.859> so<00:04:18.190> for<00:04:18.400> this<00:04:18.489> trip

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:18.759

non-rechargeable you know the

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.540 
non-rechargeable you know the
top-of-the-line<00:04:22.960> lithium-ion<00:04:23.800> triple<00:04:24.400> A's

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
top-of-the-line lithium-ion triple A's

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.180 
top-of-the-line lithium-ion triple A's
so<00:04:24.940> we<00:04:25.060> can<00:04:25.240> use<00:04:25.449> those<00:04:25.659> ones<00:04:26.099> something<00:04:27.099> I

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
so we can use those ones something I

so we can use those ones something I
really<00:04:27.520> appreciate<00:04:28.150> about<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.570> case<00:04:28.779> on<00:04:29.080> this

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
really appreciate about the case on this

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.080 
really appreciate about the case on this
one<00:04:29.500> opening<00:04:29.950> it<00:04:30.039> up<00:04:30.130> to<00:04:30.190> take<00:04:30.460> a<00:04:30.490> look<00:04:30.580> inside

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
one opening it up to take a look inside

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.200 
one opening it up to take a look inside
you<00:04:31.330> can<00:04:31.360> see<00:04:31.659> it<00:04:32.050> does<00:04:32.349> have<00:04:32.620> room<00:04:32.860> in<00:04:33.010> the

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
you can see it does have room in the

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.090 
you can see it does have room in the
if<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.479> little<00:04:33.660> foot<00:04:33.990> as<00:04:34.169> well<00:04:34.470> as<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.800> flash

little<00:05:32.099> bit<00:05:32.310> ridiculous<00:05:32.789> and<00:05:33.349> seeing<00:05:34.349> them

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
little bit ridiculous and seeing them

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.800 
little bit ridiculous and seeing them
like<00:05:34.710> this<00:05:34.919> you<00:05:35.460> can<00:05:35.699> really<00:05:36.030> notice<00:05:36.240> a<00:05:36.449> big

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
like this you can really notice a big

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.450 
like this you can really notice a big
difference<00:05:36.840> in<00:05:37.349> build<00:05:37.560> quality<00:05:38.009> between<00:05:38.220> the

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
difference in build quality between the

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.820 
difference in build quality between the
flash<00:05:38.849> and<00:05:39.210> the<00:05:39.240> body<00:05:39.539> which<00:05:40.080> is<00:05:40.289> an<00:05:40.409> apparent

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
flash and the body which is an apparent

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.249 
flash and the body which is an apparent
when<00:05:40.949> you're<00:05:41.099> using<00:05:41.310> this<00:05:41.610> one<00:05:41.880> not<00:05:42.840> a<00:05:42.870> huge

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
when you're using this one not a huge

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.710 
when you're using this one not a huge
deal<00:05:43.759> considering<00:05:44.759> this<00:05:45.000> one<00:05:45.210> has<00:05:45.449> less

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
deal considering this one has less

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.320 
deal considering this one has less
features<00:05:45.990> and<00:05:46.530> cost<00:05:46.919> more<00:05:47.190> it<00:05:47.460> may<00:05:47.940> seem<00:05:48.300> like

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
features and cost more it may seem like

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.620 
features and cost more it may seem like
a<00:05:48.690> an<00:05:49.229> unbalanced<00:05:50.190> equation<00:05:50.280> here<00:05:50.969> but<00:05:51.479> to<00:05:51.599> me

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
a an unbalanced equation here but to me

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.659 
a an unbalanced equation here but to me
it's<00:05:51.870> a<00:05:51.960> little<00:05:52.169> bit<00:05:52.289> like<00:05:52.500> I<00:05:52.889> don't<00:05:53.280> know

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
it's a little bit like I don't know

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.159

swivel<00:06:32.969> head<00:06:33.060> is<00:06:33.210> great<00:06:33.509> I<00:06:33.539> really<00:06:33.690> plan<00:06:34.199> on

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
swivel head is great I really plan on

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:36.110 
swivel head is great I really plan on
using<00:06:34.530> this<00:06:34.740> outdoors<00:06:35.219> so<00:06:35.520> the<00:06:35.699> swivel<00:06:36.030> head

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
using this outdoors so the swivel head

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.909 
using this outdoors so the swivel head
is<00:06:36.270> much<00:06:36.659> less<00:06:36.990> of<00:06:37.139> a<00:06:37.229> feature<00:06:37.469> when<00:06:37.800> you're

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
is much less of a feature when you're

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:40.700 
is much less of a feature when you're
outdoors<00:06:38.070> and<00:06:38.780> the<00:06:39.780> fact<00:06:40.020> that<00:06:40.110> this<00:06:40.259> one<00:06:40.469> can

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
outdoors and the fact that this one can

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.860 
outdoors and the fact that this one can
be<00:06:40.889> used<00:06:41.130> as<00:06:41.400> a<00:06:41.430> remote<00:06:41.760> slave<00:06:42.060> I<00:06:42.419> really<00:06:42.659> like

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
be used as a remote slave I really like

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.839 
be used as a remote slave I really like
that<00:06:43.050> because<00:06:43.409> when<00:06:43.560> I'm<00:06:43.680> shooting<00:06:44.099> say<00:06:44.610> some

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:44.849

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:06.970 
to be the way to go so yeah two

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.330 
to be the way to go so yeah two
reasonable<00:07:07.720> options<00:07:08.139> they're<00:07:08.410> both<00:07:08.590> compared

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.340 
reasonable options they're both compared

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.120 
reasonable options they're both compared
to<00:07:09.490> the<00:07:09.760> Nikon<00:07:10.090> flashes<00:07:10.570> a<00:07:10.780> lot<00:07:11.169> cheaper<00:07:11.440> in<00:07:11.860> a

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.130 
to the Nikon flashes a lot cheaper in a

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.189 
to the Nikon flashes a lot cheaper in a
overall<00:07:13.090> sense<00:07:13.479> if<00:07:13.660> you're<00:07:13.810> comparing

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:14.199 
overall sense if you're comparing

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:16.350 
overall sense if you're comparing
features<00:07:14.830> and<00:07:14.979> power<00:07:15.190> output<00:07:15.699> then<00:07:15.850> maybe<00:07:16.090> not
