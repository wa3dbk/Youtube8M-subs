 option says ipad the second says the word 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.850
 which is to send audio to a speaker 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.890
 now we are going to apple tv and we are going to 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.960
 give duplication once we give 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.850
 application is good 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.590
 we are seeing exactly what we see 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.650
 on our ipad on our screen 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.870
 high definition once we see 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.550
 duplication we are seeing exactly 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.440
 I came on a screen ipad 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.420
 high definition so that something is me 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.700
 well many times you know of 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.410

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.060
 a movie that buys in itunes store 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.370
 and well they do not want 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.440
 coming home they do not want to see her in 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.020
 its 9.7-inch screen because good 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.760
 has a 40-inch screen and 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.620
 well they have nothing for tv then you 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.600
 you can send in a 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.960
 wireless all the content that they have 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.370
 on your ipad and right now for example I have 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.320
 photographs we touch the icon of 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.520
 photographs I have a series of 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.590
 photographs that I have already taken 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.970
 I will choose you earlier 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.970
 some pictures so you can see 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.400
 who are from us 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.190
 then this I am seeing 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.290
 pictures of me making faces very 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.140

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.060
 danielle then this you put it with the 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.939
 appletv can see your pictures of your 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.500
 ipad on a 40- inch screen that 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.170
 what else can they do with duplication 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.200
 Well, if you are playing a game in 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.090
 your ipad and want to use the shovel the 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.590
 ipad as a control as good can 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.530
 use the screen to be able to see 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.480
 what they are playing without needing 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.400
 have to be with your ipad watching from 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.750
 the effects of on the screen very 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.909
 small have a very large screen 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.859
 they will be able to enjoy all this for 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.329
 example right now we have the one of perry and 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.069
 we will quickly open this game 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.889
 travel a little so you can see 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.500
 then I will not be spending 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:01.019
 on my ipad but I will be here playing 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.209
 well and seeing on the screen 40 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.579
 inches too what is surprising 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.340
 is the following sometimes you 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.510
 press movies on your ipad and good 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.269
 here they do not want to see it on a screen 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.629
 small that do well then let's go 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.889
 quickly and we are going to open youtube 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.480
 because I do not have a movie right now 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.099
 any other for movies but we see 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.740
 quickly from youtube we go to favorites 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.960
 it was a video that has already loaded 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.420
 here I give play to my ipad and in 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.340
 automatic I will be able to watch my video on 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.420
 my 40 inch screen 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.840
 highlights we have highlighted quickly 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.110
 we selected a football game here 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.580
 it's important here is doing nothing else 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.250
 Screen duplication on your ipad 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.150
 this little icon appears this is dan 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.480
 click here 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.540
 they give him appletv in automatic changes and 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.610
 change the screen dimension and I'm going to 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.310
 to be able to see the game in a very 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.890
 clearer then this how can they 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.530
 do with an apple tv that costs thousand 499 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.530
 very cheap pesos connect it with a 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.470
 high definition hdmi cable to be able 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.870
 send screen applications and they do 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.120
 apart from this as in their ipad they relate 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.560
 with press twice the enter button 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.590
 in the multi touch or ipad menu 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.590
 and well they go to the part 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.270
 left click on the icon of 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.100
 airplane give you for you life application 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.990
 and automatically they will be able to appreciate what 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.090
 that you have on your ipad on your screen 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.930
 40 inches and once they have some 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.460
 doubt any question questions doubts 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.720
 because I'm very good 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.730
