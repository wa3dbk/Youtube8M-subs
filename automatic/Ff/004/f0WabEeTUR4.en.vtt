hb- within our never crew in this video
I'm<00:00:03.570> going<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.840> be<00:00:03.929> talking<00:00:04.140> about<00:00:04.470> one<00:00:04.799> of<00:00:04.830> the

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
I'm going to be talking about one of the

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.160 
I'm going to be talking about one of the
most<00:00:05.370> common<00:00:05.879> questions<00:00:06.359> of<00:00:06.569> how<00:00:06.839> do<00:00:07.109> I

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
most common questions of how do I

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.009 
most common questions of how do I
practice<00:00:07.890> more<00:00:08.280> effectively<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.300> how<00:00:09.780> do<00:00:09.840> I

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
practice more effectively and how do I

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.749 
practice more effectively and how do I
becomes<00:00:10.440> that<00:00:10.650> are<00:00:10.769> more<00:00:10.980> quickly<00:00:11.309> when<00:00:11.639> we

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
becomes that are more quickly when we

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.220 
becomes that are more quickly when we
get<00:00:11.910> started<00:00:12.120> with<00:00:12.420> breaking<00:00:12.929> we<00:00:13.049> go<00:00:13.170> to

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
get started with breaking we go to

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.580 
get started with breaking we go to
practices<00:00:13.920> right<00:00:14.190> well<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.820> thing<00:00:15.030> here<00:00:15.330> is

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
practices right well the thing here is

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.349 
practices right well the thing here is
practices<00:00:16.590> with<00:00:16.949> breaking<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.699> not<00:00:17.970> like

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
practices with breaking is not like

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.050 
practices with breaking is not like
other<00:00:18.890> sports<00:00:19.890> even<00:00:20.130> though<00:00:20.340> breaking<00:00:20.730> status

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
other sports even though breaking status

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.500 
other sports even though breaking status
for<00:00:21.390> its<00:00:21.869> not<00:00:22.199> structured<00:00:23.189> now<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.150> the

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
for its not structured now this is the

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.779 
for its not structured now this is the
reason<00:00:24.720> for<00:00:25.230> us<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.590> sometimes<00:00:26.340> not<00:00:26.580> get

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
reason for us to sometimes not get

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.880 
reason for us to sometimes not get
motivated<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.630> not<00:00:27.960> see<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> lot<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.470> results

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
motivated and not see a lot of results

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.130 
motivated and not see a lot of results
really<00:00:29.340> quickly<00:00:29.789> because<00:00:30.330> we<00:00:30.689> don't<00:00:30.929> really

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
really quickly because we don't really

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.440 
really quickly because we don't really
have<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.800> goal<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.520> mind<00:00:32.820> when<00:00:33.180> we<00:00:33.300> go<00:00:33.420> to

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
have a goal in mind when we go to

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.500 
have a goal in mind when we go to
practice<00:00:33.770> unlike<00:00:34.770> if<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.219> play<00:00:35.489> soccer<00:00:35.880> you

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
practice unlike if you play soccer you

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.600 
practice unlike if you play soccer you
go<00:00:36.690> there<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.230> drills<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.129> play<00:00:38.579> a

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
go there you do drills and you play a

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.910 
go there you do drills and you play a
couple<00:00:38.969> games<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.629> then<00:00:40.140> that's<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.649> for<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
couple games and then that's it for the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.380 
couple games and then that's it for the
practice<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.460> lot<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.670> times<00:00:41.969> when<00:00:42.149> we<00:00:42.239> go<00:00:42.360> to

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
practice a lot of times when we go to

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
practice we just go there and we try a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
your shoulder strength because if you

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.770 
your shoulder strength because if you
see<00:01:22.890> my<00:01:23.040> other<00:01:23.220> videos<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:24.420> know<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.600> talk

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
see my other videos you know I talk

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.920 
see my other videos you know I talk
about<00:01:25.490> flexibility<00:01:26.490> quite<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> bit<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.360> I

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
about flexibility quite a bit and I

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.899 
about flexibility quite a bit and I
focus<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.560> training<00:01:29.040> your<00:01:29.369> shoulder<00:01:29.700> strength

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
focus on training your shoulder strength

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.090 
focus on training your shoulder strength
because<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.600> breaking<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.229> lot<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
because in breaking a lot of the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.920 
because in breaking a lot of the
movements<00:01:32.610> require<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.150> lot<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.540> shoulder

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
movements require a lot of shoulder

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.690 
movements require a lot of shoulder
shirt<00:01:34.229> right<00:01:34.530> bottom<00:01:35.009> line<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.340> want<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.579> go

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
shirt right bottom line you want to go

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.999 
shirt right bottom line you want to go
to<00:01:35.759> practice<00:01:36.329> with<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.570> game<00:01:36.869> plan<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.439> mind<00:01:37.740> so

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
to practice with a game plan in mind so

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.130 
to practice with a game plan in mind so
you<00:01:38.070> can<00:01:38.250> be<00:01:38.430> more<00:01:38.640> effective<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.810> if<00:01:39.990> you're

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
you can be more effective so if you're

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.020 
you can be more effective so if you're
