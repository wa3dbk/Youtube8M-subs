00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.520 

and<00:04:25.160> then<00:04:25.490> normally<00:04:25.759> I<00:04:26.000> would<00:04:26.449> spray<00:04:27.259> this

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
and then normally I would spray this

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.279 
and then normally I would spray this
with<00:04:28.120> obviously<00:04:29.120> it's<00:04:29.330> all<00:04:29.509> flying<00:04:29.930> away<00:04:30.139> you

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
with obviously it's all flying away you

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.950 
with obviously it's all flying away you
would<00:04:30.710> put<00:04:31.669> quick<00:04:31.940> braids<00:04:32.240> in<00:04:32.449> this<00:04:32.630> before

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
would put quick braids in this before

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.350 
would put quick braids in this before
you<00:04:33.349> did<00:04:33.530> it<00:04:33.650> just<00:04:33.949> a<00:04:34.070> little<00:04:34.220> bit<00:04:34.370> so<00:04:34.789> it's<00:04:35.120> a

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
you did it just a little bit so it's a

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.390 
you did it just a little bit so it's a
little<00:04:35.570> stickier<00:04:36.080> and<00:04:36.259> then<00:04:36.919> you<00:04:37.039> would<00:04:37.220> I

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
little stickier and then you would I

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.439 
little stickier and then you would I
would<00:04:37.930> quick<00:04:38.930> braid<00:04:39.259> the<00:04:39.530> end<00:04:39.710> this<00:04:40.180> here<00:04:41.180> or

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
would quick braid the end this here or

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.820 
would quick braid the end this here or
hairspray<00:04:42.169> it<00:04:42.320> so<00:04:42.560> it<00:04:42.710> stays<00:04:44.199> nicely<00:04:45.199> under

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
hairspray it so it stays nicely under

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.550 
hairspray it so it stays nicely under
there<00:04:46.009> so<00:04:46.840> that's<00:04:47.840> how<00:04:48.020> you<00:04:48.080> do<00:04:48.259> a<00:04:48.289> running

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
there so that's how you do a running

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.339 
there so that's how you do a running
braid<00:04:48.830> for<00:04:49.070> show<00:04:49.660> she's<00:04:50.660> all<00:04:50.870> ready<00:04:51.050> to<00:04:51.199> go

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:51.349 
braid for show she's all ready to go

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:53.680 
braid for show she's all ready to go
