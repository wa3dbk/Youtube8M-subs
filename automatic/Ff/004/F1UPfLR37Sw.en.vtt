number<00:02:02.969> six<00:02:03.210> learn<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.810> properly<00:02:04.020> cook<00:02:04.439> as

fresh cooking is ultimately more

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.530 
fresh cooking is ultimately more
satisfying<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.979> generally<00:02:11.940> more<00:02:12.120> healthier

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
satisfying and generally more healthier

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.210
