00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
here where we gettin our pressure to are

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.689 
here where we gettin our pressure to are
lower<00:00:27.060> in<00:00:27.240> oil<00:00:27.680> now<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.740> top<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.220> feed<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.580> this

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
lower in oil now the top in feed is this

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:41.889 
lower in oil now the top in feed is this
hole<00:00:29.880> right<00:00:30.060> here

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
I'm shining out this is when I plug but

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.050 
I'm shining out this is when I plug but
that<00:01:59.100> thing<00:01:59.280> goes<00:01:59.430> all<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.579> way<00:01:59.670> down<00:01:59.880> to

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
that thing goes all the way down to

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.649 
that thing goes all the way down to
there<00:02:00.740> so<00:02:04.100> anyway<00:02:05.119> we're<00:02:06.119> just<00:02:06.149> showing<00:02:06.479> how

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
there so anyway we're just showing how

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.080 
there so anyway we're just showing how
it<00:02:06.780> works<00:02:07.229> now<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.770> S&amp;S<00:02:08.520> tells<00:02:08.789> us<00:02:08.879> not<00:02:09.030> to

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
it works now and S&amp;S tells us not to

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.720 
it works now and S&amp;S tells us not to
plug<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.509> hole<00:02:09.660> look<00:02:09.810> like<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.080> did

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
plug the hole look like I did

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.900 
plug the hole look like I did
so<00:02:13.160> who<00:02:14.160> cares<00:02:16.099> it<00:02:17.099> doesn't<00:02:17.400> work<00:02:17.489> to<00:02:17.700> do<00:02:17.819> it

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
so who cares it doesn't work to do it

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.020 
so who cares it doesn't work to do it
what<00:02:18.060> they<00:02:18.209> said<00:02:18.450> anyway<00:02:22.550> okay<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:23.580> now<00:02:23.879> that's

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
what they said anyway okay so now that's

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.420 
what they said anyway okay so now that's
plugged<00:02:24.480> up<00:02:24.599> so<00:02:25.080> now<00:02:25.230> we<00:02:25.290> blow<00:02:25.590> our<00:02:25.709> top<00:02:25.920> in<00:02:26.160> oil

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
plugged up so now we blow our top in oil

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:49.089 
plugged up so now we blow our top in oil
in<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:46.580> they're<00:02:47.580> blowing<00:02:47.940> up<00:02:48.030> through<00:02:48.269> there

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
in it they're blowing up through there

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.410 
in it they're blowing up through there
so<00:02:50.099> that<00:02:50.519> means<00:02:50.640> all<00:02:50.790> our<00:02:50.940> feeds<00:02:51.150> are<00:02:51.299> now

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
so that means all our feeds are now

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.960 
so that means all our feeds are now
separated<00:02:51.989> so<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.709> top<00:02:52.920> end<00:02:53.160> feed<00:02:53.400> is<00:02:53.640> feeding

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
separated so the top end feed is feeding

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.490 
separated so the top end feed is feeding
our<00:02:54.030> lifter<00:02:54.329> blocks<00:02:54.569> and<00:02:54.959> feeding<00:02:55.170> our<00:02:55.319> top

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
our lifter blocks and feeding our top

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.890 
our lifter blocks and feeding our top
end<00:02:55.799> and<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.819> crank<00:02:57.060> is<00:02:57.209> being<00:02:57.420> strictly<00:02:57.750> by

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
end and the crank is being strictly by

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.069 
end and the crank is being strictly by
the<00:02:57.959> crank<00:02:58.290> so<00:02:59.540> everything<00:03:00.540> is<00:03:00.630> separated

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
the crank so everything is separated

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.860 
the crank so everything is separated
like<00:03:01.230> it's<00:03:01.380> close<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:02.269> and<00:03:03.269> like<00:03:03.720> I<00:03:03.750> said

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
like it's close to you and like I said

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.150 
like it's close to you and like I said
they<00:03:03.989> made<00:03:04.200> this<00:03:04.380> wrong<00:03:04.590> here

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
they made this wrong here

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.880 
they made this wrong here
so<00:03:05.340> we're<00:03:05.700> feeding<00:03:05.970> in<00:03:06.120> here<00:03:06.650> like<00:03:07.650> so<00:03:07.799> when

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
so we're feeding in here like so when

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.259 
so we're feeding in here like so when
this<00:03:07.950> valve<00:03:08.220> opens<00:03:08.549> up<00:03:08.700> right<00:03:08.880> under<00:03:09.090> here

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
this valve opens up right under here

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.759 
this valve opens up right under here
