00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.489
a film by Maren Elbrechtz

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.390
Tides

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:14.769
It can be pronounced nicely,

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.609
it's about ebb and flow,

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:18.579
seasonal produce,

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:20.639
things come and go,

00:00:20.639 --> 00:00:22.289
they regenerate

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:24.249
and stay the same.

00:00:24.374 --> 00:00:27.605
That's how the Gezeiten (tides)
got its name.

00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:33.306
CHANGING TIDES

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.730
I love to cook,

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.520
and I'm a good cook.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.260
I want my customers
to like it.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.260
Because my guests don't spend much,
it was important to me

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.560
that prices are affordable.

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.258
Lesbians and gays
can hold hands and kiss

00:01:04.348 --> 00:01:07.690
in almost any restaurant
in Cologne now.

00:01:08.446 --> 00:01:09.880
No one cares.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.070
15 years ago this was still a bit different.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.620
It's interesting
that in the 1920s

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.240
there was a great need
for such places to meet.

00:01:19.393 --> 00:01:21.039
But I really have to say

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:24.470
men spend considerably more money

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.290
than women.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.950
Actually, I'd qualify the statement:

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.150
lesbians spend less
than heterosexual women.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.000
'Cause only once a year
is Carneval,

00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:40.824
is Carneval
at the Rhine.

00:01:41.024 --> 00:01:45.500
'Cause only once a year
is Carneval,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.000
is Carneval
at the Rhine.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.600
Unfortunately, the negotiations
were delayed.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.920
That's why the rest of the world
knows only for a few days

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.450
that in a few days
the Gezeiten will close.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.460

00:02:10.552 --> 00:02:12.952
A documentary about the end of an era.
