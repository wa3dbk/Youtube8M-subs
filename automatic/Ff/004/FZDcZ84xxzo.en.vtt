00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
thought I'd release a quick tutorial

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.710 
thought I'd release a quick tutorial
very<00:00:04.140> quick<00:00:04.350> tutorial<00:00:04.859> on<00:00:04.950> DLL<00:00:05.730> injection<00:00:05.910> so

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
very quick tutorial on DLL injection so

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.919 
very quick tutorial on DLL injection so
all<00:00:07.230> we're<00:00:07.410> gonna<00:00:07.500> do<00:00:07.740> in<00:00:07.830> this<00:00:07.919> tutorial<00:00:08.069> is

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:08.929 
all we're gonna do in this tutorial is

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.410 
all we're gonna do in this tutorial is
I'm<00:00:09.929> going<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.139> show<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.380> how<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.849> inject<00:00:11.849> a

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
I'm going to show you how to inject a

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.189 
I'm going to show you how to inject a
DLL<00:00:13.320> into<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:14.400> game<00:00:14.820> so<00:00:15.330> there<00:00:15.870> won't<00:00:15.929> be<00:00:16.109> any

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
DLL into a game so there won't be any

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.529 
DLL into a game so there won't be any
code<00:00:16.500> involved<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.490> it's<00:00:17.760> just<00:00:17.910> simple<00:00:18.330> stuff

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
code involved so it's just simple stuff

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.150 
code involved so it's just simple stuff
from<00:00:19.430> from<00:00:20.430> running<00:00:21.330> an<00:00:21.570> injector<00:00:22.260> running

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
from from running an injector running

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.820 
from from running an injector running
the<00:00:23.250> game<00:00:23.400> injecting<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.390> DLL<00:00:25.380> into<00:00:25.740> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
the game injecting that DLL into the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.189 
the game injecting that DLL into the
game<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.250> having<00:00:26.699> your<00:00:26.910> hack<00:00:27.090> run<00:00:27.330> now<00:00:27.779> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
game and having your hack run now the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.070 
game and having your hack run now the
reason<00:00:28.470> why<00:00:28.529> I'm<00:00:28.650> doing<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.340> because

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
reason why I'm doing this is because

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.600 
reason why I'm doing this is because
recently<00:00:31.080> I've<00:00:31.260> been<00:00:31.439> quite<00:00:31.980> into<00:00:32.309> releasing

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
recently I've been quite into releasing

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.959 
recently I've been quite into releasing
my<00:00:32.910> own<00:00:33.000> hacks<00:00:33.239> again<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.730> there's<00:00:35.730> quite<00:00:35.910> a

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
my own hacks again and there's quite a

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.270 
my own hacks again and there's quite a
few<00:00:36.059> new<00:00:36.870> people<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.500> don't<00:00:37.890> know<00:00:38.010> how<00:00:38.219> to

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
few new people that don't know how to

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.040 
few new people that don't know how to
inject<00:00:38.640> hacks<00:00:38.940> which<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.239> fine<00:00:39.480> but<00:00:39.809> none<00:00:40.020> of

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
inject hacks which is fine but none of

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.290 
inject hacks which is fine but none of
us<00:00:40.260> knew<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.620> first<00:00:40.800> place<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.300> after

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
us knew in the first place and after

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.520 
us knew in the first place and after
you've<00:00:42.660> done<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.840> couple<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.200> times<00:00:43.260> you

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
you've done a couple of times you

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.139 
you've done a couple of times you
realize<00:00:43.860> it's<00:00:44.070> quite<00:00:44.280> quite<00:00:44.640> straightforward

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
realize it's quite quite straightforward

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.150 
realize it's quite quite straightforward
quite<00:00:45.360> easy<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.660> I'm<00:00:45.870> gonna<00:00:46.020> do<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:46.950> as

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
quite easy so I'm gonna do this as

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.490 
quite easy so I'm gonna do this as
hopefully<00:00:47.730> as<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> global<00:00:48.420> sort<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.780> video<00:00:49.079> that

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
hopefully as a global sort of video that

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.680 
hopefully as a global sort of video that
I<00:00:49.530> can<00:00:49.860> always<00:00:50.100> direct<00:00:50.550> people<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:51.000> or<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:51.510> can

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
I can always direct people to or we can

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.380 
I can always direct people to or we can
direct<00:00:51.989> each<00:00:52.079> other<00:00:52.289> -<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.309> new<00:00:54.059> people

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
direct each other - so the new people

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.939 
direct each other - so the new people
have<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.930> keep<00:00:55.050> asking<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.410> question<00:00:55.829> there

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
have to keep asking this question there

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.010 
have to keep asking this question there
will<00:00:56.010> be<00:00:56.070> quite<00:00:56.520> straightforwardly<00:00:57.120> pointed

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
will be quite straightforwardly pointed

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.410 
will be quite straightforwardly pointed
to<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.199> right<00:00:58.350> place<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.030> the<00:01:00.030> first<00:01:00.270> thing

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
to the right place so the first thing

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.740 
to the right place so the first thing
I'm<00:01:00.510> going<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.660> do<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.730> run<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.329> game<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.719> I

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
I'm going to do is run the game that I

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.380 
I'm going to do is run the game that I
wanna<00:01:03.870> inject<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:05.430> DLL<00:01:05.549> into<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.210> I'm<00:01:06.270> gonna

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
wanna inject the DLL into so I'm gonna

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.140 
wanna inject the DLL into so I'm gonna
run<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.659> game<00:01:06.869> windowed<00:01:07.260> mode<00:01:07.409> now<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:09.000> can

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
run this game windowed mode now you can

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.789 
run this game windowed mode now you can
run<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.420> game<00:01:09.540> or<00:01:09.780> any<00:01:09.930> other<00:01:10.110> game<00:01:10.350> now

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
run this game or any other game now

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.710 
run this game or any other game now
the<00:01:11.070> examples<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.580> I'm<00:01:11.729> giving<00:01:12.119> technically

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the examples that I'm giving technically

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.420 
the examples that I'm giving technically
apply<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.020> absolutely<00:01:13.619> every<00:01:13.920> single<00:01:13.950> hack

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
apply to absolutely every single hack

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.120 
apply to absolutely every single hack
that<00:01:14.580> gets<00:01:14.729> released<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> DLL<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:16.619> I'm

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
that gets released and is a DLL but I'm

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.670 
that gets released and is a DLL but I'm
mostly<00:01:17.790> targeting<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.420> at<00:01:18.570> my<00:01:18.720> own<00:01:18.750> hacks<00:01:19.140> that

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
mostly targeting it at my own hacks that

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.800 
mostly targeting it at my own hacks that
I<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.220> I've<00:01:20.310> coded<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.090> know<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.570> work

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
I that I've coded and I know that work

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.789 
I that I've coded and I know that work
so<00:01:22.909> did<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.060> ever<00:01:24.180> move<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.659> for<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> second

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
so did you ever move this for a second

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.190 
so did you ever move this for a second
and<00:01:25.979> that's<00:01:26.250> fine<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.780> idea<00:01:28.049> behind

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
and that's fine and so the idea behind

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.880 
and that's fine and so the idea behind
this<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.619> I'm<00:01:29.220> going<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.430> run<00:01:29.549> my<00:01:29.670> injector<00:01:30.890> so

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
this is I'm going to run my injector so

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.640 
this is I'm going to run my injector so
first<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.820> all<00:01:32.909> I'd<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.840> injector<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.590> I

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
first of all I'd the injector that I

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.460 
first of all I'd the injector that I
recommend<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.280> example<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.960> remote<00:01:37.229> er

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
recommend this example is this remote er

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.560 
recommend this example is this remote er
injection<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.009> up<00:01:38.189> absolutely<00:01:38.850> brilliant<00:01:39.000> you

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
injection is up absolutely brilliant you

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.030 
injection is up absolutely brilliant you
can<00:01:39.840> find<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.470> link<00:01:40.590> for<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.950> description

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
can find a link for in the description

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.850 
can find a link for in the description
it's<00:01:41.670> free<00:01:41.939> it's<00:01:42.540> done<00:01:42.869> by<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> proper<00:01:43.409> company

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
it's free it's done by a proper company

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.100 
it's free it's done by a proper company
and<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.460> works<00:01:44.670> very<00:01:44.880> well<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.210> not<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.899> mention

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
and it works very well so not to mention

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.130 
and it works very well so not to mention
that<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:46.439> got<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> really<00:01:46.740> good<00:01:46.950> interface<00:01:47.189> so

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
that it's got a really good interface so

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.210 
that it's got a really good interface so
obviously<00:01:49.140> I'm<00:01:49.259> not<00:01:49.439> plugging<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.979> because<00:01:50.189> I

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
obviously I'm not plugging it because I

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.319 
obviously I'm not plugging it because I
have<00:01:50.340> nothing<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.729> do<00:01:50.850> with<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.000> company

have nothing to do with this company

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.600 
have nothing to do with this company

every year no I'm joking so um this is a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.060 
every year no I'm joking so um this is a
great<00:01:57.360> program<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.869> do<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.500> injection<00:01:58.950> with

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
great program to do the injection with

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.679 
great program to do the injection with
you<00:01:59.219> can<00:01:59.340> use<00:01:59.490> anything<00:01:59.759> else<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.270> if<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.540> knew

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
you can use anything else so if you knew

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.749 
you can use anything else so if you knew
I<00:02:00.719> recommend<00:02:01.200> use<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:01.560> or<00:02:01.799> just<00:02:01.860> look<00:02:02.549> online

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
I recommend use this or just look online

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.850 
I recommend use this or just look online
for<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.240> dll<00:02:03.630> injector<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.469> make<00:02:04.649> sure<00:02:04.770> you

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
for a dll injector and make sure you

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.130 
for a dll injector and make sure you
download<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.250> from<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.579> proper<00:02:05.939> site<00:02:06.200> that<00:02:07.489> that

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
download it from a proper site that that

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.080 
download it from a proper site that that
to<00:02:10.140> ensure<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.500> it's<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.950> safe<00:02:11.280> one<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.819> it's

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
to ensure that it's a safe one and it's

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.070 
to ensure that it's a safe one and it's
not<00:02:12.239> going<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.420> give<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.599> crap<00:02:12.840> on<00:02:12.959> your

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
not going to give you crap on your

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.580 
not going to give you crap on your
computer

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
computer

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.170 
computer
so<00:02:13.950> I'm<00:02:14.430> just<00:02:14.519> gonna<00:02:14.640> move<00:02:14.849> this<00:02:14.940> down<00:02:15.120> a

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
so I'm just gonna move this down a

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.390 
so I'm just gonna move this down a
little<00:02:15.360> bit<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:16.620> is<00:02:16.739> a<00:02:16.800> good<00:02:16.890> example<00:02:17.010> I

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
little bit so this is a good example I

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.100 
little bit so this is a good example I
tend<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.700> use<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:18.030> one<00:02:18.209> these<00:02:18.330> days<00:02:18.599> you<00:02:18.959> can

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
tend to use this one these days you can

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.479 
tend to use this one these days you can
also<00:02:19.260> use<00:02:20.069> cheat<00:02:20.400> engine<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:22.220> inject<00:02:23.220> memory

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
also use cheat engine to inject memory

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:24.470 
also use cheat engine to inject memory
so<00:02:23.610> I'm<00:02:23.670> going<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.849> show<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.030> quickly<00:02:24.239> how<00:02:24.360> a

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
so I'm going to show you quickly how a

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.410 
so I'm going to show you quickly how a
engine<00:02:24.959> would<00:02:25.080> do<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.790> so<00:02:26.790> I'm<00:02:26.879> just<00:02:26.910> gonna<00:02:27.090> put

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
engine would do it so I'm just gonna put

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.880 
engine would do it so I'm just gonna put
that<00:02:27.569> put<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:27.930> on<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.170> side<00:02:28.349> for<00:02:28.560> now<00:02:28.590> and

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
that put this on the side for now and

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.020 
that put this on the side for now and
I'll<00:02:28.950> show<00:02:29.099> you<00:02:29.190> how<00:02:29.370> it's<00:02:29.550> done<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.760> cheat

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
I'll show you how it's done a cheat

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.400 
I'll show you how it's done a cheat
engine<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.660> for<00:02:30.870> those<00:02:30.989> of<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.290> know

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
engine so for those of you I know

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.440 
engine so for those of you I know
majority<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.129> you<00:02:32.250> guys<00:02:32.430> have<00:02:32.819> cheat<00:02:33.000> engine<00:02:33.180> I

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
majority of you guys have cheat engine I

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.789 
majority of you guys have cheat engine I
could<00:02:33.660> show<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.810> how<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.989> do<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.349> although

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
could show you how you do that although

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.400 
could show you how you do that although
I<00:02:35.190> think<00:02:35.519> it's<00:02:35.819> points<00:02:36.239> off<00:02:36.510> pointless<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.170> get

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
I think it's points off pointless to get

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.339 
I think it's points off pointless to get
cheat<00:02:37.709> engine<00:02:37.920> just<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:39.170> inject<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.260> DLL

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
cheat engine just to to inject the DLL

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.740 
cheat engine just to to inject the DLL
so<00:02:40.709> that's<00:02:40.860> sort<00:02:41.099> sort<00:02:41.489> of<00:02:41.549> useless<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:42.330> this

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
so that's sort sort of useless so this

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.420 
so that's sort sort of useless so this
game<00:02:42.959> here<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.379> just<00:02:43.560> an<00:02:43.680> example<00:02:43.769> you<00:02:44.160> can<00:02:44.190> use

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
game here is just an example you can use

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.360 
game here is just an example you can use
absolutely<00:02:44.549> any<00:02:44.849> game<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.180> like<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:46.620> this<00:02:47.220> is

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
absolutely any game you like so this is

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.559 
absolutely any game you like so this is
one<00:02:47.489> of<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.640> hacks<00:02:47.849> that<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.060> did<00:02:48.299> very

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
one of the hacks that I did very

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.990 
one of the hacks that I did very
recently<00:02:49.610> depending<00:02:50.610> on<00:02:50.730> when<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:50.970> watch

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
recently depending on when you watch

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.949 
recently depending on when you watch
this<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:51.510> guess<00:02:51.720> so<00:02:53.540> first<00:02:54.540> thing<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:54.720> want<00:02:54.930> to

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
this I guess so first thing you want to

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.839 
this I guess so first thing you want to
do<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.349> have<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.709> DLL<00:02:56.069> here<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.700> first

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
do so you have the DLL here the first

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:57.830 
do so you have the DLL here the first
thing<00:02:56.970> you<00:02:57.060> want<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.209> do<00:02:57.360> is<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.540> want<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.690> go

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
thing you want to do is you want to go

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.470 
thing you want to do is you want to go
hover<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.440> over<00:02:58.739> to<00:02:58.860> there<00:02:59.069> boom<00:02:59.579> there's

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
hover that over to there boom there's

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.819 
hover that over to there boom there's
your<00:03:00.780> DLL<00:03:01.110> name<00:03:01.290> fine

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
your DLL name fine

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.289 
your DLL name fine
you<00:03:02.160> then<00:03:02.310> want<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.549> click<00:03:02.700> here<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.090> select

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
you then want to click here to select

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.330 
you then want to click here to select
your<00:03:03.510> target<00:03:03.690> process<00:03:04.079> so<00:03:04.860> like<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.099> said<00:03:05.160> you

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
your target process so like I said you

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.680 
your target process so like I said you
can<00:03:05.549> use<00:03:05.579> any<00:03:06.140> DLL<00:03:07.140> injector<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.560> like<00:03:08.690> we

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
can use any DLL injector you like we

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.210 
can use any DLL injector you like we
select<00:03:10.049> cursive<00:03:10.410> like<00:03:10.530> water<00:03:10.739> which<00:03:10.950> is<00:03:11.099> our

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
going to do that just yet as you can see

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.140 
going to do that just yet as you can see
here<00:03:22.109> all<00:03:22.319> we<00:03:22.500> needed<00:03:22.680> was<00:03:23.010> a<00:03:23.220> dll<00:03:23.670> injector

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
here all we needed was a dll injector

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.180 
here all we needed was a dll injector
the<00:03:24.389> game<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:24.690> will<00:03:24.780> inject<00:03:25.139> inject<00:03:25.829> into

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
the game that will inject inject into

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.059 
the game that will inject inject into
and<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.700> DLL<00:03:27.150> itself<00:03:27.750> now<00:03:28.170> most<00:03:28.650> of<00:03:28.769> my<00:03:28.859> hacks

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
and the DLL itself now most of my hacks

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.830 
and the DLL itself now most of my hacks
that<00:03:29.250> are<00:03:29.280> released<00:03:29.579> are<00:03:29.790> going<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.060> be<00:03:30.180> dll's

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
that are released are going to be dll's

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.750 
that are released are going to be dll's
the<00:03:31.380> reason<00:03:31.680> for<00:03:31.799> that<00:03:31.859> is<00:03:32.099> because<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:32.609> makes

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
the reason for that is because it makes

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.970 
the reason for that is because it makes
life<00:03:33.060> easier<00:03:33.599> and<00:03:33.780> they<00:03:33.870> all<00:03:34.019> work<00:03:34.739> really

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
life easier and they all work really

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.280 
life easier and they all work really
well<00:03:35.220> with<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.120> game<00:03:36.389> that<00:03:36.630> way<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:36.810> can<00:03:37.079> do<00:03:37.260> a

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
well with the game that way you can do a

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.539 
well with the game that way you can do a
lot<00:03:37.470> more<00:03:37.500> things<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.069> have<00:03:38.190> much<00:03:38.400> more

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
lot more things and you have much more

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.449 
lot more things and you have much more
freedom<00:03:38.940> with<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.120> hacks<00:03:39.329> but<00:03:40.459> sometimes

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
freedom with the hacks but sometimes

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.330 
freedom with the hacks but sometimes
these<00:03:42.389> hacks<00:03:42.840> these<00:03:43.109> DLLs<00:03:43.680> will<00:03:43.919> be<00:03:44.069> flagged

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
these hacks these DLLs will be flagged

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.240 
these hacks these DLLs will be flagged
up<00:03:44.549> by<00:03:44.669> antivirus<00:03:45.000> as<00:03:45.480> viruses<00:03:46.410> now<00:03:46.889> the

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
up by antivirus as viruses now the

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.559 
up by antivirus as viruses now the
reason<00:03:47.519> for<00:03:47.549> that<00:03:47.760> well<00:03:48.180> there<00:03:48.389> are<00:03:48.480> many

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
reason for that well there are many

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.210 
reason for that well there are many
reasons<00:03:48.810> for<00:03:49.019> that<00:03:49.200> but<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.470> main<00:03:49.530> reason<00:03:50.190> for

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
reasons for that but the main reason for

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.699 
reasons for that but the main reason for
that<00:03:50.340> is<00:03:50.459> because<00:03:50.810> technically<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:51.989> hack<00:03:52.440> is

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
that is because technically a hack is

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.979 
that is because technically a hack is
often<00:03:53.130> a<00:03:53.220> virus<00:03:53.639> so<00:03:54.060> what<00:03:54.209> this<00:03:54.329> is<00:03:54.510> doing<00:03:54.720> is

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
often a virus so what this is doing is

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.509 
often a virus so what this is doing is
this<00:03:55.169> is<00:03:55.500> going<00:03:55.769> into<00:03:55.919> the<00:03:56.069> game<00:03:56.280> and

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
this is going into the game and

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.240 
this is going into the game and
modifying<00:03:57.090> memory<00:03:57.510> so<00:03:58.319> it's<00:03:58.560> saying<00:03:58.829> instead

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
modifying memory so it's saying instead

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.039 
modifying memory so it's saying instead
of<00:03:59.400> for<00:03:59.669> example<00:03:59.760> decreasing<00:04:00.510> my<00:04:00.599> lantern

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
of for example decreasing my lantern

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.559 
of for example decreasing my lantern
increase<00:04:01.440> it<00:04:01.709> blah<00:04:02.250> blah<00:04:02.549> etc<00:04:02.700> so<00:04:03.329> what<00:04:03.450> it's

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
increase it blah blah etc so what it's

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.030 
increase it blah blah etc so what it's
doing<00:04:03.870> is<00:04:03.989> technically<00:04:04.410> known<00:04:04.650> as<00:04:04.680> malicious

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
doing is technically known as malicious

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.729 
doing is technically known as malicious
stuff<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.870> normally<00:04:06.870> your<00:04:07.079> antivirus<00:04:07.319> will

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
stuff and normally your antivirus will

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:08.990 
stuff and normally your antivirus will
think<00:04:07.980> or<00:04:08.160> maybe<00:04:08.310> this<00:04:08.579> wants<00:04:08.849> to<00:04:08.880> do

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
think or maybe this wants to do

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.420 
think or maybe this wants to do
something<00:04:09.329> bad<00:04:09.510> to<00:04:09.540> my<00:04:09.780> computer<00:04:10.290> whereas<00:04:11.040> all

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
something bad to my computer whereas all

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.460 
something bad to my computer whereas all
that<00:04:11.639> it<00:04:11.730> wants<00:04:11.940> to<00:04:11.970> do<00:04:12.209> is<00:04:12.239> modify<00:04:12.720> memory<00:04:13.319> in

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
that it wants to do is modify memory in

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.409 
that it wants to do is modify memory in
the<00:04:13.590> game<00:04:13.769> so<00:04:14.220> technically<00:04:14.579> it<00:04:14.970> does<00:04:15.209> what<00:04:15.389> a

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
the game so technically it does what a

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.300 
the game so technically it does what a
virus<00:04:15.660> does<00:04:16.019> but<00:04:16.380> it<00:04:16.470> does<00:04:16.709> nothing<00:04:16.950> but

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
virus does but it does nothing but

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.909 
virus does but it does nothing but
target<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.780> game<00:04:18.959> that<00:04:19.139> we<00:04:19.229> want<00:04:19.440> so

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
target the the the game that we want so

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.080 
target the the the game that we want so
you<00:04:20.010> have<00:04:20.250> absolutely<00:04:20.579> nothing<00:04:20.729> to<00:04:20.910> worry

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
you have absolutely nothing to worry

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.529 
you have absolutely nothing to worry
about<00:04:21.209> I<00:04:21.719> know<00:04:22.229> most<00:04:22.500> of<00:04:22.740> you<00:04:23.150> guys<00:04:24.150> have<00:04:24.390> been

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
about I know most of you guys have been

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:24.990 
about I know most of you guys have been
in

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
in

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.640 
in
the<00:04:25.090> hacking<00:04:25.450> sort<00:04:25.900> of<00:04:25.990> community<00:04:26.320> for<00:04:26.620> a

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
the hacking sort of community for a

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.680 
the hacking sort of community for a
while<00:04:26.800> you<00:04:26.980> know<00:04:27.010> this<00:04:27.790> stuff<00:04:28.000> by<00:04:28.180> default<00:04:28.570> but

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
while you know this stuff by default but

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.080 
while you know this stuff by default but
I<00:04:28.750> like<00:04:28.930> to<00:04:29.050> tell<00:04:29.230> you<00:04:29.380> newbies<00:04:29.800> that<00:04:30.010> this<00:04:30.970> is

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
I like to tell you newbies that this is

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.130 
I like to tell you newbies that this is
generally<00:04:31.450> safe<00:04:31.660> now

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
generally safe now

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.960 
generally safe now
obviously<00:04:32.710> if<00:04:32.800> you<00:04:32.890> don't<00:04:33.010> trust<00:04:33.250> my<00:04:33.520> work

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
obviously if you don't trust my work

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.880 
obviously if you don't trust my work
that's<00:04:34.180> absolutely<00:04:34.600> fine<00:04:34.840> but<00:04:35.380> I've<00:04:35.530> released

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
that's absolutely fine but I've released

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.420 
that's absolutely fine but I've released
pretty<00:04:36.520> much<00:04:36.730> I<00:04:37.030> don't<00:04:37.870> know<00:04:37.990> at<00:04:38.740> least<00:04:38.950> over<00:04:39.400> a

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
pretty much I don't know at least over a

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.090 
pretty much I don't know at least over a
hundred<00:04:39.930> releases<00:04:40.930> which<00:04:41.410> many<00:04:41.740> people<00:04:41.830> are

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
hundred releases which many people are

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.930 
hundred releases which many people are
happy<00:04:42.400> with<00:04:42.520> but<00:04:43.000> again<00:04:43.240> that's<00:04:44.080> your<00:04:44.170> choice

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
happy with but again that's your choice

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.600 
happy with but again that's your choice
the<00:04:45.940> next<00:04:46.180> steps<00:04:46.920> so<00:04:47.920> you've<00:04:48.010> done<00:04:48.190> everything

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
the next steps so you've done everything

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.160 
the next steps so you've done everything
and<00:04:48.760> then<00:04:48.910> you<00:04:49.030> just<00:04:49.480> wanna<00:04:49.630> go<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:49.930> check<00:04:50.050> the

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
and then you just wanna go and check the

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.350 
and then you just wanna go and check the
out<00:04:50.350> now<00:04:50.770> what<00:04:51.190> I<00:04:51.250> generally<00:04:51.640> recommend<00:04:51.820> is

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
out now what I generally recommend is

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.690 
out now what I generally recommend is
that<00:04:52.900> you<00:04:53.290> wait<00:04:53.560> and<00:04:53.920> don't<00:04:54.160> go<00:04:54.310> on<00:04:54.400> the<00:04:54.520> game

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
that you wait and don't go on the game

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.340 
that you wait and don't go on the game
until<00:04:55.150> that<00:04:55.300> deal<00:04:55.510> is<00:04:55.750> injected<00:04:56.230> now

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
until that deal is injected now

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.200 
until that deal is injected now
depending<00:04:56.830> on<00:04:56.890> what<00:04:57.100> what<00:04:57.430> I'm<00:04:57.520> releasing<00:04:57.850> or

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
depending on what what I'm releasing or

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.050 
depending on what what I'm releasing or
whatever<00:04:58.750> hack<00:04:58.990> you're<00:04:59.169> using<00:04:59.440> you<00:05:00.340> main<00:05:00.580> you

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060

whatever hack you're using you main you
know<00:05:01.180> you<00:05:01.240> may<00:05:01.540> have<00:05:01.570> a<00:05:02.169> little<00:05:02.650> bit<00:05:02.890> longer<00:05:03.100> to

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
know you may have a little bit longer to

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.590 
know you may have a little bit longer to
weigh<00:05:03.370> now<00:05:03.520> this<00:05:03.700> hike<00:05:03.880> isn't<00:05:04.240> my<00:05:04.390> most

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
weigh now this hike isn't my most

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.659 
weigh now this hike isn't my most
efficient<00:05:05.140> although<00:05:05.680> it<00:05:05.830> does<00:05:06.040> quite<00:05:06.400> a<00:05:06.430> few

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
efficient although it does quite a few

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:08.400 
efficient although it does quite a few
things<00:05:06.940> at<00:05:07.120> once<00:05:07.330> that's<00:05:07.600> why<00:05:07.750> it's<00:05:07.900> a<00:05:07.960> bit<00:05:08.110> of

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
things at once that's why it's a bit of

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.690 
things at once that's why it's a bit of
a<00:05:08.530> slow<00:05:08.740> one<00:05:08.860> to<00:05:09.010> inject<00:05:10.680> so<00:05:11.680> I<00:05:11.710> wait<00:05:12.100> generally

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
a slow one to inject so I wait generally

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.180 
a slow one to inject so I wait generally
30<00:05:13.690> or<00:05:14.020> so<00:05:14.169> seconds<00:05:14.590> it<00:05:14.710> depends<00:05:15.010> on<00:05:15.100> the

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
30 or so seconds it depends on the

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.710 
30 or so seconds it depends on the
injectors<00:05:15.640> are<00:05:15.850> some<00:05:16.030> injectors<00:05:16.450> are<00:05:16.570> much

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
injectors are some injectors are much

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.850 
injectors are some injectors are much
faster<00:05:16.960> so<00:05:18.210> it<00:05:19.210> should<00:05:19.780> be<00:05:19.960> injecting<00:05:20.470> the

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
faster so it should be injecting the

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.700 
faster so it should be injecting the
hack<00:05:21.070> right<00:05:21.280> now<00:05:21.550> and<00:05:22.320> let's<00:05:23.320> just<00:05:23.530> wait<00:05:23.680> a

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
hack right now and let's just wait a

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:30.060 
hack right now and let's just wait a
second<00:05:27.120> so<00:05:28.120> in<00:05:28.240> theory<00:05:28.500> almost<00:05:29.500> every<00:05:29.919> hack

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
second so in theory almost every hack

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.980 
second so in theory almost every hack
that<00:05:30.220> I<00:05:30.280> release<00:05:30.520> will<00:05:30.790> be<00:05:30.820> able<00:05:31.210> to<00:05:31.360> you'll<00:05:31.870> be

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
that I release will be able to you'll be

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.740 
that I release will be able to you'll be
able<00:05:32.080> to<00:05:32.290> do<00:05:32.410> it<00:05:32.530> like<00:05:32.650> this<00:05:32.830> for<00:05:33.190> example

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
able to do it like this for example

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.120 
able to do it like this for example
the<00:05:34.750> good<00:05:34.960> thing<00:05:35.140> about<00:05:35.260> this<00:05:35.530> remote<00:05:35.890> the<00:05:36.010> L

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
the good thing about this remote the L

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.310 
the good thing about this remote the L
program<00:05:36.820> as<00:05:36.970> well<00:05:37.120> is<00:05:37.330> because<00:05:37.630> it<00:05:37.780> comes<00:05:37.960> in

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
program as well is because it comes in

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.630 
program as well is because it comes in
both<00:05:38.919> 64-bit<00:05:39.850> and<00:05:40.060> 32-bit<00:05:40.770> for<00:05:41.770> sir<00:05:41.979> every<00:05:42.490> now

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
both 64-bit and 32-bit for sir every now

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.860 
both 64-bit and 32-bit for sir every now
and<00:05:42.790> then<00:05:42.880> there<00:05:43.120> may<00:05:43.240> be<00:05:43.270> a<00:05:43.390> game<00:05:43.630> that<00:05:43.780> will

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
and then there may be a game that will

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.350 
and then there may be a game that will
be<00:05:43.960> hacked<00:05:44.200> in<00:05:44.380> 64-bit<00:05:45.130> if<00:05:45.340> you<00:05:45.790> download<00:05:46.150> a

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
be hacked in 64-bit if you download a

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.260 
be hacked in 64-bit if you download a
copy<00:05:46.540> of<00:05:46.690> my<00:05:46.840> outlast<00:05:47.260> hack<00:05:48.010> that<00:05:48.490> had<00:05:48.850> to<00:05:49.090> be

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
copy of my outlast hack that had to be

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.659 
copy of my outlast hack that had to be
used<00:05:49.510> in<00:05:49.720> 64-bit<00:05:50.560> there<00:05:51.190> you<00:05:51.340> go<00:05:51.490> that

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
used in 64-bit there you go that

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.520 
used in 64-bit there you go that
beautiful<00:05:52.090> and<00:05:52.270> Alice<00:05:52.990> had<00:05:53.169> to<00:05:53.260> be<00:05:53.350> used<00:05:53.470> a

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
beautiful and Alice had to be used a

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.520 
beautiful and Alice had to be used a
64-bit<00:05:54.250> whereas<00:05:55.000> the<00:05:55.750> majority<00:05:55.840> of<00:05:56.260> games

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
64-bit whereas the majority of games

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.490 
64-bit whereas the majority of games
need<00:05:57.340> a<00:05:57.370> 32-bit<00:05:58.060> injector<00:05:58.630> now<00:05:59.020> you<00:05:59.380> won't

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
need a 32-bit injector now you won't

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.040 
need a 32-bit injector now you won't
find<00:05:59.740> many<00:06:00.030> 64-bit<00:06:01.030> injectors<00:06:01.570> out<00:06:01.690> there<00:06:01.900> so

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
find many 64-bit injectors out there so

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.700 
find many 64-bit injectors out there so
this<00:06:02.229> is<00:06:02.500> why<00:06:02.890> this<00:06:03.520> is<00:06:03.669> also<00:06:03.850> quite<00:06:04.060> a<00:06:04.150> good

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
this is why this is also quite a good

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.680 
this is why this is also quite a good
injector<00:06:05.710> so<00:06:06.370> as<00:06:06.700> you<00:06:06.940> can<00:06:07.060> see<00:06:07.240> that<00:06:07.450> the

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
injector so as you can see that the

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.630 
injector so as you can see that the
hacks<00:06:07.930> been<00:06:08.110> released<00:06:08.410> and<00:06:08.620> I<00:06:08.680> can<00:06:08.890> do<00:06:09.370> all<00:06:09.490> my

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
hacks been released and I can do all my

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.580 
hacks been released and I can do all my
normal<00:06:10.000> functions<00:06:10.450> the<00:06:10.750> same<00:06:10.780> and<00:06:11.169> I<00:06:11.200> can<00:06:11.380> fly

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
normal functions the same and I can fly

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.010 
normal functions the same and I can fly
etc<00:06:12.280> this<00:06:12.700> is<00:06:12.760> just<00:06:13.120> an<00:06:13.210> example<00:06:13.300> of<00:06:13.660> this<00:06:13.780> hack

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
etc this is just an example of this hack

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.570 
etc this is just an example of this hack
if<00:06:14.169> you<00:06:14.260> don't<00:06:14.410> download<00:06:14.590> it<00:06:14.919> go<00:06:15.310> through<00:06:15.490> my

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
if you don't download it go through my

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.860 
if you don't download it go through my
videos<00:06:15.880> just<00:06:16.090> look<00:06:16.300> for<00:06:16.479> the<00:06:16.540> curse<00:06:16.690> of

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
videos just look for the curse of

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.750 
videos just look for the curse of
Blackwater<00:06:17.290> and<00:06:17.500> you<00:06:17.650> find<00:06:17.860> this<00:06:18.010> hack<00:06:18.190> this

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
Blackwater and you find this hack this

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.190 
Blackwater and you find this hack this
is<00:06:18.940> an<00:06:19.060> indie<00:06:19.330> horror<00:06:19.510> game<00:06:19.660> which<00:06:19.960> is<00:06:20.080> pretty

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
is an indie horror game which is pretty

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.230 
is an indie horror game which is pretty
cool<00:06:20.500> stuff<00:06:20.650> I'm<00:06:21.280> not<00:06:21.340> gonna<00:06:21.640> go<00:06:21.790> over<00:06:21.820> it<00:06:22.060> too

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
cool stuff I'm not gonna go over it too

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.030 
cool stuff I'm not gonna go over it too
much<00:06:22.390> so<00:06:22.630> that's<00:06:23.260> pretty<00:06:23.470> much<00:06:23.620> all<00:06:23.770> you<00:06:23.890> have

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.040 
much so that's pretty much all you have

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.760 
much so that's pretty much all you have
to<00:06:24.160> do<00:06:24.310> for<00:06:24.460> that<00:06:24.870> you<00:06:25.870> injected<00:06:26.320> yeah<00:06:26.440> once

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
to do for that you injected yeah once

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
to do for that you injected yeah once
you're<00:06:26.890> happy<00:06:26.950> with<00:06:27.130> that<00:06:27.250> you<00:06:27.460> can<00:06:27.580> close

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:27.790 
you're happy with that you can close

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.030 
you're happy with that you can close
that<00:06:27.820> in

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.040 
that in

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.950 
that in
the<00:06:29.520> dealer<00:06:29.850> becomes<00:06:30.150> part<00:06:30.420> of<00:06:30.510> the<00:06:30.660> program

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
the dealer becomes part of the program

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.240 
the dealer becomes part of the program
so<00:06:31.110> you<00:06:31.140> don't<00:06:31.350> have<00:06:31.440> to<00:06:31.590> worry<00:06:31.740> about<00:06:31.800> it<00:06:32.190> if

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
so you don't have to worry about it if

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.590 
so you don't have to worry about it if
you<00:06:32.580> wanted<00:06:32.760> to<00:06:32.850> inject<00:06:33.090> through<00:06:33.360> cheat

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 
you wanted to inject through cheat

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.340 
you wanted to inject through cheat
engine<00:06:33.840> you<00:06:34.560> select<00:06:35.130> the<00:06:35.640> game<00:06:35.850> here<00:06:36.180> open<00:06:36.900> go

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 
engine you select the game here open go

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.710 
engine you select the game here open go
into<00:06:37.530> memory<00:06:37.920> view<00:06:38.190> so<00:06:39.000> ignore<00:06:39.420> everything

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 
into memory view so ignore everything

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.030 
into memory view so ignore everything
that's<00:06:39.870> happening<00:06:40.260> that<00:06:40.410> click<00:06:40.650> on<00:06:40.770> tools'

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.040 
that's happening that click on tools'

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.180 
that's happening that click on tools'
inject<00:06:41.820> DLL<00:06:42.240> and<00:06:42.390> then<00:06:43.260> you<00:06:43.560> choose<00:06:43.890> your<00:06:43.920> deal

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
inject DLL and then you choose your deal

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.190 
inject DLL and then you choose your deal
so<00:06:44.490> here's<00:06:44.670> an<00:06:44.760> example<00:06:44.850> all<00:06:45.600> you<00:06:45.750> do<00:06:45.900> is<00:06:46.050> you

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.200 
so here's an example all you do is you

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.890 
so here's an example all you do is you
you<00:06:46.800> click<00:06:47.010> that<00:06:47.280> boom<00:06:47.970> do<00:06:48.540> you<00:06:48.630> want<00:06:48.780> to

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
you click that boom do you want to

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.090 
you click that boom do you want to
execute<00:06:49.200> the<00:06:49.530> function

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 
execute the function

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.480 
execute the function
I<00:06:50.130> say<00:06:50.820> yes<00:06:51.000> no<00:06:51.240> I<00:06:51.540> click<00:06:52.020> close<00:06:52.560> because<00:06:53.340> I

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490 
I say yes no I click close because I

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:54.920 
I say yes no I click close because I
don't<00:06:53.670> actually<00:06:53.790> want<00:06:54.120> to<00:06:54.180> inject<00:06:54.600> it<00:06:54.720> again

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
don't actually want to inject it again

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:55.760 
don't actually want to inject it again
cuz<00:06:55.140> I<00:06:55.230> already<00:06:55.440> got<00:06:55.590> it

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
cuz I already got it

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.350 
cuz I already got it
and<00:06:55.890> that's<00:06:56.400> pretty<00:06:56.550> much<00:06:56.670> it<00:06:56.940> that's<00:06:57.090> all<00:06:57.330> you

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 
and that's pretty much it that's all you

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.930 
and that's pretty much it that's all you
have<00:06:57.540> to<00:06:57.690> do<00:06:57.810> with<00:06:57.960> the<00:06:58.050> majority<00:06:58.530> of<00:06:58.590> my

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:58.940 
have to do with the majority of my

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.150 
have to do with the majority of my
hopefully<00:06:59.940> haven't<00:07:00.150> crushed<00:07:00.300> anything<00:07:00.810> oh

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.160 
hopefully haven't crushed anything oh

hopefully haven't crushed anything oh
yeah<00:07:02.160> fuck<00:07:02.460> each<00:07:02.670> engine<00:07:03.150> yeah<00:07:04.250> so<00:07:05.250> that's

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:05.730 
yeah fuck each engine yeah so that's

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.430 
yeah fuck each engine yeah so that's
pretty<00:07:05.910> much<00:07:06.060> all<00:07:06.210> you<00:07:06.330> have<00:07:06.480> to<00:07:06.630> do<00:07:06.810> for<00:07:07.260> that

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 
pretty much all you have to do for that

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.610 
pretty much all you have to do for that
I<00:07:08.600> may<00:07:09.600> crush<00:07:09.870> the<00:07:09.990> program<00:07:10.260> now<00:07:10.410> because<00:07:10.560> I

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:10.620 
I may crush the program now because I

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.170 
I may crush the program now because I
think<00:07:10.680> change<00:07:11.250> injected<00:07:11.820> anyway<00:07:12.120> so

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 
think change injected anyway so

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.270 
think change injected anyway so
