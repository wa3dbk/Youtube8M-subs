00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.479 
like cano 10 minutes they sound
literally<00:02:09.000> 10<00:02:09.209> minutes<00:02:09.239> if<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:10.590> can<00:02:10.739> sell<00:02:10.920> 40

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
literally 10 minutes if you can sell 40

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.790 
literally 10 minutes if you can sell 40
if<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.239> can<00:02:12.360> buy<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.660> sell<00:02:12.840> 40

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
if you can buy and sell 40

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.000 
if you can buy and sell 40
in<00:02:13.950> 10<00:02:14.310> minutes<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.850> then<00:02:14.910> 2k<00:02:15.660> in<00:02:16.020> 10<00:02:16.770> minutes

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
in 10 minutes and then 2k in 10 minutes

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.060 
in 10 minutes and then 2k in 10 minutes
that<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:18.290> quite<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.410> good<00:02:19.590> amount<00:02:19.740> of<00:02:19.860> money

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
that is quite a good amount of money

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.380 
that is quite a good amount of money
that's<00:02:20.280> 6<00:02:20.670> times<00:02:21.000> 2<00:02:21.390> k<00:02:21.690> which<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:21.960> 12<00:02:22.620> k<00:02:22.860> so

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
that's 6 times 2 k which is 12 k so

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.270 
that's 6 times 2 k which is 12 k so
quite<00:02:24.390> easily<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:25.080> can<00:02:25.290> earn<00:02:25.440> 12k<00:02:26.070> an<00:02:26.160> hour

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
quite easily you can earn 12k an hour

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.240 
quite easily you can earn 12k an hour
with<00:02:26.550> this<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.270> it's<00:02:27.450> really<00:02:28.010> quite<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.040> good

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
with this so it's really quite a good

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.370 
with this so it's really quite a good
method<00:02:29.400> but<00:02:29.760> again<00:02:30.360> this<00:02:30.570> does<00:02:30.810> change<00:02:30.840> all

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
method but again this does change all

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.530
