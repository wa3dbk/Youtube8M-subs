00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.580
 in the past the engineers made of 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.259
 mercedes the best car that seconds and 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.970
 only then did they stick one 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.590
 price tag on 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.719
 but those times are over because the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.509
 competition has not stood still and 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.310
 will also have to be fought while traveling 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.020
 the Germans nevertheless succeeded 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.859
 of this new c-class 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.859
 to make it a topper 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.450
 first, let's take a good look at that 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.950
 new c class 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.850
 because it is a beautiful car to 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.590
 see 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.590
 both outside and inside 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.290
 yes that's typical mercedes when you get the 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.340
 If you close the door , you also pull one 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.240
 door closed 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.240
 your build quality 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.590
 although there is still some kraakjes in it 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.030
 the interior and in particular the buttons of 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.930
 do the window operation for a car 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.340
 this class actually pretty cheap 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.870
 have those handsome Mercedes heads 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.870
 have to skimp on something 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.170
 fortunately there are no compromises 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.259
 closed when it is on the 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.060
 driving characteristics of the c-class 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.400
 the business sedan used to be mainly used up 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.530
 comfort matched with the arrival of this 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.180
 new generation sends it bands 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.920
 considerably sharper 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.810
 without this being at the expense of the 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.390
 limousine-like qualities 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.490
 why the brand is known in one 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.570
 Mercedes will be a sovereign rest 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.550
 reign 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.550
 also when in one bends into the bend 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.490
 with a starting price of a small 37 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.440
 wheel is the new c-class not the 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.299
 most expensive car in its segment 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.340
 that is nice but when you 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.430
 the car dressed up a bit stupid there 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.560
 soon thousands of euros on top of this 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.100
 test version with the simplest machine 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.240
 engine on board costs already 43,000 euros 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.770
 and then there are not even one 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.470
 options on which the Mercedes 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.420
 history rice 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.159
 the s class has always been it 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.220
 manufacturer's flagship 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.080
 the technology carrier of the future 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.510
 the airbac never debuted on such 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.340
 majestic mercedes 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.140
 it normally takes years for 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.870
 such gadgets find their way to 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.549
 cheaper models but this c-class 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.430
 has affairs from the outset 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.200
 as an independent braking system 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.200
 air suspension and adaptive cruise control 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.840
 with steering assistant that is more independent and 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.030
 system is standard for the others 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.420
 you will be referred to the 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.420
 option list 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.980
 with 480 liters of luggage space 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.780
 Resistance zeeklassen certainly no beacons 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.300
 but he is not inferior to his 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.750
 competitors in the back seat is 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.790
 different 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.150
 the mercedes is more spacious than models like 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:53.819
 the bmw 3 and lexus gs in the footstool 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.819
 at least in the head space does not over 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.560
 The new Mercedes e-class is one 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.090
 beautiful car set the bar 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.340
 for some competition 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.659
 faces higher but our full 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.310
 potential 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.010
 You will be pretty deep in the pouch 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.269
 to dig as previously only 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.269
 that is precisely not the intention
