00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
I just wanted to show you the issue with

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.000 
I just wanted to show you the issue with
this<00:00:06.930> throttle<00:00:07.230> body<00:00:08.929> not<00:00:09.929> only<00:00:09.960> that<00:00:10.410> the

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
this throttle body not only that the

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.390 
this throttle body not only that the
wires<00:00:11.219> are<00:00:11.519> not<00:00:11.840> extremely<00:00:12.840> horrible<00:00:13.400> you

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
wires are not extremely horrible you

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.000 
wires are not extremely horrible you
show<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.849> water's<00:00:15.179> first<00:00:18.320> just<00:00:19.320> some

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
show you the water's first just some

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.220 
show you the water's first just some
light<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:20.490> there<00:00:21.830> okay<00:00:23.930> there<00:00:24.930> are<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> couple

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
light in there okay there are a couple

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.029 
light in there okay there are a couple
of<00:00:25.439> areas<00:00:26.630> that<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.720> focuses<00:00:28.170> here<00:00:28.529> as<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:29.010> can

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
of areas that it focuses here as you can

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.500 
of areas that it focuses here as you can
see<00:00:31.070> here<00:00:32.070> are<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.219> problems<00:00:32.700> there<00:00:32.969> as<00:00:33.329> you

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
see here are the problems there as you

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.030 
see here are the problems there as you
can<00:00:33.660> see<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.020> some<00:00:34.260> wires<00:00:34.469> shorting<00:00:34.890> out

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
can see this some wires shorting out

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.069 
can see this some wires shorting out
right<00:00:35.370> there<00:00:35.640> while<00:00:36.420> they're<00:00:36.690> losing

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
right there while they're losing

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.330 
right there while they're losing
insulation<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.790> obviously<00:00:39.800> if<00:00:40.800> they're<00:00:41.100> bad

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
insulation and obviously if they're bad

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.729 
insulation and obviously if they're bad
here<00:00:41.850> then<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.719> big<00:00:42.899> possibility<00:00:43.590> that

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
here then it's a big possibility that

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.670 
here then it's a big possibility that
they<00:00:43.920> will<00:00:44.070> be<00:00:44.219> bad<00:00:44.489> right<00:00:45.420> over<00:00:45.750> here<00:00:46.020> because

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
they will be bad right over here because

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.920 
they will be bad right over here because
these<00:00:47.010> are<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.149> where<00:00:48.420> wires<00:00:48.690> are

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
these are this is where wires are

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.950 
these are this is where wires are
twisted<00:00:49.460> together<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:51.000> compressed<00:00:51.600> as<00:00:51.809> you

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
twisted together and compressed as you

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.369 
twisted together and compressed as you
can<00:00:52.110> see<00:00:52.379> further<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.129> there<00:00:53.960> this<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.020> where

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
can see further in there this is where

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.130 
can see further in there this is where
they<00:00:55.820> twist<00:00:56.820> around<00:00:57.210> with<00:00:57.480> each<00:00:57.600> other<00:00:57.840> so

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
they twist around with each other so

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.779 
they twist around with each other so
there's<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.440> big<00:00:58.739> probability<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.579> they

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
there's a big probability that they

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:00.950 
there's a big probability that they
short<00:01:00.329> out<00:01:00.539> there

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
short out there

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.439 
short out there
what<00:01:01.739> another<00:01:01.920> issue<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.550> which<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> bigger

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
what another issue is which is a bigger

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.160 
what another issue is which is a bigger
issue<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.680> clutch<00:01:04.920> coil<00:01:05.540> this<00:01:06.540> particular

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
issue is the clutch coil this particular

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.399 
issue is the clutch coil this particular
unit<00:01:07.530> I'll<00:01:08.189> show<00:01:08.460> you

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
unit I'll show you

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.870 
unit I'll show you
actually<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.619> might<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:11.159> another<00:01:11.400> unit<00:01:11.790> that

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
actually I might have another unit that

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.140 
actually I might have another unit that
I<00:01:12.030> can<00:01:12.180> show<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.960> clutch<00:01:13.200> coil

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.830 

that's<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.110> parts<00:01:19.439> throttle<00:01:19.890> body<00:01:20.630> see<00:01:21.630> if<00:01:21.689> this

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
that's a parts throttle body see if this

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.170 
that's a parts throttle body see if this
clutch<00:01:22.080> coil<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.500> good<00:01:22.790> alright<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:23.970> I'm<00:01:24.030> gonna

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
clutch coil is good alright so I'm gonna

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.929 
clutch coil is good alright so I'm gonna
put<00:01:24.960> power<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.820> 9<00:01:26.820> volts<00:01:27.270> for<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> clutch<00:01:28.170> well

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
put power on 9 volts for the clutch well

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.490 
put power on 9 volts for the clutch well
first<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.119> do<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.659> one<00:01:30.869> let's<00:01:31.079> see<00:01:31.259> if<00:01:31.320> this

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
first we do this one let's see if this

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.230 
first we do this one let's see if this
one<00:01:31.710> works<00:01:32.600> yep<00:01:33.630> as<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:34.710> see<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.090> how

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
one works yep as you can see this is how

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.719 
one works yep as you can see this is how
the<00:01:36.270> Quadro<00:01:36.840> should<00:01:37.110> work<00:01:37.380> off<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.549> video

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
the Quadro should work off the video

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.670 
the Quadro should work off the video
picks<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.240> up<00:01:40.610> this<00:01:41.610> part<00:01:41.880> throttle<00:01:42.150> body<00:01:42.680> so

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
picks it up this part throttle body so

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.530 
picks it up this part throttle body so
see<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.950> potentiometers<00:01:44.700> missing<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.509> a

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
see it potentiometers missing this is a

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.710 
see it potentiometers missing this is a
money<00:01:45.990> non<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.290> our<00:01:46.680> unit<00:01:47.210> okay<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.270> here<00:01:48.630> we

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
money non is our unit okay so here we

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.990 
money non is our unit okay so here we
have<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:50.180> you<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.360> hear<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:52.610> watch<00:01:53.610> well

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
have it you can hear it watch well

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.219 
have it you can hear it watch well
engages<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.680> whole<00:01:55.920> plate<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.899> connected<00:01:57.899> to

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
engages this whole plate is connected to

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.850 
engages this whole plate is connected to
the<00:01:58.439> gear

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:10.710 

okay<00:02:03.600> now<00:02:05.070> your<00:02:06.070> throttle<00:02:06.520> body<00:02:09.240> now<00:02:10.240> just<00:02:10.270> to

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
okay now your throttle body now just to

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.200 
okay now your throttle body now just to
show<00:02:10.750> what<00:02:11.290> it's<00:02:11.470> supposed<00:02:11.800> to<00:02:11.920> do<00:02:12.130> here<00:02:13.120> is

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
show what it's supposed to do here is

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.450 
show what it's supposed to do here is
your<00:02:13.360> throttle<00:02:13.540> body<00:02:14.580> absolutely<00:02:15.580> nothing<00:02:17.460> so

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
your throttle body absolutely nothing so

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.510 
your throttle body absolutely nothing so
the<00:02:18.580> clutch<00:02:18.820> coil<00:02:19.180> is<00:02:19.480> bad<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:21.190> is<00:02:21.370> the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
the clutch coil is bad that is the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.480 
the clutch coil is bad that is the
reason<00:02:21.700> why<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.000> saw<00:02:22.450> her<00:02:22.510> will<00:02:22.780> never<00:02:23.050> go<00:02:23.320> away

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
reason why I saw her will never go away

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.810 
reason why I saw her will never go away
because<00:02:24.490> clutch<00:02:25.120> coil<00:02:25.450> does<00:02:25.600> not<00:02:25.810> work<00:02:26.820> see

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
because clutch coil does not work see

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.770 
because clutch coil does not work see
I'm<00:02:27.910> applying<00:02:28.710> power<00:02:29.710> directly<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:30.780> right

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
I'm applying power directly to it right

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.850 
I'm applying power directly to it right
here<00:02:31.960> this<00:02:32.080> two<00:02:32.290> terminals<00:02:32.800> here<00:02:33.130> and

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
here this two terminals here and

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.190 
here this two terminals here and
absolutely<00:02:35.860> nothing<00:02:36.340> happens<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.930> first

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
absolutely nothing happens the first

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.900 
absolutely nothing happens the first
thing<00:02:38.380> I<00:02:38.470> do<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.860> when<00:02:39.040> I<00:02:39.070> get<00:02:39.310> these<00:02:39.490> throttle

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
thing I do is when I get these throttle

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.490 
thing I do is when I get these throttle
bodies<00:02:40.180> in<00:02:40.390> I<00:02:40.510> want<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.870> make<00:02:40.990> sure<00:02:41.020> clutch

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
bodies in I want to make sure clutch
