00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
take software first now let's say you

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.130 
take software first now let's say you
got<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> lot<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.700> choices<00:01:08.909> out<00:01:09.240> there<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.960> is

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
got a lot of choices out there this is

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.200 
got a lot of choices out there this is
not<00:01:10.320> an<00:01:10.619> all-inclusive<00:01:10.979> list<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.880> some

not an all-inclusive list and some

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.280 
not an all-inclusive list and some
programs<00:01:12.600> are<00:01:12.750> going<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.930> be<00:01:13.020> better<00:01:13.140> than

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
programs are going to be better than

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.910 
programs are going to be better than
others<00:01:13.650> but<00:01:14.460> as<00:01:14.640> far<00:01:15.060> as<00:01:15.119> good<00:01:15.510> ones

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920

there are going to say Dreamweavers a

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.320 
there are going to say Dreamweavers a
lot<00:01:22.530> better<00:01:22.680> than<00:01:22.950> front-page<00:01:23.400> have<00:01:24.150> used

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330

both they both work good I actually like
front<00:01:27.450> page<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> little<00:01:27.990> better<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.260> because

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
front page a little better just because
