I<00:00:30.480> think<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.990> valves<00:00:31.320> still<00:00:31.560> need<00:00:31.710> adjustment

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
I think the valves still need adjustment

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.790 
I think the valves still need adjustment
I'm<00:00:32.460> not<00:00:32.610> sure<00:00:32.940> yet<00:00:33.230> it's<00:00:34.230> got<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> straight

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
compression like side lifted valves you

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.960 
compression like side lifted valves you
have<00:03:45.640> stock<00:03:45.940> starter<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:46.690> there<00:03:47.049> we<00:03:47.170> go<00:03:47.970> there

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
have stock starter so there we go there

have stock starter so there we go there
you<00:03:49.030> go<00:04:08.040> roll<00:04:09.040> it<00:04:09.130> backwards

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.400 

there<00:04:27.950> you<00:04:28.040> go<00:04:28.160> folks<00:04:28.730> that<00:04:29.300> be<00:04:29.600> the<00:04:29.630> to<00:04:30.230> come

see<00:04:30.620> still<00:04:30.830> need<00:04:30.980> some<00:04:31.160> fine-tuning<00:04:31.430> but<00:04:32.060> it

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
see still need some fine-tuning but it

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.530 
see still need some fine-tuning but it
does<00:04:32.450> run<00:04:32.780> really<00:04:33.110> powerful<00:04:34.840> so<00:04:35.840> there<00:04:36.290> you<00:04:36.380> go
