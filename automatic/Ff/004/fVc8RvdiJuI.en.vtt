spray<00:01:43.020> actually<00:01:43.500> works<00:01:43.680> just<00:01:43.799> as<00:01:44.070> good<00:01:44.250> deep

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030

don't expect it to work but you know
know<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.829> might<00:02:02.100> help<00:02:02.930> let's<00:02:03.930> get<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.829> heat

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
know it might help let's get the heat

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:17.050 
know it might help let's get the heat
going

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.550

and<00:02:36.560> run<00:02:36.890> or<00:02:37.069> seals<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.930> Cowper<00:02:39.730> that's<00:02:40.730> why<00:02:40.970> I

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
and run or seals and Cowper that's why I

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.619 
and run or seals and Cowper that's why I
pour<00:02:41.450> water<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.780> it

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:56.349 

let's<00:02:45.959> get<00:02:46.200> big<00:02:46.469> hot<00:02:46.769> now<00:02:51.319> the<00:02:54.260> BP<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.739> all

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
let's get big hot now the BP is all

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.869 
let's get big hot now the BP is all
boiling<00:02:57.359> off<00:02:57.980> let's<00:02:58.980> give<00:02:59.219> her<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.370> little<00:02:59.639> shot

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
boiling off let's give her a little shot

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:15.699 
boiling off let's give her a little shot
of<00:02:59.909> water<00:03:06.469> so<00:03:07.469> the<00:03:07.500> water<00:03:08.389> we're<00:03:09.389> off<00:03:11.419> to

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
trying not to get it the water in the

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.559 
trying not to get it the water in the
piston<00:03:18.530> but<00:03:18.760> doesn't<00:03:19.760> matter<00:03:19.879> it's<00:03:20.299> going<00:03:20.480> to

you out of a jam I almost had to pay 100
bucks<00:04:14.510> for<00:04:14.989> a<00:04:15.019> new<00:04:15.139> caliper<00:04:15.789> just<00:04:16.789> because<00:04:17.030> of

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
bucks for a new caliper just because of

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.020 
bucks for a new caliper just because of
that<00:04:17.299> luckily<00:04:17.599> I<00:04:17.780> found<00:04:18.109> a<00:04:18.259> used<00:04:18.410> one<00:04:18.769> and<00:04:19.070> but

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
that luckily I found a used one and but

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.810 
that luckily I found a used one and but
he<00:04:20.090> just<00:04:20.269> give<00:04:20.389> it<00:04:20.479> to<00:04:20.570> me<00:04:20.690> but<00:04:21.530> we<00:04:22.190> figured

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
he just give it to me but we figured

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.510 
he just give it to me but we figured
that<00:04:22.930> it<00:04:23.930> was<00:04:24.080> at<00:04:24.229> a<00:04:24.260> loss<00:04:24.470> didn't<00:04:25.280> think<00:04:25.430> I'd

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
that it was at a loss didn't think I'd

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.500 
that it was at a loss didn't think I'd
get<00:04:25.639> that<00:04:25.849> up<00:04:26.030> but<00:04:26.389> now<00:04:26.840> you<00:04:26.900> know<00:04:27.110> how<00:04:27.289> and

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
get that up but now you know how and

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.430 
get that up but now you know how and
it's<00:04:29.510> good<00:04:29.690> trick<00:04:29.960> very<00:04:30.680> good<00:04:30.889> trick<00:04:32.260> this<00:04:33.260> is

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
it's good trick very good trick this is

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.379 
it's good trick very good trick this is
actually<00:04:33.830> my<00:04:33.979> first<00:04:34.190> time<00:04:34.370> doing<00:04:34.729> it<00:04:34.970> but<00:04:35.180> when

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
actually my first time doing it but when

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.390 
actually my first time doing it but when
I<00:04:35.419> heard<00:04:35.659> it<00:04:35.900> I<00:04:36.020> thought<00:04:36.050> you<00:04:36.979> couldn't<00:04:37.220> go

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
I heard it I thought you couldn't go

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.020 
I heard it I thought you couldn't go
wrong<00:04:37.430> sure<00:04:38.330> enough<00:04:38.690> you<00:04:39.139> can't<00:04:39.729> so<00:04:40.729> there<00:04:40.909> you

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
wrong sure enough you can't so there you

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.290 
wrong sure enough you can't so there you
go<00:04:41.180> there's<00:04:41.780> how<00:04:41.990> you<00:04:42.050> get<00:04:42.500> your<00:04:42.620> brake

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
go there's how you get your brake

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.750 
go there's how you get your brake
bleeder<00:04:44.300> out<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:45.169> first<00:04:45.440> time<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:46.190> easy<00:04:46.400> way

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
bleeder out the first time the easy way

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.480 
bleeder out the first time the easy way
don't<00:04:47.419> break<00:04:47.720> it<00:04:47.930> don't<00:04:48.139> buy<00:04:48.650> a<00:04:48.680> new<00:04:48.919> caliper

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
don't break it don't buy a new caliper

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.370 
don't break it don't buy a new caliper
just<00:04:50.240> take<00:04:50.419> it<00:04:50.599> off<00:04:50.720> and<00:04:50.990> heat<00:04:51.199> the

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
just take it off and heat the

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.170 
just take it off and heat the
ever-living<00:04:52.130> out<00:04:52.310> of<00:04:52.340> that<00:04:52.460> screw<00:04:52.909> and

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
ever-living out of that screw and

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.270 
ever-living out of that screw and
cool<00:04:53.810> it<00:04:54.050> and<00:04:54.169> heat<00:04:54.349> it<00:04:54.500> and<00:04:54.590> cool<00:04:54.770> it<00:04:54.800> so<00:04:55.130> that

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
cool it and heat it and cool it so that

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.010 
cool it and heat it and cool it so that
metal<00:04:55.610> expands<00:04:56.030> contracts<00:04:56.539> expands

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
metal expands contracts expands

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.189 
metal expands contracts expands
contracts<00:04:57.849> then<00:04:58.849> it'll<00:04:59.479> break<00:04:59.599> that<00:04:59.900> bond

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
contracts then it'll break that bond

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.529
