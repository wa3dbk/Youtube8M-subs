 hello my castillito tanin from there my website in this new tutorial and I'm going 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.090
 to teach by changing the icons in the taskbar to improve the appearance 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.179
 of his thesis 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.259
 here of what if it comes out everything still changes theme 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.709
 and the icons that look pretty good 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.170
 and good as gold bentín side of the and with hostel explorer windows 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.329
 Ep pictures in the groin 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.369
 fairfax in culture miguel opera 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.229
 It is in some of the icons that you can change 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:33.680
 good to start we're going to urge the one we were going to visit the presence 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.210
 of a program called that feels confident 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.820
 that is how they are seeing it in so many 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.330
 for this the file amedo applause is sunk 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.410
 half fayed 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.409
 ten years 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:46.440
 servers 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.290
 where you can download them in this case present a notepad open-mouthed 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.230
 with the two billings to the places where he used in the video they were told the 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.610
 the two links to get shot 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.870
 psn is failing 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.340
 ohl from megaupload 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.610
 any is valid 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.650
 you go to the 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.140
 spread the video 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.430
 sensational 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.090
 they can make donations 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.260
 or are displayed in Linux 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.250
 ian kinsler made copy 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.990
 or the other way the cis already have it as linked 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.990
 read the clip and the page was announced 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.990
 we want it to open automatically 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.990
 mearth determined 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.560
 and the mediafax page was announced 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.760
 also how is the clip 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.590
 in this 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.700
 in that sense London city 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.700
 initiated the personality 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.150
 p 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.290
 a flat market 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.810
 It seems to me that the file ethicity side that the Spaniards are to protect 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.420
 mind 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.740
 this is because he makes three and it is nothing but giving him his life of armando sandoval 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.510
 if we go again 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.300
 good when you read scenic glycols that start in the bar 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.349
 addresses 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.079
 feel the attack is given without that why not worry if some 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.529
 problem go to the other in the country and in the same 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:21.709
 so 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.709
 once it is considered that it is served 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.959
 going to say I sent to fail klínger trusal table infirmary fae 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:34.749
 cities here to start loading them on average fae 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:40.619
 and in the debate it does not stop going the seconds that then in shameless normal 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.619
 so in this case I'm going to click here 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:46.599
 and I think this picture 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.450
 of her because if you 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.699
 using 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:53.250
 in to ask if I'm going to open it, I'll give it to save 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.559
 if we have and the fae france is going to be a similar picture 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:59.559
 and they also put you save and not run 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:03.239
 I'm going to save in this case I've been asked where the dissection is 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.669
 warm writer to put the name you want study puts save 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:12.449
 isma start the race in this case those in the term because it is very light 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:13.479
 the decade 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:14.770
 in all his life 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.109
 direct me the criterion will pass 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.610
 I already find the file or enter 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.839
 auto is unzip 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:24.009
 then made klínger girlfriend 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.119
 extract 

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:30.979
 alitalia to extract here we are going to this area this folder 

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:36.779
 in which he says he feels with fayad valencia 3 jul efe - what we are going to do is open 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:40.089
 Folder 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:43.549
 Inés all the components of the city confae 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.909
 so that there yes that if they open coming e type of 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.599
 d topics for you can change the figures 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:53.760
 150 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.760
 see other components that have nothing 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:01.499
 this sm and the nation next to him I know that if the application 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.440
 to this the mass 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.440
 Double click 

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:16.279
 and the program is open to the automaton 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.189
 and in this left part do not appear side and the list of topics that can be 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.099
 ii 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.779
 put for children 

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:29.229
 in my case I have the touch to walk you will come these three by default 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.460
 because he knows if it's the pact 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.740
 without walking, you have to touch lakes 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.689
 and this team does 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:43.549
 had injured one makes sense at this time of my house was wanted 2 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:45.750
 in that scenario 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.159
 on any subject 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:50.080
 and once done this loyalty api 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.979
 it was already going to change for example 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:56.289
 acan estate that follows the preview are some of the many and with the 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:58.020
 what iris change 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.490
 then when he decides the table api 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.969
 this 4 disappears and it is enabled that they 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:08.569
 attitude that they carry 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:10.699
 apply to the taxi driver 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.770
 that day is that the taskbar 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.200
 and it's the healthy menu 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.110
 it's good 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.110
 I'm going to draw that would be the start menu to that support nucleus 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.279
 those of palomero ibarra 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:21.520
 percent in this 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.939
 that day for 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:24.089
 qi 

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:25.270
 to go 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.639
 cr7 not the computer itself, not the explorer, so it sounded Mexican 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.999
 or if you do not put a percent 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:34.120
 the guy today 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.240
 clay on my computer 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.370
 later 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.539
 I in my case will stop until you explore with themes 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.479
 yade asti 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.710
 and without grip besiege 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.919
 installed 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:48.939
 and of course 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:52.310
 it seems to me of paca and to place its empathy 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.349
 that is, he 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:56.710
 it was already applied successfully 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.150
 on tv accept 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.300
 and they know that if nothing changes autonomously automatically 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.600
 and it's very good style let's read 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.710
 a text 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.289
 percent these very good 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:11.169
 what a very good bullet style 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.169
 to your desk I kept everywhere 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:15.710
 and good 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.039
 i also 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:19.400
 I want to take advantage for silence 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.400
 what 

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:26.659
 at least in his guts but yes 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:28.110
 is that they do not know him 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.490
 good if you send it how it is to load it 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.349
 and it's very good 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:34.789
 percent 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:37.360
 good and it will be basically all children 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.569
 that age ran away and I hope it has served you 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:42.089
 we improve the next tutorial
