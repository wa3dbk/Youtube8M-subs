00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
a glider for the character and let's do

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.500 
a glider for the character and let's do
it<00:01:51.330> by<00:01:51.570> adding<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:52.140> capsule<00:01:52.680> Collider<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:54.270> see

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
create an animation controller we had a

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.180 
create an animation controller we had a
project<00:03:08.790> in<00:03:09.120> though<00:03:09.409> simply<00:03:10.409> rename<00:03:10.859> the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
project in though simply rename the

controller

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.080 

then<00:03:19.230> assign<00:03:19.710> it<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:19.890> is<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.670> animated

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
then assign it to is the animated

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.530 
then assign it to is the animated

you<00:03:25.080> need<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.380> do<00:03:25.500> is<00:03:25.740> just<00:03:25.950> drag<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.610> mocap

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
you need to do is just drag the mocap
