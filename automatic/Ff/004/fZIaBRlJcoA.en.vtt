00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.700
 the aesthetics the mood the mood the atmosphere 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.410
 three terms that without seeming 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.089
 in the field of video games tend to 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.610
 describe to the same vagueness ie 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:16.230
 the embedding of a game because one of the real 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.400
 problems of videogame criticism of 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.560
 nowadays is that people who had 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.540
 the habit of having to criticize 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.340
 of a gameplay system on 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.630
 mechanisms that tend to converge towards 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.370
 creating an experience that one 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.380
 live from the fingertips must 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.760
 now turn into criticism 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.189
 of art and all do not necessarily 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.750
 training to do this because talking 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.700
 of citic requires to have a report 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.050
 the aesthetics of being able to talk about it in 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.190
 this episode 6 of a credit show 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.990
 video game from belgium 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.640
 we are going to talk about one of his few 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.980
 games that by the efforts of his 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.230
 aesthetic manages to save gameplay 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.079
 sure enough years to make some 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.600
 something relatively unique but not 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.399
 necessarily completely video game 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.309
 felt will be question this episode 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.670
 6 of a program that I call critical 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.670
 cruel 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.060
 transistor ckoi and ben it's very simple 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.460
 it's a video game independent of 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.899
 Californian that was performed on pc 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.369
 playstation 4 which is available since 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.289
 May 2014 on systems of 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.640
 download or little played with because 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.990
 that decidedly we can play with because 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.759
 this is the goal is to play with 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.649
 but it's one of those games that has decided that he 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.939
 would be more a story told of 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.679
 video game more than a game 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.240
 which has only one gameplay artifice 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.610
 ie this system you can 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.740
 bang on people a bit like I do not 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.090
 do not know me in diablo or pass 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.890
 turn-based in a moment that is 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.500
 totally repack in knights of the 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.959
 old republic you know the rpg that 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.159
 it was a bioware pgi on jedi here 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.509
 there is no jedi but it is not 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.590
 a bad thing because there is a 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.299
 history and history that has you 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.120
 told here told a little bit 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.739
 hard and konÃ© techno bros brawl and 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.209
 it's very cute it's enough millions to 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.319
 look at it is one person who has 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.989
 does all the graphics in this game so 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.340
 we can congratulate the person who did 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.420
 and where the graphics of this game and him 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.980
 give I do not know me a 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.480
 increase so that they can go 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.130
 at the restaurant to pay the good 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.780
 food because it can be very very 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.940
 proud of the graphics of this game its 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.890
 graphics this game are absolutely 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.630
 charming they have a small clinical side 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.400
 cold while being very very things 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.480
 difficult to do and in a point of 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.920
 view of the state of mind of the story 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.019
 we tell you everything in a world 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.430
 dystopian a dumb woman is at the 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.019
 research who knows who it is who is 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.209
 currently in his transistor 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.859
 this bizarre weird and peace that is at 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.810
 his dexter right now and who maybe 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:53.660
 was a lover or someone he 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.310
 knew or friend or ae has that 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.269
 is it happening and that's the scenario 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.250
 and since she is silent 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.959
 even if it was a cantata eh ben we do not 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.670
 do not know why but we're going to look at this 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.290
 happens because she can not 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.609
 talk we have to think about his place and 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.319
 little by little we end up identifying ourselves 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.549
 to the characters in this game that is not 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.620
 not really a guy is actually 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.120
 charming yet and we say good luck 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.250
 it makes sense and the story he tells 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.829
 is here is relatively poignant and 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.269
 by the end of the game you will say yes but 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.980
 all the gameplay weaknesses of this 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.480
 game were filled by a system 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.639
 narrative that works it's very rare 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.350
 to see it's very very rare to have 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.880
 does it make an experience oh that 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.130
 we take pleasure to participate pad in 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.870
 not really hand but the pleasure of this 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.340
 game so it's more to think about which 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.889
 bild one must do in the unbelievable 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.630
 menu because it's actually a pg shareholder 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:37.760
 and when I say to the shareholder pg more 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.590
 maybe an RPG than action 'in 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.540
 the rpg do you see what I mean 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.870
 maybe yes so transistors that's 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.909
 a super jo game 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.860
 games the company that only with his 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.750
 name is looking for some of the trouble this is a 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.690
 game of amira or and Greek kke to savines 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.090
 available on pc playstation 4 in 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.370
 download since May 2014 and at ten 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.290
 10 years by amira to the founding tale 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.329
 of the company super jump games with 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.980
 his companion rather even his mate 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.810
 we would not want to do terrible things 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.269
 mental induction into your mind that 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.890
 is called simone gavin is best known 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.569
 for having worked on bastion the other 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.030
 game of jayan super years games I do not have 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.620
 spoken and command and conquer story on 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.900
 which was game designer know there had 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.030
 at least four game command and conquer 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.130
 free which was done in quick succession 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.510
 bet and he worked on four 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.430
 of them so we have to at least 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.380
 congratulate and in all this the departures 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.850
 Greek savines who made the same games 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.100
 than him because he was pals at the time when 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.720
 he was working at y is now 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.770
 when he wrote the game it's him 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.840
 who wrote the game and it's a game he 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.220
 is written so that's big job 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.180
 it's a game that's perfectly 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.830
 acceptable from a point of view of 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.330
 writing then I would tend to 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.740
 think it's not all about having 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
 nice graphics done by a young lady 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.800
 who's called john zink is mostly 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.669
 worked on grosne rome also it's 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.050
 besides a game that was 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.669
 particularly charming by his 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.630
 compared to the graphics that actually 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.280
 gets to put you in the state 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.270
 of mind that you were in the process of 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.020
 participate in something you 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.090
 have not seen elsewhere 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.500
 gold this game so by the story that tries 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.090
 to tell that they do not arrive 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.099
 always really tell as he 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.479
 would tell and allows some 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.490
 something that is quite rare is to be 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.840
 touching this is not an excellent game 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.849
 in terms of gameplay you will have done 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.289
 certainly turn after figuring out 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.479
 how things modulate her takes to 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:11.099
 about three hours the hard game 6 to 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.360
 8 if you want to take some 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.039
 time to get lost in there is 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.750
 definitely mean this kind of game so 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.310
 actually he managed to interest you 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.669
 maybe even you'd like to go there 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.560
 replay 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.580
 I would not rejoice because I 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.690
 know that I do not have time to re 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.340
 play games I have no time to 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.630
 play new game that I like so 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.979
 it's not an insult to this one 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.720
 it's more the way I work 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.370
 and I would like you to say all this 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.660
 it's supported by music then 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.650
 the music is probably the point the 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.949
 weaker of the game it's still 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.949
 it is done 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.970
 a bit like this for hours it's 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.710
 pretty unbearable but it works 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.060
 it worked with the aesthetics we get 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.800
 says that decidedly when we play a 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.510
 woman who lost her voice and that nana na 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.950
 na na why is the completeness 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.660
 of the game would not have been music this 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.610
 move a little hot and also sacred 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.230
 by darren korb who was precisely 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.880
 known for his work on transistors 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.590
 and bastion what you see these are there 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.120
 a little men bucks of creation 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.650
 American videogame that you see 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.210
 and they are forming themselves 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.920
 have not yet understood the completeness 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.300
 ideas that are called systems of 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.950
 gameplay but he already knows how to make 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.840
 games that are beautiful touching with a 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.670
 narrative system that is taking and that 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.080
 it's not nothing the video game has changed 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.450
 it may be a good thing 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.220
 on the other hand, it is not really new 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.510
 in terms of gameplay and that's a bit 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.980
 sad but that's kind of the question 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.430
 videogame as we see it 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.430
 now
