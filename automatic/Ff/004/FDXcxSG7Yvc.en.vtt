00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:04.079
 3 me 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:13.719
 in the current context of globalization of the planet in developing countries 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.189
 development as in the industrialized countries 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.839
 There was therefore a great need to train engineers who 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:23.300
 scientific knowledge solidays transversal knowledge 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.150
 at the level of recognition of civil engineering was the architectured at the for 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.279
 approach the city 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.899
 at 3 o'clock and she on the scale of batik certainly 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.460
 across the city as the summer theme of its networks and scale 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.439
 of the territory that is to say the interface between cities I arrived here 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.800
 with a project that has already been told to the chain 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.430
 especially cultural in the city 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.240
 an internship we notice a shudder allowed me to refocus 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.590
 goals 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.210
 and two hours 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.920
 to assign a professional project and this internship allowed me to realize that 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.400
 I did not want to go to 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.390
 project management and especially in the public space 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.420
 impressive work in the image of life and especially those spaces that with 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.810
 130 hectares 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.210
 abhisit vejjajiva done 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.219
 this training we want to make sure that young people 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.840
 at the level of sufficient knowledge to model the city 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.340
 and not having fun of the functioning of the city by a management approach of 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.170
 project so they are therefore trained in assistance to mastery of crafting 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.980
 first 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.090
 sister the programming of major works of large investments on 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.080
 the city 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.520
 but they can also work at the level of the project management in phase 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.640
 completion of works 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.479
 operating phase including 40 euros at the time of maintenance of 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.420
 complex technical installations 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.940
 that we find in a city I just 20 minutes and initiates and so 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.470
 these two years before inviting his mechanics to bahrain a way of 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.460
 to work 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.300
 more project oriented 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.780
 and if that I tried to work was also signed to deepen 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.920
 actually wait by choosing various project costs 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.429
 that creates medical students 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.590
 the world to have specific sales professional relations 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.950
 the one that can be used 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.340
 this one counts 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.100
 the next we have is unique in France for the moment although others 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.569
 universities took note of these themes 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.309
 but not from the angle under which we find steve mandanda of the engineer 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:21.469
 so that we are quite discreet schools that can embarrass civil by 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:22.049
 example 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.030
 who will approach our themes but in a much less transversal way
