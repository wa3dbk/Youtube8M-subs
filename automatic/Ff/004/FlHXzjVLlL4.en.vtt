you can enhance the performance of your
lg<00:00:04.560> optimus<00:00:04.589> 4x<00:00:05.100> HD<00:00:05.850> um<00:00:06.680> first<00:00:07.680> step<00:00:07.919> you<00:00:08.160> can

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
lg optimus 4x HD um first step you can

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.339 
lg optimus 4x HD um first step you can
do<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.970> go<00:00:09.179> to<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.420> hidden<00:00:09.660> menu<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.170> enter

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
this code will open the hidden mind you

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.300 
this code will open the hidden mind you
don't<00:00:14.790> have<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.150> put<00:00:15.719> one<00:00:15.900> more<00:00:16.080> hash<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:17.100> end

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
don't have to put one more hash the end

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.870 
don't have to put one more hash the end
then<00:00:18.000> you're<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.570> pin<00:00:19.140> menu<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:20.250> that's

then you're in the pin menu so that's

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.790 
then you're in the pin menu so that's
how<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.449> looks<00:00:21.480> like<00:00:21.810> that's<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.320> hidden<00:00:22.500> menu

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
how it looks like that's the hidden menu

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.720 
how it looks like that's the hidden menu
and<00:00:23.789> then<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.300> menu<00:00:24.630> go<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.590> option<00:00:26.010> MLT

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
and then this menu go to the option MLT

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.220 
and then this menu go to the option MLT
and<00:00:27.619> um<00:00:28.760> actually<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.000> enabled<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:30.929> um

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
and um actually it is enabled but um

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.090 
and um actually it is enabled but um
yeah<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.160> disabled<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.030> before<00:00:33.450> if<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.620> do<00:00:34.860> that

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
yeah I disabled it before if you do that

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.910 
yeah I disabled it before if you do that
you<00:00:35.730> will<00:00:35.880> save<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.149> lot<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.450> RAM<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.290> on<00:00:37.680> your

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
you will save a lot of RAM so on your

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.060 
you will save a lot of RAM so on your
device<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.579> has<00:00:39.210> more<00:00:39.390> space<00:00:39.660> for<00:00:39.719> RAM<00:00:40.680> usage

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
device is has more space for RAM usage

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.410 
device is has more space for RAM usage
and<00:00:41.520> it's<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.750> lot<00:00:42.989> faster<00:00:43.489> so<00:00:44.489> that's<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
and it's a lot faster so that's the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.529 
and it's a lot faster so that's the
first<00:00:45.660> option<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.800> second<00:00:47.160> one<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.579> you

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
first option the second one is you

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.990 
first option the second one is you
should<00:00:49.140> install<00:00:49.649> some<00:00:50.340> different<00:00:50.789> home

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
should install some different home

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.819 
should install some different home
screens<00:00:51.030> though<00:00:51.719> our<00:00:51.870> original<00:00:52.350> home<00:00:52.530> screen

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
screens though our original home screen

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.760 
screens though our original home screen
is<00:00:52.920> really<00:00:53.100> laggy<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:54.030> um<00:00:54.449> Nova<00:00:55.260> Launcher

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
is really laggy but um Nova Launcher

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.680 
is really laggy but um Nova Launcher
or<00:00:55.980> any<00:00:56.219> other<00:00:56.460> home<00:00:56.820> screen<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.210> really

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
or any other home screen is really

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.049 
or any other home screen is really
really<00:00:58.500> faster<00:00:59.370> than<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.730> original<00:00:59.850> one<00:01:00.480> um

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
really faster than the original one um

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.299 
really faster than the original one um
yeah<00:01:03.059> right<00:01:03.480> what<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.989> also<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.680> do<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.070> and

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
down down and here's our well this is

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.560 
down down and here's our well this is
the<00:01:38.880> animation<00:01:39.299> scholar<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.110> windows<00:01:40.530> and

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
the animation scholar of the windows and

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.270 
the animation scholar of the windows and
ya<00:01:42.570> know<00:01:42.600> how<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.259> how<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:43.950> called<00:01:44.100> in

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
ya know how it's how it's called in

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.580 
ya know how it's how it's called in
English<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.820> think<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.270> also<00:01:45.540> scale<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
English but I think it's also scale the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.960 
English but I think it's also scale the
scale<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.460> animation<00:01:48.000> window<00:01:49.790> and<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
scale of the animation window and the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.960 
scale of the animation window and the
animation<00:01:51.420> between<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.170> windows<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
animation between the windows and the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.899 
animation between the windows and the
time<00:01:54.240> viewing<00:01:54.540> animation<00:01:55.350> whatever<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:56.610> would

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
time viewing animation whatever I would

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.810 
time viewing animation whatever I would
recommend<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:58.079> are<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.799> turn<00:01:59.280> all<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.579> them

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
recommend you are to turn all of them

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
really sort of fast and smooth and

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.800 
really sort of fast and smooth and
really<00:02:12.989> easy<00:02:13.290> to

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
really easy to

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.050 
really easy to
good<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.260> use<00:02:14.500> is<00:02:14.680> good<00:02:14.830> performance<00:02:15.370> now<00:02:15.640> so

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
good to use is good performance now so

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.510 
good to use is good performance now so
it's<00:02:16.300> really<00:02:16.450> fun<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:16.750> use<00:02:17.020> it<00:02:17.170> again<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.650> not

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
it's really fun to use it again and not

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.240 
it's really fun to use it again and not
laggy<00:02:18.790> like<00:02:19.510> before<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:20.170> it's<00:02:20.830> pretty<00:02:21.010> cool

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
laggy like before so it's pretty cool
