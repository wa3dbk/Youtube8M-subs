00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
and we will figure out the rest of it

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.359 
and we will figure out the rest of it
later<00:00:17.270> how<00:00:18.270> we<00:00:18.330> want<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.840> decorate<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.320> now<00:00:20.100> I'm

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
later how we want to decorate it now I'm

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.830 
later how we want to decorate it now I'm
looking<00:00:20.699> at<00:00:20.850> this<00:00:20.970> bow<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.210> thinking<00:00:21.689> it's

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
looking at this bow and thinking it's

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.720 
looking at this bow and thinking it's
really<00:00:22.230> pretty<00:00:22.410> full<00:00:22.769> now<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.430> have<00:00:23.699> a

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
really pretty full now so I have a

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.980 
really pretty full now so I have a
choice<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:25.109> either<00:00:25.470> using<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:26.039> polka<00:00:26.640> dot

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
choice of of either using this polka dot

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.359 
choice of of either using this polka dot
which<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.140> think<00:00:28.380> maybe<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.859> little<00:00:28.949> bit<00:00:29.189> too

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
which I think maybe is a little bit too

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.020 
which I think maybe is a little bit too
loud<00:00:29.609> or<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.970> little<00:00:30.869> bit<00:00:30.990> larger<00:00:31.920> ribbon<00:00:32.219> for

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
loud or a little bit larger ribbon for

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.530 
loud or a little bit larger ribbon for
just<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.300> smaller<00:00:33.600> center<00:00:34.020> bow<00:00:34.790> which<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:36.059> a

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
just a smaller center bow which is a

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.479 
just a smaller center bow which is a
little<00:00:37.290> more<00:00:37.469> subtle<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.070> think<00:00:38.309> that's

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
little more subtle and I think that's

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.700 
little more subtle and I think that's
what<00:00:38.700> I'm<00:00:38.790> going<00:00:39.000> off<00:00:39.149> for<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.260> actually

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
what I'm going off for this is actually

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.850 
what I'm going off for this is actually
a<00:00:41.360> 1.5<00:00:42.360> inch<00:00:42.719> ribbon<00:00:44.660> and<00:00:45.660> I'm<00:00:46.320> just<00:00:46.500> going<00:00:46.680> to

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
a 1.5 inch ribbon and I'm just going to

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.360 
a 1.5 inch ribbon and I'm just going to
use<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.520> think<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.360> small<00:00:48.690> small<00:00:49.530> tight<00:00:49.890> bow<00:00:50.129> now

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
use I think a small small tight bow now

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.209 
use I think a small small tight bow now
out<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:51.059> one<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:52.379> let<00:00:52.649> me<00:00:52.739> put<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.920> one

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
out of this one so let me put this one

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.020 
out of this one so let me put this one
aside<00:00:53.340> momentarily<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:55.579> remember<00:00:56.579> I've<00:00:56.820> left

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
aside momentarily and remember I've left

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.000 
aside momentarily and remember I've left
the<00:00:57.210> wires<00:00:57.449> sticking<00:00:57.870> out<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.199> front<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.890> this

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the wires sticking out the front of this

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.099 
the wires sticking out the front of this
bow<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.760> catch<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.510> bow<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
bow so that I can catch this bow in the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.979 
bow so that I can catch this bow in the
final<00:01:01.440> bow<00:01:02.030> once<00:01:03.030> again<00:01:03.210> i'm<00:01:03.480> going<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.840> leave

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
final bow once again i'm going to leave

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.080 
final bow once again i'm going to leave
quite<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> bit<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.769> length<00:01:04.979> even<00:01:05.670> though<00:01:05.820> i<00:01:05.850> may

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
quite a bit of length even though i may

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.899 
quite a bit of length even though i may
not<00:01:06.270> end<00:01:06.600> up<00:01:06.720> deciding<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.290> use<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.860> much<00:01:08.070> but

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
not end up deciding to use that much but

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.550 
not end up deciding to use that much but
it's<00:01:09.360> better<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.689> have<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.869> there<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.110> can't

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
it's better to have it there you can't

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.910 
it's better to have it there you can't
add<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.950> back<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.400> once<00:01:11.670> you've<00:01:11.850> cut<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.470> so<00:01:13.470> now

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
add it back in once you've cut it so now

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.960 
add it back in once you've cut it so now
we're<00:01:14.189> going<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.610> make<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.790> small<00:01:15.270> bow<00:01:16.759> that's<00:01:17.759> a

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
we're going to make a small bow that's a

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.370 
we're going to make a small bow that's a
little<00:01:18.090> tighter<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.780> has<00:01:18.930> got<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> lot<00:01:19.229> of

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
little tighter this has got a lot of

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.990 
little tighter this has got a lot of
nice<00:01:19.560> glitter<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.670> going<00:01:20.909> to

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
nice glitter on it so it's going to

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.109 
nice glitter on it so it's going to
really<00:01:21.119> bring<00:01:21.420> out<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:22.280> sparkle<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.880> gold

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
little for little turns out of here and

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.030 
little for little turns out of here and
let's<00:01:39.900> see<00:01:40.320> what<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.680> looking<00:01:41.070> like<00:01:43.040> one

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
let's see what that is looking like one

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.740 
let's see what that is looking like one
two<00:01:44.840> three<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.140> four<00:01:47.090> now<00:01:48.090> we'll<00:01:48.270> wire<00:01:48.509> this

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
back around the front in between all

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.810 
back around the front in between all
those<00:02:44.170> legs<00:02:44.650> in<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:44.980> center<00:02:45.280> there<00:02:45.490> and<00:02:47.820> we're

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
those legs in the center there and we're

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.150 
those legs in the center there and we're
going<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.030> catch<00:02:49.330> it<00:02:50.580> behind<00:02:51.580> here<00:02:51.940> in<00:02:53.160> this

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
going to catch it behind here in this

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.680 
going to catch it behind here in this
nice<00:02:54.400> long<00:02:55.030> wire<00:02:56.790> there's<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.940> 24<00:02:58.360> hanging

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
nice long wire there's the 24 hanging

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.100 
nice long wire there's the 24 hanging
and<00:02:58.980> here's<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.280> two<00:03:00.850> long<00:03:01.090> ones<00:03:01.270> we're<00:03:01.989> going

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
and here's the two long ones we're going

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.020 
and here's the two long ones we're going
to<00:03:02.170> go<00:03:02.320> behind<00:03:02.500> that<00:03:03.040> we're<00:03:03.640> going<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:03.790> pull<00:03:04.000> it

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
to go behind that we're going to pull it

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.270 
to go behind that we're going to pull it
fairly<00:03:04.570> tight<00:03:05.080> but<00:03:05.470> not<00:03:05.500> too<00:03:05.650> tight<00:03:05.890> because

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
fairly tight but not too tight because

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.830 
fairly tight but not too tight because
we<00:03:06.550> don't<00:03:06.700> want<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:06.910> smash<00:03:07.180> all<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.480> rest<00:03:07.660> of

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
we don't want to smash all the rest of

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.040 
we don't want to smash all the rest of
it<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.470> we'll<00:03:08.560> go<00:03:08.680> in<00:03:08.920> between<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:10.690> legs<00:03:10.900> of

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
it and we'll go in between the legs of

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.150 
it and we'll go in between the legs of
that<00:03:11.260> wire<00:03:11.500> too<00:03:11.800> so<00:03:12.550> now<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:13.360> long<00:03:13.630> wires<00:03:14.160> we

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
that wire too so now the long wires we

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.630 
that wire too so now the long wires we
will<00:03:15.340> now<00:03:15.489> cross<00:03:16.209> those<00:03:16.630> together<00:03:17.519> get<00:03:18.519> them

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
will now cross those together get them

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.460 
will now cross those together get them
fairly<00:03:19.180> tight<00:03:19.570> and<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:22.510> I'm<00:03:22.870> going<00:03:23.170> to<00:03:23.260> turn

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
fairly tight and and I'm going to turn

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.970 
fairly tight and and I'm going to turn
it<00:03:23.680> this<00:03:23.860> way<00:03:23.920> so<00:03:24.910> that<00:03:24.940> I<00:03:25.150> can<00:03:25.590> manipulate<00:03:26.590> it

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
it this way so that I can manipulate it

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.380 
it this way so that I can manipulate it
with<00:03:27.100> my<00:03:27.250> right<00:03:27.430> hand<00:03:27.459> once<00:03:27.910> again<00:03:28.209> i'm

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
with my right hand once again i'm

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.970 
with my right hand once again i'm
holding<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.780> wires<00:03:29.080> and<00:03:29.410> turning<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.830> bow

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
holding the wires and turning the bow

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.040 
holding the wires and turning the bow
because<00:03:30.400> it's<00:03:30.580> easier<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:32.350> get<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.560> nice<00:03:32.800> tight

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
because it's easier to get a nice tight

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.120 
because it's easier to get a nice tight
tight<00:03:35.050> bow<00:03:35.260> that<00:03:35.530> way<00:03:35.680> now<00:03:37.590> we<00:03:38.590> can<00:03:38.800> take<00:03:38.980> these

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
tight bow that way now we can take these

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.070 
tight bow that way now we can take these
other<00:03:39.370> two<00:03:39.610> wires<00:03:39.850> and<00:03:40.180> wrap<00:03:40.690> them<00:03:41.019> around

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
other two wires and wrap them around

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.190 
other two wires and wrap them around
nice<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.680> tight<00:03:42.100> too<00:03:42.450> now<00:03:43.450> we<00:03:43.510> actually<00:03:44.019> have

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
nice and tight too now we actually have

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.229 
nice and tight too now we actually have
four<00:03:44.500> wires<00:03:44.800> that<00:03:45.010> we<00:03:45.130> can<00:03:45.310> use<00:03:45.340> to<00:03:45.550> hang<00:03:46.030> this

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
four wires that we can use to hang this

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.199 
four wires that we can use to hang this
bow<00:03:46.890> although<00:03:47.890> if<00:03:48.130> you<00:03:48.280> don't<00:03:48.610> need<00:03:48.880> them<00:03:49.030> and

don't<00:03:49.570> want<00:03:49.840> them<00:03:49.959> you<00:03:50.050> can<00:03:50.230> cut<00:03:50.440> them<00:03:50.560> off<00:03:50.709> if

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
don't want them you can cut them off if

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.190 
don't want them you can cut them off if

taste now what I would like to do is
actually<00:05:21.450> bring<00:05:22.450> these<00:05:22.630> together<00:05:22.870> a<00:05:23.580> little

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
actually bring these together a little

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:31.980 
actually bring these together a little
bit<00:05:25.260> but<00:05:26.730> let's<00:05:27.730> hang<00:05:27.940> it<00:05:28.120> here<00:05:30.600> let's<00:05:31.600> sort

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
bit but let's hang it here let's sort

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:38.010 
bit but let's hang it here let's sort
these<00:05:32.169> out<00:05:32.440> a<00:05:32.500> little<00:05:32.740> bit<00:05:32.970> and<00:05:35.250> then<00:05:36.840> we<00:05:37.840> can

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.220 
these out a little bit and then we can
begin<00:05:38.880> once<00:05:39.880> we<00:05:40.000> get<00:05:40.120> it<00:05:40.270> sorted<00:05:40.540> and<00:05:40.810> how<00:05:41.169> you

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.230 
begin once we get it sorted and how you

like it and begin trimming things and
let's<00:05:46.480> start<00:05:46.810> by<00:05:46.990> the<00:05:47.050> biggest<00:05:47.500> one<00:05:49.140> we<00:05:50.140> can

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
let's start by the biggest one we can

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.659 
let's start by the biggest one we can
either<00:05:50.500> trim<00:05:50.830> up<00:05:51.840> or<00:05:52.840> down<00:05:53.530> at<00:05:53.830> angles<00:05:54.220> I<00:05:54.370> like

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
either trim up or down at angles I like

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.280

to<00:05:54.850> trim<00:05:55.120> where<00:05:55.630> I<00:05:55.660> start<00:05:56.050> on<00:05:56.169> the<00:05:56.229> outside

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290 
to trim where I start on the outside

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.330 
to trim where I start on the outside
edge<00:05:56.800> and<00:05:56.830> go<00:05:57.220> up<00:05:57.490> to<00:05:57.760> the<00:05:58.330> center<00:05:59.160> and<00:06:00.160> make
