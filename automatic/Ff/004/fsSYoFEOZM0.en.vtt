no<00:00:00.329> I<00:00:00.359> have<00:00:00.659> not<00:00:00.900> invented<00:00:01.530> a<00:00:01.620> cloning<00:00:02.040> machine

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
no I have not invented a cloning machine

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.280 
no I have not invented a cloning machine
to<00:00:02.850> come<00:00:03.060> up<00:00:03.210> with<00:00:03.360> this<00:00:03.510> comparison<00:00:03.929> which

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
to come up with this comparison which

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.289 
to come up with this comparison which
we're<00:00:04.470> actually<00:00:04.710> looking<00:00:05.279> at<00:00:05.400> is<00:00:05.580> two

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
we're actually looking at is two

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.660 
we're actually looking at is two
separate<00:00:06.899> models<00:00:07.319> of<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.620> MacBook<00:00:07.890> Air<00:00:08.429> and

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
separate models of the MacBook Air and

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.970 
separate models of the MacBook Air and
even<00:00:09.210> though<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.570> 2014<00:00:10.380> version<00:00:10.620> of<00:00:10.860> the

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
even though the 2014 version of the

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.999 
even though the 2014 version of the
MacBook<00:00:11.370> Air<00:00:11.550> is<00:00:12.139> identical<00:00:13.139> physically<00:00:13.799> to

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
MacBook Air is identical physically to

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.189 
MacBook Air is identical physically to
its<00:00:14.190> previous<00:00:14.480> counterpart<00:00:15.480> we're<00:00:15.990> going<00:00:16.139> to

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
its previous counterpart we're going to

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.230 
its previous counterpart we're going to
see<00:00:16.440> whether<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.920> minor<00:00:17.250> upgrades<00:00:17.820> inside

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
see whether the minor upgrades inside

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.510 
see whether the minor upgrades inside
translate<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.350> any<00:00:19.529> real-world<00:00:20.220> performance

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
translate to any real-world performance

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.880 
translate to any real-world performance
differences<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:21.810> without<00:00:22.260> any<00:00:22.410> further<00:00:22.590> ado

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
differences so without any further ado

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.720 
differences so without any further ado
let's<00:00:22.920> get<00:00:23.279> right<00:00:23.490> into<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:23.850> comparison<00:00:25.730> now

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
let's get right into this comparison now

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.250 
let's get right into this comparison now
in<00:00:26.789> terms<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.119> specification<00:00:27.930> we're<00:00:28.080> going<00:00:28.199> to

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
in terms of specification we're going to

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.290 
in terms of specification we're going to
be<00:00:28.380> really<00:00:28.680> pulling<00:00:29.099> out<00:00:29.220> our<00:00:29.400> hair<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:30.060> find

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
be really pulling out our hair to find

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.359 
be really pulling out our hair to find
any<00:00:30.539> kind<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.080> real<00:00:31.320> differences<00:00:31.920> between

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
any kind of real differences between

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.670 
any kind of real differences between
these<00:00:32.790> two<00:00:33.000> computers<00:00:33.510> basically<00:00:34.260> from<00:00:34.530> a

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
these two computers basically from a

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.069 
these two computers basically from a
physical<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.550> internal<00:00:36.180> standpoint<00:00:36.750> they're

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
physical and internal standpoint they're

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.410 
physical and internal standpoint they're
both<00:00:37.290> using<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> same<00:00:38.129> architecture<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.030> the

both using the same architecture and the
same<00:00:39.750> overall<00:00:40.170> specifications<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.489> both<00:00:41.670> have

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
same overall specifications so both have

a couple of minutes the only thing I

a couple of minutes the only thing I
kind<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.469> hoped<00:00:55.710> for<00:00:55.949> was<00:00:56.219> an<00:00:56.370> update<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
kind of hoped for was an update to the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.209 
kind of hoped for was an update to the
Thunderbolt<00:00:57.660> connection<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.559> 2014

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
Thunderbolt connection on the 2014

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.950 
Thunderbolt connection on the 2014
edition<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.969> unfortunately<00:01:00.510> still<00:01:00.719> have

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
edition but unfortunately still have

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.020 
edition but unfortunately still have
Thunderbolt<00:01:01.500> 1<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:02.039> really<00:01:02.609> wish<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.789> they

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
Thunderbolt 1 I really wish that they

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.450 
Thunderbolt 1 I really wish that they
put<00:01:03.210> Thunderbolt<00:01:03.809> 2<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.530> we<00:01:04.680> can<00:01:04.710> get<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.159> full

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
put Thunderbolt 2 so we can get the full

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.490 
put Thunderbolt 2 so we can get the full
20<00:01:05.909> megabits<00:01:06.390> per<00:01:06.540> second<00:01:07.020> for<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> higher

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
20 megabits per second for a higher

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.830 
20 megabits per second for a higher
bandwidth<00:01:08.010> data<00:01:08.280> transferring<00:01:08.850> speeds<00:01:09.270> but

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
bandwidth data transferring speeds but

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.740 
bandwidth data transferring speeds but
for<00:01:10.290> many<00:01:10.740> people<00:01:11.100> who<00:01:11.250> do<00:01:11.430> not<00:01:11.460> have

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
for many people who do not have

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.630 
for many people who do not have
Thunderbolt<00:01:12.750> compliant<00:01:13.290> devices<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:14.280> may

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
Thunderbolt compliant devices that may

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.429 
Thunderbolt compliant devices that may
be<00:01:14.700> really<00:01:15.299> no<00:01:15.509> big<00:01:15.930> deal

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
be really no big deal

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.530 
be really no big deal
now<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.860> only<00:01:17.070> real<00:01:17.340> difference<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.360> we

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
now the only real difference is that we

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.469 
now the only real difference is that we
now<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:19.439> higher<00:01:20.250> clock<00:01:20.640> CPU<00:01:21.210> than

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
now have a higher clock CPU than

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.109 
now have a higher clock CPU than
previously<00:01:22.049> our<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.350> 5<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.400> now<00:01:23.610> clocked<00:01:23.970> in

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
previously our I 5 is now clocked in

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.420 
previously our I 5 is now clocked in
about<00:01:24.330> 1.4<00:01:25.049> gigahertz<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.009> turbo<00:01:26.280> up

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
about 1.4 gigahertz and it can turbo up

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.819 
about 1.4 gigahertz and it can turbo up
to<00:01:26.580> 1.7<00:01:27.420> gigahertz<00:01:27.900> which<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.619> about<00:01:28.770> a

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
to 1.7 gigahertz which is about a

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.340 
to 1.7 gigahertz which is about a
hundred<00:01:29.100> megahertz<00:01:29.880> difference<00:01:30.570> from<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
hundred megahertz difference from the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.010 
hundred megahertz difference from the
2013<00:01:32.130> edition<00:01:32.340> furthermore<00:01:33.119> both<00:01:33.420> computers

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
2013 edition furthermore both computers

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.510 
2013 edition furthermore both computers
are<00:01:34.259> still<00:01:34.380> using<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.009> has<00:01:35.250> walled

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
are still using the has walled

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.450 
are still using the has walled
architecture<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.630> they<00:01:36.780> both<00:01:36.930> have<00:01:37.170> HD<00:01:37.710> 5000

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.280 
architecture so they both have HD 5000
series<00:01:38.490> graphics<00:01:39.090> unfortunately<00:01:39.780> do<00:01:39.900> not<00:01:40.079> see

big deal because based on our previous

big deal because based on our previous
experiences<00:01:49.259> with<00:01:49.320> iris<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.280> really<00:01:50.610> need<00:01:50.790> a

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
experiences with iris you really need a

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.539 
experiences with iris you really need a
higher-end<00:01:51.299> CPU<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.530> see<00:01:52.680> really<00:01:53.040> any<00:01:53.070> big

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
the most peculiar and interesting

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.140 
the most peculiar and interesting
experience<00:02:32.530> I<00:02:32.650> had<00:02:32.950> benchmarking<00:02:33.730> these<00:02:33.909> two

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
experience I had benchmarking these two

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.210 
experience I had benchmarking these two
was<00:02:34.720> definitely<00:02:35.319> during<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.650> Blackmagic

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
was definitely during the Blackmagic

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.670 
was definitely during the Blackmagic
speed<00:02:36.519> test<00:02:36.819> interestingly<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.840> actually<00:02:38.319> got

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
speed test interestingly I actually got

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.830 
speed test interestingly I actually got
faster<00:02:39.250> speeds<00:02:39.640> when<00:02:40.000> it<00:02:40.120> came<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.599> right

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
faster speeds when it came to the right

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.649 
faster speeds when it came to the right
test<00:02:41.109> we<00:02:41.260> got<00:02:41.439> over<00:02:41.680> 400<00:02:42.189> on<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:43.209> older

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
test we got over 400 on the older

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.680 
test we got over 400 on the older
version<00:02:44.079> of<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.349> MacBook<00:02:44.799> Air<00:02:44.829> and<00:02:45.189> over<00:02:45.970> 300

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
version of the MacBook Air and over 300

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.259 
version of the MacBook Air and over 300
on<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:46.930> new<00:02:47.349> version<00:02:47.859> now<00:02:48.220> interestingly<00:02:48.579> we

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
on the new version now interestingly we

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.170 
on the new version now interestingly we
are<00:02:49.510> still<00:02:49.840> getting<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.829> same<00:02:50.859> arethe<00:02:51.790> speeds

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
are still getting the same arethe speeds

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.990 
are still getting the same arethe speeds
over<00:02:52.620> 700<00:02:53.620> megabytes<00:02:54.129> per<00:02:54.370> second<00:02:54.879> and

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
over 700 megabytes per second and

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.210 
over 700 megabytes per second and
probably<00:02:55.900> one<00:02:55.989> of<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.109> reasons<00:02:56.500> for<00:02:56.560> this<00:02:56.829> is

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
probably one of the reasons for this is

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.099 
probably one of the reasons for this is
apple's<00:02:58.120> supplier<00:02:58.959> if<00:02:59.439> our<00:02:59.739> SSD<00:03:00.129> is<00:03:00.310> probably

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
apple's supplier if our SSD is probably

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.270 
apple's supplier if our SSD is probably
manufacturing<00:03:02.109> their<00:03:02.260> memory<00:03:02.680> modules<00:03:03.099> a

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
manufacturing their memory modules a

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.520 
manufacturing their memory modules a
little<00:03:03.760> bit<00:03:03.849> differently<00:03:04.359> than<00:03:04.780> last<00:03:05.170> year

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
little bit differently than last year

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.110 
little bit differently than last year
and<00:03:05.680> perhaps<00:03:06.069> they're<00:03:06.459> doing<00:03:06.670> something<00:03:06.909> to

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
and perhaps they're doing something to

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.390 
and perhaps they're doing something to
save<00:03:07.569> some<00:03:07.870> cost<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.500> that's<00:03:08.950> why<00:03:09.189> we're

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
save some cost and that's why we're

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.000 
save some cost and that's why we're
sacrificing<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.299> little<00:03:10.540> bit<00:03:10.870> of<00:03:11.109> the<00:03:11.409> right

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
sacrificing a little bit of the right

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.770 
sacrificing a little bit of the right
performance<00:03:12.430> but<00:03:12.879> in<00:03:13.000> terms<00:03:13.150> of<00:03:13.299> read<00:03:13.540> it's

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
performance but in terms of read it's

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.179 
performance but in terms of read it's
pretty<00:03:13.959> much<00:03:14.109> there<00:03:14.319> now<00:03:14.470> from<00:03:14.829> a<00:03:14.980> more

benchmark<00:03:50.079> and<00:03:50.290> take<00:03:51.099> a<00:03:51.129> look<00:03:51.370> at<00:03:51.519> you<00:03:51.639> as<00:03:51.699> you

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
can see over here we're pretty much

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.039 
can see over here we're pretty much

but<00:04:07.750> that's<00:04:07.900> really<00:04:08.049> it<00:04:08.169> guys<00:04:08.440> there's<00:04:08.680> really

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
but that's really it guys there's really

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.369 
but that's really it guys there's really
not<00:04:09.099> a<00:04:09.159> whole<00:04:09.400> lot<00:04:09.609> to<00:04:09.639> discuss<00:04:10.239> since<00:04:10.930> you're

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
not a whole lot to discuss since you're

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.080 
not a whole lot to discuss since you're
pretty<00:04:11.590> much<00:04:11.829> going<00:04:12.010> to<00:04:12.069> be<00:04:12.190> out<00:04:12.370> of<00:04:12.400> your<00:04:12.760> head

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
pretty much going to be out of your head

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.490 
pretty much going to be out of your head
to<00:04:13.599> upgrade<00:04:14.079> from<00:04:14.290> a<00:04:14.470> 2013<00:04:15.370> to<00:04:16.090> a<00:04:16.120> 2014<00:04:17.049> there's

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
to upgrade from a 2013 to a 2014 there's

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.560 
to upgrade from a 2013 to a 2014 there's
really<00:04:17.829> not<00:04:18.459> much<00:04:18.699> of<00:04:18.760> a<00:04:18.940> difference<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:19.449> in

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
really not much of a difference and in

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.500 
really not much of a difference and in
some<00:04:19.810> cases<00:04:20.079> the<00:04:20.650> older<00:04:21.039> version<00:04:21.519> is<00:04:21.760> faster

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
some cases the older version is faster

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.940 
some cases the older version is faster
when<00:04:22.690> we<00:04:22.779> take<00:04:22.960> a<00:04:22.990> look<00:04:23.139> at<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:23.349> SSD

performance<00:04:24.639> but<00:04:25.389> the<00:04:25.479> interesting<00:04:25.930> thing<00:04:26.200> is

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
performance but the interesting thing is

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:26.720 
performance but the interesting thing is
if

thankfully this new version is actually

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.150 
thankfully this new version is actually
$100<00:04:33.450> cheaper<00:04:33.690> so<00:04:34.230> that<00:04:34.410> might<00:04:34.620> be<00:04:34.650> something
