00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.440 

for<00:01:06.860> us<00:01:06.950> to<00:01:07.100> be<00:01:07.220> a<00:01:07.250> part<00:01:07.580> if<00:01:07.820> something<00:01:08.240> did

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
for us to be a part if something did

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.700 
for us to be a part if something did
happen<00:01:09.280> then<00:01:10.280> at<00:01:10.370> least<00:01:11.140> you<00:01:12.140> know<00:01:12.260> one<00:01:12.470> of<00:01:12.560> us

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
happen then at least you know one of us

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.370 
happen then at least you know one of us
would<00:01:14.140> survive<00:01:16.720> it<00:01:17.720> just<00:01:17.930> seems<00:01:18.110> like<00:01:18.170> if

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
would survive it just seems like if

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.420 
would survive it just seems like if
we're<00:01:18.500> gonna<00:01:18.620> go<00:01:18.860> we<00:01:19.040> should<00:01:19.190> go<00:01:19.220> together

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
we're gonna go we should go together

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.750 
we're gonna go we should go together
well<00:01:20.270> not<00:01:20.510> necessarily

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.360 

almost<00:01:26.450> seems<00:01:26.659> a<00:01:26.750> little<00:01:28.180> selfish<00:01:30.310> that<00:01:31.310> you

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
almost seems a little selfish that you

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:40.510 
almost seems a little selfish that you
would<00:01:31.640> want<00:01:31.880> both<00:01:32.690> of<00:01:32.720> us<00:01:33.050> to<00:01:35.140> perish

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.730 

say<00:01:41.150> you'd<00:01:41.330> be<00:01:41.510> fine<00:01:41.720> going<00:01:42.140> on<00:01:42.260> without<00:01:42.590> me

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
say you'd be fine going on without me

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.590 
say you'd be fine going on without me
well<00:01:45.740> it<00:01:45.920> would<00:01:46.070> be<00:01:47.710> very<00:01:48.710> difficult<00:01:49.600> person

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
well it would be very difficult person

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.890 
well it would be very difficult person
sure<00:01:51.530> but<00:01:52.450> hopefully<00:01:53.450> I<00:01:53.869> could<00:01:54.200> at<00:01:54.770> some<00:01:54.800> point

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
sure but hopefully I could at some point

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.460 
sure but hopefully I could at some point
get<00:01:56.900> back<00:01:57.110> some<00:01:57.409> semblance<00:01:57.650> of<00:01:58.130> a<00:01:58.190> life
