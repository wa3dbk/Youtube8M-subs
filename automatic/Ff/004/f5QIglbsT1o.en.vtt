00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:08.410
 How are your friends presenting my motorcycle? 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:09.850
 This is a pulsar 200 ms 2014 model 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.910
 to buy 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.320
 at the beginning of 2013 these are the first 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.560
 put 200 goods that came to 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.560
 Colombia 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.920
 let's go then 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.050
 the motorbike 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.830
 let's start here this is the 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.800
 suspension stabilizer this motorbike 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.170
 it seemed to me that from factory in 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.320
 front train is a bit a bit 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.930
 unstable and the bike in fast corners 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:45.650
 move a lot with this stabilizer 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.930
 helped a little change the axis of the 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.080
 bars that put a liquid a little bit 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.080
 plus 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.100
 and helped what 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.510
 out a little more stable forward 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.559
 because she is ahead 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.549
 It is very weak to have him 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.549
 conversion to handlebar 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.390
 greater ability have liked me has 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.240
 really liked the bike with this handlebar 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.610
 how this behaves better is handled 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.940
 better is much more comfortable 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.680
 it is not wider than original way 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.290
 what facilitated passing between cars 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.840
 but if you feel the bike much more 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.000
 stable 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.160
 besides that it also reads 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.670
 the bars are a little higher up as 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.310
 we can see here the bars are more or 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.990
 minus five centimeters above what 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.290
 helps the front train lower a 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.280
 a little more 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.810
 and that makes 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.850
 that the center of serious to the motorcycle goes down 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.960
 it helps a lot in the curves how do you 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.960
 you feel much more stable 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.140
 let's continue here and I have these 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.430
 these grips or maniguetas seem very 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.400
 good very soft 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.550
 have this this part that rests 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.130
 rest hands 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.030
 easily that I have are cams that is 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.030
 a retractable levar 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.569
 very useful in these relapses I like 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.720
 a lot because it makes braking a lot easier 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.570
 why 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.350
 as well as more leverage then it remains 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.610
 much more 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.310
 studies for example there is much more 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.560
 soft 'we are 40,000 kilometers 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.270
 with 22,500 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.270
 and sweetie, I say the wand 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.550
 we go for the interesting part and racing 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.470
 what is racing here 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.810
 well it's a set of accessories that 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.410
 improve the performance of the motorcycle 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.120
 let's start with ground street 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.180
 you want religion relationship 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.540
 45 16 what is the balanced relationship 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.490
 each other speed with this relationship I 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.890
 I took out we are a maximum of 160 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.920
 kilometers per hour and it improves immensely 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.110
 the acceleration 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.870
 the acceleration obviously that combined 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.709
 with the other accessories of the other is the 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.530
 cayenne filter that on this bike goes 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:18.550
 under the tank is a filter that 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.760
 allows a greater air flow what can 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.450
 increase acceleration 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.120
 considerably 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.640
 let's go on with the spark plugs we're 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.430
 making iridium buoys there are many 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.599
 that a more intense spark and last 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.360
 four times more than the bags 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:38.940
 the conventional highly recommend 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.940
 let's continue with the exhaust system the 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.180
 system sap pool system comes in steel 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:48.020
 stainless exist that has complete the 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.020
 tube 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.770
 that we won with this we suppressed the leader 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.200
 the catalyst that brings the motorcycle is a 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.080
 sort of honeycomb filter that 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.890
 greatly restricts gas output 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.860
 when we are not having the entry of the 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.870
 street air filter facilitating the 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.560
 entrance and this escape facilitating the 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.239
 exit 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.880
 this is going to allow the engine to go up 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.459
 revolutions much faster as see 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.370
 this the new exhaust no longer comes with 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.310
 rivets are well already fully sealed 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.830
 I escaped much nicer 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.610
 and it greatly increases the acceleration and 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.200
 Motorbike strength great escape 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.020
 this comes with must killer to reduce 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:36.820
 the sound is used daily for 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.820
 that is not very annoying 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.380
 well many people ask me what 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:47.860
 rims I have the motorcycle 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.390
 I have these tires are the pirelli 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:54.290
 diablo rosso 2 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:59.260
 with radial tires I liked 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:01.060
 very much that came down and the srx 0-1 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.770
 but I liked it a lot more these are 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.820
 so many that have very good grip because 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:09.650
 has a very good contact area 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.419
 the edges of the rim 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:15.160
 I recommend it very much is through a 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.160
 that is very beauty 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.180
 then my motorcycle I hope you like it 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:37.990
 we are also seeing an english light 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:41.370
 has been a video of the main thing is 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.370
 3,600 lumens 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.220
 it is a bulb that does not heat the lamp 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.910
 all day long and do not touch it here 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.280
 heats up 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.200
 you're not going to damage the reflector 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.710
 by 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:58.250
 the heat 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:00.320
 but this bulb shines a lot more 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.050
 that the original even I had him 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.340
 one to the bike plus h 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.980
 but I did not like them because 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.919
 had to put rates going and many 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:13.139
 things were very bulky a lot of cable and 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.970
 many things this is a light bulb that 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.960
 remove the bulb that brings the 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:21.290
 led bulb and ready with the easiest 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.290
 waths up 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:02.419
 the description of the video I will leave you 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:05.409
 the links of the racing page in 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:05.409
 Facebook 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.040
 the telephones 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:20.070
 for any doubt they have to 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.810
 contact with others 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.680
 with the completion these products 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.680
 because he
