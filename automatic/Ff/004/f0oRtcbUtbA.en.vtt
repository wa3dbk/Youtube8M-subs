should always be looking at multiple
pictures<00:01:44.530> of<00:01:44.920> those<00:01:45.040> plants<00:01:45.520> because<00:01:45.909> there's

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
pictures of those plants because there's

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.170 
pictures of those plants because there's
so<00:01:47.110> much<00:01:47.259> variation<00:01:47.680> within<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.520> single<00:01:48.729> plant

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
so much variation within a single plant

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.230 
so much variation within a single plant
species<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.829> within<00:01:51.340> its<00:01:51.520> spectrum<00:01:52.090> of

growth from spring to fall set let's say

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.990 
growth from spring to fall set let's say
there's<00:01:55.930> so<00:01:56.079> many<00:01:56.170> variations<00:01:56.729> what<00:01:57.729> may<00:01:57.939> be

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
there's so many variations what may be

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.060 
there's so many variations what may be
in<00:01:58.270> this<00:01:58.420> book<00:01:58.689> may<00:01:58.930> not<00:01:58.960> be<00:01:59.140> what<00:01:59.469> you<00:01:59.619> find<00:01:59.890> in

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
tells you how to examine a plant to

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.710 
tells you how to examine a plant to
notice<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.620> variation<00:02:39.340> so<00:02:39.820> it<00:02:40.150> makes<00:02:40.390> plant

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
notice the variation so it makes plant

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.750 
notice the variation so it makes plant
identification<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:41.890> bit<00:02:42.100> easier<00:02:42.550> without

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
identification a bit easier without

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.670 
identification a bit easier without
going<00:02:43.210> into<00:02:43.360> all<00:02:43.480> of<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:43.810> scientific<00:02:44.290> lingo

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
going into all of the scientific lingo

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.990 
going into all of the scientific lingo
so<00:02:45.640> for<00:02:46.540> plant<00:02:46.870> identification<00:02:47.820> usually<00:02:48.820> when

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
so for plant identification usually when

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.300 
so for plant identification usually when
you're<00:02:49.120> beginning<00:02:49.770> wildcrafting<00:02:50.830> and<00:02:51.100> you're

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
you're beginning wildcrafting and you're

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.460 
you're beginning wildcrafting and you're
an<00:02:51.400> amateur<00:02:51.760> you<00:02:52.660> want<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.930> make<00:02:53.050> certain<00:02:53.230> that

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
an amateur you want to make certain that

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.140 
an amateur you want to make certain that
your<00:02:53.650> wildcrafting<00:02:54.430> when<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.700> plant<00:02:54.940> is<00:02:55.120> in

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
your wildcrafting when the plant is in

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.710 
your wildcrafting when the plant is in
full<00:02:55.540> bloom<00:02:55.650> it's<00:02:56.650> easiest<00:02:57.220> when<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:58.480> plant

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
full bloom it's easiest when the plant

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.530 
full bloom it's easiest when the plant
is<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:59.010> flowering<00:03:00.010> plant<00:03:00.060> because<00:03:01.060> flowers

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
is a flowering plant because flowers

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.170 
is a flowering plant because flowers
tend<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:02.050> look<00:03:02.260> very<00:03:02.850> distinguishable<00:03:03.850> from

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
tend to look very distinguishable from

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.290 
tend to look very distinguishable from
plant<00:03:04.510> plants<00:03:05.170> so<00:03:06.160> you<00:03:06.580> want<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:06.970> look<00:03:07.060> at<00:03:07.180> the

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
plant plants so you want to look at the

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.750 
plant plants so you want to look at the
shape<00:03:07.540> of<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:07.990> leaves<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:09.160> time<00:03:09.430> it's

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
shape of the leaves the time it's

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.590 
shape of the leaves the time it's
blooming<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:11.080> size<00:03:11.350> of<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.680> plant<00:03:12.120> are<00:03:13.120> the

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
blooming the size of the plant are the

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.290 
blooming the size of the plant are the

leaves oval are the leaves pointed at
the<00:03:16.480> end

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
the end

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.050 
the end
are<00:03:17.200> they<00:03:17.410> thorned<00:03:18.100> do<00:03:18.460> they<00:03:18.580> have<00:03:18.760> little

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
are they thorned do they have little

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.940 
are they thorned do they have little
hairs<00:03:19.360> on<00:03:19.630> them<00:03:19.870> what<00:03:20.110> do<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.410> little<00:03:20.560> roots

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
hairs on them what do the little roots

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.780 
hairs on them what do the little roots
on<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.310> leaves<00:03:21.520> look<00:03:21.850> like<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:23.790> that's

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
on the leaves look like and that's

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.760 
on the leaves look like and that's
really<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.660> first<00:03:25.840> step<00:03:25.990> and<00:03:26.320> the<00:03:26.410> easiest

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
really the first step and the easiest

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.100 
really the first step and the easiest
way<00:03:27.100> to<00:03:27.130> begin<00:03:27.430> looking<00:03:28.420> at<00:03:28.690> plants<00:03:29.050> and

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
way to begin looking at plants and

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.930 
way to begin looking at plants and
examining<00:03:29.650> them<00:03:29.830> to<00:03:30.040> figure<00:03:30.310> out<00:03:30.460> what<00:03:30.790> they

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
examining them to figure out what they

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.410 
examining them to figure out what they
are<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:32.560> flowers<00:03:33.100> are<00:03:33.370> very<00:03:33.550> important<00:03:34.150> and

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
are the flowers are very important and

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.480 
are the flowers are very important and
this<00:03:34.780> means<00:03:35.080> when<00:03:35.440> you're<00:03:35.590> working<00:03:36.160> when

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
this means when you're working when

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.340 
this means when you're working when
you're<00:03:36.610> learning<00:03:36.790> wildcrafting<00:03:37.720> it's

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
you're learning wildcrafting it's

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.900 
you're learning wildcrafting it's
something<00:03:39.190> that<00:03:39.340> you're<00:03:39.460> going<00:03:39.610> to<00:03:39.700> be

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
something that you're going to be

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.840 
something that you're going to be
learning<00:03:40.060> through<00:03:40.810> multiple<00:03:41.230> seasons

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
learning through multiple seasons

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.220 
learning through multiple seasons
because<00:03:42.850> when<00:03:43.030> that<00:03:43.180> plant<00:03:43.660> first<00:03:43.900> starts

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
because when that plant first starts

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.750 
because when that plant first starts
blooming<00:03:44.650> in<00:03:44.800> spring<00:03:45.160> it<00:03:45.400> doesn't

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
blooming in spring it doesn't

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.940 
blooming in spring it doesn't
necessarily<00:03:46.420> have<00:03:46.690> all<00:03:47.050> the<00:03:47.440> characteristics

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
necessarily have all the characteristics

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.240 
necessarily have all the characteristics
you<00:03:48.340> need<00:03:48.640> as<00:03:48.940> an<00:03:49.090> amateur<00:03:49.420> to<00:03:49.690> identify<00:03:50.260> it<00:03:50.320> so

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
you need as an amateur to identify it so

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.220 
you need as an amateur to identify it so
you<00:03:52.000> look<00:03:52.240> at<00:03:52.330> a<00:03:52.390> plant<00:03:52.660> you<00:03:52.870> go<00:03:52.990> out<00:03:53.140> and

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
you look at a plant you go out and

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.540 
you look at a plant you go out and
spring<00:03:53.500> you<00:03:53.650> look<00:03:53.800> and<00:03:53.950> see<00:03:54.100> what's<00:03:54.280> blooming

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
spring you look and see what's blooming

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.440 
spring you look and see what's blooming
and<00:03:55.140> then<00:03:56.140> you<00:03:56.830> go<00:03:57.010> back<00:03:57.220> continuously<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.270> try

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
and then you go back continuously to try

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.430 
and then you go back continuously to try
to<00:03:58.510> identify<00:03:58.720> it

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
to identify it

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.530 
to identify it
and<00:03:59.740> you<00:04:00.250> get<00:04:00.400> to<00:04:00.550> see<00:04:00.700> it<00:04:00.850> through<00:04:01.030> all<00:04:01.210> of<00:04:01.240> its

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
and you get to see it through all of its

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.930 
and you get to see it through all of its
stages<00:04:01.810> and<00:04:02.440> that's<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.890> safest<00:04:03.370> way<00:04:03.610> to

stages and that's the safest way to

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.670 
stages and that's the safest way to
identify<00:04:04.330> that<00:04:04.840> plan<00:04:05.080> if<00:04:05.230> you're<00:04:05.320> going<00:04:05.500> to

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
identify that plan if you're going to

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.500 
identify that plan if you're going to
actually<00:04:05.860> try<00:04:06.340> to<00:04:06.370> eat<00:04:07.240> it<00:04:08.400> now<00:04:09.400> in<00:04:09.850> nature

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
actually try to eat it now in nature

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.150 
actually try to eat it now in nature
there<00:04:10.750> are<00:04:10.780> always<00:04:10.990> some<00:04:11.320> plants<00:04:11.770> that<00:04:12.010> look

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
there are always some plants that look

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.559 
there are always some plants that look
alike<00:04:12.490> and

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
alike and

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.630 
alike and
it's<00:04:14.019> a<00:04:14.140> misconception<00:04:14.319> that<00:04:15.040> every<00:04:15.310> plant

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
it's a misconception that every plant

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.779 
it's a misconception that every plant
has<00:04:16.090> a<00:04:16.509> plant<00:04:17.320> that<00:04:17.410> looks<00:04:17.530> just<00:04:17.859> like<00:04:18.009> it<00:04:18.160> that

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
has a plant that looks just like it that

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.759 
has a plant that looks just like it that
is<00:04:19.060> poisonous<00:04:19.690> that's<00:04:19.900> probably<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.560> biggest

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
is poisonous that's probably the biggest

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.370 
is poisonous that's probably the biggest
fear<00:04:21.220> I<00:04:21.250> run<00:04:21.579> into<00:04:21.940> with<00:04:22.150> people<00:04:22.509> learning<00:04:23.169> to

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
fear I run into with people learning to

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.210 
fear I run into with people learning to
wildcraft

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
wildcraft

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.330 
wildcraft
there<00:04:24.880> are<00:04:25.289> some<00:04:26.289> plants<00:04:26.530> that<00:04:26.770> look<00:04:27.070> very

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
there are some plants that look very

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.670 
there are some plants that look very
much<00:04:27.520> alike<00:04:27.580> where<00:04:28.150> one<00:04:28.389> is<00:04:28.720> edible<00:04:29.169> and<00:04:29.500> one

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
much alike where one is edible and one

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.560 
much alike where one is edible and one
is<00:04:29.860> poisonous<00:04:30.460> but<00:04:30.669> not<00:04:30.850> really<00:04:31.150> that<00:04:31.330> many

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
is poisonous but not really that many

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.050 
is poisonous but not really that many
and<00:04:31.960> once<00:04:32.590> you<00:04:32.830> pay<00:04:33.100> attention<00:04:33.669> to<00:04:33.910> the

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
and once you pay attention to the

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.820 
and once you pay attention to the
differences<00:04:34.479> between<00:04:34.539> those<00:04:35.050> two<00:04:35.350> plants<00:04:35.710> you

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
differences between those two plants you

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.670 
differences between those two plants you
can<00:04:35.949> usually<00:04:36.160> easily<00:04:36.820> tell<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.120> difference

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
can usually easily tell the difference

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.379 
can usually easily tell the difference
what<00:04:38.680> I<00:04:38.710> do<00:04:38.860> recommend<00:04:39.340> if<00:04:39.880> you're<00:04:40.120> beginning

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
what I do recommend if you're beginning

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.719 
what I do recommend if you're beginning
plant<00:04:40.720> identification<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:41.740> wildcrafting<00:04:42.580> is

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
plant identification and wildcrafting is

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.960 
plant identification and wildcrafting is
that<00:04:43.479> you<00:04:44.169> do<00:04:44.440> not<00:04:44.590> harvest<00:04:45.160> the<00:04:45.280> plant<00:04:45.550> until

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
that you do not harvest the plant until

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.850 
that you do not harvest the plant until
you<00:04:46.120> see<00:04:46.389> it<00:04:46.509> in<00:04:46.630> full<00:04:46.900> bloom<00:04:47.169> because<00:04:47.650> that's

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
you see it in full bloom because that's

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.830 
you see it in full bloom because that's
going<00:04:48.039> to<00:04:48.160> be<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.460> easiest<00:04:48.820> time<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:49.270> identify

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
going to be the easiest time to identify

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.230 
going to be the easiest time to identify
it<00:04:49.900> if<00:04:50.320> you're<00:04:51.009> going<00:04:51.190> to<00:04:51.460> harvest<00:04:51.699> a<00:04:52.000> plant

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
it if you're going to harvest a plant

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.920 
it if you're going to harvest a plant
for<00:04:52.539> its<00:04:52.630> roots<00:04:53.020> go<00:04:53.380> and<00:04:54.160> stick<00:04:54.729> a<00:04:54.759> little<00:04:55.060> sign

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
for its roots go and stick a little sign

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.810 
for its roots go and stick a little sign
there<00:04:55.960> to<00:04:56.620> distinguish<00:04:57.099> that<00:04:57.310> that<00:04:57.460> is<00:04:57.639> where

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
there to distinguish that that is where

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.700 
there to distinguish that that is where
the<00:04:57.849> plant<00:04:58.210> is<00:04:58.330> located<00:04:58.389> because<00:04:59.110> a<00:04:59.320> lot<00:04:59.560> of

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
the plant is located because a lot of

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.159 
the plant is located because a lot of
mistakes<00:05:00.009> are<00:05:00.310> made<00:05:00.460> by<00:05:00.639> wild<00:05:01.060> crafters<00:05:01.570> when

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
mistakes are made by wild crafters when

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.560 
mistakes are made by wild crafters when
the<00:05:02.500> plant<00:05:02.740> has<00:05:02.949> died<00:05:03.190> away<00:05:03.220> on<00:05:03.789> the<00:05:04.090> top<00:05:04.300> and

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
the plant has died away on the top and

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.089 
the plant has died away on the top and
they<00:05:04.780> go<00:05:04.930> to<00:05:04.990> dig<00:05:05.199> up<00:05:05.349> the<00:05:05.500> root<00:05:05.680> but<00:05:05.919> it's

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
they go to dig up the root but it's

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.089 
they go to dig up the root but it's
actually<00:05:06.639> a<00:05:06.820> root<00:05:07.150> next<00:05:07.840> to<00:05:08.020> it<00:05:08.169> that<00:05:08.410> is<00:05:08.770> from

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:09.099 
actually a root next to it that is from

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:14.159 
actually a root next to it that is from
the<00:05:09.220> dangerous<00:05:09.580> plant<00:05:11.250> so<00:05:12.660> the<00:05:13.660> first<00:05:13.900> thing

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
the dangerous plant so the first thing

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:15.900 
the dangerous plant so the first thing
is<00:05:14.320> a<00:05:14.349> wild<00:05:14.650> crafter<00:05:15.099> you<00:05:15.220> need<00:05:15.370> to<00:05:15.490> learn<00:05:15.639> are

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
is a wild crafter you need to learn are

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.330 
is a wild crafter you need to learn are
not<00:05:16.210> the<00:05:16.900> helpful<00:05:17.320> plants<00:05:17.770> the<00:05:17.919> edible<00:05:18.250> plants

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
not the helpful plants the edible plants

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.520 
not the helpful plants the edible plants
you<00:05:18.699> need<00:05:18.880> to<00:05:18.970> learn<00:05:19.120> the<00:05:19.479> poisonous<00:05:20.050> plants

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
you need to learn the poisonous plants

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.339 
you need to learn the poisonous plants
and<00:05:20.770> in<00:05:21.310> the<00:05:21.460> eastern<00:05:21.909> US<00:05:22.120> and<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:22.840> Piedmont

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.159 
and in the eastern US and the Piedmont
our<00:05:24.159> typical<00:05:24.460> poisonous<00:05:25.180> plants<00:05:25.659> are<00:05:25.900> going

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
our typical poisonous plants are going

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.240 
our typical poisonous plants are going
to<00:05:26.289> be<00:05:26.409> poison<00:05:27.070> ivy<00:05:27.220> may<00:05:28.180> be<00:05:28.240> poison<00:05:28.840> oak<00:05:29.250> and

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
to be poison ivy may be poison oak and

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.589 
to be poison ivy may be poison oak and
what<00:05:30.490> constitutes<00:05:30.880> a<00:05:31.270> poisonous<00:05:31.750> plant<00:05:32.080> is

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
what constitutes a poisonous plant is

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.560 
what constitutes a poisonous plant is
it's<00:05:34.599> variable<00:05:35.349> for<00:05:36.070> some<00:05:36.340> herbs<00:05:36.639> the

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
it's variable for some herbs the

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.629 
it's variable for some herbs the
characteristics<00:05:38.320> that<00:05:38.440> people<00:05:38.500> would<00:05:38.949> call<00:05:39.250> a

characteristics that people would call a

characteristics that people would call a
poisonous<00:05:40.090> plant<00:05:40.360> are<00:05:40.539> actually<00:05:40.990> the

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
poisonous plant are actually the

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.649 
poisonous plant are actually the
characteristics<00:05:42.550> in<00:05:42.669> it<00:05:42.789> we<00:05:42.909> want<00:05:43.150> to<00:05:43.240> use<00:05:43.389> for

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:43.659 
characteristics in it we want to use for

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:48.750 
characteristics in it we want to use for
specific<00:05:44.550> illness<00:05:45.550> so<00:05:47.610> really<00:05:48.610> you're<00:05:48.729> just

specific illness so really you're just

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.460 
specific illness so really you're just
learning<00:05:49.090> about<00:05:49.330> any<00:05:49.630> plant<00:05:49.960> that<00:05:50.080> may<00:05:50.260> be<00:05:50.320> a
