when<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:10.889> first<00:00:11.160> got<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:11.639> motor<00:00:11.910> all<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.540> had<00:00:12.900> to

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
when I first got this motor all I had to

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.820 
when I first got this motor all I had to
do<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.950> get<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.219> running<00:00:14.660> was<00:00:15.660> pull<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.650> fly

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
do to get it running was pull the fly

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.120 
do to get it running was pull the fly
wheel<00:00:17.039> off<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.550> clean<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.910> points<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.390> recap

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
wheel off and clean the points and recap

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.480 
wheel off and clean the points and recap
once<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.340> was<00:00:20.520> done<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:21.420> ran<00:00:21.750> like<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:22.020> top

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
once that was done it ran like a top

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.390 
once that was done it ran like a top
with<00:00:23.490> one<00:00:23.730> exception<00:00:24.410> it<00:00:25.410> was<00:00:25.590> very<00:00:25.920> difficult

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
with one exception it was very difficult

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.030 
with one exception it was very difficult
to<00:00:26.760> start<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:29.029> originally<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.060> had<00:00:31.040> plastic

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
to start and originally I had plastic

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.600 
to start and originally I had plastic
tubing<00:00:32.969> for<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.239> fuel<00:00:33.510> pickup<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.430> I<00:00:35.430> could

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
tubing for the fuel pickup and I could

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.299 
tubing for the fuel pickup and I could
see<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.000> every<00:00:36.540> time<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.780> kicked<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:38.040> fuel

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
see that every time I kicked it the fuel

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.920 
see that every time I kicked it the fuel
would<00:00:38.460> rise<00:00:38.730> up<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.180> tube<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.629> then

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
would rise up the tube and then

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.220 
would rise up the tube and then
partially<00:00:40.530> drop<00:00:40.829> back<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.570> you<00:00:42.570> just<00:00:42.600> had<00:00:43.020> to

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
partially drop back and you just had to

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.500 
partially drop back and you just had to
kick<00:00:43.590> like<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> son<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.399> gun<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.700> get<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.000> going

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
kick like a son of a gun to get it going

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.540 
kick like a son of a gun to get it going
once<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> fuel<00:00:46.469> reached<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.010> bottom<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
once the fuel reached the bottom of the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.229 
once the fuel reached the bottom of the
carburetor<00:00:47.879> off<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.870> would<00:00:48.989> go<00:00:49.489> one<00:00:50.489> day<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.910> was

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
carburetor off it would go one day I was

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.020 
carburetor off it would go one day I was
at<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.989> engine<00:00:52.860> meet<00:00:54.500> over<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:56.280> Oregon<00:00:56.820> and

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
at the engine meet over in in Oregon and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.510 
at the engine meet over in in Oregon and
I<00:00:57.480> heard<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.050> couple<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.440> old-timers<00:00:58.680> talking

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
I heard a couple of old-timers talking

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.439 
I heard a couple of old-timers talking
about<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:01.020> fact<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:02.039> fuel<00:01:02.280> pickups<00:01:02.760> in

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
about the fact that the fuel pickups in

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.399 
about the fact that the fuel pickups in
these<00:01:03.750> original<00:01:04.019> tanks<00:01:04.710> for<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.100> old<00:01:05.460> Briggs

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
these original tanks for the old Briggs

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:14.240 
these original tanks for the old Briggs
required<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:09.020> check<00:01:10.020> ball<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:12.979> right<00:01:13.979> away<00:01:14.130> I

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
required a check ball and right away I

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.280 
required a check ball and right away I
knew<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.880> was<00:01:15.060> probably<00:01:15.299> my<00:01:15.810> problem

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
knew that that was probably my problem

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.249 
knew that that was probably my problem
so<00:01:16.770> when<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.009> got<00:01:17.280> home<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.850> went<00:01:18.780> ahead<00:01:18.930> and

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
so when I got home I went ahead and

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.289 
so when I got home I went ahead and
pulled<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.070> fuel<00:01:20.280> pickup<00:01:20.460> out<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.030> tank

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
pulled the fuel pickup out of the tank

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.580 
pulled the fuel pickup out of the tank
and<00:01:22.790> I<00:01:23.790> did<00:01:24.420> some<00:01:24.630> checking<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.259> noticed

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
and I did some checking and I noticed

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.140 
and I did some checking and I noticed
that<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.770> could<00:01:25.860> see<00:01:26.189> right<00:01:26.430> through<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.880> port

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
that I could see right through the port

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.740 
that I could see right through the port
and<00:01:27.380> through<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.560> screen<00:01:29.180> it<00:01:30.180> took<00:01:30.360> me<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> bit

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
and through the screen it took me a bit

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.800 
and through the screen it took me a bit
of<00:01:30.869> figuring<00:01:31.280> but<00:01:32.280> what<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.880> found<00:01:33.150> was<00:01:33.509> that

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
of figuring but what I found was that

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.950 
of figuring but what I found was that
you<00:01:34.680> removed<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.310> screen<00:01:35.729> at<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> bottom<00:01:36.869> of

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
you removed the screen at the bottom of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.870 
you removed the screen at the bottom of
the<00:01:37.020> pickup<00:01:37.759> and<00:01:38.780> if<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.930> looked<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.380> there

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
the pickup and if you looked in there

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.200 
the pickup and if you looked in there
you<00:01:41.880> could<00:01:42.030> see<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.420> there<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.750> seat<00:01:43.049> I

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
you could see that there is a seat I

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.899 
you could see that there is a seat I
found<00:01:45.210> an<00:01:45.509> old<00:01:46.280> Czech<00:01:47.280> ball<00:01:47.520> from<00:01:47.790> a

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
found an old Czech ball from a

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.859 
found an old Czech ball from a
carburetor<00:01:48.390> kit<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:49.439> my<00:01:49.670> toolbox<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:51.600> just

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
carburetor kit in my toolbox that just

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.310 
carburetor kit in my toolbox that just
happened<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.350> fit<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:53.570> as<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.720> can<00:01:54.869> see<00:01:55.079> there

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
happened to fit and as you can see there

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.580 
happened to fit and as you can see there
it<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.790> and<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.420> fits<00:01:57.840> right<00:01:58.079> down<00:01:58.350> inside

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it is and it just fits right down inside

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.830 
it is and it just fits right down inside
the<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.549> taper<00:01:59.790> there<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.719> the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.880 
the the taper there and the in the
pickup<00:02:02.060> so<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:04.110> drop<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.710> make

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
pickup so you just drop that in make

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.889 
pickup so you just drop that in make
sure<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.219> fits<00:02:05.430> properly<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:07.039> that<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.190> does

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
sure it fits properly and that it does

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.220 
sure it fits properly and that it does
actually<00:02:09.899> move<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.530> doesn't<00:02:10.920> get<00:02:11.069> stuck

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
actually move and doesn't get stuck

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.020 
actually move and doesn't get stuck
then<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.380> go<00:02:14.560> ahead<00:02:14.800> and<00:02:14.980> reinstall<00:02:15.610> the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
then you go ahead and reinstall the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.120 
then you go ahead and reinstall the
pickup<00:02:17.340> make<00:02:18.340> sure<00:02:18.580> it's<00:02:18.730> on<00:02:18.910> there<00:02:19.120> well<00:02:19.390> and

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
don't put too much pressure on it

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.340 
don't put too much pressure on it
because<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.600> certainly<00:02:22.810> don't<00:02:23.080> want<00:02:23.230> to

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
because you certainly don't want to

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.000 
because you certainly don't want to
break<00:02:23.530> this<00:02:23.740> tube<00:02:24.040> off<00:02:25.590> make<00:02:26.590> sure<00:02:26.620> you

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
break this tube off make sure you

rust and I don't know if you can see on
camera<00:03:13.270> but<00:03:13.630> there's<00:03:14.380> a<00:03:14.470> lot<00:03:14.860> of<00:03:14.890> pitting<00:03:15.460> all

camera but there's a lot of pitting all
the<00:03:16.270> way<00:03:16.390> through<00:03:16.750> around<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.470> neck<00:03:18.000> luckily

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
the way through around the neck luckily

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.420 
the way through around the neck luckily
it<00:03:19.120> wasn't<00:03:19.330> down<00:03:19.630> lower<00:03:19.990> and<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:21.100> doesn't

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
it wasn't down lower and it doesn't

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.250 
it wasn't down lower and it doesn't
appear<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.760> leak<00:03:22.030> even<00:03:22.060> with<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.720> vibration

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
appear to leak even with the vibration

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.010 
appear to leak even with the vibration
of<00:03:23.380> running<00:03:24.300> but<00:03:25.300> that's<00:03:25.810> certainly

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
of running but that's certainly

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.680 
of running but that's certainly
something<00:03:26.260> that<00:03:26.680> you'd<00:03:26.830> want<00:03:27.070> to<00:03:27.130> check<00:03:27.690> now

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
something that you'd want to check now

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.770 
something that you'd want to check now
the<00:03:28.870> next<00:03:29.170> thing<00:03:29.350> you<00:03:29.440> do<00:03:29.620> is<00:03:31.650> carefully

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
the next thing you do is carefully

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.630 
the next thing you do is carefully
reinstall<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:36.280> fuel<00:03:36.490> pickup<00:03:36.760> tube<00:03:37.270> and<00:03:38.640> it'd

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
reinstall the fuel pickup tube and it'd

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.260 
reinstall the fuel pickup tube and it'd
be<00:03:39.820> best<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.840> hold<00:03:41.020> the<00:03:41.260> fitting<00:03:42.030> while<00:03:43.030> you

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
be best to hold the fitting while you

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.240 
be best to hold the fitting while you
tighten<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:44.040> ferrule<00:03:45.040> nut<00:03:45.270> and<00:03:46.980> now<00:03:47.980> you're

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
tighten the ferrule nut and now you're

00:03:48.250 --> 00:04:03.500 
tighten the ferrule nut and now you're
ready<00:03:48.459> to<00:03:48.640> run

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.660 

and<00:04:04.110> I'm<00:04:04.650> going<00:04:04.830> to<00:04:04.890> move<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.129> camera<00:04:05.459> back<00:04:05.489> a

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
and I'm going to move the camera back a

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.309 
and I'm going to move the camera back a
little<00:04:05.940> bit<00:04:06.150> in<00:04:06.330> the<00:04:06.420> next<00:04:06.450> video<00:04:06.930> we'll<00:04:07.200> go

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
little bit in the next video we'll go

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.830 
little bit in the next video we'll go
ahead<00:04:07.530> and<00:04:07.650> run<00:04:07.799> it
