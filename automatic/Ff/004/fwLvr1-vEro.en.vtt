00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.880
 surgeons joking a man 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.590
 not knowing what you find and what they put 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.009
 canned food 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.009
 let's talk about it 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.369
 canning 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.650
 one way to save long 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.650
 product there is a whole science which 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.760
 called food preservation 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.000
 products in principle 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.890
 canned everything is divided by packaging and by 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.489
 content that are in this 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.890
 There are canned meat packaging 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.320
 fish and vegetable mix them 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.960
 called vegetable meat fish 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.780
 vegetable canned depending on 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.899
 quantities and combinations of animal and 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.480
 vegetable protein is basically all 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.059
 canned foods are very stiff 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.070
 heat treated which kills 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.729
 all bad and all good 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.890
 together with the microbes in the cashiers killed 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.110
 the main amount of vitamins therefore 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.390
 everyday use of canned food is not 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.570
 very useful if you have a choice 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.720
 use just live foods 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.140
 canned food 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.960
 This is in case of a trip to the country or 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.630
 when there's nothing at home to eat 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.880
 does not apply to baby food for children 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.520
 canned food not exposed so tough 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.890
 heat treatment in the late 90s 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.200
 a new species appeared on the market 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.270
 canned food called preserves 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.780
 this is plastic packaging without 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.850
 heat treatment but without air access 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.890
 products are stored for a long time but 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.770
 not as long as the packaged product 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.090
 tin preserves preserve 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.450
 practically to your taste 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.369
 characteristics they contain 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.049
 enough vitamins 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.750
 virtually indistinguishable from the number 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.600
 vitamins raw materials in general 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.299
 canned fast food is a product of 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.930
 product where everyday consumption but 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.479
 Colleagues 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.479
 Nobody canceled potato with stew
