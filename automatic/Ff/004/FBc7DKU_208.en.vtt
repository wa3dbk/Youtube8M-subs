00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.269
 Hi, my name is a lot and I'm an alcoholic 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:06.950
 I say sniper and today I hit my voice 

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:08.990
 velvety and sexy to teach you a 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.190
 which many have told me how 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.230
 to do quiz cops in battle filtres 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.420
 I'm calm here to explain 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.010
 the good thing I take to say that this 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.720
 video will be exclusive to my channel and the 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.220
 channel of best friends because this rock 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.930
 he is working on it for 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.940
 move forward the Spanish community of 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.310
 battlefield and Latin American and I wanted 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.539
 put my two cents in the only 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.060
 topic that I more or less understand that they are 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.380
 the smile pers so without further delay 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.789
 I'll comment on the topic that we 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.909
 concerns today how to do quiz cops in 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.409
 battlefield 3 by the way what you will 

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:37.879
 background is a pretty random game that 

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:40.100
 I had kept it there so it scratched us 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.230
 and you know pay more attention to what you 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.570
 story how the quiz goes 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.960
 The theory of the click is simple and ancient 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.840
 will learn from the counter 1.3 1.6 ovas llosa 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.000
 that has already time and is to aim and just 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.320
 when the peephole is put on without passing 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.030
 a second to take a shot and charge you 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.280
 someone and avoid the peephole quickly 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.190
 up there all simple there is no 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.510
 problem now you will tell me a lot and why 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.430
 I have to do quiz cop when I can 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.380
 do the co then for a simple reason 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.390
 the mosco always has a variant 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.890
 quite random which is the dispersion 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.840
 of the bullet can go out for any 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.550
 side you can give yourself in one leg can 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.860
 entering the moon will be like a penalty 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.940
 we then select the quick what 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.190
 does it is to avoid that 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.960
 in that random way that when closing the 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.700
 cross height makes the bullet just go 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.470
 for that site then it's easier to 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.060
 the people doing a cuit that a surly 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.060
 It also depends on the distance 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.549
 good what I roll more than a whore 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.549
 or make wish combat filters 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.030
 to be able to do quixen mate filter is 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.830
 The first thing you should do is put the 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.810
 enemy in which only the dashes 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.670
 whites that mark where it's left over 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.640
 go and the bullet and once you have it 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.080
 square without moving aim just 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.230
 when the targeted animation finishes 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.080
 shoot and just when you finish 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.030
 Remove the peephole shoot these these 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.040
 they are made easier if you carry in laser 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.780
 because because it notably decreases the 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.760
 cros falls and makes you so much easier 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.290
 the square of the enemies 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.850
 that's the quiz cope has nothing else 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.320
 and now I'm going to tell you about the little 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.180
 trick that there is for textile clothes 3 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.580
 frame and fit several quick 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.700
 followed and the crossfire is fixed 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.800
 look, it's okay, you do not see it well 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.420
 look now after pasting the first 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.519
 shot looks at the positioning of the cross 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.230
 fall is completely closed that 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.640
 indicates just what the weapon is pointing at 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.989
 then the only thing you have to do 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.300
 is while doing the animation 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.340
 of lacrosse lacrosse caixa is closed 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.650
 and you just have to point to 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.420
 next enemy to be able to fit 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.130
 several weeks in a row and has nothing 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.780
 more and that's a little trick that 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.630
 susan bates 1.003 to make some 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.610
 gusts of wikis quite pretty bad 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.080
 and do not think that with this trick 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.490
 do only weeks have to have the 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.750
 skill you know so it works out 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.070
 all this you have to practice and 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.900
 practice it and practice it if you're not going to 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.760
 remain a bank 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.799
 Well now I 'm going to tell you a couple of 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.299
 little things that are logical to know the 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.890
 peephole you can put the one you get 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.040
 from the ass of iron cloth to the 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.590
 sport 24 x 40 for which you want for 12 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.209
 the one you want does not matter the only thing that you 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.099
 I say that with the peephole of x 8 is more 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.540
 nice that is the only thing is more aesthetic 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.239
 because he gets the partitaire adital 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.980
 then another little thing that the two best 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.629
 how to click is the sv because 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.310
 is the best shot from hip has 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.109
 and 940 because it's the one that does the work 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.180
 faster and you will notice that it is 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.450
 much easier to count and nothing 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.859
 plus 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.780
 this is all I hope you liked 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.010
 that has served you above all and good 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.349
 now I'll put you with a mini mount 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.579
 Hello from the sitem Hello and such good 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.579
 we see trunk of agur
