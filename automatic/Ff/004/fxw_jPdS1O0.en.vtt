in<00:02:07.869> my<00:02:07.930> class<00:02:08.229> have<00:02:08.410> some<00:02:08.619> kind<00:02:08.830> of<00:02:08.890> potential

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
in my class have some kind of potential

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.699 
in my class have some kind of potential
you<00:02:09.610> know<00:02:09.729> not<00:02:09.850> just<00:02:10.030> one<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:10.600> I<00:02:10.690> try<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:10.899> give

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
you know not just one and I try to give

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.350 
you know not just one and I try to give
some<00:02:11.739> kind<00:02:12.100> of<00:02:12.160> individual<00:02:12.700> attention<00:02:13.090> to

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
some kind of individual attention to

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.060 
some kind of individual attention to
make<00:02:13.540> sure<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.989> they<00:02:14.440> can<00:02:14.620> realize<00:02:15.040> what

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
make sure that they can realize what

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.580 
make sure that they can realize what
their<00:02:15.430> potential<00:02:15.910> is<00:02:16.060> not<00:02:16.870> even<00:02:17.110> in<00:02:17.170> just<00:02:17.380> park

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
their potential is not even in just park

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.320 
their potential is not even in just park
or<00:02:17.830> I<00:02:17.860> just<00:02:17.950> make<00:02:18.310> sure<00:02:18.489> they<00:02:18.519> apply<00:02:19.000> what<00:02:19.209> they

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
or I just make sure they apply what they

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.890 
or I just make sure they apply what they
learn<00:02:19.540> in<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.890> parkour<00:02:21.340> class<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:22.030> take<00:02:22.780> it
