 happens to open it 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.889
 if it really attracts chivas here 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.310
 in goal 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:44.089
 I'm not sure if it brings cargo but 

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:44.089
 let's try to turn it on 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.920

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.880
 to our environment 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:09.140
 to proceed to turn it on 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.140
 button does not have this side 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.630
 effectively in montecarlo 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.150

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.990
 very good colors 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.800
 ah 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.900
 as it is the first start it takes a 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:10.120
 little bit 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.120
 and here how can you see what I just pulled out 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:44.070

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:48.530
 size is very large but fits very 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:48.530
