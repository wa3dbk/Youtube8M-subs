00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
bulky too heavy that it just didn't look

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.669 
bulky too heavy that it just didn't look
natural<00:00:33.290> for<00:00:33.829> me<00:00:33.950> so<00:00:34.489> I<00:00:34.520> decided<00:00:34.840> to<00:00:35.840> revise<00:00:36.379> it

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:36.679 
natural for me so I decided to revise it

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:40.150 
natural for me so I decided to revise it
and<00:00:37.429> what<00:00:37.730> I<00:00:37.760> did<00:00:38.210> was<00:00:39.019> cut<00:00:39.379> some<00:00:39.559> layers

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160

layers<00:00:44.780> took<00:00:45.230> off<00:00:45.379> some<00:00:45.649> of<00:00:45.679> the<00:00:45.859> bulk<00:00:46.100> and

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
layers took off some of the bulk and

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.500 
layers took off some of the bulk and
