in a lot more ride reservation tickets
floating<00:01:26.250> around<00:01:26.420> so<00:01:27.420> they're<00:01:28.200> doing<00:01:28.979> a

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
floating around so they're doing a

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.550 
floating around so they're doing a
couple<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.430> strategies<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.810> keep<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.350> number

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
couple of strategies to keep that number

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.170 
couple of strategies to keep that number
of<00:01:31.770> manageable<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:33.119> first<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:34.369> now<00:01:35.369> they

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
of manageable the first is that now they

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.179 
of manageable the first is that now they
are<00:01:36.210> enforcing<00:01:37.079> those<00:01:37.259> return<00:01:37.650> times<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
are enforcing those return times the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.100 
are enforcing those return times the
return<00:01:38.460> winner<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.790> can't<00:01:38.820> return<00:01:39.150> late<00:01:39.509> too

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
return winner you can't return late too

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.530 
return winner you can't return late too
fast<00:01:40.320> fast<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.790> secondly<00:01:41.790> they<00:01:42.060> are<00:01:42.119> adding

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
fast fast and secondly they are adding

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.380 
fast fast and secondly they are adding
more<00:01:42.899> attractions<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.340> fastpass<00:01:44.820> roster

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
more attractions to the fastpass roster

things that at the moment don't really

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.179 
things that at the moment don't really
need<00:01:51.899> fast<00:01:52.229> pass<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.710> we<00:01:52.740> don't<00:01:52.950> really<00:01:53.040> know

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
need fast pass so we don't really know

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.219 
need fast pass so we don't really know
exactly<00:01:53.460> what<00:01:53.909> will<00:01:54.000> happen<00:01:54.030> after<00:01:54.780> all<00:01:55.110> this

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
