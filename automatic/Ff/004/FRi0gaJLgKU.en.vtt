00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.640
 ah 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.900
 sometimes you will need to join a strand of 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.090
 new wool either when the 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.190
 ball or for color changes always 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.470
 it is better to add a new ball of wool 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.330
 at the beginning of a turn at the end of the 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.980
 last round leave around 10 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.980
 centimeters of thread and cut it 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.900
 start the new round with the new 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.870
 ball, leaving at least 10 cm of 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.480
 thread 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.430
 You must slide the two ends through the 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.290
 shores and thus avoid the unsightly 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.290
 knots in the center of the work 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.480
 when it is knitting it can happen 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.370
 that a point escaped I observed 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.030
 regularly work to get it back 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.030
 easily 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.910
 at the point of mean to right by 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.200
 example begins to weave to the place 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.200
 in which the point escaped 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.880
 You will need a crochet hook to pass 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.860
 the needle through the loop of the loose point and 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.820
 hold the strand of the point that is just 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.820
 over with the crochet 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.500
 is pull the needle to go through the 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.190
 point the thread that is in the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.190
 crochet hook 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.759
 Repeat this process until the point 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.560
 loose has gone through all the laps 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.720
 put the last point recovered in the 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.920
 left needle you can continue 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.920
 weaving normally 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.400
 when I notice that there is an error in the work 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.810
 who is working will not cease everything nor 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.730
 start again 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.290
 it is enough to gently undo all 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.520
 the turns that are above the 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.520
 mistake and do them again 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.819
 mark the turn where there is the error 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:16.819
 with a wool patch of another color 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.600
 remove the needles 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.450
 pull the thread slowly until you reach 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.810
 the previous round where he committed the 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.810
 error 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.730
 Replace the stitches on the needle 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.730
 left and I went back to work
