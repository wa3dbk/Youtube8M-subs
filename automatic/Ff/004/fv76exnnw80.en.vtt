00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
from there the three marshal if this is

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.960 
from there the three marshal if this is
pretty<00:02:47.170> standard<00:02:47.550> because<00:02:48.550> when<00:02:48.790> it's

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
pretty standard because when it's

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.560 
pretty standard because when it's
basically<00:02:49.660> pot<00:02:50.350> duality<00:02:50.980> Mills<00:02:51.400> it's<00:02:52.330> like<00:02:52.540> a

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
basically pot duality Mills it's like a

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.420 
basically pot duality Mills it's like a
you<00:02:53.170> know<00:02:53.200> it<00:02:53.530> says<00:02:53.769> it<00:02:53.890> right<00:02:53.950> on<00:02:54.070> the<00:02:54.220> card

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
you know it says it right on the card

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.640 
you know it says it right on the card
basically<00:02:55.150> when<00:02:55.330> it's<00:02:55.480> like<00:02:55.630> sent<00:02:56.410> to<00:02:56.560> the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
basically when it's like sent to the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.380 
basically when it's like sent to the
graveyard<00:02:57.130> by<00:02:57.310> its<00:02:57.489> little<00:02:57.700> pod<00:02:57.850> reality

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
graveyard by its little pod reality

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.720 
graveyard by its little pod reality
effect<00:02:58.450> because<00:02:59.410> I<00:02:59.560> like<00:02:59.800> saying<00:03:00.040> mill<00:03:00.340> but

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
effect because I like saying mill but

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.250 
effect because I like saying mill but
Konami<00:03:01.300> doesn't<00:03:01.660> believe<00:03:01.840> in<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.019> middle<00:03:02.170> no

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
Konami doesn't believe in the middle no

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.500 
Konami doesn't believe in the middle no
more<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:03.069> gets<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.370> destroyer<00:03:03.670> monsters<00:03:04.239> so

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
more it gets the destroyer monsters so

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.420 
more it gets the destroyer monsters so
that's<00:03:04.750> pretty<00:03:04.989> standard<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.709> shroom

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
that's pretty standard and the shroom

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.280 
that's pretty standard and the shroom
gets<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.790> story<00:03:07.060> spell<00:03:07.300> or<00:03:07.450> trap<00:03:07.660> you<00:03:07.930> only<00:03:08.080> run

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
gets a story spell or trap you only run

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.009 
gets a story spell or trap you only run
two<00:03:08.560> because<00:03:09.069> if<00:03:09.280> you<00:03:09.760> do<00:03:09.970> draw<00:03:10.390> these<00:03:10.750> guys

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
two because if you do draw these guys

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.509 
two because if you do draw these guys
you<00:03:11.260> can't<00:03:11.470> really<00:03:11.650> like<00:03:11.860> be<00:03:12.040> milling<00:03:12.400> them

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
you can't really like be milling them

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.660 
you can't really like be milling them
off<00:03:12.670> and<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:14.590> have<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:14.920> basically<00:03:15.040> set<00:03:15.550> them

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
off and you have to basically set them

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.070 
off and you have to basically set them
use<00:03:15.910> their<00:03:16.060> effects<00:03:16.330> that<00:03:16.480> way<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:16.780> this<00:03:16.930> guy

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
like with him I like them below and then

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.159

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
we have to phil gramm because phil gramm

is<00:05:32.470> like<00:05:33.190> I<00:05:33.370> think<00:05:33.760> it's<00:05:33.849> pretty<00:05:33.970> obvious<00:05:34.090> the

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
is like I think it's pretty obvious the

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:36.120 
is like I think it's pretty obvious the
deck<00:05:34.690> does<00:05:34.870> not<00:05:35.050> run<00:05:35.200> in<00:05:35.320> fact<00:05:35.500> realer<00:05:35.680> so<00:05:35.800> this

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
deck does not run in fact realer so this

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.339 
deck does not run in fact realer so this
gives<00:05:36.370> not<00:05:36.820> only<00:05:37.090> protection<00:05:37.510> to<00:05:37.840> your<00:05:37.870> field

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 
gives not only protection to your field

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:40.290 
gives not only protection to your field
set<00:05:38.620> up<00:05:38.650> but<00:05:39.280> it<00:05:39.430> basically<00:05:39.550> allows<00:05:39.880> you<00:05:40.210> to

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
set up but it basically allows you to

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.620 
set up but it basically allows you to
say<00:05:40.450> no<00:05:41.080> you<00:05:41.139> don't<00:05:41.470> get<00:05:41.650> your<00:05:41.830> effect<00:05:42.190> today

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
say no you don't get your effect today

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.089 
say no you don't get your effect today
it's<00:05:43.630> a<00:05:43.750> walking<00:05:44.020> break<00:05:44.380> through<00:05:44.590> skill<00:05:44.830> so

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099 
it's a walking break through skill so

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:47.250 
it's a walking break through skill so
definitely<00:05:45.520> you<00:05:45.700> want<00:05:45.849> to<00:05:45.910> run<00:05:46.030> it<00:05:46.150> this<00:05:46.690> is<00:05:46.990> um

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
definitely you want to run it this is um

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.830 
definitely you want to run it this is um

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:15.650 
and the only time we really need a combo

base that is banished out it's usually

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.770 
base that is banished out it's usually
spores<00:07:18.920> so<00:07:19.250> there's<00:07:19.520> not<00:07:19.670> really<00:07:19.940> a<00:07:20.270> high<00:07:20.510> use

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:20.780
