to the camera as you can see there's a

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.500 
to the camera as you can see there's a
slight<00:03:46.940> magnification<00:03:47.940> so<00:03:48.150> if<00:03:48.239> I<00:03:48.299> go<00:03:48.360> like

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
slight magnification so if I go like

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.880 
slight magnification so if I go like
that<00:03:48.540> like<00:03:48.959> that<00:03:49.110> you<00:03:49.320> could<00:03:49.410> see<00:03:49.560> it<00:03:49.680> kind<00:03:49.829> of

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
that like that you could see it kind of

that like that you could see it kind of
zooms<00:03:50.130> in<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:51.140> very<00:03:52.140> tiny<00:03:52.530> bit<00:03:52.799> it<00:03:53.519> makes

it's it's cold duty black ops 2 on the

left eye and ext titanium gaming on the

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
right I assume that that means this

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.979 
right I assume that that means this
frame<00:04:21.209> is

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
frame is

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.350 
frame is
no<00:04:22.620> while<00:04:22.830> so<00:04:23.039> it's<00:04:23.160> a<00:04:23.250> titanium<00:04:23.580> gaming<00:04:24.120> maybe

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
no while so it's a titanium gaming maybe

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.580 
no while so it's a titanium gaming maybe

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
but I assumed they'll help slightly if

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:06.230 
but I assumed they'll help slightly if
they<00:05:03.750> don't<00:05:03.960> I<00:05:04.139> don't<00:05:04.470> know<00:05:04.560> I<00:05:04.590> guess<00:05:05.039> I<00:05:05.340> wasted

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
they don't I don't know I guess I wasted

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.390 
they don't I don't know I guess I wasted
$30<00:05:07.169> that<00:05:07.319> would<00:05:07.470> have<00:05:07.590> been<00:05:07.860> void<00:05:08.159> by

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
$30 that would have been void by

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.100 
$30 that would have been void by
tomorrow<00:05:08.819> because<00:05:09.720> of<00:05:09.750> the<00:05:09.840> gift<00:05:10.050> card

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.360 
tomorrow because of the gift card
expiring<00:05:10.530> so<00:05:11.159> yeah<00:05:11.400> hopefully<00:05:11.669> their<00:05:11.970> quality

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
expiring so yeah hopefully their quality

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.399 
expiring so yeah hopefully their quality
so<00:05:14.370> as<00:05:14.460> you<00:05:14.580> can<00:05:14.669> see<00:05:14.789> the<00:05:14.909> front<00:05:15.120> frame<00:05:15.479> is

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:16.409 
so as you can see the front frame is

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:19.850 
so as you can see the front frame is
just<00:05:16.710> made<00:05:16.860> of<00:05:16.979> metal<00:05:18.169> the<00:05:19.169> brim<00:05:19.409> seems<00:05:19.680> to<00:05:19.800> be

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
just made of metal the brim seems to be

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.230 
just made of metal the brim seems to be
orange<00:05:20.159> but<00:05:20.250> that's<00:05:20.490> just<00:05:20.580> because<00:05:20.880> the<00:05:21.030> light

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
orange but that's just because the light

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.749 
orange but that's just because the light
being<00:05:21.840> reflected<00:05:22.259> by<00:05:22.349> the<00:05:22.409> lenses<00:05:22.830> as<00:05:23.639> you

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
being reflected by the lenses as you

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.610 
being reflected by the lenses as you
could<00:05:23.880> see<00:05:24.030> it<00:05:24.120> says<00:05:24.210> est<00:05:24.810> titanium<00:05:25.229> gaming

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620

so<00:06:28.409> to<00:06:28.469> sum<00:06:28.710> up<00:06:28.740> this<00:06:28.919> unboxing<00:06:29.150> the<00:06:30.150> glasses

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
so to sum up this unboxing the glasses

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.640 
so to sum up this unboxing the glasses
seem<00:06:30.630> to<00:06:30.719> be<00:06:30.810> pretty<00:06:31.020> solidly<00:06:31.320> built<00:06:31.469> they

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
seem to be pretty solidly built they

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.040 
seem to be pretty solidly built they
come<00:06:31.800> with<00:06:31.919> a<00:06:31.979> case<00:06:32.159> and

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050 
come with a case and

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.540 
come with a case and
a<00:06:33.139> little<00:06:33.770> silk<00:06:34.009> cloth<00:06:34.159> that<00:06:34.190> you<00:06:34.340> can<00:06:34.460> see

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
a little silk cloth that you can see

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:35.770 
a little silk cloth that you can see
under<00:06:34.759> the<00:06:34.789> glasses<00:06:35.030> and<00:06:35.270> behind<00:06:35.539> the<00:06:35.599> glasses

under the glasses and behind the glasses

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.070 
under the glasses and behind the glasses
the<00:06:36.740> reason<00:06:37.069> I<00:06:37.159> think<00:06:37.340> these<00:06:37.490> are<00:06:37.669> more

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
the reason I think these are more

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.330 
the reason I think these are more
usually<00:06:39.080> the<00:06:39.349> scuffed<00:06:39.590> gaming<00:06:39.860> glasses<00:06:40.159> for

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
usually the scuffed gaming glasses for

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.339 
usually the scuffed gaming glasses for
black<00:06:40.520> ops<00:06:40.669> 2<00:06:40.909> are<00:06:41.180> around<00:06:41.449> $30<00:06:42.020> but<00:06:42.229> these

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:42.349 
black ops 2 are around $30 but these

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:44.290 
black ops 2 are around $30 but these
seem<00:06:42.620> to<00:06:42.740> be<00:06:42.889> the<00:06:43.580> most<00:06:43.669> expensive<00:06:43.909> pair<00:06:44.180> which

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
seem to be the most expensive pair which

them while they're cheaper I'd say go

them while they're cheaper I'd say go
for<00:06:48.949> it<00:06:49.270> the<00:06:50.270> reason<00:06:50.449> I<00:06:50.659> think<00:06:50.720> it's<00:06:50.990> more

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:51.139 
for it the reason I think it's more

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:52.600 
for it the reason I think it's more
expensive<00:06:51.319> is<00:06:51.650> one<00:06:51.830> because<00:06:52.069> they're<00:06:52.250> seen<00:06:52.460> to

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 
expensive is one because they're seen to

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.980 
expensive is one because they're seen to
be<00:06:52.699> made<00:06:52.849> of<00:06:52.970> a<00:06:53.030> pretty<00:06:53.210> solid<00:06:53.419> metal<00:06:53.810> the

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
be made of a pretty solid metal the

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.210 
be made of a pretty solid metal the
other<00:06:54.139> ones<00:06:54.319> look<00:06:54.500> like<00:06:54.560> they<00:06:54.860> were<00:06:54.979> made<00:06:55.099> of

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.220 
other ones look like they were made of

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.249 
other ones look like they were made of
plastic<00:06:55.340> for<00:06:55.789> the<00:06:55.819> most<00:06:55.970> part<00:06:56.240> as<00:06:56.479> well<00:06:57.110> as<00:06:57.199> you

00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:57.259 
plastic for the most part as well as you

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:58.420 
plastic for the most part as well as you
get<00:06:57.349> the<00:06:57.470> hard<00:06:57.680> case<00:06:57.889> which<00:06:58.099> I<00:06:58.190> don't<00:06:58.250> think

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430 
get the hard case which I don't think

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.820 
get the hard case which I don't think
the<00:06:58.639> other<00:06:58.789> ones<00:06:59.000> come<00:06:59.240> with<00:06:59.449> so<00:07:00.409> if<00:07:00.560> you<00:07:00.620> want

the other ones come with so if you want

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.010 
the other ones come with so if you want
a<00:07:00.919> case<00:07:01.099> like<00:07:01.280> this<00:07:01.629> maybe<00:07:02.629> if<00:07:02.720> you<00:07:02.780> don't<00:07:02.870> even

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:15.319 
they actually make any difference I was

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:16.510 
they actually make any difference I was
based<00:07:15.530> on<00:07:15.650> the<00:07:15.740> reviews<00:07:16.039> I've<00:07:16.159> read<00:07:16.340> they<00:07:16.460> do

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 
based on the reviews I've read they do

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.219 
based on the reviews I've read they do
stop<00:07:16.849> your<00:07:17.060> eyes<00:07:17.150> from<00:07:17.389> becoming<00:07:17.659> a<00:07:17.810> strain<00:07:18.080> so

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:18.229 
stop your eyes from becoming a strain so

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:19.600 
stop your eyes from becoming a strain so
that<00:07:18.319> should<00:07:18.500> help<00:07:18.650> him<00:07:18.919> with<00:07:19.460> his<00:07:19.580> eyes

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:19.610 
that should help him with his eyes

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.670 
that should help him with his eyes
becoming<00:07:20.300> bloodshot<00:07:20.810> and<00:07:21.020> popping<00:07:21.530> blood

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 
becoming bloodshot and popping blood

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.080 
becoming bloodshot and popping blood
vessels<00:07:22.039> in<00:07:22.129> his<00:07:22.219> eyes<00:07:22.340> from<00:07:22.580> straining<00:07:23.000> them

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.090 
vessels in his eyes from straining them

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.689 
vessels in his eyes from straining them
against<00:07:23.389> the<00:07:23.599> TV<00:07:23.960> screen<00:07:24.340> so<00:07:25.340> hopefully<00:07:25.610> these

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:25.699 
against the TV screen so hopefully these

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:27.070 
against the TV screen so hopefully these
glasses<00:07:26.090> work<00:07:26.270> I'll<00:07:26.449> probably<00:07:26.629> make<00:07:26.810> a<00:07:26.870> review

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:27.080
