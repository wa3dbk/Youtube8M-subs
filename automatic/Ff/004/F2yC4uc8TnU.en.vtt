games<00:02:42.410> I<00:02:42.710> remember<00:02:43.370> back<00:02:43.580> on<00:02:43.820> the<00:02:43.940> Xbox<00:02:44.450> we

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
games I remember back on the Xbox we

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.170 
games I remember back on the Xbox we
used<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:44.930> link<00:02:45.170> all<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.880> Xbox's<00:02:46.880> together

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
used to link all the Xbox's together

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.940 
used to link all the Xbox's together
with<00:02:47.540> different<00:02:47.900> TV<00:02:48.140> screens<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:48.680> we<00:02:48.800> would

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
with different TV screens and we would

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.710 
with different TV screens and we would
play<00:02:49.100> each<00:02:49.310> other<00:02:49.490> from<00:02:49.850> different<00:02:49.910> rooms<00:02:50.390> now

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
play each other from different rooms now

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.820 
play each other from different rooms now
I<00:02:50.750> guess<00:02:51.140> you<00:02:51.290> know<00:02:51.380> you<00:02:51.440> can<00:02:51.620> do<00:02:51.710> that

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
I guess you know you can do that

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.550 
I guess you know you can do that
wirelessly<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:52.940> it's<00:02:53.030> a<00:02:53.060> lot<00:02:53.210> easier<00:02:53.390> but<00:02:54.320> that

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
wirelessly so it's a lot easier but that

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.350 
wirelessly so it's a lot easier but that
will<00:02:54.680> be<00:02:54.770> used<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.070> have<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.280> do<00:02:55.430> play<00:02:56.120> against

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
will be used to have to do play against

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.699 
will be used to have to do play against
their<00:02:56.480> friends

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
Warcraft there used to be I think we

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.890 
Warcraft there used to be I think we
used<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.069> call<00:04:15.189> bear<00:04:15.639> in<00:04:15.849> chat<00:04:16.090> people<00:04:16.509> used<00:04:16.840> to

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
used to call bear in chat people used to

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.039 
used to call bear in chat people used to

talk about pirates vs. ninjas all day
long<00:04:20.289> and<00:04:20.880> then<00:04:21.880> we<00:04:22.120> have<00:04:22.330> this<00:04:22.539> lynch<00:04:23.020> dum

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
long and then we have this lynch dum

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.790 
long and then we have this lynch dum
battle<00:04:24.280> mage<00:04:24.810> 50%<00:04:25.810> off<00:04:25.960> so<00:04:26.229> I<00:04:26.259> guess<00:04:26.440> this<00:04:26.590> is<00:04:26.770> a

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
battle mage 50% off so I guess this is a

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.980 
battle mage 50% off so I guess this is a
game<00:04:27.160> and<00:04:27.400> comes<00:04:27.610> with<00:04:27.669> a<00:04:27.759> code<00:04:28.090> and<00:04:28.419> I<00:04:28.720> guess<00:04:28.900> I

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
game and comes with a code and I guess I

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.499 
game and comes with a code and I guess I
get<00:04:29.110> 50%<00:04:29.500> off<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.860> game<00:04:30.039> I<00:04:30.330> think<00:04:31.330> I'll<00:04:31.389> check

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
get 50% off the game I think I'll check

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.409 
get 50% off the game I think I'll check
that<00:04:31.660> out<00:04:31.750> later<00:04:31.900> and<00:04:32.340> then<00:04:33.340> we<00:04:33.520> get<00:04:33.699> digital

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
that out later and then we get digital

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.810 
that out later and then we get digital
