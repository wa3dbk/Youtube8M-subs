00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.330
 hello everyone hello everyone and welcome 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:17.160
 Well, a problem that I have that is 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:20.820
 smaller or greater depending on how you look but 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.960
 I'm going to solve it like that because I want 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.200
 make a cheese cheese with goat's milk 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.000
 but I can not find the house or the cloth for 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.910
 strain the rennet 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.440
 and I've already taken a couple of laps out there and 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.390
 the branch is going to cost me more than the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.870
 borrico so I step to spin already 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.850
 I do not give more to build 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.860
 I will get the cloth I will make the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.850
 cloth with 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.850
 with wit 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.800
 among other things 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.180
 and with sale come rolls of these 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.180
 of normal and current bandages 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.280
 because with this I'm going to manage 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.780
 because it is a I believe but the ideal fabric 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.060
 maybe a little too thin but it's going to 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.770
 equal value so I 'm going to cut some 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.500
 how many strips 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.770
 I'm going to cut a few strips about 5 or 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.770
 6 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.590
 about five or six of about 60 centimeters 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.970
 long that after knowing each other to 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.660
 long 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.110
 I put one strip of another so they are 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.110
 equally long 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.830
 and shorten 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.810
 I think with this 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.530
 the saying 5 or 6 will depend on the width of the 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.670
 container that we go of used 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:59.310
 key but that I think with five or 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.780
 six of these we already got a width what 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.420
 enough to cover a pot by 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.300
 such a thing like a normal casserole 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.550
 ok so I have the strips so 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.550
 nothing to sew each other long stick 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.890
 well then about putting one or 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.870
 overlapping one on top of the other we see the 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.210
 area a little whiter is what they are 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.510
 peace or ride a cloth over the 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:29.019
 another and there is a cloth 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.900
 I think plenty of women told me 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:35.659
 that with gauzes of these that were put 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.689
 to the habits of babies you can be 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:41.190
 well says that they can serve where 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:44.280
 I find myself 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.350
 because now they are all you if Spain and 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.150
 rolls of those where you find a gauze 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.770
 of those if it's going to cost more wants 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.770
 find what it's worth 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:59.810
 so what I said with this to go through 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.810
 the machine that will serve me equally 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.810
 things 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.000
 then to sew on the selector of the 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.049
 stitch type machine that I'm going to 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.230
 use 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:16.360
 well, I'm going to use it in cista 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.550
 this l 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:23.550
 because this is smaller and more 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:27.000
 tight and this is longer 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.340
 13 more maybe something else but I think that 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.310
 with this spare me, I am not a 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.040
 expert sewing far but 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.700
 I think something in between is too much for me 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.830
 because the son zigzag because it is 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.260
 much more reinforced to the seam we 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.600
 let's overlap a piece of cloth with 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.160
 another and is much more reinforced than 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.160
 if we put it online 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:58.450
 online I would have to meet him twice 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.470
 in one pass it could also be but 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.989
 like there is not much more 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.879
 reinforced n may already show after 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.330
 that you have finished sewing to 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:11.030
 that you see that maybe there is a lot more 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:14.410
 more resistant 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:19.510
 to join one fabric with another 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:21.200
 with overlap about 5 or 6 millimeters a 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.540
 piece of cloth 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.970
 over the other 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:30.580
 about 56 millimeters is enough 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.330
 Well, we're giving it, I have this and 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.330
 I finish 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.450
 let's check each step 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.130
 that we go right so that we do not stay 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.130
 then zone without sewing 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.860
 good 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.750
 ready 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.910
 we see the cord that remains of the 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.910
 Union 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.610
 and what we have left here I think it 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.000
 can see perfectly the cord that 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.000
 we have left 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.090
 is much stronger in zigzag than 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.090
 if we take it in 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.789
 we see no memory 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.790
 what we have left to own encrypt 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.790
 much stronger than knowing him in 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:53.190
 line because with only one position in 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:56.139
 line would be a little weak and 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.659
 cooking twice as good 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:00.969
 could be but much stronger so 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:04.409
 in a single pass 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:04.409
 I do not roll more than I already have it 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.950
 by the way if you want to fix a 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.040
 little perimeter so that it does not remain 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.040
 A) Yes 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.380
 irregular cut at the ends then 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.440
 also a hem beams such that 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.920
 so for example 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:26.700
 and a sewing is given out there so that 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.440
 be a bit regular if it is not like that 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.560
 for what is going to be what interests us 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.860
 that is well 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.169
 between the junctions there are no zones left 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:39.700
 without sewing so that it does not escape us 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:39.700
 there the cheese when brewing 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.430
 It is worth it then it has remained 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:48.889
 very very very very perfect but I think 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:53.550
 which has been good for the purpose 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:58.030
 what I am looking for or the function that I am going to give 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:07:00.940
 Well, nothing to prove, I've done this, I hope 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.800
 someone to serve and good for longer 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:06.100
 you can see that today sometimes it's better 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.840
 wit that something else because if I'm not going to 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.300
 lose more looking for him than what in 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.770
 reality for the cloth come nothing more 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.770
 that, see you later
