 To have been enthusiastic all right temple most 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.640
 There were so many people going down with car sickness first 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:29.420
 I wonder what Masu city lack of sleep by doing the game until midnight 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.590
 I'm not hungry, I'll go until the morning 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.340

 Thank you for driving Yudai 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:53.050
 It seems like Franken is busy with developing a new menu, which was good, but it is okay 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:56.559
 It's not particularly fast, so good menus don't appear. 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:01.630
 I wanted to have a good time and I 'm happy to be invited 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:05.650
 Not good was good if so? 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:09.670
 Would be dangerous Do not jump up and down in the pumpkin car 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.600
 New wind is on the left of the traffic light 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.380
 Who over there is intends close 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:20.509
 The right holder of the right but earn good cheese 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.759
 The loss of time in a place like this at all because I like went to find a good camp 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:28.220
 I mean I found it 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:29.650
 If I go, I'm just saying myself that the locality is good, but finally I'm looking for Dai-chan 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.060
 Give me a note 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.130

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.710
 Yup 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:44.150
 But most of Peneen is only in magazines and online reviews 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:49.010
 It seems that there aren't many people so I can stretch my wings a lot 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.630
 That's peace of mind it is likely to be or chat with inadvertently placed or ear 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:55.159
 Pumpkin 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:59.130
 To either shortcuts I'm soon signal 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.390

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.930

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:22.760
 I used to go out with my teacher's outdoor research 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:28.819
 I have slept outside and made meals 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:33.530
 It is the first time for me to do it properly. 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:38.060
 I'm familiar with pumpkin camp and I think it's right 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:44.060
 Really it is also to Makai things are Matsutsu also that of the human world 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.410

 Well Yeah Is the had come with up to specify the destination in what 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:57.970
 Or troubled by force speaking, you guys are not erected a tent 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:00.069
 It 's because it's the real thing that you can cook and cry with a bonfire 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:05.340

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.340
