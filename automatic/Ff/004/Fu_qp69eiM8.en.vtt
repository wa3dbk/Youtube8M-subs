00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.099
 hello youtube friends my name is in 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.630
 I live where today we are in a new 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.980
 video for the good channel forgive me in 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.840
 that through the videos but I bring them 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.340
 a pack of new tires but you 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.650
 they do on the floor first of all they 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.690
 they will go to the description of the video 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.250
 then the cow is decompressed in a 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.910
 folder called new tires for the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.160
 gta san andreas after that we open 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.720
 the folder we copy the data folder to the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.550
 root of our gta san andreas and if we 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.059
 we will then ask to replace it 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.070
 we open the program like that and in that editor 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.989
 1.5 you know , we took it away from the file 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.369
 gt3 point and m inside the folder 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.500
 molds of our idea of â€‹â€‹san andreas 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.090
 we open then that we select all 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.880
 the files we click on the button 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.770
 open pardon forgiveness we select all 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.509
 the files that are going to be inside 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.070
 the rims folder that says gt3 point and 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.250
 selection of all files emerges 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.350
 from that folder and we're going to open it later 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.880
 we wait for him to keep giving in the 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.220
 floppy we wait for you to save and 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.140
 we closed the program 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.920
 good when they make a small gameplay 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.810
 good as we can see here we have 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.070
 many cars in my garage well let's 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.409
 take any car to do what 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.940
 will be the sample of what would be the 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.950
 new tires in this case we're going to 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.740
 take my pony c's as we can see here 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.869
 we have this car 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.189
 well we just have to go to what 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.720
 that it would be a studied store but 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.700
 in this case I have installed that 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.439
 lets study it because the side when 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.700
 first of all let's show what 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.399
 it would be the wheels as we can see there 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.070
 new wheels here each of these 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.710
 as we can see installed to the for 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.830
 virtual I never love the new ones 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.830
 wheels 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.160
 the all-rounder the mega even if it goes something 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.560
 fast but I do not want it to last long 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.860
 this video did not take long 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.050
 good 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.180
 we have people last week and so on 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.980
 there are many types of wheels there are two types 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.170
 of kinds of wheels as I told you 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.150
 previously there are what would be the 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.070
 sports cars and also what they would be 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.980
 the classic cars in this case here 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.420
 we have a luck in the 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.840
 which is the second group of 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.840
 tires 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.490
 when we can see here are the 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.060
 new tires 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:49.880
 from salvage to good from classic cars 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:53.440
 we have the classes that are these two 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.320
 the will bring them the crosses 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.790
 among others good I hope you have
