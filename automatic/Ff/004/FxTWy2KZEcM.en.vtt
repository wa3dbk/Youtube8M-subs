 semantic loads lie in this film and 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.390
 what the author wanted to convey to us 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.269
 and second what are the technical solutions he 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.809

 philosophy of his life road journey 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.570
 so before discussing how she is 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:58.970
 made what effects has on 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:01:01.730
 viewer let's see every day i 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.030
 changing my life I do not think about 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.000
 what was yesterday and every tomorrow

 day i choose new way i wake up 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 in the other side I see new faces 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.090
 every day I become different nothing 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.509
 prevents me from seeing the world in a new way and 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.619
 every day I talk friends forever and 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:25.490
 every day i find a person behind 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.649
 whom I am willing to give life and religion 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.860
 languages ​​are not persuasions don't know permanent 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.800

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:48.250
 belongs to my heart 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.250
 one day one life is my business 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.190
 so let's talk about the psychology of influence 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.750
 business cards on visual because it is very 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.680
 important point that we need 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.649
 be aware of the first video business cards 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.290
 you see rapidly changing events if 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.700
 you count them it will see that there is 24 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.520
 frames 24 micro events they have on 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.190
 us influence that we believe since we 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.220
 could have seen so much in 30 seconds 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.890
 means a lot we believe our hero 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.970
 intensity of living one day as 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.580
 a whole second moment also reinforcing 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.430
 the credibility of the viewers business cards their message 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.200
 this is the voice timbre 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.640
 pleasant and loud male pectoral 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.520
 baritone slowly narrates and we believe 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.390
 yes this is the third 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.550
 business cards used the principle of contrast 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:56.300
 quick change of events and slow 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.280
 main narrative voice also on 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.880
 contrast 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.300
 usually and unusual hero usually like everything 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.680
 brushing his teeth 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.680
 unusual only that he does it 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.950
 open hero habitual car rides 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.910
 and it is unusual that it will leave like those of others 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.340
 us and so on the contras chains our 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:24.130
 attention and we literally can't 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:26.380
 take your eyes off this well and a mistake 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.569
 which still can not be said on 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.569
 my opinion is not quite well chosen and 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.260
 so and and business card is really impressive 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.880
 or those who are unfamiliar with the video card business genre 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.430
 at first glance it may seem that 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.010
 they did it very hard but really 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.069
 In fact it is not so if carefully 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.870
 look closer then technically the whole whole 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.360
 video business card it consists of exactly three 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.680
 ingredients first text sense my 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.130
 there is a part of the text 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.870
 texts taken from the film of the text 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.880
 apparently written by the author here it is 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.430
 is the main core of the whole form 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.100
 designs further you look if you 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.570
 find in all videos of 24 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.030
 frames and every frame 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.579
 he lays down exactly one sentence then 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.799
 there is a sentence not a frame which it 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.570
 illustrates and further there is music and 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.370
 the most important ingredient 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.169
 see he is that in 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.270
 each frame continues to move 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.300
 the previous one that is if the main character 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.430
 moving this way then next 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.530
 frame he does not go to meet you that 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.860
 that is, he may say runs here 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.750
 and in the next frame he will be on tactics 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.810
 turns around that is movement somehow 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.180
 in the way she goes all the time from 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.710
 one frame to another is permissible even 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.640
 if you stand this way a 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.370
 have looked 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.410
 That 's it somewhere in the next frame you can 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.220
 enter from the opposite side because 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.590
 what is your view 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.700
 pointed out the next direction so we 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.400
 do madrid 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.250
 then take home all the videos that have 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.440
 you can be captured just 24 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.120
 form a piece of yourself as you rested on 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.100
 the beach or how did you go to some 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.070
 journey as you downloaded with friends and 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.289
 just try to connect their friend for 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.910
 friend so that one frame movement 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.770
 continued 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:22.760
 another so rolling up our sleeves plunging into 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.760
 creation
