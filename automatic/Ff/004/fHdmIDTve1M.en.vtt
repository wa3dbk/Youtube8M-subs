00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.309
 hey people what total intake and today 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.560
 I have a new extreme banging solo 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.210
 catapult for you the wool consoles 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.490
 works and mine were said 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.810
 That's why it should be extremely easy 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.660
 In any case, make it so long 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.130
 before boxing would have patched as well 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.869
 Of course I am happy if the wiki 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.760
 would leave a positive evaluation there 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.710
 but the only thing you for this solo 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.030
 catapult is needed is namely one 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.110
 I will send you the video in the video 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.700
 link description 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.250
 you just have to go to social club 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.780
 add to the game when you are standing 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.160
 that the mission was not found 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.170
 just have her side once again again 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.640
 open or top right is 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.120
 also be displayed for which 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.860
 consoles ps3 ps4 pc what do i know 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.719
 you have to choose your console 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.760
 so that the mission is still displayed 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.230
 will then learn again or again 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.149
 then simply restarts the page 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.770
 or data and then will be at 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.030
 you also see the mission 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.920
 and they can add you to the game 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.920
 if he did it then he leaves 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.170
 your easy on startup online stores and 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.119
 Jobs marked or marked jobs and 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.670
 the races and there you will then 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.049
 find job when you start the job 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.820
 then you just have to 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.799
 the containers given on the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.570
 golf course now you can just go 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.729
 into the container and shoot 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.070
 a light torch against the container 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.439
 best not up against the container 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.360
 against the ground but best stop 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.259
 against the ceiling of the container and then 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.360
 we will see that you 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.280
 Mega-moderately catapulted far into the air 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.990
 Of course most of you will 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.090
 it is not so far but it is often 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.100
 so he really went extremely far 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.810
 catapulted above and so far 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.250
 practically a high point 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.049
 You can also come with us 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.880
 shooting weapons means you can then to 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.710
 example still further torch light 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.689
 Shoot or domino rocket launcher 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.460
 what we're sure to play on everyone 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.320
 If it is really correct that is again 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.540
 something like that because it was in the last 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.430
 time making it even catapults it 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.810
 But was I not as I like it to 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.700
 example , there was a long time ago the 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.330
 Man with the helicopter where you are behind 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.310
 the 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.500
 had to break off this wing end with it 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.920
 just a little bit the air 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.380
 was catapulted 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.300
 that was almost nothing up at all 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.520
 this picture is just so that you are extreme 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.470
 goes far up or that one extreme 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.840
 is catapulted far up 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.550
 so as you said you should open it 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.890
 Make each case so long before 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.510
 oxer is patched but that was about it 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.220
 this video as always me too 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.750
 that you liked and if that's the one 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.610
 Of course , I would be glad of course 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.680
 if he gave me a positive rating or 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.390
 but that would be something with this 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.680
 video people like us next time 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.680
