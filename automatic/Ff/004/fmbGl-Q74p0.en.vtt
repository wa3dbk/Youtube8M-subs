00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.269
 let's move on to the last phase that concerns 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:14.809
 the algorithms of ICS ll after that 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.090
 I was a last last summit section 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.150
 ortega concerning the recognition 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.489
 or the recognition of the various cases of the 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.439
 xl l which I think is the most aspect 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.220
 complex 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.239
 when the first steps are taken 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.879
 within this method 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.050
 let's start with the algorithms 

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:36.739
 I want to clarify that all the 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.989
 algorithms that I run performs them 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.539
 slowly so that you can see 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.790
 exactly what is the correct movement 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.020
 at the level of finger tricks because they are 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.520
 algorithms that can be divided into 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.050
 sequence is very intuitive and very 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.810
 fast 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.930
 if by chance you have doubts about how 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.450
 quickly perform a sexy mustru with 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.910
 cutting maybe double rotations e 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.530
 these things here is the tutorial on 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.399
 finger trick always on this channel 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.969
 performed by me we start with the 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:09.950
 algorithms of ICS ll begin with the 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:11.980
 with one of the most trivial cases ie 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.710
 those where you need to 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.320
 to change only one layer into 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:22.570
 how much the first layer is already 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:26.980
 solved while the second layer at a 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:31.660
 2x1 block solved and the other two by 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:34.780
 exchanging the algorithm is the perm state of 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.620
 3 water method and that's exactly it 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.620
 I follow him slowly 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.470
 another similar case is the following 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.800
 the one in which a layer is the first 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.230
 is already solved while in the second 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.820
 layer there are two pieces to exchange 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.160
 as before with the difference that instead 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.090
 being the two pieces on the right are two 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.190
 pieces diagonally 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.950
 when they are two pieces diagonally it is not 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.410
 important starting position 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.850
 because two pens will be exchanged 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.619
 these two pieces 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.990
 let me check one can so these 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.260
 two pieces here or the piece below a 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.790
 right with the one at the top left but 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.380
 it is also true that if you put it by chance 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.320
 so and then exchange the other two 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.130
 they are put correctly illustrated 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.270
 will be solved equally for which 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.760
 just know that they come 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.150
 exchanged these two 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.910
 the algorithm is the ypsilon perm of the method 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:45.910
 3x3 friedrich and it is the following I execute it 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:49.030
 as always slowly we pass to the 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.510
 cases where states needing to 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.350
 one permutation are both in 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:59.760
 this case both layers 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:03.580
 require a diagonal permutation 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:08.530
 this entire column is evident here 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.830
 will have to end here the algorithm is the 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.830
 following 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.550
 on this algorithm there is a small one 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.319
 advice I can give you at the level of 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:30.980
 finger trick you have to perform a r2 back 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:35.690
 2 r2 reverse actually you can do a 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:40.280
 something more comfortable that is to do an r is 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:45.019
 a this point with the index you will have 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.450
 a double to do and repeat r inverse 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:51.310
 it's the reverse that comes out 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.310
 so do them simultaneously 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.269
 the algorithm we see now is that 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.370
 which happens most likely is 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.260
 the one with the most statistical probability 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.450
 so high of all others then that 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.330
 that will happen more often or that in 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.600
 which both layers will have these 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:14.540
 two pieces to exchange or two 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.519
 whole columns to be inverted are held 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:25.370
 in this way those to be exchanged are 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:27.740
 here is the algorithm is the following last 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:32.090
 two algorithms we see first of all 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.039
 this or in the up layer yes yes 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.289
 verify a situation in which there are a 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:39.800
 exchange two pieces horizontally 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:42.740
 while below there are two to exchange 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.590
 pieces diagonally 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.720
 you have to keep on your side the 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.300
 solved horizontal piece of the sheet 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.460
 above all the rest situation 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.770
 of the unimportant cube you place 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.919
 this piece here and do this 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.919
 algorithm 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:10.240
 last case the one in which the pieces from 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.969
 exchange horizontally are on 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.219
 layer below while the layer of 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:17.319
 above have two pieces diagonally from 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:19.029
 exchange you have to keep the lock is 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:21.520
 solved here on your side like 

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:24.370
 you have done before for the up layer 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.740
 so this part is the algorithm is 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.439
 the following if you notice is the mirror of 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.999
 the first one for my parameters is 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:33.310
 important to know both in 

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:34.659
 actually you could flip the cube ed 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.919
 execute the algorithm we have 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:40.779
 learned a little while ago but I find much more 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.909
 It is interesting to study the two quickly 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:45.159
 cases so you don't have to rotate the 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:47.400
 cube in this way algorithm is the 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:47.400
 following
