00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.080
 hello welcome back to paradise 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:20.200
 the flavors today I want to teach them to 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.630
 prepare barÃ§a is a very popular fan in 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.630
 Morocco that is served at breakfast 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.140
 together with honey butter or cheese for 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.610
 anoint to be attentive to the video to ask 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.510
 preparation molds that 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:37.719
 necessary ingredients we started 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.500
 in a large bowl we add 400 grams of 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.500
 fine grits 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.030
 a spoon of sugar 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.900
 half a teaspoon of salt 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.230
 and a teaspoon of chemical yeast 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.110
 we mix well 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.369
 we add 100 grams of butter 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.380
 melted and mixed well until 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.380
 get to a sandy texture 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.490
 so it has to be 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.840
 we now add 200 milliliters of milk 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.840
 tempered 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.700
 we incorporate well the milk with the semolina 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.760
 we knead a little with our hands 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.060
 we make a ball 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.329
 we cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.329
 rest 10 minutes 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.970
 after 10 minutes we put on the 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:48.700
 work table semolina and we take the dough 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.700
 and we passed it as you see in the video 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.160
 We spread the soft dough with the palms 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.220
 of the hands 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.700
 and the thickness we leave it approximately 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.700
 one centimeter 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.980
 on a tray we put a little bit of 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.980
 semolina 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.520
 and now with the help of a cup we are going to 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:42.730
 cut the dough the size you can make 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.730
 to your liking bigger or smaller 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.830
 once we have them in the tray 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.870
 we put a little semolina on top and 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.409
 the mass that we have left we worked 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.409
 again 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.930
 in a pan we put semolina 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.820
 and we place the very important area on 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.340
 body must be under what 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.690
 otherwise they will be made outside and the 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.690
 interior will stay raw 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.729
 we put a little semolina on top 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.960
 and let about 45 minutes 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.300
 approximately on one side and others 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.670
 so much on the other hand depending also 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.040
 of the thickness of your sauce 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.640
 when they are of this color we can 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.640
 turn around 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.230
 And it's ready 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:13.090
 we store them and clean the pan with 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.840
 a paper and we follow the same steps 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.840
 until finished 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.440
 I hope you like today's recipe and 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.970
 that you put it into practice thanks for 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.970
