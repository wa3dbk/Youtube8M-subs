00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
into the bowl of the mountain and there

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.690 
into the bowl of the mountain and there
we'll<00:03:31.140> take<00:03:31.170> some<00:03:31.500> trails<00:03:31.770> and<00:03:32.010> see<00:03:32.130> how<00:03:32.250> how

we'll take some trails and see how how

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.830 
we'll take some trails and see how how
close<00:03:32.970> we<00:03:33.120> need<00:03:33.270> actually<00:03:33.540> get<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:33.750> the

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
close we need actually get to the

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.890 
close we need actually get to the
mountain<00:03:34.080> itself<00:03:34.470> we<00:03:35.130> actually<00:03:35.460> see<00:03:35.640> a<00:03:35.910> little

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
mountain itself we actually see a little

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.090 
mountain itself we actually see a little
bit<00:03:37.080> of<00:03:37.140> a<00:03:37.290> mountain<00:03:37.560> peeking<00:03:37.860> through<00:03:37.890> the

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
bit of a mountain peeking through the

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.980 
bit of a mountain peeking through the
clouds<00:03:38.430> that<00:03:38.820> you<00:03:38.970> can<00:03:39.120> see<00:03:39.240> some<00:03:39.450> waterfalls

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
clouds that you can see some waterfalls

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.500 
clouds that you can see some waterfalls
coming<00:03:40.320> down<00:03:40.500> off<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:41.070> cliffs<00:03:41.340> out<00:03:41.580> there<00:03:41.910> but

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
coming down off the cliffs out there but

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.360 
coming down off the cliffs out there but
we<00:03:42.630> can't<00:03:42.870> see<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.500> summit<00:03:43.860> of<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.340> mountain

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
we can't see the summit of the mountain

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.510 
we can't see the summit of the mountain
itself<00:03:45.260> because<00:03:46.260> it's<00:03:46.440> shrouded<00:03:46.920> in<00:03:47.250> clouds

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
itself because it's shrouded in clouds

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.610 
itself because it's shrouded in clouds
and<00:03:47.880> that's<00:03:48.330> the<00:03:48.540> trouble<00:03:48.780> with<00:03:49.020> the<00:03:49.230> world's

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
and that's the trouble with the world's

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.850 
and that's the trouble with the world's
rainiest<00:03:50.100> place<00:03:50.460> there's<00:03:50.910> owns<00:03:51.210> clouds

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
rainiest place there's owns clouds

00:03:51.860 --> 00:04:00.050 
rainiest place there's owns clouds
covering<00:03:52.860> it

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.240 

I'm<00:04:01.060> heading<00:04:01.420> off<00:04:01.510> now<00:04:01.590> for<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.650> second<00:04:03.070> part

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
I'm heading off now for the second part

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.600 
I'm heading off now for the second part
of<00:04:03.430> my<00:04:03.790> journey<00:04:03.900> which<00:04:04.900> is<00:04:05.080> on<00:04:05.290> foot<00:04:05.680> along

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
of my journey which is on foot along

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.610 
of my journey which is on foot along
this<00:04:07.090> narrow<00:04:07.360> road<00:04:07.690> which<00:04:08.080> will<00:04:08.230> eventually

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
this narrow road which will eventually

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.650 
this narrow road which will eventually
turn<00:04:08.830> into<00:04:08.860> trail<00:04:09.460> and<00:04:09.820> the<00:04:10.180> trail<00:04:10.210> will

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
turn into trail and the trail will

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.280 
turn into trail and the trail will
vanish<00:04:10.870> into<00:04:11.710> a<00:04:11.890> river<00:04:12.720> I'm<00:04:13.720> looking<00:04:14.050> for<00:04:14.200> the

vanish into a river I'm looking for the

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.490 
vanish into a river I'm looking for the
a<00:04:14.320> mythical<00:04:14.890> Blue<00:04:15.490> Hole<00:04:15.850> a<00:04:16.209> great<00:04:16.810> place<00:04:17.200> of
