00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.980
 very good to all here fast danielle 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:09.490
 and well I bring one on the map of 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:12.100
 coal in for the first time a love in the 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:16.000
 demolition game mode what good what 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:19.140
 I was testing with the black clan that 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.689
 good is another thing I wanted to tell you 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.650
 that's why I'm talking to the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.730
 taxpayers 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.680
 with the one to fuck with zero with black 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.060
 but good at the end 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.060
 I'm going to go to black 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.440
 talking to them a couple of times but 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.520
 good for those of pi for those of 0 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.760
 and everyone 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.630
 and we will continue playing although not though 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:53.370
 let's be clan I do not see why not 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.370
 we could continue playing 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.760
 we are finding the video a bit 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:05.140
 we're 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.140
 in three minutes and something 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:14.560
 and good nothing in a round of chance I think 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.590
 they're still talking about the sack before 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.060
 but of the round 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.770
 Well, I took out the NBA 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.960
 a little time per round 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.210
 get to one with the car and I up 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.250
 placed the explosions and the whole truth 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.250
 it's pretty good in the game 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:43.220
 I had one of playing with me 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.650
 and I was playing with rebels and good 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.710
 seconds 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.400
 I was playing with one of 10 and with the 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.400
 black 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.520
 and against the burn good clan I do not know when 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.690
 we started the game 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:06.440
 good invitation from scratch 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.440
 but good is very important 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.670
 there are 7 seconds left for me 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.410
 when in time with one without that then 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.060
 also did not want time to start like that 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.060
 how good was everything perfect 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:25.760
 but good for that already I would have 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.800
 and well I also wanted to tell you a 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.500
 very important news at least for me 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:40.380
 the editor has already been removed from the trailer 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:40.380
 it has given me quite a lot 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.400
 Photos 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.489
 but 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:58.940
 I did not like the game too much 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.490
 futurists 25 collectives 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.860
 well it gives a little bit of thing that is like this 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.860
 old but basic 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.870
 then something 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.600
 good here with beautiful the sun some 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.090
 is now the portable radar that I 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.840
 I recommend it has already been talked about in 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.840
 several games 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.040
 and always 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.140
 forced us worth but with the radar 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.989
 portable as the casualties that you have to 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.500
 low hours but if I get to 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.909
 kill that time I would not have had the web 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.409
 that's for me at least it's pretty 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:44.909
 important the portable place 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:48.549
 he has not given me more but if he helps you 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:50.709
 next to considering putting together in the 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.829
 portable because all the disadvantages 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.920
 specialist that I found the mp 7 by 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.890
 there 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.069
 those things have love the whole 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.060
 of things 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.560
 but time nor to see me 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.190
 no christ is a pretty thing 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.190
 pretty 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:16.269
 I do not even know how you stay low 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:22.239
 of course not 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:22.239
 It is quite fast because 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.110
 the thing is pretty easy good here they go 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.150
 22 ones 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.289
 but 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.660
 I see myself to see 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:37.390
 the challenge as simple 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.910
 and therefore he does not have the 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:43.360
 practically someone figuro other 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.360
 two 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.280
 and steals and surround me but I take the 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.320
 voice 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.790
 and good kills all the team except one 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.790
 I think something had come out 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:06.470
 no longer a few seconds to 27-3 the 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.720
 departure is worth but very very good departure 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:14.300
 for the time that lasts so nothing else 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:18.580
