00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
and sound quite cool let's start with

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.330 
and sound quite cool let's start with
the<00:00:31.140> first<00:00:31.349> phrase<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.800> melody<00:00:32.070> which<00:00:32.250> is

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
the first phrase of the melody which is

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:41.510 
the first phrase of the melody which is
this<00:00:37.219> so<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.340> was<00:00:38.430> two<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.450> g<00:00:39.600> string<00:00:40.520> one

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
this so that was two on the g string one

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.170 
this so that was two on the g string one
on<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.329> B<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:43.309> double<00:00:44.309> three<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> bean

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.760 

three<00:00:48.050> again<00:00:48.980> then<00:00:49.670> zero<00:00:50.110> or<00:00:51.110> open<00:00:51.560> E<00:00:51.710> string

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
three again then zero or open E string

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.120 
three again then zero or open E string
and<00:00:52.340> then<00:00:52.520> double<00:00:53.150> one<00:00:53.330> on<00:00:53.540> the<00:00:53.660> E

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:08.340 

so<00:00:57.130> that<00:00:57.310> was<00:00:57.550> 2<00:00:58.360> 1<00:00:59.200> 3<00:01:00.160> 3<00:01:01.590> 3<00:01:02.640> 0<00:01:03.640> 1<00:01:05.580> 1<00:01:06.580> and<00:01:07.350> then

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
so that was 2 1 3 3 3 0 1 1 and then

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:16.440 
so that was 2 1 3 3 3 0 1 1 and then
we're<00:01:08.590> going<00:01:08.710> to<00:01:08.770> do<00:01:08.860> 1<00:01:09.780> 3<00:01:12.090> whoops<00:01:14.010> 0:03<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:16.330> the

right let's go from the beginning after

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:41.290 
right let's go from the beginning after
two<00:01:25.100> beats<00:01:25.360> one<00:01:26.360> two<00:01:39.460> okay<00:01:40.460> I<00:01:40.490> hope<00:01:40.700> that

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
two beats one two okay I hope that

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.080 
two beats one two okay I hope that
wasn't<00:01:41.480> too<00:01:41.630> quick<00:01:42.250> but<00:01:43.250> you<00:01:43.340> kind<00:01:43.910> of<00:01:43.940> get

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
wasn't too quick but you kind of get

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.260 
wasn't too quick but you kind of get
there<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:45.200> gist<00:01:45.440> of<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:46.100> first<00:01:46.370> phrase<00:01:46.670> the

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
there the gist of the first phrase the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.300 
there the gist of the first phrase the
second<00:01:47.600> phrase<00:01:47.780> is<00:01:47.990> almost<00:01:48.290> identical<00:01:49.070> to<00:01:49.100> the

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
second phrase is almost identical to the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.840 
second phrase is almost identical to the
first

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
first

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.850 
first
however<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.780> ending<00:01:51.110> is<00:01:51.230> slightly<00:01:51.440> different

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
however the ending is slightly different

00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:01.750 
however the ending is slightly different
okay<00:01:52.700> so<00:01:52.790> let<00:01:53.090> me<00:01:53.150> show<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:53.300> first<00:02:00.520> now<00:02:01.520> here's

okay so let me show you first now here's

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.390 
okay so let me show you first now here's
where<00:02:01.910> it's<00:02:02.060> different<00:02:02.360> he<00:02:03.350> goes<00:02:03.500> three<00:02:03.860> and

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
where it's different he goes three and

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.270 
where it's different he goes three and
you<00:02:05.390> do<00:02:05.480> a<00:02:05.510> single<00:02:05.930> one<00:02:06.080> instead<00:02:06.680> of<00:02:06.740> a<00:02:07.010> double

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
you do a single one instead of a double

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.170 
you do a single one instead of a double
and<00:02:07.670> then<00:02:07.790> back<00:02:07.970> to<00:02:08.119> three<00:02:09.369> so<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.790> second

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
and then back to three so the second

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.260 
and then back to three so the second
phrase<00:02:11.360> starts<00:02:11.690> with<00:02:11.960> two<00:02:12.200> goes<00:02:12.740> to<00:02:12.770> one<00:02:13.270> three

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
phrase starts with two goes to one three

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:22.870 
phrase starts with two goes to one three
three<00:02:14.300> three<00:02:16.450> again<00:02:17.620> zero<00:02:19.000> one<00:02:20.000> one<00:02:21.610> one<00:02:22.610> three

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
three three again zero one one one three

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:32.280 
three three again zero one one one three
double<00:02:24.520> zero<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:27.530> three<00:02:28.300> one<00:02:29.620> three

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
double zero and three one three

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.100 
double zero and three one three
call<00:02:33.129> right<00:02:33.610> so<00:02:34.209> if<00:02:34.569> you<00:02:34.719> look<00:02:34.870> if<00:02:35.079> you
