this is still sketchy at this point this
is<00:02:46.210> not<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.570> work<00:02:46.870> despite<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.470> fact<00:02:47.860> that<00:02:48.010> they

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
is not a work despite the fact that they

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
cost-cutting mode anyway so it doesn't

take much for them to have an excuse to

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.570 
take much for them to have an excuse to
fire<00:02:58.390> somebody<00:02:58.780> as<00:02:59.110> you<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.680> I<00:02:59.860> both<00:02:59.890> remember
