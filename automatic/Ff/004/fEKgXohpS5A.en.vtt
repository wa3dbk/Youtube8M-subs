that solves the rubik's cube using the
corners<00:00:18.570> first<00:00:18.750> method<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.380> parts<00:00:19.980> 1<00:00:20.189> 2<00:00:20.220> &amp;<00:00:20.550> 3<00:00:20.609> we

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
corners first method in parts 1 2 &amp; 3 we

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.060 
corners first method in parts 1 2 &amp; 3 we
solved<00:00:21.660> all<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.050> corners<00:00:22.380> by<00:00:22.529> putting<00:00:22.830> an<00:00:22.920> X

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
solved all the corners by putting an X

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.000 
solved all the corners by putting an X
on<00:00:23.189> every<00:00:23.460> side<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.510> part<00:00:24.750> 4<00:00:25.050> we<00:00:25.619> started

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
on every side and in part 4 we started

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.189 
on every side and in part 4 we started
to<00:00:26.099> put<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.460> edge<00:00:26.640> pieces<00:00:27.000> together<00:00:27.359> people

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
to put the edge pieces together people

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.630 
to put the edge pieces together people
have<00:00:28.320> been<00:00:28.410> getting<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.680> little<00:00:28.710> confusing<00:00:29.369> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
have been getting a little confusing the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.849 
have been getting a little confusing the
best<00:00:29.880> way<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.119> do<00:00:30.359> these<00:00:30.480> edges<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.170> perhaps<00:00:31.619> I

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
best way to do these edges and perhaps I

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:32.749 
best way to do these edges and perhaps I
did<00:00:32.040> that

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
did that

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.420 
did that
step<00:00:33.390> 4<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> little<00:00:33.870> too<00:00:34.050> fast<00:00:34.350> for<00:00:34.680> people<00:00:34.980> so

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
step 4 a little too fast for people so

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.750 
step 4 a little too fast for people so
I'm<00:00:35.520> going<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.700> do<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.910> little<00:00:36.030> bit<00:00:36.270> slower

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
I'm going to do it a little bit slower

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.850 
I'm going to do it a little bit slower
in<00:00:38.760> this<00:00:38.940> particular<00:00:39.239> case<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:40.200> are<00:00:40.230> I'm

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
in this particular case you are I'm

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.229 
in this particular case you are I'm
going<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.100> pick<00:00:41.250> yellow<00:00:41.489> for<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.790> top<00:00:42.059> but

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
going to pick yellow for the top but

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.850 
going to pick yellow for the top but
again<00:00:42.270> once<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.930> have<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.170> X<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.500> every<00:00:43.680> side

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
again once you have the X in every side

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.950 
again once you have the X in every side
you<00:00:44.160> can<00:00:44.370> pick<00:00:44.610> whatever<00:00:45.059> side<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.750> want

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
you can pick whatever side you want

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.200 
you can pick whatever side you want
usually<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.590> side<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.160> works<00:00:47.399> fastest<00:00:47.969> for

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
usually the side that works fastest for

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.630 
usually the side that works fastest for
you<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.629> what<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.200> want<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.440> do<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.460> want

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
you and what you want to do is you want

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.029 
you and what you want to do is you want
to<00:00:50.700> look<00:00:50.879> for<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.600> middle<00:00:51.930> row<00:00:52.140> any<00:00:52.500> place

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
to look for in this middle row any place

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.430 
to look for in this middle row any place
that<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:53.579> find<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:54.329> top<00:00:54.570> color<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.320> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
that you can find the top color so the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.590 
that you can find the top color so the
top<00:00:55.590> color<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.949> yellow<00:00:56.100> here's<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.030> yellow<00:00:57.239> and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
top color is yellow here's a yellow and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.360 
top color is yellow here's a yellow and
what<00:00:58.500> you're<00:00:58.649> going<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.859> do<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.160> you're<00:00:59.280> going

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
what you're going to do is you're going

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.910 
what you're going to do is you're going
to<00:00:59.430> put<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.730> first<00:01:00.000> three<00:01:00.449> pieces<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:01.230> but<00:01:01.739> not

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
to put the first three pieces in but not

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.429 
to put the first three pieces in but not
the<00:01:02.129> fourth<00:01:02.399> piece<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.480> here<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.840> yellow<00:01:04.260> and

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
the fourth piece so here is a yellow and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.620 
the fourth piece so here is a yellow and
a<00:01:04.500> green<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.400> go<00:01:05.549> up<00:01:05.729> here<00:01:06.119> but

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
a green it's going to go up here but

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.260 
a green it's going to go up here but
where<00:01:07.110> yellow<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.590> green<00:01:07.799> are<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.790> what<00:01:09.119> you

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
where yellow and green are so what you

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.480 
where yellow and green are so what you
do<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.630> just<00:01:09.840> turn<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.260> cube<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:11.220> that

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
do is you just turn the cube so that

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.630 
do is you just turn the cube so that
here's<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.360> piece<00:01:12.540> where<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.780> needs<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.049> go

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
here's the piece where it needs to go

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.830 
here's the piece where it needs to go
here<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.760> where<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.030> piece<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.540> it's<00:01:15.780> very

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
here is where that piece is it's very

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.149 
here is where that piece is it's very
simple<00:01:16.380> we're<00:01:16.950> going<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.130> turn<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.700> clockwise

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
simple we're going to turn it clockwise

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.190 
simple we're going to turn it clockwise
we're<00:01:20.159> going<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.340> put<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.729> piece<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.200> and

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
we're going to put the piece in and

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.300 
we're going to put the piece in and
we're<00:01:22.290> going<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.439> just<00:01:22.590> turn<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.860> back<00:01:23.040> and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
we're going to just turn it back and

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.910 
we're going to just turn it back and
there<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.150> go<00:01:24.299> that's<00:01:24.450> 1<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.020> we're<00:01:25.740> going<00:01:25.890> to

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
there you go that's 1 and we're going to

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.219 
there you go that's 1 and we're going to
keep<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.430> as<00:01:26.850> far<00:01:27.090> as<00:01:27.150> we<00:01:27.390> can<00:01:27.630> around<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
keep going as far as we can around the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.850 
keep going as far as we can around the
middle<00:01:28.700> so<00:01:29.700> here<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> yellow<00:01:30.600> blue<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.439> needs

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
middle so here is a yellow blue it needs

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.640 
middle so here is a yellow blue it needs
to<00:01:32.100> go<00:01:32.250> up<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.640> yellow<00:01:32.970> blue<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.960> we'll<00:01:34.140> turn<00:01:34.409> it

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
to go up to yellow blue so we'll turn it

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.890 
to go up to yellow blue so we'll turn it
so<00:01:35.159> again<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.850> backside<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.720> where

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
so again it's on the backside of where

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.359 
so again it's on the backside of where
it<00:01:36.990> needs<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.259> be<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.590> yellow<00:01:37.710> blue<00:01:37.979> needs<00:01:38.189> to

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
it needs to be the yellow blue needs to

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.520 
it needs to be the yellow blue needs to
be<00:01:38.460> right<00:01:38.670> here<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.090> it's<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> backside

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
be right here and it's on the backside

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.469 
be right here and it's on the backside
we<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:41.430> simply<00:01:41.759> turn<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.750> down<00:01:43.820> move<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.180> into

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
we just simply turn it down move it into

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.429 
we just simply turn it down move it into
position<00:01:46.110> by<00:01:46.320> moving<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:48.049> why<00:01:49.049> did<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.229> just

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
position by moving it why did I just

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.980 
position by moving it why did I just
have<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> freeze<00:01:50.210> clock<00:01:51.210> my<00:01:51.329> camera<00:01:51.659> froze<00:01:51.840> for

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
have a freeze clock my camera froze for

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.319 
have a freeze clock my camera froze for
a<00:01:52.049> second<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.500> then<00:01:53.280> back<00:01:53.549> up<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:54.000> case<00:01:54.030> it

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
a second and then back up in case it

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.060 
a second and then back up in case it
froze<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.810> case<00:01:54.960> my<00:01:55.140> camera<00:01:55.439> froze<00:01:55.740> let<00:01:55.950> me

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
froze in case my camera froze let me

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.060 
froze in case my camera froze let me
redo<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.810> so<00:01:57.810> here's<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.200> yellow<00:01:58.350> blue<00:01:58.770> and

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
redo that so here's the yellow blue and

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.219 
redo that so here's the yellow blue and
we<00:01:59.820> need<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.090> put<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.360> here<00:02:00.600> with<00:02:00.719> yellow<00:02:00.990> blue

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
we need to put it here with yellow blue

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.410 
we need to put it here with yellow blue
we<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:01.950> make<00:02:02.130> sure<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.640> top<00:02:02.850> color<00:02:03.180> is

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
we just make sure that the top color is

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.010 
we just make sure that the top color is
in<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.869> back<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.820> then<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.939> would<00:02:06.090> turn<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
in the back and then you would turn the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.260 
in the back and then you would turn the
face<00:02:07.259> down<00:02:07.619> there<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.789> right<00:02:08.970> there

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
face down there it is right there

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.680 
face down there it is right there
move<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.170> middle<00:02:10.500> layer

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
move that middle layer

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.560 
move that middle layer
so<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.350> comes<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.770> meets<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.570> turns

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
so that it comes and meets it and turns

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.050 
so that it comes and meets it and turns
up<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:16.350> can<00:02:16.470> be<00:02:16.590> done<00:02:16.740> both<00:02:17.010> ways<00:02:17.310> if<00:02:17.760> if

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
up and it can be done both ways if if

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.380 
up and it can be done both ways if if
you<00:02:18.570> see<00:02:18.810> for<00:02:18.990> example<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:20.010> yellow<00:02:20.220> piece<00:02:21.180> on

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
you see for example the yellow piece on

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.230 
you see for example the yellow piece on
this<00:02:21.570> side<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:23.340> still<00:02:23.610> would<00:02:23.760> put<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.120> this

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
this side you still would put it in this

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.290 
this side you still would put it in this
back<00:02:24.510> turn<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.500> this<00:02:25.920> way<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.400> put<00:02:26.820> it<00:02:26.940> in<00:02:27.090> and

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
back turn it this way and put it in and

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.150 
back turn it this way and put it in and
then<00:02:27.450> turn<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.660> up<00:02:27.900> or<00:02:28.110> if<00:02:28.680> it's<00:02:28.800> on<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.100> side

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
then turn it up or if it's on this side

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.770 
then turn it up or if it's on this side
like<00:02:29.640> this<00:02:29.790> one<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.180> we're<00:02:30.540> going<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.690> do

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
like this one is we're going to do

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.550 
like this one is we're going to do
yellow<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.380> red<00:02:32.030> we're<00:02:33.030> going<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.210> put<00:02:33.560> again

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
yellow and red we're going to put again

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.180 
yellow and red we're going to put again
we<00:02:34.770> have<00:02:34.980> yellow<00:02:35.700> red<00:02:36.590> there<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.710> needs<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:38.040> be

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
we have yellow red there it needs to be

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.940 
we have yellow red there it needs to be
yellow<00:02:38.850> red<00:02:39.090> we<00:02:39.930> put<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.290> piece<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.740> top

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
yellow red we put the piece the top

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.790 
yellow red we put the piece the top
color<00:02:41.190> piece<00:02:41.370> in<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.670> back<00:02:41.850> back

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
color piece in the back back

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.260 
color piece in the back back
so<00:02:43.800> there's<00:02:44.040> or<00:02:44.280> needs<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.670> go<00:02:44.790> in<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.000> front

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
so there's or needs to go in the front

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.860 
so there's or needs to go in the front
we<00:02:45.690> turn<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.080> down<00:02:46.260> we<00:02:47.160> put<00:02:47.460> it<00:02:47.610> in<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:47.970> we<00:02:48.660> turn

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
we turn it down we put it in and we turn

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.110 
we turn it down we put it in and we turn
it<00:02:48.900> up<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.440> all<00:02:50.040> we're<00:02:50.220> going<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.370> do<00:02:50.640> is<00:02:50.850> solve

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
it up and all we're going to do is solve

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.010 
it up and all we're going to do is solve
three<00:02:51.830> so<00:02:52.830> with<00:02:53.040> three<00:02:53.550> yellow<00:02:54.210> done<00:02:54.480> now

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
three so with three yellow done now

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.150 
three so with three yellow done now
we're<00:02:55.170> going<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.350> turn<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.560> over<00:02:55.710> and<00:02:55.980> look<00:02:56.100> at

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
we're going to turn it over and look at

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.460 
we're going to turn it over and look at
the<00:02:56.220> other<00:02:56.430> side<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:57.030> this<00:02:57.450> case<00:02:57.720> we<00:02:57.990> we<00:02:58.260> have

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
the other side in this case we we have

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.070 
the other side in this case we we have
three<00:02:58.800> here<00:02:59.100> but<00:02:59.370> they're<00:02:59.520> not<00:02:59.640> there<00:03:00.080> but

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
three here but they're not there but

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.140 
three here but they're not there but
they're<00:03:01.200> actually<00:03:01.320> not<00:03:01.530> correct<00:03:02.280> we<00:03:02.820> have<00:03:03.000> the

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
they're actually not correct we have the

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.670 
they're actually not correct we have the
white<00:03:03.360> green<00:03:03.690> that's<00:03:03.930> correct<00:03:04.320> though<00:03:04.500> the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
white green that's correct though the

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.750 
white green that's correct though the
white<00:03:04.890> blue<00:03:05.370> doesn't<00:03:06.060> belong<00:03:06.330> there<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:07.760> the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
white blue doesn't belong there and the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.970 
white blue doesn't belong there and the
white<00:03:09.030> orange<00:03:09.900> doesn't<00:03:10.200> belong<00:03:10.590> there

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
white orange doesn't belong there

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.750 
white orange doesn't belong there
so<00:03:11.940> what<00:03:12.480> we<00:03:12.600> need<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:12.930> do<00:03:13.110> is<00:03:13.380> move<00:03:14.040> these

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
so what we need to do is move these

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.240 
so what we need to do is move these
pieces<00:03:15.090> around<00:03:15.510> this<00:03:15.780> white<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.830> orange<00:03:17.160> is

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
pieces around this white the orange is

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.460 
pieces around this white the orange is
going<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.459> need<00:03:17.580> to<00:03:17.730> go<00:03:17.850> here<00:03:18.300> this<00:03:18.810> white<00:03:19.110> blue

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
going to need to go here this white blue

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.070 
going to need to go here this white blue
is<00:03:19.770> going<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.250> need<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.550> go<00:03:20.700> here<00:03:21.060> so<00:03:21.180> here's

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
is going to need to go here so here's

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.080 
is going to need to go here so here's
how<00:03:22.230> we're<00:03:22.380> going<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.770> do<00:03:22.920> that<00:03:23.160> remember<00:03:23.850> how

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
how we're going to do that remember how

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.300 
how we're going to do that remember how
I<00:03:24.120> said<00:03:24.270> we<00:03:24.420> always<00:03:24.630> have<00:03:24.900> that<00:03:25.050> missing<00:03:25.500> that

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
I said we always have that missing that

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.770 
I said we always have that missing that
we<00:03:26.400> only<00:03:26.550> solve<00:03:26.790> three<00:03:27.060> on<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.240> bottom<00:03:27.390> well

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
we only solve three on the bottom well

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.120 
we only solve three on the bottom well
it's<00:03:27.900> because<00:03:28.140> every<00:03:28.380> time<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.680> do<00:03:28.800> a<00:03:28.830> piece

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
it's because every time you do a piece

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.040 
it's because every time you do a piece
on<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.430> top<00:03:29.640> you<00:03:29.820> do<00:03:30.000> mess<00:03:30.180> up<00:03:30.209> one<00:03:30.600> piece<00:03:30.840> on

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
on the top you do mess up one piece on

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.690 
on the top you do mess up one piece on
the<00:03:31.170> bottom<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:31.709> so<00:03:32.220> what<00:03:32.370> you're<00:03:32.520> going<00:03:32.610> to

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
the bottom and so what you're going to

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.370 
the bottom and so what you're going to
do<00:03:32.850> is<00:03:33.000> whenever<00:03:33.360> you're<00:03:33.660> doing<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:34.020> piece<00:03:34.200> up

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
do is whenever you're doing the piece up

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.960 
do is whenever you're doing the piece up
here<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:34.770> always<00:03:35.160> seem<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.370> mess<00:03:35.670> up<00:03:35.850> the

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
here you always seem to mess up the

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.540 
here you always seem to mess up the
piece<00:03:36.150> directly<00:03:36.360> under<00:03:36.990> it<00:03:37.020> so<00:03:37.709> what<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:37.950> do<00:03:38.130> is

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
piece directly under it so what I do is

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.400 
piece directly under it so what I do is
I<00:03:38.670> turn<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:39.209> bottom<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.720> always<00:03:40.020> make<00:03:40.200> sure

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
I turn the bottom to always make sure

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.260 
I turn the bottom to always make sure
that<00:03:40.590> this<00:03:40.770> messed<00:03:41.070> up<00:03:41.250> piece<00:03:41.520> is<00:03:41.760> underneath

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
that this messed up piece is underneath

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.690 
that this messed up piece is underneath
the<00:03:42.480> piece<00:03:42.660> I'm<00:03:42.840> working<00:03:42.870> on<00:03:43.380> so<00:03:44.040> therefore<00:03:44.489> I

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
the piece I'm working on so therefore I

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.640 
the piece I'm working on so therefore I
don't<00:03:44.760> mess<00:03:45.150> up<00:03:45.180> these<00:03:45.540> pieces<00:03:45.840> I<00:03:46.140> always<00:03:46.470> just

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
don't mess up these pieces I always just

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.430 
don't mess up these pieces I always just
mess<00:03:46.830> up<00:03:46.940> one<00:03:47.940> piece<00:03:48.180> that<00:03:48.209> is<00:03:48.660> already<00:03:49.170> messed

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
mess up one piece that is already messed

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.110 
mess up one piece that is already messed
up<00:03:49.590> so<00:03:50.220> here's<00:03:50.430> how<00:03:50.580> we're<00:03:50.730> going<00:03:50.850> to<00:03:51.000> actually

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
up so here's how we're going to actually

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.050 
up so here's how we're going to actually
solve<00:03:51.570> moving<00:03:52.440> these<00:03:52.590> around<00:03:53.070> we're<00:03:53.880> going<00:03:54.000> to

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
solve moving these around we're going to

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.130 
solve moving these around we're going to
move<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.270> orange<00:03:55.400> here<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:57.000> blue<00:03:57.239> one<00:03:57.450> here

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
move the orange here the blue one here

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.050 
move the orange here the blue one here
we<00:03:58.620> actually<00:03:58.920> can<00:03:59.070> do<00:03:59.160> this<00:03:59.340> all<00:03:59.489> in<00:03:59.640> one<00:03:59.760> move

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
we actually can do this all in one move

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.420 
we actually can do this all in one move
I'll<00:04:00.780> take<00:04:00.989> a<00:04:01.020> look<00:04:01.260> I'm<00:04:01.590> going<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:01.800> move<00:04:01.950> this

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
I'll take a look I'm going to move this

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.540 
I'll take a look I'm going to move this
down<00:04:02.489> and<00:04:03.770> we're<00:04:04.770> going<00:04:04.890> to<00:04:04.920> move<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.340> blue

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
down and we're going to move the blue

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.500 
down and we're going to move the blue
back<00:04:06.260> we're<00:04:07.260> going<00:04:07.380> to<00:04:07.470> put<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.770> up<00:04:08.390> and<00:04:09.390> we're

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
back we're going to put it up and we're

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.920 
back we're going to put it up and we're
going<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:10.100> move<00:04:11.100> two<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.060> that<00:04:12.480> where<00:04:12.630> we<00:04:12.750> want

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
going to move two to that where we want

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.409 
going to move two to that where we want
that<00:04:13.260> piece<00:04:14.040> to<00:04:14.280> go<00:04:14.810> which<00:04:15.810> is<00:04:15.840> now<00:04:16.169> right<00:04:16.830> here

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
that piece to go which is now right here

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.510 
that piece to go which is now right here
we're<00:04:18.419> going<00:04:18.660> to<00:04:18.780> now<00:04:19.020> turn<00:04:19.080> it<00:04:19.620> back<00:04:19.799> down<00:04:21.229> and

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
we're going to now turn it back down and

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.590 
we're going to now turn it back down and
there<00:04:23.520> remember<00:04:23.850> it's<00:04:23.940> still<00:04:23.970> there<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:24.479> when

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
there remember it's still there and when

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.909 
there remember it's still there and when
we're<00:04:24.750> going<00:04:24.870> to<00:04:24.930> then<00:04:25.080> put<00:04:25.380> it<00:04:25.470> into<00:04:25.740> its

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
we're going to then put it into its

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:26.659 
we're going to then put it into its
place

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
place

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.700 
place
we're<00:04:27.599> going<00:04:27.720> to<00:04:27.780> turn<00:04:27.960> it<00:04:28.080> back<00:04:28.110> up<00:04:29.060> now<00:04:30.060> and

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
we're going to turn it back up now and

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.409 
we're going to turn it back up now and
then<00:04:31.710> it's<00:04:31.979> actually<00:04:32.370> moved<00:04:32.639> that<00:04:32.909> white<00:04:33.150> blue

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
then it's actually moved that white blue

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:34.999 
then it's actually moved that white blue
piece<00:04:33.659> to<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:33.960> bottom<00:04:34.289> so<00:04:34.620> what<00:04:34.770> we're<00:04:34.919> going

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
piece to the bottom so what we're going

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:36.850 
piece to the bottom so what we're going
to<00:04:35.069> do<00:04:35.280> is<00:04:35.520> we're<00:04:35.669> now<00:04:35.759> going<00:04:35.940> to<00:04:36.030> turn<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.449> top

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
to do is we're now going to turn the top

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.320 
to do is we're now going to turn the top
so<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:38.099> white<00:04:38.250> blue<00:04:38.490> piece<00:04:38.729> is<00:04:38.879> directly

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
so the white blue piece is directly

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.689 
so the white blue piece is directly
under<00:04:39.569> it<00:04:39.650> we're<00:04:40.650> going<00:04:40.800> to<00:04:40.860> turn<00:04:41.099> it<00:04:41.159> sideways

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
under it we're going to turn it sideways

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.339 
under it we're going to turn it sideways
and<00:04:42.180> just<00:04:42.590> move<00:04:43.590> that<00:04:43.830> piece<00:04:44.129> into<00:04:44.370> place<00:04:44.490> and

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
and just move that piece into place and

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:49.309 
and just move that piece into place and
turn<00:04:46.349> it<00:04:46.500> back<00:04:47.060> now<00:04:48.060> we<00:04:48.629> still<00:04:48.870> just<00:04:48.900> have<00:04:49.080> our

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:49.319 
turn it back now we still just have our

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:51.050 
turn it back now we still just have our
one<00:04:49.500> messed-up<00:04:49.710> piece<00:04:50.159> these<00:04:50.490> are<00:04:50.699> still<00:04:50.909> all

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
one messed-up piece these are still all

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.960 
one messed-up piece these are still all
fine<00:04:51.360> but<00:04:51.720> now<00:04:51.840> we've<00:04:52.020> put<00:04:52.259> one<00:04:52.470> two<00:04:53.220> three<00:04:53.879> of

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
fine but now we've put one two three of

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.379 
fine but now we've put one two three of
these<00:04:54.090> into<00:04:54.419> place<00:04:55.729> you<00:04:56.729> can<00:04:56.879> actually<00:04:57.120> turn

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
these into place you can actually turn

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:02.260 
these into place you can actually turn
this<00:04:58.219> and<00:05:00.020> we've<00:05:01.020> got<00:05:01.050> three<00:05:01.440> on<00:05:01.560> the<00:05:01.680> top<00:05:01.860> and

this and we've got three on the top and
we've<00:05:03.270> got<00:05:03.509> three<00:05:03.780> on<00:05:03.900> the<00:05:04.020> bottom<00:05:04.280> now<00:05:06.020> the

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
we've got three on the bottom now the

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.540 
we've got three on the bottom now the
next<00:05:07.259> thing<00:05:07.409> that<00:05:07.440> needs<00:05:07.889> to<00:05:07.979> happen<00:05:08.069> is<00:05:08.460> you

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
next thing that needs to happen is you

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.300 
next thing that needs to happen is you
need<00:05:08.729> to<00:05:08.759> put<00:05:09.000> a<00:05:09.060> fourth<00:05:09.360> piece<00:05:09.599> in<00:05:10.099> either<00:05:11.099> on

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
need to put a fourth piece in either on

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.950 
need to put a fourth piece in either on
the<00:05:11.400> top<00:05:11.610> or<00:05:11.819> the<00:05:11.879> bottom<00:05:11.969> because<00:05:12.840> you're

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
the top or the bottom because you're

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.089 
the top or the bottom because you're
going<00:05:13.080> to<00:05:13.139> be<00:05:13.319> putting<00:05:13.530> these<00:05:13.680> two<00:05:13.889> pieces

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
going to be putting these two pieces

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:18.320 
going to be putting these two pieces
together<00:05:14.430> so<00:05:15.270> in<00:05:15.479> this<00:05:15.569> case<00:05:16.819> since<00:05:17.819> I<00:05:18.000> see<00:05:18.210> the

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
together so in this case since I see the

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.149 
together so in this case since I see the
white<00:05:18.509> is<00:05:18.690> here<00:05:19.050> and<00:05:19.229> there<00:05:19.800> could<00:05:19.949> only<00:05:20.009> be

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:20.159 
white is here and there could only be

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:22.909 
white is here and there could only be
one<00:05:20.280> more<00:05:20.639> white<00:05:20.849> white<00:05:21.150> red<00:05:21.680> needs<00:05:22.680> to<00:05:22.830> go

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
one more white white red needs to go

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.589 
one more white white red needs to go
right<00:05:22.949> there<00:05:23.099> I<00:05:23.490> put<00:05:24.000> it<00:05:24.120> below<00:05:24.389> where<00:05:24.569> it

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599 
right there I put it below where it

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.430 
right there I put it below where it
needs<00:05:24.810> to<00:05:24.930> go<00:05:25.020> I<00:05:25.610> turn<00:05:26.610> it<00:05:26.840> put<00:05:27.840> it<00:05:27.960> into<00:05:28.169> place

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
needs to go I turn it put it into place

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.010 
needs to go I turn it put it into place
and<00:05:28.879> turn<00:05:29.879> it<00:05:30.030> back<00:05:30.180> up<00:05:30.210> and<00:05:30.690> that's<00:05:30.810> going<00:05:30.960> to

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
and turn it back up and that's going to

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.350 
and turn it back up and that's going to
solve<00:05:31.440> that<00:05:31.560> side<00:05:32.039> and<00:05:32.310> now<00:05:32.940> we're<00:05:33.120> going<00:05:33.270> to

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
solve that side and now we're going to

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.089 
solve that side and now we're going to
have<00:05:33.719> to<00:05:33.870> put<00:05:34.050> that<00:05:34.139> last<00:05:34.469> piece<00:05:34.740> into<00:05:35.069> place

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
have to put that last piece into place

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.640 
have to put that last piece into place
so<00:05:35.729> to<00:05:35.789> put<00:05:36.000> this<00:05:36.180> last<00:05:36.449> piece<00:05:36.779> up<00:05:37.050> here<00:05:37.080> it

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
so to put this last piece up here it

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.339 
so to put this last piece up here it
could<00:05:37.889> either<00:05:38.009> be<00:05:38.130> here<00:05:38.669> or<00:05:39.330> it<00:05:39.389> can<00:05:39.810> be<00:05:39.960> here

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
could either be here or it can be here

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:42.529 
could either be here or it can be here
the<00:05:40.740> move<00:05:40.949> is<00:05:41.130> very<00:05:41.250> similar<00:05:41.880> to<00:05:42.180> each<00:05:42.300> other

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
the move is very similar to each other

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:43.939 
the move is very similar to each other
they're<00:05:42.779> just<00:05:42.990> sort<00:05:43.110> of<00:05:43.259> symmetrically

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:43.949 
they're just sort of symmetrically

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:45.350 
they're just sort of symmetrically
opposed<00:05:44.279> depending<00:05:44.789> on<00:05:44.880> which<00:05:45.029> way<00:05:45.210> you're

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
opposed depending on which way you're

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.180 
opposed depending on which way you're
going<00:05:45.449> to<00:05:45.539> turn<00:05:45.719> this<00:05:45.990> so<00:05:46.800> what<00:05:46.949> you're<00:05:47.099> going

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
going to turn this so what you're going

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.070 
going to turn this so what you're going
to<00:05:47.250> do<00:05:47.460> to<00:05:47.639> put<00:05:47.849> this<00:05:48.000> piece<00:05:48.240> up<00:05:48.419> here<00:05:48.449> is

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
to do to put this piece up here is

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.920 
to do to put this piece up here is
you're<00:05:49.259> going<00:05:49.380> to<00:05:49.469> turn<00:05:49.650> this<00:05:49.889> up<00:05:50.930> you're

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
you're going to turn this up you're

00:05:51.930 --> 00:06:00.050 
you're going to turn this up you're
going<00:05:52.080> to<00:05:52.139> turn<00:05:53.090> this<00:05:54.090> center<00:05:56.300> back<00:05:58.639> then<00:05:59.639> turn

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
going to turn this center back then turn

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.390 
going to turn this center back then turn
that<00:06:01.009> back<00:06:03.080> there<00:06:04.080> it<00:06:04.199> is<00:06:04.319> back<00:06:04.500> there<00:06:04.740> turn<00:06:05.250> it

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
that back there it is back there turn it

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.869 
that back there it is back there turn it
down

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:05.879 
down

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:09.860 
down
put<00:06:06.840> it<00:06:06.960> back<00:06:07.169> in<00:06:07.440> and<00:06:08.330> then<00:06:09.330> turn<00:06:09.569> it<00:06:09.719> up<00:06:09.840> you
