magnetized<00:01:00.820> sponsons<00:01:01.820> here<00:01:02.120> I<00:01:02.300> do<00:01:02.600> believe<00:01:02.989> a

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
magnetized sponsons here I do believe a

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.890 
magnetized sponsons here I do believe a
heavy<00:01:03.530> flamers<00:01:04.190> the<00:01:04.489> alternate<00:01:04.970> there<00:01:05.150> this

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
heavy flamers the alternate there this

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.260 
heavy flamers the alternate there this
is<00:01:06.110> called<00:01:06.440> a<00:01:06.680> prat<00:01:07.610> or<00:01:07.910> a<00:01:08.150> salt<00:01:08.540> launcher<00:01:09.230> and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
is called a prat or a salt launcher and

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.900 
is called a prat or a salt launcher and
this<00:01:11.270> is<00:01:11.450> an<00:01:11.570> extremely<00:01:12.320> just<00:01:13.220> look<00:01:13.490> at<00:01:13.700> that

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
this is an extremely just look at that

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.550 
this is an extremely just look at that
front<00:01:14.720> that<00:01:15.260> is<00:01:15.500> really<00:01:16.210> really<00:01:17.210> super<00:01:17.570> oh<00:01:17.990> my

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
front that is really really super oh my

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.060 
front that is really really super oh my
gosh

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.310 
gosh
I<00:01:19.100> want<00:01:19.490> one<00:01:20.110> these<00:01:21.110> are<00:01:21.440> really<00:01:22.220> really<00:01:22.700> neat

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
I want one these are really really neat

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.800 
I want one these are really really neat
it's<00:01:24.320> got<00:01:24.500> like<00:01:24.620> a<00:01:24.680> back<00:01:24.980> hatch<00:01:25.280> here<00:01:25.810> and

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
it's got like a back hatch here and

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.530 
it's got like a back hatch here and
check<00:01:27.770> this<00:01:27.950> action<00:01:28.370> out<00:01:28.520> at<00:01:29.390> this<00:01:30.010> and<00:01:31.540> and

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
check this action out at this and and

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.300 
check this action out at this and and
and<00:01:32.930> it<00:01:33.020> stays<00:01:33.290> open<00:01:33.500> you<00:01:33.710> actually<00:01:34.070> have<00:01:34.190> to

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
and it stays open you actually have to

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.540 
and it stays open you actually have to
turn<00:01:34.550> this<00:01:34.850> vertical<00:01:35.450> to<00:01:36.260> get<00:01:37.070> it<00:01:37.190> to<00:01:37.370> slide

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
turn this vertical to get it to slide

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.400 
turn this vertical to get it to slide
back<00:01:38.000> in<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.450> I<00:01:38.510> do<00:01:38.570> believe<00:01:38.870> this<00:01:39.230> is

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
back in and I do believe this is

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.130 
back in and I do believe this is
magnetized<00:01:40.130> it<00:01:40.880> has<00:01:41.090> like<00:01:41.420> it's<00:01:41.690> really<00:01:41.930> hard

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
magnetized it has like it's really hard

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.980 
magnetized it has like it's really hard
to<00:01:42.290> get<00:01:42.470> it<00:01:42.710> off<00:01:43.010> with<00:01:43.310> one<00:01:43.610> hand<00:01:44.210> so<00:01:44.570> I<00:01:44.600> won't

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
to get it off with one hand so I won't

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.480 
to get it off with one hand so I won't
even<00:01:45.110> try

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
even try

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.820 
even try
and<00:01:46.700> then<00:01:46.940> there's<00:01:47.180> an<00:01:47.450> alternate<00:01:48.080> missile

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
and then there's an alternate missile

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.470 
and then there's an alternate missile
launcher<00:01:49.160> here<00:01:49.310> it's<00:01:49.430> like<00:01:49.520> big<00:01:49.760> missiles<00:01:50.270> and

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
launcher here it's like big missiles and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.050 
launcher here it's like big missiles and
little<00:01:50.720> missiles<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:51.340> it<00:01:52.340> has<00:01:52.550> a<00:01:52.580> ton<00:01:53.030> of

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
little missiles and it has a ton of

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.500 
little missiles and it has a ton of
detail<00:01:53.540> on<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.900> inside<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:55.180> let's<00:01:56.180> move<00:01:56.360> on

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
detail on the inside and let's move on

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.490 
detail on the inside and let's move on
to<00:01:56.660> the<00:01:56.810> third<00:01:57.050> one

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
to the third one

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
to the third one
this<00:01:57.740> is<00:01:57.950> a<00:01:58.300> Macarius<00:01:59.300> Vulcan<00:02:00.080> I<00:02:00.770> do<00:02:01.130> believe

this is a Macarius Vulcan I do believe

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.770 
this is a Macarius Vulcan I do believe
this<00:02:01.700> gets<00:02:01.940> like<00:02:02.120> 20<00:02:02.510> shots<00:02:02.800> twin<00:02:03.800> linked<00:02:04.190> and
