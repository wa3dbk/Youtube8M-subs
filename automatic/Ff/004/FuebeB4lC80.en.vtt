to clean your you are

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.670 
to clean your you are
quicker<00:00:20.730> you'll<00:00:21.000> move<00:00:21.180> up<00:00:21.360> and<00:00:21.750> maybe<00:00:22.260> work<00:00:22.590> a

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
little more but there's also there's a

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.210 
little more but there's also there's a
thing<00:00:25.110> that<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.320> could<00:00:25.440> be<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.590> quick<00:00:25.830> rise<00:00:26.040> to

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
thing that you could be a quick rise to

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.070 
thing that you could be a quick rise to
the<00:00:26.340> middle<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.360> can<00:00:27.510> be<00:00:27.600> stuck<00:00:27.900> there

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
the middle and you can be stuck there

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.230 
the middle and you can be stuck there
but<00:00:28.920> if<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.040> do<00:00:29.160> your<00:00:29.340> own<00:00:29.490> thing<00:00:29.520> it<00:00:30.060> may<00:00:30.180> be

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
but if you do your own thing it may be

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.600 
but if you do your own thing it may be
hard<00:00:30.660> at<00:00:30.810> first<00:00:30.890> but<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.010> payoff<00:00:32.340> could<00:00:32.550> be

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
hard at first but the payoff could be

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.310 
hard at first but the payoff could be
bigger<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.239> there's<00:00:33.540> no<00:00:33.660> rhyme<00:00:33.900> or<00:00:33.930> reason<00:00:34.140> to

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
bigger so there's no rhyme or reason to

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.660 
bigger so there's no rhyme or reason to
anything<00:00:34.530> don't<00:00:35.100> think<00:00:35.250> you'd<00:00:35.370> be<00:00:35.460> happy
