smallest breed I can and get away with
so<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.130> 80<00:00:17.310> seems<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.789> work<00:00:17.940> well<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.240> can<00:00:18.539> pack

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
so the 80 seems to work well I can pack

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.019 
so the 80 seems to work well I can pack
a<00:00:18.750> lot<00:00:19.020> on<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.619> then<00:00:20.070> I'll<00:00:20.189> top<00:00:20.460> shot<00:00:20.820> it

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
a lot on it and then I'll top shot it

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.750 
a lot on it and then I'll top shot it
with<00:00:21.270> about<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> 60<00:00:22.439> or<00:00:22.470> 80<00:00:22.619> pound<00:00:23.189> mono

does<00:00:28.650> give<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.010> some<00:00:29.039> stretch<00:00:29.810> at<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.990> same

does give you some stretch at the same
time<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.769> want<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.009> use<00:00:32.130> your<00:00:32.279> drag<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:33.000> biggest

time you want to use your drag a biggest
mistake<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> lot<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.410> people<00:00:34.500> make<00:00:34.980> with<00:00:35.280> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
mistake a lot of people make with the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.799 
mistake a lot of people make with the
deep<00:00:35.579> drop<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.149> they'll<00:00:36.360> lock<00:00:36.600> their

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
deep drop and is they'll lock their

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.900 
deep drop and is they'll lock their
drags<00:00:37.140> up<00:00:37.469> they'll<00:00:37.620> have<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.890> too<00:00:38.070> tight<00:00:38.370> so

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
drags up they'll have it too tight so

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.160 
drags up they'll have it too tight so
when<00:00:39.030> you're<00:00:39.149> hooking<00:00:39.329> these<00:00:39.570> fish<00:00:39.809> six

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
when you're hooking these fish six

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.510 
when you're hooking these fish six
hundred<00:00:40.410> seven<00:00:40.710> hundred<00:00:40.739> feet<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.219> water<00:00:41.370> and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
hundred seven hundred feet of water and

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.979 
hundred seven hundred feet of water and
you're<00:00:41.610> fighting<00:00:41.850> them<00:00:42.120> all<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> way<00:00:42.510> up<00:00:42.540> and

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
you're fighting them all the way up and

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.840 
you're fighting them all the way up and
the<00:00:43.110> currents<00:00:43.469> pulling<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:44.040> them<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.309> they're

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
the currents pulling on them is they're

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.279 
the currents pulling on them is they're
gonna<00:00:44.969> fight<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.570> hard<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:45.960> you're<00:00:46.079> not<00:00:46.170> gonna

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
have enough drag to slow the line down

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.930 
have enough drag to slow the line down
they're<00:00:48.480> gonna<00:00:48.570> rip<00:00:48.780> themselves<00:00:49.350> off<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:50.219> what

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
they're gonna rip themselves off so what

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.490 
they're gonna rip themselves off so what
I'll<00:00:51.030> do<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.210> I'll<00:00:51.420> check<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.809> drag<00:00:52.079> soon<00:00:52.350> as<00:00:52.440> I

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
I'll do is I'll check the drag soon as I

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.529 
I'll do is I'll check the drag soon as I
get<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.710> bottom<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.160> make<00:00:53.250> sure<00:00:53.699> they<00:00:54.360> did

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
get to the bottom and make sure they did

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.319 
get to the bottom and make sure they did
all<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:55.649> little<00:00:55.770> it'll<00:00:56.280> stop<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.610> reel<00:00:57.000> and

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
got a real stopper and that's a good

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.260 
got a real stopper and that's a good
fish<00:01:01.739> when<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:01.980> say<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.730> what<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.000> doing

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
fish when I say that and what it's doing

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.789 
fish when I say that and what it's doing
is<00:01:03.359> when<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:03.629> fighting<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.229> stopping<00:01:04.530> that

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
is when it's fighting it's stopping that

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.190 
is when it's fighting it's stopping that
drag<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.610> not<00:01:05.790> all<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.510> time<00:01:06.720> winching

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
drag and it's not all the time winching

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.530 
drag and it's not all the time winching
them<00:01:07.380> up<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.799> also<00:01:08.250> with<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.610> reel<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.299> has<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
them up and also with this reel it has a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.050 
them up and also with this reel it has a
counter<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.979> lot<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.400> these<00:01:11.490> now<00:01:11.790> are

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
counter on it and a lot of these now are

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.270 
counter on it and a lot of these now are
computerized<00:01:12.689> which<00:01:13.140> works<00:01:13.439> really<00:01:13.740> well<00:01:14.040> it

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
computerized which works really well it

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.999 
computerized which works really well it
counts<00:01:14.610> your<00:01:14.760> line<00:01:14.909> down<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:16.350> actually<00:01:16.530> is

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
counts your line down and it actually is

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.410 
counts your line down and it actually is
pretty<00:01:17.280> smooth<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.850> don't<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.180> thumb

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
pretty smooth you don't have to thumb

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.780 
pretty smooth you don't have to thumb
them<00:01:18.659> as<00:01:18.720> much<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.040> way<00:01:20.159> down<00:01:20.430> it'll

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
them as much so on the way down it'll

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.670 
them as much so on the way down it'll
count<00:01:21.000> itself<00:01:21.360> down<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.840> one's<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.259> meters

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
count itself down this one's in meters

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.620 
count itself down this one's in meters
so<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.009> have<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.340> learn<00:01:23.460> meters<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.299> once<00:01:24.509> you

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
so you have to learn meters so once you

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.420 
so you have to learn meters so once you
learn<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.470> count<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.830> down<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.159> once<00:01:26.280> it

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
learn that you count it down and once it

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
all the way up as far as my plug in a

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.580 
all the way up as far as my plug in a
lot<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.660> people<00:02:12.930> use<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.200> there

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
lot of people use that there

lot of people use that there
I<00:02:13.620> am<00:02:13.769> plugin<00:02:14.519> for<00:02:15.090> myself<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:15.720> just<00:02:15.930> rigged<00:02:16.170> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
I am plugin for myself I just rigged the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.610 
I am plugin for myself I just rigged the
clamps<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.580> alligator<00:02:18.000> clamps<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.720> for<00:02:19.440> me

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
clamps the alligator clamps and for me

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.900 
clamps the alligator clamps and for me
it<00:02:19.739> just<00:02:19.800> works<00:02:20.129> easier<00:02:20.519> because<00:02:20.700> I<00:02:20.790> would

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
it just works easier because I would

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.339 
it just works easier because I would
bounce<00:02:21.090> around<00:02:21.360> on<00:02:21.540> different<00:02:21.959> boots<00:02:22.140> and

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
bounce around on different boots and

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.660 
bounce around on different boots and
that<00:02:22.440> way<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.560> can<00:02:22.680> carry<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.099> 12<00:02:23.400> volt<00:02:23.610> battery

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
that way I can carry a 12 volt battery

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.150 
that way I can carry a 12 volt battery
with<00:02:24.180> me<00:02:24.390> just<00:02:24.959> clamp<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.349> right<00:02:25.560> on<00:02:25.769> I'm<00:02:25.950> ready

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
with me just clamp it right on I'm ready

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.550 
with me just clamp it right on I'm ready
to<00:02:26.370> go
