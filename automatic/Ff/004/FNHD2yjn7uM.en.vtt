00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
like a it'd be like a commentary with

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.630 
like a it'd be like a commentary with
music<00:01:57.210> tossed<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.750> every<00:01:58.020> now<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.320> then<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:59.009> I

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
music tossed in every now and then so I

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.899 
music tossed in every now and then so I
think<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.899> would<00:02:00.990> be<00:02:01.049> pretty<00:02:01.290> fun<00:02:01.909> Athena

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
think that would be pretty fun Athena

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.520 
think that would be pretty fun Athena
thinks<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.420> would<00:02:03.540> be<00:02:03.630> pretty<00:02:03.840> fun<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.500> I

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
thinks that would be pretty fun so I

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.109

is that request a song feature so again
just<00:02:44.840> something<00:02:45.840> I<00:02:45.930> wanted<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.320> run<00:02:46.470> through

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
just something I wanted to run through

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.800 
just something I wanted to run through
past<00:02:47.490> you<00:02:47.670> guys<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:48.150> see<00:02:48.390> if<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.540> guys<00:02:48.660> would

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
past you guys to see if you guys would

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.890 
past you guys to see if you guys would
be<00:02:48.840> on<00:02:49.020> board<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:50.790> scheduling<00:02:51.450> of<00:02:51.570> when<00:02:51.810> it

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
be on board the scheduling of when it

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.040 
be on board the scheduling of when it
would<00:02:52.050> be<00:02:52.550> I<00:02:53.550> would<00:02:53.820> say<00:02:54.210> it's<00:02:54.330> fairly<00:02:54.720> open

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
would be I would say it's fairly open

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.860 
would be I would say it's fairly open
for<00:02:55.380> one<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.530> could<00:02:55.740> probably<00:02:55.980> do<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.430> if<00:02:56.870> I

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
for one I could probably do it if I

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.440 
for one I could probably do it if I
enjoyed<00:02:58.320> it<00:02:58.350> plus<00:02:58.950> side<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.580> realized<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.270> had<00:03:00.420> a

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
enjoyed it plus side I realized I had a

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.180 
enjoyed it plus side I realized I had a
decent<00:03:00.690> enough<00:03:00.960> following<00:03:01.560> willing<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:01.950> tune

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
decent enough following willing to tune

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.190 
decent enough following willing to tune
in<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.520> could<00:03:02.700> probably<00:03:02.940> go<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.630> weekly<00:03:04.170> show

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
could do at least once to try it and

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.340 
could do at least once to try it and
then<00:03:41.330> analyze<00:03:42.330> how<00:03:42.540> it<00:03:42.660> went<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.110> move

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
then analyze how it went and move

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.540 
then analyze how it went and move
forward<00:03:43.590> from<00:03:43.770> there<00:03:44.040> if<00:03:44.160> I<00:03:44.250> wanted<00:03:44.340> to
