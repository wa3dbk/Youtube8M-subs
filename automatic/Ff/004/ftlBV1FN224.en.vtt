00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.949
 I certainly have always experienced 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.079
 genuine interest in the conductor profession 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.780
 and she has always captured me on 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.570
 energy probably that's the promise 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.210
 which the 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.270
 in my eyes tried to bring in 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.340
 the orchestra is for some reason very famous 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.090
 conductors and such really common 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.090
 were sitting 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.360
 how much I'm not being a musician of my own 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:59.370
 metalworkers how many did not sit rocket here 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:03.160
 for me the most interesting thing was 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.470
 see how the conductor wins 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.490
 orchestra when 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:13.210
 you copy try to find my 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:18.210
 individuality and then surely any 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:21.070
 any conductor he is worthy to 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.790
 perceived and at least anglized 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.740
 to distinguish 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.420
 I do not support 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:32.299
 these are so totalitarian 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:35.930
 and dictatorial communication style between 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.280
 orchestra conductor but I support 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.549
 quite tough communication styles 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.899
 since i went through quite difficult 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:46.190
 way and 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:48.170
 so I walked one milik he helped and I 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.240
 I know how it does not know the price of everything 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.060
 and probably this makes me 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.490
 this moment is too ordinary 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.380
 tough in some particular youth 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.539
 orchestra 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.770
 because disorganization from two 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.770
 musicians it can destroy 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.010
 without the police you are everything else 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.330
 only main conductor but also 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.180
 art director for 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.370
 youth symphony orchestra in 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.160
 hence the question and what is the role in principle 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.540
 artistic director orchestras and what creative 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.710
 maybe managerial tasks he 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:28.010
 must decide artistic 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:33.440
 supervisor should in my opinion 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:35.940
 impersonate a direction 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.090
 vision of this direction vision 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.260
 team development 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.890
 vision of artistic excellence 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.490
 collective 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:50.040
 probably those possibilities with the help 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.890
 which this orchestra can even more 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.570
 open yourself 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:03:00.290
 Now that's the soloists charged 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:03.290
 as if there were some concert tours 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.290
 surely 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.430
 this is the leader who defines and sets 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:17.310
 vector development of your collection of this 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.260
 affairs but today us and talks about 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.239
 tom that 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.200
 artistic leader force 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.200
 certain reasons 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.510
 all the same in contact with the fact that so 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.879
 say accompanies and by month 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:41.069
 components and some domestic problems 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:44.220
 same dad musician is essentially a man 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:48.450
 who in his face unites and decides 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:51.209
 and help solve problems and everything 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.459
 collective and all musicians in particular 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.439
 today dictates those conditions 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.629
 cook for no one ever yet 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:59.340
 will never bring you nothing 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.920
 so if you want to prolong life 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.379
 your team 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.870
 forced to do it too 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.790
 perceive how I do and what I do 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.139
 why should I do this at all 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:15.209
 I am a creator, but then tomorrow 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:17.130
 won't have your design and already 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.669
 A lot of us had examples with 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.590
 big teams that broke up 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.510
 unfortunately because all creators and 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.530
 no one wants to condescend to this 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.659
 but as long as we live in today's reality 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.310
 day of you are sick of collective action 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:34.310
 fight for the team whales oblige
