and scream yeah you stand down there any
fence<00:02:54.629> or<00:02:54.840> any<00:02:54.989> final<00:02:55.290> falling<00:02:55.739> you'll<00:02:55.920> hear

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
fence or any final falling you'll hear

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.670 
fence or any final falling you'll hear
all<00:02:56.220> those<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:56.940> screaming<00:02:57.390> horses<00:02:58.140> respond

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
all those that screaming horses respond

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.470 
all those that screaming horses respond
to<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:59.010> yeah<00:02:59.129> it's<00:02:59.549> not<00:02:59.640> just<00:02:59.970> about<00:03:00.209> using

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
to it yeah it's not just about using

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.960 
to it yeah it's not just about using
this<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:02.220> voice<00:03:02.370> thing<00:03:02.609> comes<00:03:02.819> with

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
this the voice thing comes with

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.610 
this the voice thing comes with
confidence<00:03:03.390> at<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.569> moment<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.079> know<00:03:04.200> under

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
confidence at the moment you know under

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.360 
confidence at the moment you know under
its<00:03:04.799> soft<00:03:05.040> voice<00:03:06.440> but<00:03:07.440> as<00:03:07.530> well<00:03:07.709> it<00:03:07.980> like<00:03:08.250> I

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
its soft voice but as well it like I

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.630 
its soft voice but as well it like I
cannot<00:03:08.819> emphasize<00:03:09.209> enough<00:03:09.720> how<00:03:10.440> much<00:03:10.980> these

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
cannot emphasize enough how much these

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.330 
cannot emphasize enough how much these
have<00:03:11.970> an<00:03:12.090> effect<00:03:12.420> because<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:13.319> transmit<00:03:14.129> that

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
have an effect because you transmit that

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.900 
have an effect because you transmit that
energy<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:15.090> yeah<00:03:15.329> you<00:03:15.810> know<00:03:16.430> those<00:03:17.430> hands<00:03:17.730> as

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
energy to yeah you know those hands as

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.150 
energy to yeah you know those hands as
relaxed<00:03:18.269> as<00:03:18.390> I<00:03:18.510> can<00:03:18.750> because<00:03:19.530> like<00:03:19.950> if<00:03:20.069> you

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
relaxed as I can because like if you

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.309 
relaxed as I can because like if you
imagine<00:03:20.370> when<00:03:20.700> when<00:03:21.030> Sebastian<00:03:21.989> Vettel

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
imagine when when Sebastian Vettel

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.589 
imagine when when Sebastian Vettel
drives<00:03:22.560> for<00:03:22.890> Red<00:03:23.099> Bull<00:03:23.129> he's<00:03:23.940> got<00:03:24.150> somebody<00:03:24.359> in

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
drives for Red Bull he's got somebody in

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.539 
drives for Red Bull he's got somebody in
his<00:03:24.720> ear<00:03:24.900> telling<00:03:25.290> them<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.650> are<00:03:25.799> low<00:03:26.010> on<00:03:26.250> fuel

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
his ear telling them you are low on fuel

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.849 
his ear telling them you are low on fuel
you<00:03:26.940> need<00:03:27.120> to<00:03:27.239> conserve<00:03:27.630> energy<00:03:27.870> when<00:03:28.680> you're

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
you need to conserve energy when you're

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.309 
you need to conserve energy when you're
riding<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.459> race<00:03:29.609> horses<00:03:30.000> are<00:03:30.239> jockey<00:03:30.630> this

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
riding the race horses are jockey this

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.559 
riding the race horses are jockey this
is<00:03:31.680> where<00:03:32.069> you<00:03:32.340> get<00:03:32.609> your<00:03:32.639> energy<00:03:32.790> levels<00:03:33.389> from

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
is where you get your energy levels from

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.960 
is where you get your energy levels from
you<00:03:33.750> can<00:03:33.930> feel<00:03:34.200> it<00:03:34.440> comin<00:03:34.769> through<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.280> you

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
you can feel it comin through and you

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.580 
you can feel it comin through and you
have<00:03:36.209> to<00:03:36.389> be<00:03:36.510> able<00:03:36.599> to<00:03:36.720> interpret<00:03:37.230> those

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
have to be able to interpret those

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:47.030 
have to be able to interpret those
signals<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:38.340> use<00:03:38.760> them<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.239> win<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.480> race

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.040 

really<00:03:48.040> really<00:03:48.370> good<00:03:48.670> start<00:03:49.450> there's

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
really really good start there's

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.750 
really really good start there's
absolutely<00:03:50.320> no<00:03:50.890> doubt<00:03:50.920> about<00:03:51.310> if<00:03:51.640> you're

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
absolutely no doubt about if you're

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.680 
absolutely no doubt about if you're
lacking<00:03:52.000> a<00:03:52.180> little<00:03:52.270> bit<00:03:52.420> of<00:03:52.510> practice

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
lacking a little bit of practice

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.100 
lacking a little bit of practice
actually<00:03:53.290> on<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:54.250> hearts<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:55.000> step<00:03:55.300> one<00:03:55.570> it's

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
actually on the hearts the step one it's

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.750 
actually on the hearts the step one it's
in<00:03:56.350> Delaware<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.770> goal<00:03:57.450> you're<00:03:58.450> on<00:03:58.570> your<00:03:58.720> way
