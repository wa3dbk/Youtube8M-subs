00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.140
 hello I'm here with one of the most new 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.800
 the borile is expected of the last period 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:56.149
 b300 cr want to know how it goes and then 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:58.010
 We knew it was a beautiful theme to look at 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.100
 already when a few have presented it 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.040
 days ago and then the beauty has it in the 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.799
 dna because it comes from the famous b500 cr 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.190
 which borile presented in 99 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.679
 but this one is smaller more 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:16.009
 reachable both for driving reasons 

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:17.899
 it's a 300 is a much more docile engine 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.190
 now let's see it for a moment 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.550
 both because it is very economically 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.020
 Interesting 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.970
 in fact we start from what we usually do 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.869
 is communicated last or the 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.190
 price 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:34.880
 abi 300 cr starts at a price of 5,800 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.069
 euro than for a small 300 finished in 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.080
 craft way is absolutely one 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:42.259
 interesting figure 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.500
 but I'm here in front of the factory of 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.990
 die cinisello to try it in 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.790
 preview this is one of the first 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.979
 prototypes therefore it is a pre version 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.070
 series the pre-series version betrays 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.740
 some details not yet finished at 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.350
 better how borile taught us is 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.240
 accustomed apart from that the bike is 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.640
 absolutely identical to the standard one 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.560
 of open made a brief tour here 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.450
 around and I must say that the first thing 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.880
 which impressed is the engine the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.090
 this small single cylinder precisely from 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.359
 300 actually 27 horses but ne 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.070
 shows many more on the road e 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:22.070
 gritty and anna makes itself felt with one 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.799
 beautiful full-bodied voice that makes it seem like a 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.910
 mono from enduro some time ago not a 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:30.950
 in fact the engine derives from the da 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.359
 what was used on the in 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.239
 tough a while ago a 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:36.680
 single cylinder, generous and ideal for 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.480
 turn into traffic just 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.829
 tried here in a few traffic lights e 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.450
 round I have to say that it works 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.190
 Great work great even 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.890
 suspension above all the fork 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.590
 front is really 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.569
 active is a little stiff behind but there is 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.819
 you drive almost like a motard more than 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.380
 like a cafe racer on the other hand this one 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:59.060
 it is a fairly common feature 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.740
 to the road bikes to die 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.130
 the finishes I said are still a 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.200
 little by way to define the colors 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.030
 also the painting of the exhaust 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.700
 which, however, as we said, has a great deal 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.010
 voice and otherwise this is like the 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.230
 we will see the impressions are excellent and not 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.500
 I can say that this is a motorcycle 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.410
 ideal for those looking for a café racer in 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.570
 able to afford to stand out in 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.040
 city ​​and also to be able to do some 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.730
 ride in short having fun among the 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.590
 curves if you like videos like 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.750
