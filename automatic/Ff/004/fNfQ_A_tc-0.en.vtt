00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 The s of a dog in Argentina has 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.580
 moved millions of people 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.069
 around the world for six years 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.170
 living at the foot of the tomb of his 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.860
 I love that he died a year after he adopted him 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.990
 as your pet 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.380
 the loyalty of a dog to its owner does not have 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.420
 limits examples there are many for 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.240
 boy is perhaps the best known at the level 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.250
 worldwide thanks to the movie always to 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.730

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.260
 civility that always showed his master 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.390
 even beyond death and is that 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.340
 daily used to stand in front 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.650
 at the door of the train station 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.840
 shibuya to wait for the return of his 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.570
 owner a professor at the university of 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.430
 tokyo until one day his master did not get to 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.620
 the appointment because he had died of a 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.450
 cerebral hemorrhage without losing the 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.550
 hope to get back together with your 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.410
 Companion Jimmy went to the same place 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.869
 for the next ten years of his life 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.880
 until he died staying in memory of 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.149
 all those who witnessed his 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.149
 loyalty 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.050
 from that real story 77 have already passed 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.360
 years 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.460
 however in Argentina a dog 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.500
 called captain has monopolized the attention 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.260
 of the media by 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.600
 show eternal love to his master and is that the 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.730
 faithful dog a cordovan sheep-farmer has lived 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.680
 six years in a cemetery in 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.290
 the province of córdoba where its 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.270
 owner was buried when dying what more 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.100
 has drawn the attention of this story 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.020
 is that captain came to the place for his 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.730
 own account two weeks after 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.160
 the death of his master named Miguel 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.870
 It seems that the emotional ties that 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.670
 in life they joined this dog with his 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.830
 owner were the ones who helped him 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.650
 find your grave among the 14,000

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.700
 hour captain prostrates at the feet of the 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.100
 grave where the remains of 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.650

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.320
