00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.970
 even 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.970
 but what 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.879
 and 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.879
 then I thought so 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.300
 I hope it works together 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.780
 drive there and tomas 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.780
 a second room 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.300
 I can now tell that matter myself, it took a long time before it happened 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.860
 this film is about the search for a switch 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.510
 with that she let her communication on the afternoon use self-employed 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.950
 the 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.010
 Lisa communicated at the start of this week 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.580
 I think that in a communication error, tickets ask for something 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.940
 or to tell 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.460
 it was very difficult for her to keep looking at the picture about which 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.540
 she wanted to talk 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.439
 high muscle tone and strong reflexes 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.439
 they prevented and the fixation 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.140
 used more and more often and he said that he made that clear 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.270
 that the flu itself 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.020
 also participate in the search for communication 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.899
 it seemed logical that the tongue would use case to operate the switch 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.069
 attaching the skate card turned out to be a problem 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.670
 initially attached to a wheelchair with the switch 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.770
 but the random movements 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.560
 come those are not good at the switch 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.909
 moreover, the risk that they would see themselves was too great 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.789
 the next step of his headband 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.090
 therefore the muscle tension had influence 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.539
 what can you do the new problems 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:17.219
 the switch was too heavy 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.219
 and the main building states over her head 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:32.499
 then the idea arose, so he goes to the scene once more 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:33.449
 confirm 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:37.719
 the development of this idea but requires too much time money and shared 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.389
 Lisa finds it very funny to see me struggling with her new chess 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.389
 when 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.019
 now is the 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.169
 Rubicon 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:09.230
 In the meantime, Lisa developed communication skills 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.519
 but conversation partner who presses the switch in the right position 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:14.829
 for her mouth 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.829
 men 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.349
 an i can 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.099
 w 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:29.359
 VAT 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.159
 the the 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:33.449
 using a special trip card 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:37.300
 to who should play made to the left 3 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.300
 or to the right 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:47.819
 after four years of developing and trying different prototypes, it is 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.819
 picture now ready for use 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.389
 Yes 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:00.299
 this does not mean that the search is over 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.299
 refinement and production of the switch is needed 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.889
 right 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.729
 with this prototype 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.509
 May be his debut album communication does not want to behave independently 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.490
 a day later the receipt 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.490
 I got 

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:45.509
 i am very important it is that a student i look forward to worse 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:49.620
 two of them were able to work behind it, which was nice and handy 

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:51.309
 are to a patch 

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:53.360
 on the contrary 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.150
 striving to 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.280
 its editors if there is something to the name if that is too small 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.919
 corrected the problem 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:07.939
 a cozy square 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:12.939
 hardenberg 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.569
 He never got that far without her enormous perseverance 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:19.759
 my sense of humor
