00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.540
 a lot of water has run under the bridge and 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.270
 many kilometers below the sole 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.640
 of this shoe since we use them 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.430
 for the first time back in the month of January 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:15.250
 during its launch in the 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:18.250
 central park of new york today 7 months and 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:22.289
 700 kilometers later I'll tell you 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.289
 how are they still carrying 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.130
 opportunely we had already talked about 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.550
 of the main qualities of this 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.680
 adidas ultrabook but missing by 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.960
 define a more than fundamental aspect 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.510
 some footwear for running and is the one 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.710
 it has to do with its durability 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.769
 personally my biggest doubt was 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.100
 put in how they would resist the 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:52.640
 soles of these ultrabook since in this 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.780
 adidas sector for the first time used a 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:00.559
 rubber mesh of a material that yes 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.710
 well it provides optimal flexibility and 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.690
 very good touch apparently stepping on or 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.500
 at first glance they were not going to offer 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.570
 too much wear resistance that 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.479
 can produce the asphalt none of this 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.420
 happened and today 700 kilometers later 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.700
 I have to tell you that only the sole 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.770
 suffered some small wear 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.080
 minimum personally I spend it to a 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.530
 little more remove the heel since the 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.240
 use for mainly to roll to 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.580
 rhythms to rhythms means rhythms 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.220
 trainings where one hits more 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.400
 with the heel not so much with the half foot and 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.350
 how can you see inside that heel the 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.740
 only areas that have worn out are 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.020
 elevations or small plugs 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.479
 plugs that brings the shoes but 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.189
 quietly is still used since the 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.970
 material continues on its entire surface 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:57.380
 present and nowhere is put in 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.299
 I play the durability of the bus that is 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.450
 present in this shoe in this other 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.310
 bus in 100% of your the stroke of the 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.860
 Unlike previous shoes 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.890
 here as we already told you in your 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.900
 moment what they did was eliminate by 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.590
 complete the eva gum and make a 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.440
 shoe hundred percent with his / 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.190
 bus material sole this gave the 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.489
 footwear plus a lot much tread 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.620
 smoother a better transition and a 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.660
 greater return of energy so that 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.450
 is the top part the part of the 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.190
 capped now with 700 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.570
 kilometers something is showing 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.310
 minimal signs of wear and here the 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.100
 you can see it's practically 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.700
 imperceptible and the threads of this 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.920
 material called prime it that is a 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.390
 elastic material wrapping envelops 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.750
 completely to the foot and adapts 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.840
 perfectly also is they are very 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.300
 resistant and as I say with 700 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.400
 miles of filming just in some 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.530
 specific places and I think this is good 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.750
 is going to have more to do with the kind of 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.740
 foot of each one I have here it is seen that 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.700
 the long toe a little more more 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:16.010
 pronounced then that's where you 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.140
 began to produce a 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.360
 fraying of the material but 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.410
 that is still far from being a hole 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.550
 The upper part of the footwear is 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.890
 made with this material that as 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.110
 You see besides very durable it is very comfortable 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.470
 since it adapts perfectly to each 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.800
 foot and for example has details like 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.290
 that there is no difference between the language 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.050
 and the rest of the shoes are practically 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.320
 a glove since he sticks his foot in here 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:48.260
 in adapting it in a flexible way and 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.480
 no, there is not a different language that goes 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.940
 to be on the one hand that are edited by 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.430
 complete any type of injuries 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.740
 by frictions that may be caused by 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.590
 traditional languages of sneakers that 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.710
 they are loose and on the other hand you have 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.350
 an optimal fit in the instep area 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.630
 since this material will be embraced by 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.300
 complete the foot and it will leave well 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.240
 subject for many specialists these 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.780
 Ultra bus outputs are so far 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.660
 the best invented running shoes and 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:24.170
 this has to do with a series of 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.420
 factors not only with parts 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:31.550
 punctual as the cap can be 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:33.440
 Elastic or sole that is 100% made 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.880
 of buzz material or how we talk to you 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:40.280
 the sole that is also innovative 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.500
 It also has some elements that are 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.310
 very interesting and one of them 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.530
 it's really revolutionary and maybe 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.420
 goes unnoticed when you see the shoes 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.760
 but that really feels at the time 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:56.000
 to use it and it's located on your heel 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:59.990
 is this material that have used this 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.440
 hard tpv that makes the heel stay 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.270
 subject but which in turn remains 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.010
 totally released to the area of 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.630
 Achilles how can you see the material 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:15.700
 cover the heel in the area below and 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:19.220
 leaves an opening in the proper part of the 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:21.590
 tendon and this is going to greatly facilitate 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.950
 that the shoe suits any 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.740
 type of foot and inside each type of foot 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:31.760
 to any requirement the movement of 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.680
 the coat is totally released and that 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.590
 you will really feel it mainly 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.000
 when you do a background job when 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.100
 you put many kilometers to the 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.530
 These shoes were then my 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.780
 impressions of these adidas ultrabook 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:48.650
 after having beaten them a good 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:51.050
 beating already 700 kilometers accumulated 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.600
 a brand that for many shoes 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.430
 would mean the end of the useful life something 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.800
 that seems to be quite quite far 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.610
 still for these ultra boost outputs 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.979
 who continue to maintain their conditions 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:06.680
 intact its ability to absorb its 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:09.440
 midsole completely bus material 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.419
 that as anticipated by the German brand is 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.370
 practically indestructible that is not 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:15.500
 deforms despite the passage of time and 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.620
 kilometers you can check it in 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:21.020
 person not altered in the least 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.630
 capacity after 300 kilometers its 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.419
 absorbing ability to absorb 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.729
 impacts only the shoe has 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:30.199
 some small wear marks that 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:33.590
 the senators are appearing in 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:36.919
 some specific places like the area 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:43.190
 of the big finger the cap standing on my 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:45.770
 case and maybe something in the sole but that 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:48.349
 they are minimum wear marks and that of 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.650
 no way do they anticipate the end of 

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:53.979
 life of the footwear at least in 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.870
 the next ones in the next kilometers 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:58.550
 surely they are going to be a 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:01.190
 accompanying for a good time more to 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:04.730
 true science I do not know by how much but 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:07.640
 most likely for everything that indicates 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.110
 that they continue accompanying me in the 

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:12.880
 trainings and the odd race 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.880
 for many many more kilometers
