otters<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.370> think<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:53.850> did<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.090> right<00:00:54.120> thing<00:00:54.420> by

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
otters I think we did the right thing by

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.139 
otters I think we did the right thing by
saying<00:00:54.750> who<00:00:55.079> wasn't<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.640> because<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
saying who wasn't in it and because the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.209 
saying who wasn't in it and because the
tracks<00:00:57.420> block<00:00:57.719> NASCAR<00:00:58.410> has<00:00:58.649> displayed<00:00:59.070> the

tracks block NASCAR has displayed the
red<00:00:59.399> flag<00:00:59.699> because<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> cars<00:01:00.359> can't<00:01:00.629> even<00:01:00.750> get

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
red flag because the cars can't even get
