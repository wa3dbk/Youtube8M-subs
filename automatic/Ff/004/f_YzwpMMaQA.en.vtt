00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
it's amazing how much you can play

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.660 
it's amazing how much you can play
around<00:03:20.720> a<00:03:20.990> tiny<00:03:21.410> area<00:03:21.740> of<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.040> neck<00:03:22.220> like<00:03:22.430> that

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
around a tiny area of the neck like that

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.080 
around a tiny area of the neck like that
and<00:03:23.150> get<00:03:23.420> so<00:03:23.660> much<00:03:23.870> expression<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:25.490> BB<00:03:25.910> does

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
and get so much expression and BB does

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.660 
and get so much expression and BB does
that<00:03:26.270> really<00:03:26.450> well<00:03:26.720> because<00:03:26.960> what<00:03:27.470> BB<00:03:27.800> does<00:03:28.010> is

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
that really well because what BB does is

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.670 
that really well because what BB does is
he's<00:03:28.880> a<00:03:28.910> singer<00:03:29.360> and<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.140> guitarist

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
holler than the and the answer comes way

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.560 
holler than the and the answer comes way
back<00:03:43.400> from<00:03:43.550> when<00:03:43.850> they<00:03:43.940> were<00:03:44.030> working<00:03:44.180> in<00:03:44.420> the

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
back from when they were working in the

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.240 
back from when they were working in the
fields<00:03:44.960> and<00:03:45.140> so<00:03:45.290> it's<00:03:45.440> literally<00:03:45.860> that<00:03:46.040> horror

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
fields and so it's literally that horror

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.580 
fields and so it's literally that horror
in<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.520> art<00:03:46.640> so<00:03:46.910> he<00:03:47.300> would<00:03:47.420> sing<00:03:47.690> then<00:03:48.170> he<00:03:48.260> play

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
in the art so he would sing then he play

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.470 
in the art so he would sing then he play
never<00:03:49.130> plays<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:49.670> sings<00:03:49.790> together<00:03:50.030> BB

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
never plays and sings together BB

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.020 
never plays and sings together BB
doesn't<00:03:51.050> play<00:03:51.200> rhythm<00:03:51.590> he<00:03:52.070> sings<00:03:52.370> a<00:03:52.490> line<00:03:52.640> then

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
doesn't play rhythm he sings a line then

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.450 
doesn't play rhythm he sings a line then
plays<00:03:53.330> a<00:03:53.360> line<00:03:53.770> so<00:03:54.770> remember<00:03:55.160> that's<00:03:55.250> that

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
plays a line so remember that's that
