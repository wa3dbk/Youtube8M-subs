00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
I was watching I'm gonna say she's in

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.430 
I was watching I'm gonna say she's in
the<00:02:06.450> contract<00:02:06.870> that<00:02:06.900> says<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.110> can't<00:02:07.350> work

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440

the other coming and we have actually

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.140 
the other coming and we have actually
put<00:02:08.850> it<00:02:08.940> straight<00:02:13.580> it's<00:02:14.580> like<00:02:14.730> nothing<00:02:15.000> for<00:02:15.120> a

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
put it straight it's like nothing for a

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.070 
put it straight it's like nothing for a
lot<00:02:15.270> of<00:02:15.360> law<00:02:15.480> students<00:02:15.840> there's<00:02:16.020> an

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
lot of law students there's an

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.170 
lot of law students there's an
increasing<00:02:16.350> recognition<00:02:16.560> use<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.460> both<00:02:18.030> the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
increasing recognition use of both the

academic station and professional stage

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.370 
academic station and professional stage
that<00:02:20.520> these<00:02:20.670> are<00:02:20.910> skills<00:02:21.000> which<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:22.080> want<00:02:22.260> to
