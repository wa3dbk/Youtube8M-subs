straight into frogs mouths on your turn

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.240 
straight into frogs mouths on your turn
you<00:01:29.840> have<00:01:29.899> two<00:01:30.080> actions<00:01:30.470> you<00:01:30.619> can<00:01:30.740> rotate<00:01:31.100> at

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
you have two actions you can rotate at

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.330 
you have two actions you can rotate at
I'll<00:01:31.460> each<00:01:31.940> tile<00:01:32.360> has<00:01:32.630> a<00:01:32.990> arrow<00:01:33.350> on<00:01:33.649> it<00:01:33.680> that

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
I'll each tile has a arrow on it that

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.400 
I'll each tile has a arrow on it that
you<00:01:34.369> can<00:01:34.520> see<00:01:34.940> that<00:01:35.509> shows<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.899> director<00:01:36.259> that

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
you can see that shows the director that

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.770 
you can see that shows the director that
thought<00:01:36.649> that<00:01:36.920> tile<00:01:37.220> goes<00:01:37.490> in<00:01:37.729> and<00:01:37.910> you<00:01:38.600> can

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
thought that tile goes in and you can

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.710 
thought that tile goes in and you can
move<00:01:38.960> from<00:01:39.470> a<00:01:39.710> color<00:01:39.979> tile<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.149> same<00:01:41.390> color

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
move from a color tile to the same color

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.719 
move from a color tile to the same color
tile<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.289> this<00:01:42.740> red<00:01:43.009> floral<00:01:43.280> can<00:01:43.460> move<00:01:43.580> from

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
tile so this red floral can move from

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.120 
tile so this red floral can move from
here<00:01:43.880> to<00:01:44.090> here<00:01:44.390> then<00:01:45.110> next<00:01:45.409> turn<00:01:45.560> i<00:01:45.710> might<00:01:45.920> go

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
here to here then next turn i might go

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.820 
here to here then next turn i might go
one<00:01:46.429> two<00:01:47.179> and<00:01:47.509> then<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:48.110> next<00:01:48.140> turn<00:01:48.500> i<00:01:48.619> might

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
one two and then the next turn i might

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.399 
one two and then the next turn i might
go<00:01:49.039> one<00:01:49.399> and<00:01:49.700> then<00:01:50.210> two<00:01:50.450> because<00:01:51.050> you<00:01:51.259> can

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
go one and then two because you can

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.770 
go one and then two because you can
always<00:01:51.649> move<00:01:51.979> on<00:01:52.159> to<00:01:52.340> these<00:01:52.460> white<00:01:52.819> tiles<00:01:53.149> in

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
always move on to these white tiles in

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.169 
always move on to these white tiles in
fact<00:01:54.110> these<00:01:54.289> white<00:01:54.619> tiles<00:01:54.950> are<00:01:55.220> essentially

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
fact these white tiles are essentially

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:57.730 
fact these white tiles are essentially
the<00:01:56.210> only<00:01:56.509> way<00:01:56.600> you<00:01:56.659> can<00:01:56.840> change<00:01:57.229> what<00:01:57.500> color

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
the only way you can change what color

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.109 
the only way you can change what color
you're<00:01:57.920> on<00:01:57.979> see<00:01:58.130> you<00:01:58.220> next<00:01:58.369> end<00:01:58.580> a<00:01:58.670> frog<00:01:58.880> can

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
you're on see you next end a frog can

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.999 
you're on see you next end a frog can
move<00:01:59.300> to<00:01:59.539> this<00:01:59.960> yellow<00:02:00.319> one<00:02:00.350> now<00:02:00.649> he<00:02:00.710> can<00:02:00.800> move

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
move to this yellow one now he can move

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.980 
move to this yellow one now he can move
on<00:02:01.159> two<00:02:01.250> yellows<00:02:01.580> and<00:02:01.729> that's<00:02:02.360> probably<00:02:02.569> going

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
on two yellows and that's probably going

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.570 
on two yellows and that's probably going
to<00:02:03.080> be<00:02:03.140> needed<00:02:03.560> for<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:03.890> because<00:02:04.220> your<00:02:04.369> fly

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
to be needed for you because your fly

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.279 
to be needed for you because your fly
and<00:02:04.789> the<00:02:04.850> corner<00:02:05.179> is<00:02:05.330> likely<00:02:05.929> going<00:02:05.960> to<00:02:06.110> be<00:02:06.170> on

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
and the corner is likely going to be on

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:08.169 
and the corner is likely going to be on
a<00:02:06.319> different<00:02:06.500> one<00:02:06.800> you<00:02:07.009> can<00:02:07.190> move<00:02:07.369> him<00:02:07.610> too<00:02:07.909> and

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
a different one you can move him too and

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.759 
a different one you can move him too and
so<00:02:08.780> you<00:02:08.840> what<00:02:09.049> you<00:02:09.140> were<00:02:09.229> doing<00:02:09.440> is<00:02:09.530> eventually

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
so you what you were doing is eventually

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.530 
so you what you were doing is eventually
just<00:02:10.459> trying<00:02:10.700> to<00:02:10.759> get<00:02:10.850> them<00:02:10.970> together<00:02:11.060> that's

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
just trying to get them together that's

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.449 
just trying to get them together that's
what<00:02:11.660> it<00:02:11.750> is<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:12.410> have<00:02:12.500> some<00:02:12.650> bonus<00:02:12.980> moves<00:02:13.250> if

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
what it is you have some bonus moves if

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.370 
what it is you have some bonus moves if
someone<00:02:13.700> else<00:02:13.850> is<00:02:13.940> on<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.180> same<00:02:14.360> tile<00:02:14.690> as<00:02:14.720> your

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
someone else is on the same tile as your

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.520 
someone else is on the same tile as your
creature<00:02:16.269> other<00:02:17.269> than<00:02:17.540> that<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:18.230> first

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
creature other than that the first

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.870 
creature other than that the first
person<00:02:18.829> to<00:02:18.860> connect<00:02:19.220> them<00:02:19.340> is<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.640> winner<00:02:19.820> of

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
person to connect them is the winner of

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.310 
person to connect them is the winner of
the<00:02:20.030> game<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.450> so<00:02:20.720> is<00:02:20.840> everybody<00:02:21.019> else

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
the game and so is everybody else

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.250 
the game and so is everybody else

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.880 
a rotate and move and if someone wants
do<00:02:49.549> they<00:02:49.730> can<00:02:49.880> simply<00:02:50.239> rotate<00:02:51.079> you<00:02:51.500> out<00:02:51.739> of

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
do they can simply rotate you out of

just happen that way I've played this

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.250 
just happen that way I've played this
game<00:02:55.100> several<00:02:55.579> times<00:02:55.850> looking<00:02:56.269> to<00:02:56.810> see<00:02:57.019> what

game several times looking to see what
the<00:02:57.410> interesting<00:02:57.799> thing<00:02:57.980> is<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.310> there's

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
spot but it's not like there's a lot of

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.770 
spot but it's not like there's a lot of
deviations<00:03:10.760> or<00:03:10.880> a<00:03:10.940> lot<00:03:11.030> of<00:03:11.150> variations<00:03:11.630> are<00:03:11.720> a

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.850 
lot of just anything I does rotate move
and<00:03:14.360> then<00:03:14.450> my<00:03:14.569> opponent<00:03:14.930> rotates<00:03:15.319> moves<00:03:15.560> and

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
and then my opponent rotates moves and

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.070 
and then my opponent rotates moves and
then

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
then

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.750

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.680

I<00:03:20.160> gotta<00:03:20.430> rotate<00:03:20.580> back<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.210> I<00:03:21.240> wrote<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:21.540> him

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
I gotta rotate back and I wrote to him

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.050 
I gotta rotate back and I wrote to him
away<00:03:21.900> at<00:03:22.020> the<00:03:22.080> same<00:03:22.290> time<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.890> just<00:03:23.760> doesn't

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
away at the same time it just doesn't

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.510 
away at the same time it just doesn't
have<00:03:24.390> any<00:03:24.540> kind<00:03:24.840> of<00:03:24.960> putzing<00:03:25.170> pass<00:03:25.890> out<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.370> it

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
have any kind of putzing pass out to it

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.910 
have any kind of putzing pass out to it
this<00:03:26.940> is<00:03:27.150> just<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.480> really<00:03:27.720> big<00:03:27.930> no<00:03:28.140> for<00:03:28.170> me<00:03:28.440> so<00:03:28.710> I

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
this is just a really big no for me so I

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.520 
this is just a really big no for me so I
wasn't<00:03:29.760> interested<00:03:30.210> in<00:03:30.300> the<00:03:30.450> theme<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:31.320> the

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
wasn't interested in the theme that the

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.990 
wasn't interested in the theme that the
components<00:03:32.400> weren't<00:03:32.550> very<00:03:32.670> good<00:03:32.760> quality

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
components weren't very good quality
