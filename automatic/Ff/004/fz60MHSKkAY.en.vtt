 the sound of the detector do not deceive 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.449
 a few shovels are enough to dig up in this sense this piece of 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.460
 metal pedophilia dj rare no doubt it is a plane part 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.480
 it confirms 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.230

 an American fighter would have crashed here on August 28, 1944 beat 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.320
 by a German machine gun 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.690
 the pilot would not have had time to jump 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.489
 we had faith because the accused a peasant and the alliance

 the edition adding that the state would not have been worked we know that there is 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.940
 so a curve 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.130
 the goal is to get out of 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.200

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.460
 the arrival of the ipad the body responsible for searching and identifying the bodies of 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.280

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.690
 the two men met by this common passion we would have done 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.450
 to offer 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.130
 it's been 20 years that they do their own research as invested with a 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.380
 distilled mission 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.000
 and this quest originates from childhood in these undergrowths yet 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.910
 marked by the fights of 44
