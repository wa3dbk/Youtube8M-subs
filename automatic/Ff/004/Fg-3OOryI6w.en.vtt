panda<00:00:42.780> tan<00:00:42.989> dropped<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:43.770> be<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.340> we<00:00:45.300> already

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
panda tan dropped on be so we already

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.660 
panda tan dropped on be so we already
had<00:00:45.989> been<00:00:46.350> see<00:00:46.680> cat<00:00:48.289> so<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.950> gives<00:00:50.129> us<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
had been see cat so it gives us the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.029 
had been see cat so it gives us the
options<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.329> spawning<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.289> being<00:00:52.559> see<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
options of spawning of being see and the

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.369 
options of spawning of being see and the
main<00:00:53.219> base<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.760> at<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.539> moment<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.110> enemy

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
main base and at the moment the enemy

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.279 
main base and at the moment the enemy
hasn't<00:00:55.590> kept<00:00:55.860> anything<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.750> it<00:00:57.750> already<00:00:57.899> feels

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
hasn't kept anything so it already feels

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.319 
hasn't kept anything so it already feels
like<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.649> other<00:00:59.100> teams<00:00:59.399> not<00:00:59.760> doing<00:01:00.090> as<00:01:00.270> well

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
like the other teams not doing as well

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.399 
like the other teams not doing as well
in<00:01:00.840> objective<00:01:01.710> like<00:01:02.309> play<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:03.600> only<00:01:03.780> threat

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
in objective like play the only threat

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.730 
in objective like play the only threat
we<00:01:04.589> have<00:01:04.769> right<00:01:05.040> now<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.430> cone<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.970> pc<00:01:06.330> and

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
we have right now is this cone a pc and

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.990 
we have right now is this cone a pc and
we<00:01:07.740> pretty<00:01:07.950> much<00:01:08.010> deal<00:01:08.340> with<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.610> straight

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
we pretty much deal with it straight

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.620 
we pretty much deal with it straight
away<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.990> not<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.290> problem<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.479> at<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
away so it's not a problem and at the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.940 
away so it's not a problem and at the
moment<00:01:12.689> there's<00:01:13.110> still<00:01:13.290> not<00:01:13.439> up<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.799> anything

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
moment there's still not up to anything

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.160 
moment there's still not up to anything
we<00:01:14.549> trust<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:14.909> our<00:01:15.030> teammates<00:01:15.509> world<00:01:15.750> cup<00:01:15.930> a

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
we trust that our teammates world cup a

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.580 
we trust that our teammates world cup a
so<00:01:16.650> that's<00:01:16.830> why<00:01:17.009> we<00:01:17.040> always<00:01:17.310> go<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:17.729> B<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:17.970> C

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
objectives we win and we can prove it

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.840 
objectives we win and we can prove it
