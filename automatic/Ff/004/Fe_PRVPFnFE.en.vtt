00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
specifics about who's in London it's a

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.460 
specifics about who's in London it's a
thing<00:02:39.200> that<00:02:39.230> would<00:02:40.840> possibly<00:02:41.840> give<00:02:42.080> away<00:02:42.290> the

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
thing that would possibly give away the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.610 
thing that would possibly give away the
sauce

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.250 

but<00:02:47.620> yes<00:02:47.830> it's<00:02:48.540> non-executive<00:02:49.540> figures<00:02:49.960> that

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
but yes it's non-executive figures that

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.880 
but yes it's non-executive figures that
are<00:02:50.470> down<00:02:51.040> there<00:02:51.250> alone

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.470 

and<00:02:54.890> I<00:02:54.950> think<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:55.730> don't<00:02:55.820> do<00:02:56.000> an<00:02:56.120> update<00:02:56.360> this

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.940 
and I think you don't do an update this
even<00:02:56.810> if<00:02:56.930> I<00:02:57.020> get<00:02:57.260> one<00:02:57.320> this<00:02:57.530> even<00:02:57.830> I<00:02:57.890> think

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
Kenny Dalglish playing so you can't

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.030 
Kenny Dalglish playing so you can't
really<00:04:22.570> pay<00:04:22.750> much<00:04:22.900> attention<00:04:22.960> to<00:04:23.470> that
