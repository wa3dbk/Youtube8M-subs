really<00:01:37.520> she<00:01:37.670> goes<00:01:37.820> with<00:01:37.940> enough<00:01:38.150> this<00:01:38.270> is<00:01:38.450> that

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
really she goes with enough this is that

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.540 
really she goes with enough this is that
other<00:01:38.780> side<00:01:39.110> this<00:01:39.409> is<00:01:39.470> when<00:01:39.740> she<00:01:39.890> snapped
