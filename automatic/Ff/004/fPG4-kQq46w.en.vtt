00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 so here it is, but editing that 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.020
 I basically use two types of 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.620
 montages so both are montages 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.990
 combined carbon fluo gron 50/100 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.379
 I do not go below because I value 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.970
 it's fake euros so in the water 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.130
 it's useless to go down too low 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.170
 do not want to take risks so 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.820
 so combine with a little bit of 13 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.130
 years 35 does so expressly to avoid 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.330
 that it seems too much on my e for the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.460
 protect I put a little bit of no 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.620
 fill and in addition that it's a little 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.960
 is that is nice for the self made 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.350
 rage mounted on a dark man a little 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.969
 curb with a little talent ignore who 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.750
 makes mounting more aggressive mount 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.670
 also titanium cap to donations which is very 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.329
 good for hook penetration 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.620
 when the fish blows the apa of which I 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.719
 fishing essentially with fixtures 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.250
 snowman 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.480
 this is my editing it really 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.949
 snowman play their game 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.690
 of school a little bit more but opens 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.690
 on my time I am only using 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.850
 all and snowmen 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.850
 so yes it's fishing 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.140
 yeah well that's a montage that 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.159
 I have been using for many years 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.450
 this one so to play there show you the 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.009
 second the second I used it 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.079
 basically also it's mostly for 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.090
 when I want to take off more but not 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.990
 in always the same I always put I 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.850
 never have a pop up 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.520
 I put a boil is dense so a 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.600
 boils is that I prepare for better 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.770
 in the world and charge so it's the same 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.289
 boils is that's not that I 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.179
 distributes except that I make them harden I 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.920
 my name is attract ans and I put a pop 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.719
 up with even when I want colleges 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.459
 but still a hip hop hop hop dance 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:54.909
 hop hop alone this is exactly the 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:57.209
 same combined mount has a small end 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.530
 of 13 except that there I rise to laughter 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:02.649
 so the hook is not the same point 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.239
 30-30 on a little deregulation so there 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.429
 it's for my montages that I'm going 

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:08.739
 take off a little more so you're at 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.769
 say 1 cm 2 cm what when I'm fishing on 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.090
 the fonts muddy grass and when the 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.250
 fish it's a little reluctant even on 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.099
 the pebbles I sin also axa so 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.720
 it is a montage that suits me 100% 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.690
 so the advantage that elsewhere no 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.760
 hair is that and the baits when 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.450
 so we want it to fit in is not a 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.450
 little higher 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.370
 but what is it 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.630
 luckily life would not be good
