thought that would be really cute for
her<00:02:40.530> but<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.549> thought<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.209> we<00:02:42.510> can<00:02:42.690> have<00:02:43.140> her

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
her but I thought that we can have her

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.680 
her but I thought that we can have her
move<00:02:43.500> into<00:02:43.680> her<00:02:43.829> own<00:02:44.099> little<00:02:44.730> starter<00:02:45.480> home

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
move into her own little starter home

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.830 
move into her own little starter home
and<00:02:45.989> I<00:02:46.319> could<00:02:46.500> do<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.920> fun<00:02:47.340> little<00:02:47.819> thing<00:02:48.000> for

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
have done it in the past I think it was

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.720 
have done it in the past I think it was
for<00:03:03.060> The<00:03:03.390> Sims<00:03:03.629> 3<00:03:03.870> seasons<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.549> was

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
for The Sims 3 seasons and that was

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.520 
for The Sims 3 seasons and that was
great<00:03:06.030> so<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.480> thought<00:03:06.840> this<00:03:06.959> was<00:03:07.140> like<00:03:07.500> the

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
great so I thought this was like the

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.009 
great so I thought this was like the
perfect<00:03:07.920> opportunity<00:03:08.850> and<00:03:09.600> don't<00:03:09.840> worry

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
perfect opportunity and don't worry

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.750 
perfect opportunity and don't worry
she'll<00:03:10.319> still<00:03:10.739> be<00:03:10.769> in<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.040> same<00:03:11.250> neighborhood

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
she'll still be in the same neighborhood

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.120 
she'll still be in the same neighborhood
will<00:03:12.000> still<00:03:12.239> see<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.780> Sims<00:03:13.019> family<00:03:13.260> since

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.890 
will still see the Sims family since
we're<00:03:14.340> family<00:03:14.760> every<00:03:15.359> once<00:03:15.540> in<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.720> while<00:03:15.870> you

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
we're family every once in a while you
