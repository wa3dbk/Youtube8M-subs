you want to use first the new UAV drone
is<00:01:45.000> quite<00:01:45.240> interesting<00:01:45.630> when<00:01:46.049> used<00:01:46.289> in<00:01:46.409> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
is quite interesting when used in the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.709 
is quite interesting when used in the
demo<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:47.490> can<00:01:47.609> tell<00:01:47.789> it<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.000> go<00:01:48.030> anywhere<00:01:48.479> in

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
demo you can tell it to go anywhere in

environments from the UAVs perspective

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.219 
environments from the UAVs perspective
when<00:01:58.679> using<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.039> mode<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.670> UAV<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.810> UAV

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
when using this mode of the UAV the UAV

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.020 
when using this mode of the UAV the UAV
drone<00:02:01.499> is<00:02:01.679> in<00:02:01.770> scanning<00:02:02.100> position<00:02:02.579> which

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
drone is in scanning position which

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.029 
drone is in scanning position which
basically<00:02:03.420> means<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.929> while<00:02:04.350> you're<00:02:04.560> seeing

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
basically means that while you're seeing

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.429 
basically means that while you're seeing
down<00:02:05.219> from<00:02:05.429> it<00:02:05.579> it's<00:02:05.789> in<00:02:06.390> danger<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.899> can<00:02:07.049> also

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
down from it it's in danger and can also

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
the final game will become so if you
