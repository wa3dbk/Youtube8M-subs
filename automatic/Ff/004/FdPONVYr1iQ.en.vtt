about<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:13.830> now<00:00:14.820> usually<00:00:15.059> we<00:00:15.420> think<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.719> weak

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
about that now usually we think of weak

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.570 
about that now usually we think of weak
dominance<00:00:16.289> as<00:00:16.500> being<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.800> real<00:00:17.010> thorn<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.490> our

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
dominance as being a real thorn in our

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.090 
dominance as being a real thorn in our
side<00:00:17.820> because<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:19.230> all<00:00:19.500> sorts<00:00:20.039> of

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
side because of all sorts of

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.580 
side because of all sorts of
complications<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.300> creates<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.960> while

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
complications that it creates and while

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.650 
complications that it creates and while
that's<00:00:22.830> still<00:00:22.980> going<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.400> remain<00:00:23.640> true<00:00:24.090> there

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
that's still going to remain true there

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.560 
that's still going to remain true there
was<00:00:24.750> at<00:00:24.869> least<00:00:24.900> one<00:00:25.170> topic<00:00:26.099> or<00:00:26.279> one<00:00:26.460> time<00:00:26.730> where

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
was at least one topic or one time where

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.450 
was at least one topic or one time where
we<00:00:28.170> dominance<00:00:28.740> can<00:00:28.830> actually<00:00:29.130> help<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.429> out

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
we dominance can actually help you out

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.800 
we dominance can actually help you out
and<00:00:29.820> that's<00:00:29.939> what<00:00:30.029> we're<00:00:30.150> gonna<00:00:30.210> be<00:00:30.390> talking

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
and that's what we're gonna be talking

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.600 
and that's what we're gonna be talking
about<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.170> video<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:31.890> specifically<00:00:32.489> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
about in this video so specifically the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.910 
about in this video so specifically the
trick<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.239> if<00:00:33.450> your<00:00:33.989> opponent<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.469> mixing

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
trick is this if your opponent is mixing

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.830 
trick is this if your opponent is mixing
among<00:00:35.219> all<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.730> her<00:00:35.850> pure<00:00:36.030> strategies<00:00:36.570> let<00:00:36.750> me

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
among all of her pure strategies let me

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.720 
among all of her pure strategies let me
emphasize<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.230> all<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:38.370> her<00:00:38.520> pure

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
emphasize that all of her pure

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.569 
emphasize that all of her pure
strategies<00:00:39.360> then<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.170> cannot<00:00:40.530> play<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:41.100> weakly

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
strategies then you cannot play a weakly

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.990 
strategies then you cannot play a weakly
dominated<00:00:42.120> strategy<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:43.070> equilibrium<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.219> let

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
dominated strategy in equilibrium so let

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.340 
dominated strategy in equilibrium so let
that<00:00:45.030> sink<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.450> there<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.780> moment<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.200> then

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
that sink in there for a moment and then

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.950 
that sink in there for a moment and then
let's<00:00:46.559> talk<00:00:46.649> about<00:00:46.800> why<00:00:47.070> that's<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.399> case<00:00:47.960> so

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
let's talk about why that's the case so

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.529 
let's talk about why that's the case so
recall<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.860> all<00:00:50.100> pure<00:00:50.550> strategies<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
recall that all pure strategies in the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.869 
recall that all pure strategies in the
support<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.110> your<00:00:52.230> mixed<00:00:52.590> strategy<00:00:53.190> must

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
support of your mixed strategy must

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.029 
support of your mixed strategy must
yield<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.420> same<00:00:54.449> expected<00:00:55.350> utility<00:00:55.469> if

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
yield the same expected utility if

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.560 
yield the same expected utility if
you're<00:00:56.399> going<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.579> be<00:00:56.640> playing<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.120> mixed<00:00:57.480> of

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
you're going to be playing that mixed of

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.830 
you're going to be playing that mixed of
strategy<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.399> equilibrium<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.609> also<00:01:00.449> recall

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
strategy in equilibrium and also recall

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.319 
strategy in equilibrium and also recall
that<00:01:01.129> weakly<00:01:02.129> dominated<00:01:02.760> strategies

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
that weakly dominated strategies

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.539 
that weakly dominated strategies
sometimes<00:01:03.840> produce<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.710> same<00:01:04.920> payoff<00:01:05.309> as

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
sometimes produce the same payoff as

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.760 
sometimes produce the same payoff as
another<00:01:05.760> strategy<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.510> sometimes<00:01:07.229> produce<00:01:07.439> a

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
another strategy and sometimes produce a

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.890 
another strategy and sometimes produce a
strictly<00:01:08.369> worse<00:01:08.580> payoff<00:01:09.060> than<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.720> other

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
strictly worse payoff than that other

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.020 
strictly worse payoff than that other
strategy<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.770> basically<00:01:11.100> these<00:01:11.310> weakly

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
strategy so basically these weakly

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.600 
strategy so basically these weakly
dominated<00:01:12.540> strategies<00:01:13.080> are<00:01:13.290> never<00:01:14.189> going<00:01:14.490> to

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
dominated strategies are never going to

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.030 
dominated strategies are never going to
be<00:01:14.790> better<00:01:15.000> than<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.290> weakly<00:01:16.590> dominant

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
be better than the weakly dominant

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.490 
be better than the weakly dominant
strategy<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.030> sometimes<00:01:18.930> they're<00:01:19.229> worse

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
strategy and sometimes they're worse

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.270 
strategy and sometimes they're worse
they're<00:01:20.159> never<00:01:20.400> going<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.759> be<00:01:20.850> better<00:01:21.090> though

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
they're never going to be better though

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.679 
they're never going to be better though
all<00:01:23.280> right<00:01:23.430> well<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.970> being<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.270> case<00:01:24.299> if

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
all right well that being the case if

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.050 
all right well that being the case if
your<00:01:25.320> opponent<00:01:25.680> mixes<00:01:26.070> among<00:01:26.400> all<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.939> her

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
your opponent mixes among all of her

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.149 
your opponent mixes among all of her
strategies<00:01:27.600> then<00:01:28.170> sometimes<00:01:28.740> she'll<00:01:29.009> play

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
strategies then sometimes she'll play

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.010 
strategies then sometimes she'll play
the<00:01:29.310> strategy<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:30.119> makes<00:01:30.390> your<00:01:30.630> weakly

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
the strategy that makes your weakly

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.410 
the strategy that makes your weakly
dominated<00:01:31.650> strategy<00:01:32.220> worse<00:01:32.880> than<00:01:33.299> your

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
dominated strategy worse than your

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.810 
dominated strategy worse than your
weakly<00:01:33.750> dominant<00:01:34.259> strategy<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.579> never

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
weakly dominant strategy and it's never

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.429 
weakly dominant strategy and it's never
going<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.060> be<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.270> case<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.720> by<00:01:37.110> playing

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
going to be the case that by playing

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.170 
going to be the case that by playing
this<00:01:37.560> weakly<00:01:37.920> dominated<00:01:38.430> strategy<00:01:38.939> you're

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
this weakly dominated strategy you're

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.510 
this weakly dominated strategy you're
gonna<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.450> doing<00:01:39.720> better<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:41.040> particular

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
gonna be doing better in in particular

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.920 
gonna be doing better in in particular
instance<00:01:41.880> than<00:01:42.180> if<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.390> play<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.659> weakly

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
instance than if you play the weakly

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.050 
instance than if you play the weakly
dominant<00:01:43.409> strategy<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.040> there's<00:01:44.189> nothing

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
dominant strategy so there's nothing

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.940 
dominant strategy so there's nothing
there<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.299> compensate<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.320> for<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.710> fact

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
there to compensate you for the fact

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.620 
there to compensate you for the fact
that<00:01:47.220> sometimes<00:01:47.759> you're<00:01:48.240> getting<00:01:48.509> this

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
that sometimes you're getting this

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.050 
that sometimes you're getting this
payoff<00:01:48.869> which<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.710> strictly<00:01:50.220> worse<00:01:50.490> by

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
payoff which is strictly worse by

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.090 
payoff which is strictly worse by
playing<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.780> weakly<00:01:52.140> dominated<00:01:52.649> strategy

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
playing the weakly dominated strategy

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.410 
playing the weakly dominated strategy
than<00:01:53.310> by<00:01:53.399> playing<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.790> weakly<00:01:54.060> dominant

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
than by playing the weakly dominant

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.060 
than by playing the weakly dominant
strategy<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.049> that's<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.500> problem<00:01:55.920> because

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
strategy and that's a problem because

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.170 
strategy and that's a problem because
that<00:01:56.219> means<00:01:56.520> you're<00:01:56.670> not<00:01:56.820> doing<00:01:57.030> something

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
that means you're not doing something

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.810 
that means you're not doing something
that's<00:01:57.450> optimal<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.409> playing<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.490> weakly

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
that's optimal so playing the weakly

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.120 
that's optimal so playing the weakly
dominated<00:02:00.270> strategy<00:02:00.810> produces<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.770> worse

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
dominated strategy produces a worse

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.950 
dominated strategy produces a worse
payoff<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.700> expectation<00:02:03.360> than<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.719> weakly

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
payoff in expectation than the weakly

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.840 
payoff in expectation than the weakly
dominant<00:02:04.320> strategy<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.399> means<00:02:05.610> you

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
dominant strategy and that means you

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.760 
dominant strategy and that means you
cannot<00:02:06.149> play<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.810> weakly<00:02:07.229> dominated

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
cannot play that weakly dominated

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.650 
cannot play that weakly dominated
strategy<00:02:08.250> in<00:02:08.369> equilibrium<00:02:08.940> since<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.539> have<00:02:09.629> a

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
strategy in equilibrium since you have a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.570 
strategy in equilibrium since you have a
profitable<00:02:10.140> deviation<00:02:10.580> specifically

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
profitable deviation specifically

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.369 
profitable deviation specifically
whenever<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.390> were<00:02:12.510> supposed<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.989> play<00:02:13.140> the

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
whenever you were supposed to play the

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.770 
whenever you were supposed to play the
weakly

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
weakly

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.630 
weakly
dominated<00:02:14.290> strategy<00:02:14.770> you<00:02:15.220> could<00:02:15.370> just<00:02:15.520> play

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
dominated strategy you could just play

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.699 
dominated strategy you could just play
the<00:02:15.760> weakly<00:02:16.030> dominant<00:02:16.510> strategy<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:17.290> do

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
the weakly dominant strategy and do

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.860 
the weakly dominant strategy and do
better<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:18.700> this<00:02:19.090> is<00:02:19.209> actually<00:02:19.569> fairly

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
better so this is actually fairly

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.080 
better so this is actually fairly
intuitive<00:02:20.530> perhaps<00:02:21.160> because<00:02:21.520> of<00:02:21.550> all<00:02:21.790> the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
intuitive perhaps because of all the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.610 
intuitive perhaps because of all the
writing<00:02:22.480> this<00:02:22.750> might<00:02:22.990> seem<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.200> little<00:02:23.290> bit

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
writing this might seem a little bit

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.140 
writing this might seem a little bit
more<00:02:23.709> complicated<00:02:24.069> than<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.520> needs<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.760> be<00:02:24.850> and

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
more complicated than it needs to be and

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.120 
more complicated than it needs to be and
so<00:02:25.330> once<00:02:25.600> you've<00:02:25.780> seen<00:02:25.959> an<00:02:26.350> example<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:26.980> this

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
so once you've seen an example of this

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.949 
so once you've seen an example of this
actually<00:02:27.640> in<00:02:27.730> practice<00:02:27.880> you'll<00:02:28.540> understand

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
actually in practice you'll understand

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.449 
actually in practice you'll understand
perfectly<00:02:29.200> why<00:02:29.530> this<00:02:29.620> is<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:29.980> case<00:02:30.160> and

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
perfectly why this is the case and

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.180 
perfectly why this is the case and
you'll<00:02:30.700> never<00:02:30.850> question<00:02:31.270> this<00:02:31.360> again<00:02:31.630> so<00:02:32.590> for

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
you'll never question this again so for

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.010 
you'll never question this again so for
an<00:02:33.280> example<00:02:33.370> let's<00:02:33.940> look<00:02:34.000> at<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.510> take<00:02:34.780> or

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
an example let's look at the take or

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.110 
an example let's look at the take or
share<00:02:35.319> game<00:02:35.560> this<00:02:36.069> appears<00:02:36.430> very<00:02:36.670> frequently

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
share game this appears very frequently

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.150 
share game this appears very frequently
on<00:02:37.180> television<00:02:37.840> in<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.530> United<00:02:38.860> Kingdom

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
on television in the United Kingdom

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.740 
on television in the United Kingdom
there's<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:39.400> game<00:02:39.640> show<00:02:39.850> called<00:02:40.060> golden<00:02:40.540> balls

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
there's a game show called golden balls

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.050 
there's a game show called golden balls
where<00:02:41.140> this<00:02:41.260> is<00:02:41.470> part<00:02:42.100> of<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.370> game<00:02:42.520> show<00:02:42.790> in

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
where this is part of that game show in

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.120 
where this is part of that game show in
the<00:02:43.390> United<00:02:43.660> States<00:02:43.930> there<00:02:44.319> was<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.890> game<00:02:45.100> show

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
the United States there was a game show

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.520 
the United States there was a game show
called<00:02:45.310> friend<00:02:45.970> or<00:02:46.120> foe<00:02:46.360> where<00:02:46.989> this<00:02:47.200> was<00:02:47.380> also

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
called friend or foe where this was also

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.080 
called friend or foe where this was also
part<00:02:47.650> of<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.310> it<00:02:48.640> happens<00:02:49.030> very

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
part of it and it happens very

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.949 
part of it and it happens very
frequently<00:02:49.390> on<00:02:49.720> American<00:02:50.530> reality<00:02:50.800> TV<00:02:51.340> so<00:02:52.120> in

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
frequently on American reality TV so in

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.210 
frequently on American reality TV so in
this<00:02:53.230> game<00:02:53.410> we're<00:02:53.620> gonna<00:02:53.680> just<00:02:53.920> say<00:02:54.040> there's

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
this game we're gonna just say there's

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.800 
this game we're gonna just say there's
some<00:02:54.400> amount<00:02:54.610> of<00:02:54.730> money<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.150> be<00:02:55.269> divided<00:02:55.660> we're

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
some amount of money to be divided we're

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.090 
some amount of money to be divided we're
going<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.019> say<00:02:56.230> it's<00:02:56.320> eight<00:02:56.440> thousand<00:02:56.800> dollars

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
going to say it's eight thousand dollars

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.740 
going to say it's eight thousand dollars
for<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.340> sake<00:02:57.519> of<00:02:57.730> this<00:02:58.030> particular<00:02:58.269> argument

and simultaneously the players must

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.470 
and simultaneously the players must
choose<00:03:01.330> whether<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:01.810> take<00:03:02.050> or<00:03:02.350> share<00:03:02.680> and

if one takes and the other one shares

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.810 
if one takes and the other one shares
then<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.810> taker<00:03:26.049> receives<00:03:26.590> all<00:03:26.799> $8,000<00:03:27.670> and

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
then the taker receives all $8,000 and

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.330 
then the taker receives all $8,000 and
the<00:03:27.880> sharer<00:03:28.180> receives<00:03:28.750> nothing<00:03:29.049> and<00:03:29.470> if<00:03:30.130> both

the sharer receives nothing and if both

the sharer receives nothing and if both
share<00:03:30.730> each<00:03:31.239> receives<00:03:31.750> half<00:03:31.959> of<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.350> money<00:03:32.500> or

share each receives half of the money or

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.150 
share each receives half of the money or
$4,000<00:03:33.700> apiece<00:03:34.079> and<00:03:35.079> because<00:03:35.799> we<00:03:35.950> want<00:03:36.100> to

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
$4,000 apiece and because we want to

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.830 
$4,000 apiece and because we want to
make<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.400> lives<00:03:36.549> simple<00:03:37.000> and<00:03:37.420> make<00:03:37.570> our<00:03:37.720> lives

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.800 
as simple as possible for ourselves
we're<00:03:39.610> gonna<00:03:39.700> assume<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.090> players<00:03:40.299> only<00:03:40.570> want

we're gonna assume the players only want

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.870 
we're gonna assume the players only want
to<00:03:40.870> maximize<00:03:41.260> money<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:41.739> if<00:03:42.549> that's<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.790> case

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
to maximize money and if that's the case

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.970 
to maximize money and if that's the case
then<00:03:43.239> we<00:03:43.329> have<00:03:43.480> this<00:03:43.660> payoff<00:03:44.470> matrix<00:03:44.799> right

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
then we have this payoff matrix right

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.220 
then we have this payoff matrix right
here<00:03:45.040> where<00:03:45.549> player<00:03:46.000> 1<00:03:46.329> can<00:03:46.690> take<00:03:46.720> her<00:03:46.989> share

take<00:04:05.880> weakly<00:04:06.880> dominates<00:04:07.450> share<00:04:08.019> so<00:04:08.560> if<00:04:08.980> player

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
take weakly dominates share so if player

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.030 
take weakly dominates share so if player
2<00:04:09.640> were<00:04:09.940> to<00:04:09.970> take<00:04:10.329> player<00:04:10.989> 1<00:04:11.290> is<00:04:11.530> indifferent

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
2 were to take player 1 is indifferent

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.160 
2 were to take player 1 is indifferent

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
between take or share regardless of his

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.219 
between take or share regardless of his
choice<00:04:14.410> he<00:04:14.680> runs<00:04:14.859> nothing<00:04:15.299> but<00:04:16.299> if<00:04:16.539> player<00:04:16.900> 2

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
choice he runs nothing but if player 2

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.340 
choice he runs nothing but if player 2
plays<00:04:17.590> share<00:04:18.039> then<00:04:18.669> now<00:04:18.940> take<00:04:19.539> is<00:04:19.780> strictly

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
plays share then now take is strictly

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.010 
plays share then now take is strictly
better<00:04:20.500> than<00:04:20.829> share<00:04:21.130> for<00:04:21.370> player<00:04:21.609> 1<00:04:21.940> because<00:04:22.780> 8

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
better than share for player 1 because 8

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.649 
better than share for player 1 because 8
is<00:04:23.380> greater<00:04:23.650> than<00:04:24.010> 4<00:04:24.400> so<00:04:25.030> that<00:04:25.150> means<00:04:25.419> by

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:25.659 
is greater than 4 so that means by

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:28.339 
is greater than 4 so that means by
definition<00:04:25.990> take<00:04:26.710> weakly<00:04:27.250> dominates

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
definition take weakly dominates

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:30.770 
definition take weakly dominates
so<00:04:29.280> now<00:04:29.400> let's<00:04:29.580> apply<00:04:29.729> this<00:04:30.240> we<00:04:30.360> know<00:04:30.539> that

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
so now let's apply this we know that

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.589 
so now let's apply this we know that
take<00:04:31.229> is<00:04:31.470> weakly<00:04:32.160> dominant<00:04:32.759> share<00:04:33.120> is<00:04:33.330> weakly

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
take is weakly dominant share is weakly

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.170 
take is weakly dominant share is weakly
dominated<00:04:34.289> for<00:04:34.470> player<00:04:34.710> 1<00:04:35.039> let's<00:04:35.699> apply<00:04:36.120> this

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
dominated for player 1 let's apply this

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.320 
dominated for player 1 let's apply this
lesson<00:04:37.050> about<00:04:37.199> weakly<00:04:38.190> dominated<00:04:38.819> strategies

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
lesson about weakly dominated strategies

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.740 
lesson about weakly dominated strategies
and<00:04:39.629> look<00:04:40.259> to<00:04:40.560> see<00:04:40.590> what<00:04:40.919> happens<00:04:41.310> if<00:04:41.550> player<00:04:42.360> 2

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
and look to see what happens if player 2

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.899 
and look to see what happens if player 2
mixes<00:04:43.139> so<00:04:43.500> basically<00:04:44.280> what<00:04:44.400> I'm<00:04:44.490> trying<00:04:44.699> to<00:04:44.759> do

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
mixes so basically what I'm trying to do

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.189 
mixes so basically what I'm trying to do
is<00:04:45.030> put<00:04:45.180> you<00:04:45.240> in<00:04:45.330> a<00:04:45.360> situation<00:04:45.539> where<00:04:46.020> you<00:04:46.110> have

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
is put you in a situation where you have

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.409 
is put you in a situation where you have
to<00:04:46.289> saw<00:04:46.440> you<00:04:46.770> have<00:04:47.099> to<00:04:47.159> solve<00:04:47.340> all<00:04:47.699> Nash

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
to saw you have to solve all Nash

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.360 
to saw you have to solve all Nash
equilibria<00:04:49.080> for<00:04:49.139> this<00:04:49.379> game<00:04:49.560> and<00:04:49.740> that<00:04:50.250> would

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
equilibria for this game and that would

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.740 
equilibria for this game and that would
ordinarily<00:04:50.490> be<00:04:51.030> a<00:04:51.060> lot<00:04:51.240> of<00:04:51.270> work<00:04:51.479> because

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
ordinarily be a lot of work because

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.119 
ordinarily be a lot of work because
you'd<00:04:51.870> have<00:04:51.930> to<00:04:52.020> check<00:04:52.259> not<00:04:52.440> only<00:04:52.710> for<00:04:52.889> a<00:04:52.919> pure

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:53.129 
you'd have to check not only for a pure

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:55.070 
you'd have to check not only for a pure
strategy<00:04:53.520> Nash<00:04:53.699> equilibria<00:04:54.300> which<00:04:54.449> is<00:04:54.569> fairly

cases<00:05:11.610> takes<00:05:11.880> a<00:05:11.970> lot<00:05:12.180> of<00:05:12.210> time<00:05:12.539> unless<00:05:12.870> you<00:05:13.139> can

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
cases takes a lot of time unless you can

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.680 
cases takes a lot of time unless you can
use<00:05:13.919> this<00:05:14.250> weak<00:05:14.550> dominance<00:05:15.000> trick<00:05:15.270> to<00:05:15.449> really

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
use this weak dominance trick to really

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.839 
use this weak dominance trick to really
save<00:05:15.990> yourself<00:05:16.409> a<00:05:16.620> whole<00:05:16.979> a<00:05:17.460> whole<00:05:17.520> lot<00:05:17.819> of

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
save yourself a whole a whole lot of

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.930 
save yourself a whole a whole lot of
trouble<00:05:18.120> so<00:05:19.069> imagine<00:05:20.069> that<00:05:20.099> player<00:05:20.400> 2<00:05:20.699> is

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
trouble so imagine that player 2 is

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.240 
trouble so imagine that player 2 is
mixing<00:05:21.569> between<00:05:21.719> take<00:05:22.110> or<00:05:22.289> share<00:05:22.500> so<00:05:23.009> she's

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
mixing between take or share so she's

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.040 
mixing between take or share so she's
playing<00:05:23.430> take<00:05:23.849> with<00:05:24.030> probability<00:05:24.569> P<00:05:24.780> and

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
playing take with probability P and

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.990 
playing take with probability P and
she's<00:05:25.560> playing<00:05:25.770> share<00:05:26.129> with<00:05:26.340> probability<00:05:26.849> 1

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
she's playing share with probability 1

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.270 
she's playing share with probability 1
minus<00:05:27.300> P<00:05:27.509> and<00:05:27.690> these<00:05:28.050> are<00:05:28.229> actual<00:05:28.680> mixings

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
minus P and these are actual mixings

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.459 
minus P and these are actual mixings
going<00:05:29.819> on<00:05:29.969> here<00:05:30.240> it's<00:05:30.389> not<00:05:30.539> that<00:05:30.810> P<00:05:31.080> is<00:05:31.199> equal

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:31.469 
going on here it's not that P is equal

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:33.559 
going on here it's not that P is equal
to<00:05:31.500> 1<00:05:31.770> or<00:05:31.800> P<00:05:32.130> is<00:05:32.159> equal<00:05:32.490> to<00:05:32.580> 0<00:05:32.819> so<00:05:33.090> player<00:05:33.300> 2<00:05:33.509> is

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:33.569 
to 1 or P is equal to 0 so player 2 is

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:35.839 
to 1 or P is equal to 0 so player 2 is
actually<00:05:33.810> playing<00:05:34.289> a<00:05:34.530> pure<00:05:35.069> strategy<00:05:35.340> she's

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
actually playing a pure strategy she's

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.760 
actually playing a pure strategy she's
actually<00:05:36.150> mixing<00:05:36.719> between<00:05:36.840> these<00:05:37.199> two<00:05:37.440> things

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
actually mixing between these two things

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.969 
actually mixing between these two things
so<00:05:38.729> the<00:05:38.940> question<00:05:39.270> is<00:05:39.419> can<00:05:39.840> player<00:05:40.139> 1<00:05:40.409> play<00:05:40.740> the

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
so the question is can player 1 play the

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.070 
so the question is can player 1 play the
weakly<00:05:41.310> dominated<00:05:41.880> strategy<00:05:42.360> and<00:05:42.539> the<00:05:42.840> answer

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
weakly dominated strategy and the answer

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.279 
weakly dominated strategy and the answer
is<00:05:43.229> gonna<00:05:43.319> be<00:05:43.440> no<00:05:43.710> why<00:05:44.490> is<00:05:44.550> that<00:05:44.699> well<00:05:45.360> let's

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
is gonna be no why is that well let's

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:47.749 
is gonna be no why is that well let's
look<00:05:46.409> at<00:05:46.560> take<00:05:46.740> if<00:05:46.949> you<00:05:47.130> play<00:05:47.340> stake<00:05:47.610> as

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 
look at take if you play stake as

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:50.450 
look at take if you play stake as
expected<00:05:48.180> utility<00:05:48.300> is<00:05:48.870> P<00:05:49.259> times<00:05:49.529> 0<00:05:49.889> or<00:05:50.130> that

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
expected utility is P times 0 or that

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.269 
expected utility is P times 0 or that
part<00:05:50.699> cancels<00:05:51.029> out<00:05:51.180> plus<00:05:51.810> 8<00:05:52.110> times<00:05:52.139> 1<00:05:52.800> minus<00:05:53.069> P

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:53.279 
part cancels out plus 8 times 1 minus P

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:55.249 
part cancels out plus 8 times 1 minus P
so<00:05:53.550> as<00:05:53.729> expected<00:05:53.969> utility<00:05:54.210> is<00:05:54.509> just<00:05:54.870> equal<00:05:55.139> to

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:55.259 
so as expected utility is just equal to

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:58.640 
so as expected utility is just equal to
8<00:05:55.469> times<00:05:56.069> 1<00:05:56.460> minus<00:05:56.819> P<00:05:57.060> but<00:05:57.960> if<00:05:58.080> player<00:05:58.259> 2<00:05:58.529> is

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
8 times 1 minus P but if player 2 is

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.899 
8 times 1 minus P but if player 2 is
still<00:05:58.889> maintaining<00:05:59.219> the<00:05:59.430> same<00:05:59.639> mixed

00:05:59.899 --> 00:05:59.909 
still maintaining the same mixed

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:02.240 
still maintaining the same mixed
strategy<00:06:00.419> can<00:06:01.169> player<00:06:01.409> 1<00:06:01.680> plays<00:06:02.009> share

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
strategy can player 1 plays share

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.309 
strategy can player 1 plays share
rationally<00:06:02.849> given<00:06:03.150> this<00:06:03.270> the<00:06:03.779> answer<00:06:03.990> is<00:06:04.050> no

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 
rationally given this the answer is no

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.499 
rationally given this the answer is no
this<00:06:05.099> time<00:06:05.370> if<00:06:05.550> she<00:06:05.639> plays<00:06:05.849> share<00:06:06.150> she's<00:06:06.389> gonna

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:06.509 
this time if she plays share she's gonna

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:09.350 
this time if she plays share she's gonna
get<00:06:06.659> 0<00:06:07.139> times<00:06:07.469> P<00:06:07.620> right<00:06:08.520> so<00:06:08.880> that<00:06:08.969> cancels<00:06:09.270> out

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
get 0 times P right so that cancels out

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.390 
get 0 times P right so that cancels out
to<00:06:09.479> 0<00:06:09.690> and<00:06:09.960> then<00:06:10.050> you<00:06:10.169> have<00:06:10.259> to<00:06:10.349> add<00:06:10.469> that<00:06:10.680> to<00:06:11.130> 4

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
to 0 and then you have to add that to 4

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.519 
to 0 and then you have to add that to 4
times<00:06:11.639> 1<00:06:11.849> minus<00:06:12.120> P<00:06:12.330> so<00:06:12.599> her<00:06:12.750> expected<00:06:13.169> utility

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:13.529 
times 1 minus P so her expected utility

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:15.350 
times 1 minus P so her expected utility
for<00:06:13.680> share<00:06:13.889> or<00:06:14.159> his<00:06:14.460> expected<00:06:14.880> utility<00:06:15.000> for

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
for share or his expected utility for

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.170 
for share or his expected utility for
share<00:06:15.539> is<00:06:15.750> 4<00:06:16.560> times<00:06:16.830> 1<00:06:17.039> minus<00:06:17.340> P<00:06:17.580> but<00:06:18.029> that's

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
share is 4 times 1 minus P but that's

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.420 
share is 4 times 1 minus P but that's
strictly<00:06:18.509> worse<00:06:18.930> than<00:06:19.620> if<00:06:19.949> he<00:06:20.190> had<00:06:20.310> played

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
strictly worse than if he had played

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.670 
strictly worse than if he had played
take<00:06:20.759> and<00:06:21.000> got<00:06:21.120> an<00:06:21.240> 8<00:06:21.479> times<00:06:21.990> one<00:06:22.319> minus<00:06:22.469> P

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
take and got an 8 times one minus P

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.830 
take and got an 8 times one minus P
instead<00:06:23.250> it's<00:06:23.880> always<00:06:24.150> better<00:06:24.360> for<00:06:24.449> him<00:06:24.690> to

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
instead it's always better for him to

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.999 
instead it's always better for him to
play<00:06:24.990> take<00:06:25.259> in<00:06:25.469> this<00:06:25.560> sort<00:06:25.770> of<00:06:25.800> situation

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:26.009 
play take in this sort of situation

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:27.920 
play take in this sort of situation
where<00:06:26.520> player<00:06:26.729> 2<00:06:26.940> is<00:06:27.060> mixing<00:06:27.389> than<00:06:27.539> it<00:06:27.659> is<00:06:27.750> for

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
where player 2 is mixing than it is for

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.080 
where player 2 is mixing than it is for
him<00:06:28.020> to<00:06:28.080> play<00:06:28.289> share<00:06:28.560> so<00:06:29.310> the<00:06:29.430> conclusion<00:06:29.909> here

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
him to play share so the conclusion here

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.240 
him to play share so the conclusion here
is<00:06:30.120> share<00:06:30.599> is<00:06:30.719> a<00:06:30.750> bad<00:06:30.990> strategy<00:06:31.349> if<00:06:31.800> player<00:06:32.039> 2

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
is share is a bad strategy if player 2

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:50.390 
player 1 cannot mix or play share with

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.300 
player 1 cannot mix or play share with
any<00:06:50.540> positive<00:06:51.020> probability<00:06:51.620> if<00:06:51.740> player<00:06:51.950> 2<00:06:52.190> is

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.310 
any positive probability if player 2 is

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.550 
any positive probability if player 2 is

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 
mixing he has to play take with

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.160 
mixing he has to play take with
probability<00:06:55.220> 1<00:06:55.430> given<00:06:56.270> that<00:06:56.300> player<00:06:56.660> 2<00:06:56.960> is

probability 1 given that player 2 is

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.410 
probability 1 given that player 2 is
mixing<00:06:57.530> between<00:06:57.650> take<00:06:58.070> or<00:06:58.220> share<00:06:58.430> so<00:06:59.270> that's

00:06:59.410 --> 00:06:59.420 
mixing between take or share so that's

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:00.940 
mixing between take or share so that's
the<00:06:59.600> idea<00:06:59.720> with<00:07:00.140> this<00:07:00.260> this<00:07:00.530> trick<00:07:00.800> behind

this<00:07:08.480> video<00:07:08.750> that<00:07:08.960> says<00:07:09.170> that<00:07:09.350> that<00:07:09.440> can't<00:07:09.680> be

that<00:07:17.270> weakly<00:07:17.720> dominated<00:07:18.170> strategies<00:07:18.650> can<00:07:18.890> be

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:18.920 
that weakly dominated strategies can be

that weakly dominated strategies can be
played<00:07:19.250> in<00:07:19.370> equilibrium<00:07:19.970> it's<00:07:20.420> just<00:07:20.630> that<00:07:20.750> it

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:20.840 
played in equilibrium it's just that it

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.810 
played in equilibrium it's just that it
requires<00:07:21.170> the<00:07:21.500> other<00:07:21.650> player<00:07:21.980> to<00:07:22.010> not<00:07:22.490> play

requires the other player to not play
the<00:07:22.970> strategy<00:07:23.480> which<00:07:23.960> is<00:07:24.110> strictly<00:07:24.320> worse<00:07:24.620> for

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:24.890 
the strategy which is strictly worse for

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.530 
the strategy which is strictly worse for
you<00:07:25.010> when<00:07:25.550> you're<00:07:25.700> playing<00:07:25.940> your<00:07:26.270> weakly

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:26.540 
you when you're playing your weakly

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.860 
you when you're playing your weakly
dominated<00:07:27.110> strategy<00:07:27.850> so<00:07:28.850> again<00:07:29.150> you<00:07:29.600> can<00:07:29.720> use

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:29.870 
dominated strategy so again you can use

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.480 
dominated strategy so again you can use
this<00:07:30.050> weak<00:07:30.230> dominance<00:07:30.620> trick<00:07:30.890> all<00:07:31.100> sorts<00:07:31.430> of

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:31.490 
this weak dominance trick all sorts of

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.340 
this weak dominance trick all sorts of
places<00:07:31.640> but<00:07:32.030> you<00:07:32.180> can't<00:07:32.480> use<00:07:32.690> it<00:07:32.720> to<00:07:32.930> say<00:07:33.110> that

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:33.350 
places but you can't use it to say that

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.620 
places but you can't use it to say that
players<00:07:33.650> can't<00:07:34.010> play<00:07:34.310> weakly<00:07:35.120> dominated

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:35.630 
players can't play weakly dominated

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.630 
players can't play weakly dominated
strategies<00:07:36.140> in<00:07:36.290> equilibrium<00:07:36.860> because<00:07:37.460> they

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:37.640 
strategies in equilibrium because they

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.490 
strategies in equilibrium because they
actually<00:07:38.000> can<00:07:38.240> play<00:07:38.480> weakly<00:07:39.110> dominated

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:39.500 
actually can play weakly dominated

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.830 
actually can play weakly dominated
strategies<00:07:39.920> in<00:07:40.010> equilibrium<00:07:40.520> alright<00:07:41.480> that

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 
strategies in equilibrium alright that

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.810

joining me and in the next video we will

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.520 
joining me and in the next video we will
do<00:07:46.820> the<00:07:46.970> last<00:07:47.180> thing<00:07:47.540> of<00:07:47.660> this<00:07:47.840> unit<00:07:48.110> or<00:07:48.230> begin

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:48.530 
do the last thing of this unit or begin

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.200 
do the last thing of this unit or begin
to<00:07:48.680> the<00:07:48.770> last<00:07:49.040> thing<00:07:49.220> in<00:07:49.370> this<00:07:49.490> unit<00:07:49.790> which<00:07:50.030> is

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:50.210 
to the last thing in this unit which is

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.050 
to the last thing in this unit which is
to<00:07:50.420> solve<00:07:50.690> rock-paper-scissors<00:07:51.650> in<00:07:51.890> a<00:07:52.700> broad

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:53.060 
to solve rock-paper-scissors in a broad

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.080 
to solve rock-paper-scissors in a broad
context<00:07:53.810> so<00:07:54.110> we'll<00:07:54.800> start<00:07:55.160> in<00:07:55.310> the<00:07:55.700> next<00:07:55.790> video

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.090 
context so we'll start in the next video

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:57.700 
context so we'll start in the next video
by<00:07:56.300> looking<00:07:56.510> for<00:07:56.840> the<00:07:56.900> equilibrium<00:07:57.140> of<00:07:57.590> the

by looking for the equilibrium of the

by looking for the equilibrium of the
basic<00:07:58.010> rock-paper-scissors<00:07:58.730> game<00:07:58.910> and<00:07:59.240> we'll

00:07:59.380 --> 00:07:59.390 
basic rock-paper-scissors game and we'll

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.190 
basic rock-paper-scissors game and we'll
go<00:07:59.690> from<00:07:59.840> there

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:00.200 
go from there

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.930 
go from there
I<00:08:00.230> hope<00:08:00.500> to<00:08:00.650> see<00:08:00.770> you<00:08:00.860> then<00:08:01.040> and<00:08:01.220> until<00:08:01.910> that

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:01.940 
I hope to see you then and until that

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.350 
I hope to see you then and until that
