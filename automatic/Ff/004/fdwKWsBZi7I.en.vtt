 ----- warning!! -----. I produce videos for Japanese people who are common sense, such as religion, politics, ethics and morals. These may be different from your country's common sense.

 ----- warning!! -----. If you try to look only at your country's values, you may find it uncomfortable. If this is not acceptable, please stop playing the video now. 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 May 31, 2013 before the rainy season. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Hello !! I am "YUKKURI" of the famous voice actor in Japan. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 I went to buy a cutting sheet. 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 I want to blacken the camera case. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 There was a shop selling cutting sheets in this building. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 There was a store that I was selling. Oh? 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 The shop is gone. (Was changed to another store) 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 That's why I couldn't buy a cutting sheet. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 Please tell me the shop selling cutting sheets in this area. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 It will be rainy season in Japan. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 I can not go far because of my work or physical condition. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 I will go to the "favorite place" after a long time. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 "NAGOYA NO HAYAMAGARI" !!. (Poor right turn method of manners) 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 It is often found in Chiba Prefecture. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 However, it is rare for the car behind you to do it. (Because there is a possibility of being violated) 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 After about 20 seconds 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 There is a right turn signal at this intersection. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 You don't have to worry about it. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 There are many cars giving speed. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 Dangerous!! 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 I came here after a long time. 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 You can see the sea while riding a motorcycle. 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 About 20 years ago, I saw the sea here. 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 I feel like I'm back. 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 SEE YOU NEXT TIME! 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 A long time ago, there was a song called "Before Winter Comes". 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 I sang in chorus when I was in elementary school. 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 Primary school students did not understand the meaning of the lyrics. The teacher was novel when thinking now.
