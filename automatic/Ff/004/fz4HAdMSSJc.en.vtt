 volunteers our guys are engaged in 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.710

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.940
 standoff 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.660
 so how would yards be 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.860
 plants the next three four thousand 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.660
 applications 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.700
 the price of 2,900 yards will say right on the road 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.460
 I see the goal in the standard 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.940

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.120

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.930
 too close 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:36.549
 promise were on pepper opening 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.549
 confrontation can take 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.019
 in the first quarter of 2011 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.189
