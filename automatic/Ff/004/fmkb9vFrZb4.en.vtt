coating it with cornstarch when you put

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:58.759 
coating it with cornstarch when you put
it<00:03:57.659> in<00:03:57.689> lovin<00:03:58.019> I'm<00:03:58.200> sure<00:03:58.379> a<00:03:58.409> lot<00:03:58.500> of<00:03:58.650> people

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
it in lovin I'm sure a lot of people

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.309 
it in lovin I'm sure a lot of people
already<00:03:59.099> do<00:03:59.370> but<00:03:59.909> that's<00:04:00.480> how<00:04:00.689> I<00:04:00.720> think<00:04:01.200> a

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
already do but that's how I think a

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.740 
already do but that's how I think a
reason<00:04:01.620> why<00:04:01.709> these<00:04:01.769> can<00:04:02.129> get<00:04:02.340> burned<00:04:03.209> on<00:04:03.510> the

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
reason why these can get burned on the

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.960 
reason why these can get burned on the
sides<00:04:03.989> so<00:04:04.310> if<00:04:05.310> you<00:04:05.459> haven't<00:04:05.730> heard<00:04:05.790> of<00:04:05.909> that

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
sides so if you haven't heard of that

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.009 
sides so if you haven't heard of that
you<00:04:06.900> should<00:04:07.109> try<00:04:07.319> it<00:04:07.349> and<00:04:08.239> one<00:04:09.239> thing<00:04:09.329> that<00:04:09.540> I

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
you should try it and one thing that I

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.930 
you should try it and one thing that I
really<00:04:10.349> like<00:04:10.709> about<00:04:10.739> air<00:04:11.190> dry<00:04:11.400> clay<00:04:11.430> is<00:04:11.700> that

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
really like about air dry clay is that

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.479 
really like about air dry clay is that
it<00:04:12.030> dries<00:04:12.239> like<00:04:12.629> without<00:04:13.019> using<00:04:13.319> the<00:04:13.590> oven<00:04:13.889> and

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
it dries like without using the oven and

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.909 
it dries like without using the oven and
you<00:04:15.150> could<00:04:15.389> unlike<00:04:15.930> cold<00:04:16.260> porcelain<00:04:16.530> you

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
you could unlike cold porcelain you

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.370 
you could unlike cold porcelain you
could<00:04:17.130> um<00:04:17.340> sand<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:18.239> down<00:04:18.269> which<00:04:18.720> she<00:04:18.930> can't<00:04:19.109> do

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
could um sand it down which she can't do

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.979 
could um sand it down which she can't do
I<00:04:19.410> don't<00:04:19.680> think<00:04:19.889> because<00:04:20.039> it<00:04:20.070> looks<00:04:20.850> shiny<00:04:21.150> but

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
I don't think because it looks shiny but

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.110 
I don't think because it looks shiny but
um<00:04:22.289> one<00:04:23.010> of<00:04:23.160> the<00:04:23.280> things<00:04:23.490> that<00:04:23.580> sucks<00:04:24.000> about

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
um one of the things that sucks about

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.540 
um one of the things that sucks about
dads<00:04:24.660> is<00:04:24.960> that<00:04:25.169> I<00:04:25.410> think<00:04:26.039> it's<00:04:26.160> made<00:04:26.370> with<00:04:26.520> a

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
dads is that I think it's made with a

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
dads is that I think it's made with a
bunch<00:04:26.789> of<00:04:27.000> um<00:04:27.240> paper<00:04:27.660> fibers<00:04:28.169> so<00:04:29.099> like<00:04:29.310> um<00:04:29.639> if

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
bunch of um paper fibers so like um if

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.210 
bunch of um paper fibers so like um if
you<00:04:30.720> want<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:31.020> smoothness<00:04:31.410> you<00:04:31.860> can't<00:04:32.099> really

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
you want the smoothness you can't really

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.490 
you want the smoothness you can't really
get<00:04:32.460> them<00:04:32.610> unless<00:04:32.849> you<00:04:33.000> put<00:04:33.180> a<00:04:33.210> gloss<00:04:33.449> on<00:04:33.720> it<00:04:33.930> or

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
get them unless you put a gloss on it or

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.560 
get them unless you put a gloss on it or
send<00:04:34.770> it<00:04:34.860> down<00:04:35.070> a<00:04:35.400> lot<00:04:36.150> here<00:04:36.720> I<00:04:36.990> did<00:04:38.510> try<00:04:39.510> to

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
send it down a lot here I did try to

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.279 
send it down a lot here I did try to
make<00:04:39.780> little<00:04:40.410> planks<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:41.449> I<00:04:42.449> guess<00:04:42.930> it<00:04:43.110> comes

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
make little planks and I guess it comes

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:50.830 
make little planks and I guess it comes
out<00:04:43.530> kind<00:04:43.979> of<00:04:44.190> smooth<00:04:46.940> but<00:04:47.940> not<00:04:48.630> that<00:04:48.810> much

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
out kind of smooth but not that much

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.270 
out kind of smooth but not that much
well<00:04:51.840> this<00:04:52.020> I<00:04:52.199> did<00:04:52.380> but<00:04:53.449> kind<00:04:54.449> of<00:04:54.630> not<00:04:55.070> it's<00:04:56.070> not

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
well this I did but kind of not it's not

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:03.469 
well this I did but kind of not it's not
that<00:04:56.490> smooth<00:04:56.909> though

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:10.290 

yeah<00:05:07.919> like<00:05:08.919> if<00:05:09.310> you<00:05:09.460> can<00:05:09.580> see<00:05:09.789> it<00:05:09.880> let<00:05:10.030> me<00:05:10.090> try

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
yeah like if you can see it let me try

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.020 
yeah like if you can see it let me try
to<00:05:10.620> autofocus<00:05:13.919> there<00:05:14.919> so<00:05:15.430> you<00:05:15.490> could<00:05:15.699> see<00:05:15.910> all

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
to autofocus there so you could see all

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.890 
to autofocus there so you could see all
the<00:05:16.060> little<00:05:16.530> holes<00:05:17.530> and<00:05:17.919> such<00:05:18.220> so<00:05:19.030> that's<00:05:19.630> one

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
the little holes and such so that's one

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.439 
the little holes and such so that's one
downside<00:05:20.440> with<00:05:20.650> it<00:05:20.830> but<00:05:21.340> I<00:05:21.639> really<00:05:21.820> like<00:05:22.300> it

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449 
downside with it but I really like it

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:23.850 
downside with it but I really like it
because<00:05:22.509> you<00:05:22.720> can<00:05:22.840> make<00:05:22.960> little<00:05:23.139> things<00:05:23.470> and

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
because you can make little things and

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.300 
because you can make little things and
it's<00:05:24.669> easy<00:05:25.710> but<00:05:26.710> I<00:05:26.770> guess<00:05:27.009> if<00:05:27.190> you're

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
it's easy but I guess if you're

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.760 
it's easy but I guess if you're
impatient<00:05:27.669> with<00:05:28.000> waiting<00:05:28.419> for<00:05:28.600> it<00:05:28.690> to<00:05:28.780> dry<00:05:29.669> but

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
impatient with waiting for it to dry but

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.450 
impatient with waiting for it to dry but
yeah<00:05:32.770> and<00:05:33.720> I<00:05:34.720> guess<00:05:35.110> making<00:05:35.740> like<00:05:35.889> thin<00:05:36.220> things

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
yeah and I guess making like thin things

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.510 
yeah and I guess making like thin things
like<00:05:36.669> this<00:05:36.880> is<00:05:37.060> kind<00:05:37.419> of<00:05:37.570> hard<00:05:37.830> but<00:05:38.830> not<00:05:39.340> that

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
like this is kind of hard but not that

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.409 
like this is kind of hard but not that
much<00:05:41.190> and<00:05:42.190> you<00:05:42.220> can<00:05:42.550> always<00:05:42.639> rewrite<00:05:42.940> it<00:05:43.210> well

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
much and you can always rewrite it well

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.779 
much and you can always rewrite it well
I've<00:05:44.050> actually<00:05:44.289> dried<00:05:44.740> a<00:05:44.770> couple<00:05:45.130> pieces<00:05:45.340> in

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
I've actually dried a couple pieces in

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.730 
I've actually dried a couple pieces in
tried<00:05:46.060> to<00:05:46.270> win<00:05:46.870> them<00:05:47.020> all<00:05:47.139> the<00:05:47.320> way<00:05:47.470> where<00:05:47.650> it

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
tried to win them all the way where it

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.379 
tried to win them all the way where it
goes<00:05:47.889> back<00:05:48.190> to<00:05:48.430> the<00:05:48.550> way<00:05:48.639> it<00:05:48.759> used<00:05:48.789> to<00:05:49.030> be<00:05:49.180> and

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
goes back to the way it used to be and

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.870 
goes back to the way it used to be and
that<00:05:49.599> doesn't<00:05:49.930> it<00:05:50.139> didn't<00:05:50.500> happen<00:05:50.680> see<00:05:51.610> it<00:05:51.759> is

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
that doesn't it didn't happen see it is

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.870 
that doesn't it didn't happen see it is
doing<00:05:52.240> here<00:05:53.789> see<00:05:54.789> I<00:05:55.320> have<00:05:56.320> big<00:05:56.729> bunch<00:05:57.729> of

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
doing here see I have big bunch of

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.100 
doing here see I have big bunch of
chunks<00:05:58.539> in<00:05:58.750> here<00:05:59.229> and<00:06:00.270> there<00:06:01.270> still<00:06:01.630> I<00:06:01.870> put

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
chunks in here and there still I put

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.129 
chunks in here and there still I put
water<00:06:02.320> in<00:06:02.560> it<00:06:02.650> like<00:06:02.800> three<00:06:03.160> times<00:06:03.280> I<00:06:04.139> should

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139 
water in it like three times I should

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:11.730 
water in it like three times I should
have<00:06:05.259> done<00:06:05.380> that<00:06:05.530> there's<00:06:06.400> a<00:06:06.460> mosquito<00:06:09.180> so<00:06:10.740> but

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
have done that there's a mosquito so but

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.230 
have done that there's a mosquito so but
it's<00:06:11.860> good<00:06:12.070> i<00:06:12.280> have<00:06:12.550> i'm<00:06:12.669> going<00:06:12.849> to<00:06:12.909> bunch<00:06:13.090> of

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
it's good i have i'm going to bunch of

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:19.170 
it's good i have i'm going to bunch of
bags<00:06:13.389> right<00:06:13.720> here<00:06:17.580> and<00:06:18.580> here's<00:06:19.000> something

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
bags right here and here's something

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:25.189 
bags right here and here's something
else<00:06:19.360> is<00:06:19.690> going<00:06:19.930> to<00:06:19.990> make<00:06:20.199> a<00:06:20.560> little<00:06:21.300> weight

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:30.300 

and<00:06:26.199> I<00:06:26.770> guess<00:06:27.039> that's<00:06:27.220> about<00:06:27.340> it<00:06:27.780> yeah<00:06:28.949> does<00:06:29.949> is

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
and I guess that's about it yeah does is
