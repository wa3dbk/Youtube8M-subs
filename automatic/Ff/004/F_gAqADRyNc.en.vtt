00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.570
 record to 27 wins 21 of them by 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.580

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.070
 colombian óscar escandón for 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.440
 darchinyan it seems that the retreat is already 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.450
 knocking on your door 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.810
 the ring- side program that is transmitted 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.600
 cable wave sport had its second 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.060
 day in a function that turned out very 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.850
 interesting last Saturday a 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.310
 primer from south africa 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.190
 Tomás stage where he lost the title 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:56.250
 light weight of the ibo on the scale at 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.860
 exceed the limit of the category exceeded 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.340
 by unanimous decision to the New Zealander 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.400
 Robert Veres that at least gave a fight 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.030
 worthy in that transmission we could 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.330
 meet the undefeated lightweight 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.400
 South African solid zan and dongen and who 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.110
 had to be extended thoroughly for 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.870
 finally win by decision 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.770
 majority that should have been unanimous 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:25.200
 veteran former world champion are that fna 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.990
 Dongen and showed talent and quality now 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.390
 adds 18 consecutive wins without 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.910
 defeats and in our opinion can be 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.390
 a figure that gives a lot to talk about 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.850
 the division of light weights another 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.020
 unbeaten prospect but this one 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.869
 kazakhstan roman soul I make a western 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.780
 it showed its power by cooling in it 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.690
 first assault on the South African louis anda 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.500
 Jaco now has 15 victories without 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.690

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.729
 uppercase an armed robbery in the 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.820
 that the judges gave him the victory 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.090
 divided decision to South African johnny 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.700
 miller who in our opinion had been 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.800
 clearly surpassed by the Polish 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.460
 natives master nac 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.950
 in the division of the cruiser weights what 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.860
 barbarity definitely that in all 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.340
 the places are cooked beans we go to a 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.620
 pause and we continue with more information 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.980
 in the booklet of Miguel Cotto against 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.800
 daniel guild last saturday we saw a 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:36.150
 undefeated rookie of the semi-heavy division 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.519
 by junior name younan ended in two 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.250
 assaults with the experienced mike sawyer 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:44.519
 he left a good impression this boy 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.650
 younan of only 19 years old who 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.950
 paints hair in a very showy way 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.760
 qualifies for the vicious ring and 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.590
 He has 7 wins with 6 knockouts and in that 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.130
 same primer there was a result 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.860
 truly surprising the former champion 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.530
 world wilfredo vázquez júnior lost 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.870
 by unanimous decision before the fighter 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.450
 mexican fernando vargas a modest 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.959
 rival that was presented with palmares of 28 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.150
 won nine losses and three draws 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.650
 it was a fault just right worked by 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.860
 Fernando Vargas who fought without 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.690
 complexes before their most valued rival and 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.670
 He took out the triumph that will allow his 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.099
 admission to world council lists 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.010
