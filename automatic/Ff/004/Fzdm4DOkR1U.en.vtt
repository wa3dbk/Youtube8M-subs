00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 very good guys girls welcome to 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.930
 what is being a trailer analysis 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.849
 of then the ruling these laws 490 the er 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.019
 basically we are going to analyze some 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.849
 things that you have told me 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.830
 curiosities they saw in the trailer 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.839
 that I did not see because the truth was 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.970
 quite excited and things like that for 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.369
 to be able to get it right but you had 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.410
 a lot of time to see it well and I 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.180
 they said such a thing and well then let's 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.789
 analyze then this part we already know that 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.220
 it's a case we're going to be in a house that 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.920
 do not question here they are going to give 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.440
 the pictures the walls everything looks like a 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.890
 home we are in a house definitely 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.780
 is going to try his defense 34 and then 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.850
 let's light up the same thing is like 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.230
 end that 31 we named a hallway 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.020
 this is going to be also the hallway I think 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.550
 that the left is not criticized if it is 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.140
 we will be lighting up if it comes 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.280
 someone and we close the door what 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.110
 same as fox and in finance 31 and good 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.250
 do you think this game was 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.260
 playing so we wanted others to 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.149
 We were going to play toxic mind a great 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.859
 I play the truth that this one scott and good 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.870
 it is said that the protagonist of 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.040
 fainÃ© salto disco tosa 5 that we are going to 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.970
 control 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.340
 would be an auction buyer because if 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.380
 we see well in finance the distress they make 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.150
 an auction of the things that remain 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.220
 I think I do not know this guy like that 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.440
 purchases and has brought them to your home 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.830
 as a collector but something happened to 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.200
 the things that they auctioned and then 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.450
 the buy says that I do not know and another 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.790
 very curious thing that they said to me good 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.740
 here we know to close things are going 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.990
 to close things we are going to close the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.790
 doors and well basically in the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.110
 where we are going to control what 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.670
 it would be the doors and all that here 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.280
 we can see a purple robot and a 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.009
 purple fan and here and here 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.410
 monitor what would be the closet or something 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.450
 well and watch it and well then apparently 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.880
 do not see that we would have cameras I think 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.130
 Yes, because I wanted 12m or so 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.800
 or maybe it would be a bedroom here 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.900
 bedroom maybe I do not know but good 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.479
 point is that it could be said that 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.610
 after ends to 33 that would be 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.710
 auctioneer but because he has a 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.619
 purple fan and because it has a 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.570
 basic robot that casually purple that 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.770
 it is not understood and well here we can see 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.080
 also anyone 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.200
 girl basically like the design of the 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.060
 logo the cicca defense 32 but in mode 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.800
 nike media here is to do a 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.900
 very nice hall the truth 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.490
 the graphics are good they are very 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.140
 good the truth to make a game that 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.850
 it will also adapt for android 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.830
 many have been complaining about the 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.900
 graphics and all those guys is a game 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.300
 that will also be adapted for android 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.850
 you do not have to do it so cool 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.440
 because if it's not going to be like that it's not going to 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.880
 adapt for android everyone want that 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.290
 go out for android also in case 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.930
 they want to go somewhere and they want to play 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.260
 in those 34 then play it on your tablet 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.090
 or cellular whatever and well what else 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.650
 we can close the doors that's very 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.900
 well let's go back to the old old 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.610
 to close the doors and check the 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.680
 crosses is a new one is a new the truth 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.780
 h Carlos closes in here we have then 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.740
 our hour marker at 12 m place 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.630
 same we are going to do what would be the 6th m 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.310
 Well, that's very good, I really do not know 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.320
 what else can we analyze and good here 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.810
 we can see nightmare ' bonnie that 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.970
 it has like that the design of pretty fine 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.100
 up to 31 then basically if you have a 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.710
 bun and all spectacular look great 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.420
 wow honestly going to be great this 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.160
 end those three the truth and well then 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.230
 basically here we can witness in 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.860
 the trailer what would be the jams that 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.320
 james harden nightmare 'bon and if not then 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.670
 I do not know who it would be but it's very good 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.560
 good the graphics the truth is very 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.080
 well and the cndh and they have said some of 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.730
 that the game would be made in 3d and not 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.250
 would adapt for android by the graphics 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.110
 the same not guys the game I saw that 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.730
 it is proven that this is going to be done 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.940
 by multimedia fusion a pretty game 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.230
 simple that scott well basically 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.750
 he wanted to be in the race of 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.340
 animation and he did thanks to these in 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.680
 house for doing differentiated tasks 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.440
 expert in animation and put in guys 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.090
 it's like this 34 pages even if you see a 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.520
 juezo is adaptable for all 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.320
 computers for all devices 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.450
 and another very curious thing is that here 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.940
 we can see in bed in a bed in the 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.310
 bedroom do not get to see the 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.110
 freddys that are like that in the body 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.270
 of neymar fred and if we will remember them 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.640
 we are three are three exactly and 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.410
 these are exactly three but to me 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.930
 question is where is nightmare 'frei 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.700
 has not appeared here and is possibly 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.590
 contain nothing else list the 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.620
 He also showed the first night and then 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.810
 the second because according to freddy it appears 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.790
 well on the third night out there or the 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.530
 fourth night Freddy appears and what 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.290
 would be in order until 31 then also in 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.970
 end up to 34 possibly I do not know the 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.590
 it really has a good design that the 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.200
 you're really going to get nervous 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.550
 things the truth being honest this 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.200
 end is another disc another is going to be one of 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.360
 the best I do not know what in some that 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.700
 the truth is cody only possible for 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.620
 adapt it for all public because according to 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.590
 is for all public for one for one 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.060
 of 10 years or less maybe in today 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.100
 so the either a 10 year old child 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.990
 can make this day this is nothing 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.880
 I did not like it, but well, they have to 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.970
 be the ones with you do not have to do it so 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.740
 aggressive as well as I do not know and then because 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.020
 we got an idea of what the 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.570
 game as a basis that you are going to treat a 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.280
 a little bit more than the one 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.780
 be so far possibly from that of 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.490
 a house we will be in a house in what 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.990
 unique that is so far that one 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.360
 boy is this what would be nothing more a 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.070
 teaser trailer if you have more 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.930
 theories maybe some saga of theories 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.570
 of finance 34 but remember that you are going to 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.280
 leave the game soon on August 8 and 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.000
 we do not have to make so many ideas 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.100
 why 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.960
 game is going to be good the truth is going to be 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.700
 one of the best because if we see well 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.040
 the graphics and all that has been left 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.840
 very cool very cool and you have to 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.940
 learn the story when we play 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.620
 the game that the truth is going to be great 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.750
 there is a reason why we are in a 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.970
 house and we're going to find out we're going to 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.490
 know surely and with regard to what 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.890
 what would trap this animatronic 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.170
 that we see it here, no, that's why a 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.880
 little doll is sitting there and has the 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:59.000
 same appearance the teaser that we see 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.800
 we are the window is sitting 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.440
 and well, the truth is very good 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.360
 I feel maybe some that is could 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.090
 be the cause of everything that will control 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.180
 maybe it controls the people 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:14.030
 little freddys that we see from there by 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.040
 the camera I do not know then nothing will be known 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.500
 seriously nothing is known until it comes out 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.210
 fine atradis 4 the truth that you have to 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.490
 expect nothing more the game and 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.200
 experience it to ourselves so 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.380
 guys this has been all well for this 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.000
 uncle for this teaser trailer analysis 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.160
 something like that but good if it escaped me 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.480
 Something I do not know, can you tell me? 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.370
 the comments and I would do it in a 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.569
 video apart I do not know and well then if 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.159
 they have theories 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:39.439
 a theory that I would rise up 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:41.449
 obviously and good boy I hope you have them 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:42.919
 liked as they comment subscribe if they are 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:45.139
 new in the channel likes the video 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:46.819
 if you really liked this was a 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:48.649
 country is not another disc tote is the trailer 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:50.089
 analysis I am lee deadly wolves of 

00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:54.009
 very large and until the other video 

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:54.009
