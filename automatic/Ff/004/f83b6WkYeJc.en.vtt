contoured to go shapely to go with the

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.490 
contoured to go shapely to go with the
snow<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:40.640> it's<00:01:40.760> easier<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.210> turn<00:01:41.390> in<00:01:41.570> touch<00:01:41.750> and

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
snow so it's easier to turn in touch and

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.260 
snow so it's easier to turn in touch and
our<00:01:42.830> children's<00:01:43.310> program<00:01:43.670> is<00:01:43.910> a<00:01:43.940> very

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
our children's program is a very

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.570 
our children's program is a very
friendly<00:01:44.600> environment<00:01:45.290> where<00:01:45.530> we<00:01:46.130> have<00:01:46.310> a

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
friendly environment where we have a

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.420 
friendly environment where we have a
very<00:01:46.730> animated<00:01:47.180> learning<00:01:47.690> area<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:48.800> it<00:01:49.160> takes

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
very animated learning area so it takes

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.640 
very animated learning area so it takes
her<00:01:49.580> mind<00:01:49.760> off<00:01:49.880> skiing<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:50.420> it's<00:01:50.510> more<00:01:50.930> fun

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650
