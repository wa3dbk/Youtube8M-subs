these<00:00:26.400> are<00:00:26.820> my<00:00:26.939> definitions<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.989> think<00:00:28.259> it

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
these are my definitions I think it

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.880 
these are my definitions I think it
accurately<00:00:28.829> reflects<00:00:29.340> what<00:00:29.669> needs<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.360> be

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.479 
described in the light pressure zone
pretty<00:00:36.239> much<00:00:36.530> you're<00:00:37.530> doing<00:00:37.890> mostly

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
pretty much you're doing mostly

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:48.560 
pretty much you're doing mostly
smoothing<00:00:39.410> very<00:00:40.410> little<00:00:40.890> adding<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.910> area<00:00:42.769> so

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.930 

in<00:00:49.080> the<00:00:49.260> light<00:00:49.410> pressure<00:00:49.710> zone<00:00:50.100> that's<00:00:50.700> where

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
in the light pressure zone that's where

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.860 
in the light pressure zone that's where
you<00:00:51.000> do<00:00:51.150> your<00:00:51.300> finish<00:00:52.040> wheeling<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:54.510> next

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
you do your finish wheeling the next

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.000 
you do your finish wheeling the next
zone<00:00:55.110> will<00:00:55.860> be<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.280> middle<00:00:56.610> pressure<00:00:56.910> zone

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
zone will be the middle pressure zone

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.700 
zone will be the middle pressure zone
middle<00:00:59.010> zone<00:00:59.750> the<00:01:00.750> middle<00:01:01.050> zone<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.470> where<00:01:01.650> you

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
middle zone the middle zone is where you

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.189 
middle zone the middle zone is where you
do<00:01:01.890> mostly<00:01:02.280> work<00:01:02.580> middle<00:01:03.450> zone<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:04.050> do

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
do mostly work middle zone you do

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.130 
do mostly work middle zone you do
smoothing<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:05.550> you<00:01:05.700> also<00:01:05.910> add<00:01:06.390> area<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
smoothing but you also add area to the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.840 
smoothing but you also add area to the
panel<00:01:07.590> you're<00:01:07.740> stretching<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.250> panel<00:01:08.700> out

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
panel you're stretching the panel out

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.500 
panel you're stretching the panel out
and<00:01:12.680> in<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.890> middle<00:01:14.190> zone<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.729> don't<00:01:14.790> get<00:01:15.210> a

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
and in the middle zone you don't get a

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.370 
and in the middle zone you don't get a
lot<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.560> what's<00:01:16.800> called<00:01:17.090> wheel<00:01:18.090> stop<00:01:18.570> marks<00:01:19.110> or

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
lot of what's called wheel stop marks or

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.150 
lot of what's called wheel stop marks or
furrows<00:01:19.920> or<00:01:20.430> wheel<00:01:21.330> marks<00:01:21.690> it<00:01:22.590> still<00:01:22.860> stays

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
furrows or wheel marks it still stays

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.910 
furrows or wheel marks it still stays
pretty<00:01:23.580> nice<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.000> smooth<00:01:24.300> now<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.259> progress

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
pretty nice and smooth now the progress

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.820 
pretty nice and smooth now the progress
is<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> little<00:01:26.369> slower<00:01:26.990> then<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.440> go<00:01:28.590> into

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
is a little slower then if you go into

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.530 
is a little slower then if you go into
the<00:01:28.920> high<00:01:29.070> pressure<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.759> if<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.090> go<00:01:30.210> into<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
the high pressure so if you go into the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.630 
the high pressure so if you go into the
high<00:01:30.660> pressure<00:01:30.960> zone<00:01:31.110> which<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.640> really

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
high pressure zone which is really

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.859 
high pressure zone which is really
cranking<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.360> up<00:01:33.800> you<00:01:34.800> know<00:01:34.979> it'll<00:01:35.460> gain<00:01:35.869> air

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
cranking it up you know it'll gain air

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.320 
cranking it up you know it'll gain air
even<00:01:37.140> faster<00:01:39.350> basically<00:01:40.350> thinning<00:01:40.800> out

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
even faster basically thinning out

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.410 
even faster basically thinning out
gaining<00:01:42.330> an<00:01:42.450> area<00:01:43.310> but<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.610> do<00:01:44.790> get<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.030> lot<00:01:45.270> of

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
gaining an area but you do get a lot of

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.180 
gaining an area but you do get a lot of
stop<00:01:45.750> marks<00:01:46.200> when<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.710> whenever<00:01:46.979> you

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
stop marks when you have it whenever you

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.910 
stop marks when you have it whenever you
stop<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:48.509> wheel<00:01:48.750> leaves<00:01:49.080> a<00:01:49.259> little<00:01:49.680> tiny

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
stop the wheel leaves a little tiny

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.730 
stop the wheel leaves a little tiny
little<00:01:50.250> indent<00:01:50.880> there<00:01:51.630> easy<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.990> get<00:01:52.259> out<00:01:52.470> but

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
little indent there easy to get out but

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.240 
little indent there easy to get out but
it's<00:01:52.890> just<00:01:53.010> something<00:01:53.370> that<00:01:53.940> have<00:01:54.030> done<00:01:55.250> if

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
it's just something that have done if

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:05.970 
it's just something that have done if
there's

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.710 

so<00:02:06.980> that's<00:02:07.160> if<00:02:07.370> you<00:02:07.490> attempted<00:02:08.030> to<00:02:08.090> wheel<00:02:08.420> this

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
so that's if you attempted to wheel this

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.280 
so that's if you attempted to wheel this
panel<00:02:09.140> out<00:02:09.350> all<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:10.070> way<00:02:10.630> you<00:02:11.630> might<00:02:11.810> do<00:02:11.990> some

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
panel out all the way you might do some

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.260 
panel out all the way you might do some
of<00:02:12.410> it<00:02:12.530> in<00:02:12.710> the<00:02:12.860> high-pressure<00:02:13.310> zone<00:02:13.490> and<00:02:14.150> you

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
of it in the high-pressure zone and you

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.200 
of it in the high-pressure zone and you
would<00:02:14.450> go<00:02:14.690> into<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.950> medium<00:02:16.340> pressure<00:02:16.640> so

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.540 

slowly<00:02:20.210> but<00:02:20.360> sure<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:21.560> shape<00:02:21.890> would<00:02:22.100> start<00:02:22.400> to

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
slowly but sure the shape would start to

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.400 
slowly but sure the shape would start to
appear<00:02:22.880> unity<00:02:23.570> desire<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:26.120> then<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.840> process

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
appear unity desire and then the process

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.080 
appear unity desire and then the process
of<00:02:27.560> wheeling<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.070> can<00:02:28.250> also<00:02:28.430> set<00:02:28.940> the

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
of wheeling you can also set the

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.780 
of wheeling you can also set the
arrangement<00:02:29.750> so<00:02:30.470> if<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:30.890> know<00:02:31.160> this<00:02:31.550> thing<00:02:31.760> is

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
arrangement so if I know this thing is

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.290 
arrangement so if I know this thing is
supposed<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.209> have<00:02:32.390> this<00:02:32.570> shape<00:02:32.900> like<00:02:33.230> this<00:02:34.300> as

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
supposed to have this shape like this as

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.020 
supposed to have this shape like this as
you're<00:02:35.540> pulling<00:02:35.990> it<00:02:36.200> out<00:02:36.800> you<00:02:37.430> pull<00:02:37.730> down<00:02:38.000> a

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
you're pulling it out you pull down a

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.810 
you're pulling it out you pull down a
little<00:02:38.360> bit<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.400> starts<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:40.910> induce<00:02:41.239> that

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
little bit and it starts to induce that

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.650 
little bit and it starts to induce that
that<00:02:43.820> I<00:02:44.090> roll<00:02:44.810> I<00:02:46.120> just<00:02:47.120> want<00:02:47.300> to<00:02:47.390> do<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.600> a

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
that I roll I just want to do that a

00:02:47.660 --> 00:03:05.480 
that I roll I just want to do that a
little<00:02:47.989> bit

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.540 

you<00:03:05.820> see<00:03:06.150> now

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
you see now

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.730 
you see now
what's<00:03:08.060> happening<00:03:08.510> here<00:03:08.780> is<00:03:08.990> the<00:03:09.140> panel<00:03:09.560> is

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
what's happening here is the panel is

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.600 
what's happening here is the panel is
let's<00:03:10.580> not<00:03:10.790> looking<00:03:11.090> like<00:03:11.270> clone<00:03:11.540> play<00:03:12.610> and

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
let's not looking like clone play and

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.170 
let's not looking like clone play and
what<00:03:14.000> that<00:03:14.210> is<00:03:14.480> is<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:15.110> fine<00:03:15.740> smooth<00:03:16.700> finish

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
what that is is the fine smooth finish

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.770 
what that is is the fine smooth finish

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
we put a little corner marks in here so

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:02.930 
we put a little corner marks in here so
we<00:06:01.229> get<00:06:01.349> the<00:06:01.500> Pat<00:06:01.710> always<00:06:02.220> back<00:06:02.430> at<00:06:02.639> the<00:06:02.729> same

we get the Pat always back at the same
spot<00:06:03.330> yeah<00:06:03.569> but<00:06:04.229> we're<00:06:04.380> still<00:06:04.500> really<00:06:04.979> early

spot yeah but we're still really early
in<00:06:05.310> the<00:06:05.400> development<00:06:05.610> so<00:06:06.300> we're<00:06:06.419> gonna<00:06:06.509> have

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
in the development so we're gonna have

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.870 
in the development so we're gonna have
to<00:06:06.690> worry<00:06:06.930> about<00:06:06.990> it<00:06:07.289> yeah

as<00:06:23.710> good<00:06:23.980> as<00:06:24.130> a<00:06:24.160> panel<00:06:24.640> to<00:06:24.760> get<00:06:25.000> both<00:06:25.270> sides

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
as good as a panel to get both sides

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
as good as a panel to get both sides
would<00:06:25.810> be<00:06:25.930> absolutely<00:06:26.440> perfect

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
would be absolutely perfect

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.930 
would be absolutely perfect
it's<00:06:28.680> a<00:06:28.800> little<00:06:29.100> smaller<00:06:29.930> little<00:06:30.930> methodical

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
it's a little smaller little methodical

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.900 
it's a little smaller little methodical
no<00:06:32.940> noise<00:06:33.290> and<00:06:34.290> now<00:06:35.190> we're<00:06:35.430> going<00:06:35.550> to<00:06:35.610> try<00:06:35.880> a

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910 
no noise and now we're going to try a

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.440 
no noise and now we're going to try a
different<00:06:36.090> map

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.450 
different map

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.230 
different map
shrinking<00:06:39.290> instead<00:06:40.130> and<00:06:40.460> a<00:06:40.520> little<00:06:41.060> bit<00:06:41.150> of

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
shrinking instead and a little bit of

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.490 
shrinking instead and a little bit of
shrinking<00:06:41.660> he<00:06:41.780> grew<00:06:41.960> a<00:06:41.990> lot<00:06:42.460> here<00:06:43.460> you<00:06:43.610> change

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.500 
shrinking he grew a lot here you change

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.450 
shrinking he grew a lot here you change
it's<00:06:45.710> quite<00:06:46.460> disruptive<00:06:46.790> to<00:06:47.360> the<00:06:47.450> panel

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
my dad allow some without too

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.140 
my dad allow some without too
eventually<00:06:54.680> over<00:06:55.039> there<00:06:55.280> always<00:06:55.699> like<00:06:55.909> from

eventually over there always like from

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.170 
eventually over there always like from

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.379 

we've<00:07:00.540> got<00:07:00.690> a<00:07:00.720> shrink<00:07:01.080> in<00:07:01.229> these<00:07:01.410> two<00:07:02.389> black

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:03.389 
we've got a shrink in these two black

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:07.310 
we've got a shrink in these two black
zone<00:07:03.720> areas<00:07:04.290> here<00:07:04.740> bring<00:07:05.430> this<00:07:05.580> up<00:07:06.139> I'll<00:07:07.139> do
