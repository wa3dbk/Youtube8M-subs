 gorgeous no doubt but this is not 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:36.200
 its main advantage is gaming 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.510
 laptop to me laptop has never been 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.760
 my understanding is the laptop is always weaker 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.760
 personal computer it is not for 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.739
 toys but not for this hunk 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.760

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.350
 add another 16 gig laptop 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.680
 energy intensive keeps charging order 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.799
 four to five hours for vader this 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.780
 very very important quality in relation to 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.920
 17 inch monitor

 instantly 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:38.439
 despite the fact that it was well shoved here 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.909
 full size backlit keyboard 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:44.380
 backlit and endorsed as soon as you 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.759
 got to the touchpad or pressed the button 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.939
 buttons are pressed gently 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:53.659
 do not require much effort touchpad 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.790
 hefty not miss by itself 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.450
 for such personalities need good 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.649
 cooling and it is here 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.960
 the fans are located at the back 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.060
 hot air comes out of a pair of large 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.939
 holes thus achieved 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.130
 reasonable balance on the one hand cooler and 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.370
 removed as possible from the user but 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.250
 same time they 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.370
 put annoying buzz cools well 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.950
 the insides of a laptop most often a laptop 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.159
 behaves very quietly for the game model 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.860
 and does not interfere with immersing the virtual world 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:29.340
 oddly enough excellent quality 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.099

 it's all nice and little things like I already 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.239
 spoke gaming and let's 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.720
 let's test it with our example 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:47.390
 favorite game world of tanks like you 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:50.970
 see it gives out 8090 100 fps on ultra 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.790
 the graph is given that the url of tanks 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.870
 we all know our game has optimized 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.510
 so-so but approach it again though release 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.030
 again put off the bastard and so here's the flight 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.750
 on ultra gta 5 to the owner of this 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.540
 the laptop is guaranteed why is this all if 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.750
 You can buy a hospital rowing that is 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.760
 people who need a mobile platform 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.760
 constant travel trips and so 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.060

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.530
 advice to future buyers 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.959
 but quite big and its weight is 5 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.829
 kilogram so I advise you to dial 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:35.340
 some muscle mass worth mentioning 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.829

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:46.739
 Well, you can see right away not cheap again 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.389
 I would like to mention the design if 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.470
 compare with other top 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:55.290

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.840
 brutal form however like the others 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:06.299

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.720
 on the monitor there i try to bend on 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.980
 touchpad, and let's be honest this is still 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.949
 perversion 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.060
 I play on the account itself, the rate will drop 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:18.060
 but I'm not worried 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:22.079
