00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 your pc the year you wish you 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.799
 give a little boost for this 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.429
 do you have to change the bar of ram 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:09.059
 so what is it that the 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.070
 bar of ram 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.500
 the ram bar is one of the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.020
 components of the computer it allows 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.460
 in addition everything depends on the ability 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.230
 to run more or fewer applications 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.609
 at the same time or execute 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.380
 applications that demand more than 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.460
 resources 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.529
 then these bars of ram is found 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.840
 in supermarkets or on 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.460
 internet of course we can buy them 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.969
 for about twenty euros 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.250
 everything depends on the capacity so me here 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.370
 I have a bar of ram 2 gigas that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.010
 I bought 20 euros how to change 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.460
 Ram strips will have to be disassembled 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.399
 the computer first of all it takes 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.680
 turn off the computer by unplugging the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.070
 power plug and of course it takes 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.390
 remove all connected devices 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.280
 to disassemble your CPU 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.739
 it is possible that they need a 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.160
 screwdriver personally I do not have any 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.649
 need 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.649
 and just eclipsed it's gone 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:13.920
 here is once the central unit disassemble 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.009
 must be placed inside 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.310
 the computer and look for the bar of 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.340
 ram 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.780
 personally she is here to 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.100
 to remove it is very simple on both 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.460
 sides here and here you and ethical lips 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.860
 removed like this here I am 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.140
 the old RAM modules is here 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.700
 a bar of ram of 256 mo here and 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.130
 I replace it with the new ride 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:47.040
 lasting 2 gigas of which I have room 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:49.920
 in the same place like this here is very 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.149
 simply and I give the clips this in 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.490
 pushing here is my new bar of 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.049
 ram is installed there is no more 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.049
 than to go back up my central unit 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.970
 once the central unit is up and 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.930
 all the components reconnect it does not 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.259
 you just have to turn on 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.440
 the computer like these have benefited 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.000
 of the new power of this one 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.290
 Thank you for watching this video 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.210
 to find out how to change your 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.210
 RAM modules to the next
