00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
that was a pretty hyped game and I think

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.540 
that was a pretty hyped game and I think
even<00:00:56.879> like<00:00:57.149> any<00:00:57.329> any<00:00:57.809> next-gen<00:00:58.680> big<00:00:59.129> release

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
even like any any next-gen big release

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.569 
even like any any next-gen big release
is<00:00:59.879> gonna<00:01:00.149> have<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.660> lot<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.109> hype<00:01:01.739> behind<00:01:02.070> it

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
is gonna have a lot of hype behind it

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.130 
is gonna have a lot of hype behind it
and<00:01:02.760> advanced<00:01:03.239> warfare<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.629> not<00:01:03.840> going<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.019> be

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
and advanced warfare is not going to be

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.990

period and know how hyped I was but I

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.340 
period and know how hyped I was but I

hadn't played the game and and I I
didn't<00:02:48.160> really<00:02:48.280> know<00:02:48.459> what<00:02:48.490> fully<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:49.180> expect

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
didn't really know what fully to expect

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.150 
didn't really know what fully to expect
with<00:02:49.780> black<00:02:50.020> ops<00:02:50.230> 2<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:50.500> then<00:02:50.590> black<00:02:50.770> ops<00:02:50.980> 2

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
with black ops 2 and then black ops 2

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.130 
with black ops 2 and then black ops 2
ended<00:02:51.490> up<00:02:51.610> being<00:02:51.820> probably<00:02:52.540> my<00:02:52.660> favorite<00:02:52.990> call

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
ended up being probably my favorite call

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.500 
ended up being probably my favorite call
duties<00:02:53.440> about<00:02:53.680> time<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:55.270> wasn't

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
duties about time and it wasn't

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.530 
duties about time and it wasn't
overhyped<00:02:56.130> but<00:02:57.130> I<00:02:57.340> don't<00:02:57.700> know<00:02:57.790> since<00:02:58.390> I've

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
overhyped but I don't know since I've

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.300 
overhyped but I don't know since I've
played<00:02:58.570> advanced<00:02:59.470> warfare<00:02:59.800> I<00:02:59.860> feel<00:03:00.100> like<00:03:00.190> I

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
played advanced warfare I feel like I

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.670 
played advanced warfare I feel like I
have<00:03:00.520> a<00:03:00.550> more<00:03:00.910> biased<00:03:01.420> opinion<00:03:01.959> on<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.470> hype

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
have a more biased opinion on the hype

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.590 
have a more biased opinion on the hype
of<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:03.010> game<00:03:03.160> I<00:03:03.370> really<00:03:03.730> do<00:03:03.880> think<00:03:04.120> it's<00:03:04.360> worth

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
of the game I really do think it's worth

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.870 
of the game I really do think it's worth
all<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.930> hype<00:03:05.080> I<00:03:05.440> really<00:03:06.190> do<00:03:06.340> firmly<00:03:06.730> believe

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
all the hype I really do firmly believe

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.910 
all the hype I really do firmly believe
that<00:03:07.209> it's<00:03:07.600> going<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.840> be<00:03:07.990> a<00:03:08.020> great<00:03:08.320> call<00:03:08.800> of

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
that it's going to be a great call of

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.980 
that it's going to be a great call of
duty<00:03:09.160> game<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:09.459> that<00:03:09.520> we're<00:03:09.730> in<00:03:10.240> for<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.570> really

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
duty game and that we're in for a really

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.410 
duty game and that we're in for a really
good<00:03:11.260> first<00:03:12.040> year<00:03:12.370> of<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.550> game<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.060> I<00:03:13.180> think

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
good first year of the game and I think

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.790 
good first year of the game and I think
it's<00:03:13.570> going<00:03:13.660> to<00:03:13.750> be<00:03:13.870> really<00:03:14.050> good<00:03:14.170> just<00:03:14.590> all

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
this stuff that they've done for it and

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.900 
this stuff that they've done for it and

just tried to make it for too many
different<00:03:26.470> platforms<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.370> know<00:03:27.489> and<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:28.150> I

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
different platforms you know and and I

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.330 
different platforms you know and and I
feel<00:03:28.480> like<00:03:28.510> I<00:03:28.840> don't<00:03:28.900> know<00:03:29.019> this<00:03:29.290> this<00:03:30.010> is<00:03:30.220> the

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
feel like I don't know this this is the

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.740 
feel like I don't know this this is the
first<00:03:30.580> call<00:03:30.790> of<00:03:30.820> duty<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:31.239> we're<00:03:31.480> playing

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
first call of duty that we're playing

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.449 
first call of duty that we're playing
even<00:03:32.200> though<00:03:32.290> ghost<00:03:32.560> was<00:03:32.860> released<00:03:33.250> on

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
even though ghost was released on

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.280 
even though ghost was released on
next-gen<00:03:34.120> I<00:03:34.330> feel<00:03:34.840> like<00:03:34.900> this<00:03:35.080> is<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.260> first

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
next-gen I feel like this is the first

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.110 
next-gen I feel like this is the first
call<00:03:35.739> duty<00:03:35.920> that<00:03:36.130> we're<00:03:36.340> playing<00:03:36.610> that<00:03:36.730> was

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.140 
you're getting into when you click on
them<00:04:09.690> but<00:04:10.690> um<00:04:10.989> I<00:04:11.530> don't<00:04:11.950> know<00:04:12.130> I<00:04:12.190> don't<00:04:13.030> think

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
them but um I don't know I don't think

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.250 
them but um I don't know I don't think
this<00:04:13.390> is<00:04:13.450> going<00:04:13.660> to<00:04:13.750> be<00:04:13.870> like<00:04:14.019> another

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
this is going to be like another

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.140 
this is going to be like another
titanfall<00:04:14.739> and<00:04:15.160> to<00:04:15.640> be<00:04:15.760> honest<00:04:16.000> I<00:04:16.090> think

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
titanfall and to be honest I think

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.660 
titanfall and to be honest I think
people<00:04:16.480> are<00:04:16.690> going<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:16.900> get<00:04:17.079> really<00:04:17.230> bore

of<00:04:17.760> destiny<00:04:18.030> uh<00:04:18.390> I<00:04:19.080> think<00:04:19.620> destiny<00:04:20.100> is<00:04:20.310> just<00:04:20.520> a

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
of destiny uh I think destiny is just a

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.400 
of destiny uh I think destiny is just a
game<00:04:20.820> that<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.360> is<00:04:21.630> tithing<00:04:22.080> a<00:04:22.170> lot<00:04:22.320> of

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
game that that is tithing a lot of

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.930 
game that that is tithing a lot of
people<00:04:22.680> over<00:04:22.980> for<00:04:23.280> now<00:04:23.370> because<00:04:23.550> there's<00:04:23.760> not

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
people over for now because there's not

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.570 
people over for now because there's not
a<00:04:23.970> whole<00:04:24.150> lot<00:04:24.300> of<00:04:24.360> new<00:04:24.540> games<00:04:24.690> out<00:04:24.990> right<00:04:25.230> now

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.620 
a whole lot of new games out right now
so<00:04:26.580> I<00:04:26.610> don't<00:04:26.760> know<00:04:26.940> I'm<00:04:27.000> not<00:04:27.120> trying<00:04:27.390> to<00:04:27.450> I'm

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
so I don't know I'm not trying to I'm

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.120 
so I don't know I'm not trying to I'm
not<00:04:27.660> trying<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:27.990> argue<00:04:28.050> if<00:04:28.590> you<00:04:28.710> think<00:04:28.920> have<00:04:29.100> a

not trying to argue if you think have a

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.100 
not trying to argue if you think have a
