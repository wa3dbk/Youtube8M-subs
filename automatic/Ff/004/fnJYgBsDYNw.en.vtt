what's up guys squirt dude here ever

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.700 
what's up guys squirt dude here ever
since<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.210> creation<00:00:03.419> of<00:00:03.689> mob<00:00:03.899> farms<00:00:04.350> people

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
since the creation of mob farms people

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:05.690 
since the creation of mob farms people
have<00:00:04.890> been<00:00:05.009> trying<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.339> come<00:00:05.490> up<00:00:05.609> with

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
have been trying to come up with

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.730 
have been trying to come up with
efficient<00:00:06.270> and<00:00:06.420> simple<00:00:06.720> solutions<00:00:07.440> to

efficient and simple solutions to

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.250 
efficient and simple solutions to

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
quickly bring down at mobs Hill so that

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.690 
quickly bring down at mobs Hill so that
they<00:00:10.380> can<00:00:10.530> be<00:00:10.650> killed<00:00:10.889> by<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.130> player

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
they can be killed by the player

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.120 
they can be killed by the player
however<00:00:12.690> most<00:00:13.019> designs<00:00:13.440> ignored<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.920> very

XP like all good mob forms the first
step<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.570> gather<00:00:39.690> all<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.079> mobs<00:00:40.469> at<00:00:40.680> a

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
step is to gather all the mobs at a

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.080 
step is to gather all the mobs at a
central<00:00:41.129> location<00:00:41.960> it<00:00:43.100> is<00:00:44.100> also<00:00:44.579> worth<00:00:44.789> noting

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
central location it is also worth noting

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.360 
central location it is also worth noting
that<00:00:45.480> if<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.020> device<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.739> be<00:00:46.980> done<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.340> a

that if this device is to be done on a

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.520 
that if this device is to be done on a
spawner<00:00:47.760> then<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.600> has<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.930> be<00:00:49.020> at<00:00:49.110> least<00:00:49.230> five

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
spawner then it has to be at least five

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
spawner the reason this design uses lava

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.279 
spawner the reason this design uses lava
is<00:00:59.460> because<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.420> quickest<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
is because it is the quickest and the

is because it is the quickest and the
smallest<00:01:01.559> way<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.949> killing<00:01:02.309> mobs<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:03.239> also<00:01:03.480> has
