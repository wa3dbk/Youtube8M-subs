00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.580
 - 17 for me to do that ip high it's 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:16.199
 dear paid he opens to all 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.940
 these lyrics franquin I hope you 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.779
 be fine for a passage in super good 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.150
 played in are found for a 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.800
 attac technique that's going to be with two 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.090
 wizards golem you to the joke is that 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.880
 harry potter who is a wizard 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.099
 mdr nan i wander ah well it made me 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.570
 laugh so it's too much right now 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.009
 I try a lot of songs with the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.239
 new earthquake spell that 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.790
 I love it but I think it's limited 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.899
 we are very proud of the e3 because of 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.399
 blow it allows to enter the village 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.770
 very very easily and so we will 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.670
 watch today 3 gameplay where I 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.350
 will resume in the villages 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.640
 I really go through them completely 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.969
 you'll see I'm going from one side to 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.829
 the other 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.300
 it's pure violence it's really 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.399
 super nice to use 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.219
 i really love this lot i love them 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.690
 cry they completely innovate the game 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.370
 finally I find it really super funny 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.350
 of kara disappears all the ramparts 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.489
 of an area like that huge so on this 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.870
 I propose its small installation 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.149
 elise is that we find ourselves just 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.320
 after for our gameplay so for this 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.420
 first gameplay we will end up on 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.890
 a village a little bit about us that 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.750
 I want to say without being mean 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.729
 so for this understand to use 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.500
 eight earthquake spell everything 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.880
 simply to bring down all 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.380
 ramparts and draw a path that goes 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.330
 go to the middle of the village 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.710
 we're going to put on a stormy evening and a kind 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.450
 of poison to sign a castle 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.380
 fields but in any case the facts 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.450
 there was no franc chat 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.890
 they do not use it so we 'll see 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.840
 when three golem yet what is 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.729
 will swing all the wizards just 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.119
 behind and our heroes so how are you 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.950
 to be a mass mass composition of guys 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.509
 that is to say we will try time 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.500
 who with the guen and with them the 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.430
 wizards really we will do a lot 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.810
 damage 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.909
 especially that the heroes who have 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.500
 supported these wizards so that's going to be a 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.119
 thing that will really be based on the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.710
 power speed etc. 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.210
 so that's if we do not have walls 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.540
 can go within the village a lot 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.070
 more quickly and so my surroundings of 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.840
 stars trophies faster 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.439
 because if you reach the age of helping 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.689
 faster 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.030
 we won as quickly as possible and so the wheel 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.070
 tried to try a 100% on this 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.180
 base but it's going to be very complicated 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.710
 simply because the shutters we 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.540
 have to turn the exits no go no 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.459
 follow because in it was a 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.619
 base who were poorly organized whose 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.629
 rather complicated to attack 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.830
 it's the two stars were insured seen 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.269
 the level of the village 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.620
 that it is not very 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.659
 very big lebel we will say with the 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.670
 ramparts level 6 it's not top top 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.250
 knowing that there are eleven levels it has a 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.569
 it's about halfway and it does not cost 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.310
 not very expensive alain not a lot of 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.769
 points and so it's really a village 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.299
 not very powerful but the wolf attacked 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.940
 because it's not a form 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.650
 like to attack so there we at 77% we will not 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.629
 go up very high in percentage just 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.040
 with the golems and the giant the little ones 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.110
 roads that we have at the top of the village are going 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.599
 to come and get killed rather quickly 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.099
 but it will do it if we saw more than 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.359
 time we could have done something 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.430
 but unfortunately we did not have 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.319
 more time so it's a pity 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.879
 in fact it's mostly the Arctic what 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.329
 was very embarrassed if he had been destroyed 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.910
 in the beginning 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.709
 finally not at the beginning but while the 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.970
 troops is in the middle that would be very 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.980
 very well we could have done the 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:04.079
 100% and unfortunately it was not 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:06.030
 destroyed he was able to get down all my 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.170
 troops betrayed them peace with his 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.720
 small submachine gun 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.579
 so that's only 90% of these already 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.510
 not bad there we meet when 500 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.040
 miles of each and when I you 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.079
 were talking about crossing the village with 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.120
 the earthquake without boom 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.620
 it's really this gameplay that I 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.630
 will register because we are going to go from one 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.220
 side to side it's going to be just huge 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.989
 we'll be able to see that just after 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.269
 really me I think it's like josi a 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.250
 open m it's not anything 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.410
 allows to make beautiful carnage and I 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.609
 well kiffÃ© so there we have 1,500 million 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.049
 every day we have a lot of resources 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.090
 we will balance all our problems as 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.319
 it comes back in the village we will swing 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.940
 all our wizards but we have to watch 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.859
 still a little bit before I go all 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.180
 swing but then I tried to play 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.579
 otherwise, that is , keeping a 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.540
 little bit for if he had to scratch there 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.919
 it's mostly because I wanted 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.959
 can also take the resource that 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:50.940
 had up but common sense is going to say it 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.819
 So here we see the rage fate 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.650
 will come all their enraged make a 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.810
 carnage in the middle the age of a help will come 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.849
 to be attacked we will chain everything 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.620
 right away on the tremor boom 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.389
 earth to come make a hole in 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.599
 the other side of the village and be able to do 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:08.519
 so that the troops come out 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.840
 so here we will come and drill here and 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.340
 now I look at it I could have 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.260
 better put it a little closer to the 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.790
 cannon finally pile up you start what 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.039
 like in the same place it would have 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.670
 maybe better than the market but hey 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.650
 it's not a big deal 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.000
 and by the way not his uzel mi space 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.710
 july the power of marennes 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.420
 it's a pity it could have done 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.040
 a lot more damage but hey it's 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.660
 not very bad it's a shame we are 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.640
 will come out alive so I think there I 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.170
 begin to as the golems 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.340
 entertain all the defenses I'm going 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.200
 swing wizards who are coming 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.280
 scrape water resources and especially 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.780
 percentages because for 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.000
 the moment we do not have the 50% yet 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.810
 even if it is more or less assured saw 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.400
 all we have left 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.230
 we have once again the fate of 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.520
 poison that we will not use because it 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.560
 there is no auckland tournament 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.750
 so that's a very big problem 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.970
 so here we will have climbs the hyades 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.470
 play and we will thank him and have nothing 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.600
 for all these resources can when 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.670
 even to be better lead the little ones 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.200
 to improve bergstein and not a 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.020
 resource plus the league bonus 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.610
 champions bah it's going to please 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.150
 people and tell you that we will fill 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.100
 pockets 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.720
 and obviously this not finished we can see 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.120
 that they feed some wizard 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.440
 that there are drills left on the side 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.660
 left of the base in prob to come 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.670
 obviously use it so 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.050
 reasonable, that is, we're going 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.510
 manage all this we will not put it all 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.520
 in bulk we'll put it all calmly 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.550
 for it is so dirty that loses 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.930
 all so there we will be 60% for this guy 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.430
 was so it's really not bad the 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.410
 next gameplay of a fifth that 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.060
 I did not get stars if I had 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.410
 a little better manage it's less of 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.370
 bullshit I could have done I did 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.140
 49% 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.840
 we're going to look at it but it's still 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.430
 interesting as gameplay I did not know 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.780
 too much how m leaving the trembling 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.400
 but good it's pretty good 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.800
 past and I want to tell you that 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.139
 it's gone well I actually 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.060
 think the thing is 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.499
 the problem is that with the fate of 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.659
 poison that there is no castle 

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:52.889
 flan is when we could have put a 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:54.870
 lightning night and scratch a percentage 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.889
 elsewhere sent this kind mail but 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.270
 not be sure of the poison in the blood of 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.550
 poor who can kill the castle according 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.900
 she can yes and in addition he can 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.819
 when important then the fate of 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.379
 poison can not but hey that's a 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:06.180
 you still need to improve 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:07.310
 finally gameplay techniques attacked 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.110
 it's something you still need 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.939
 practice really needs a lot 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.449
 use it to be able to use it at the 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:14.009
 perfection 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:16.199
 I want to say there for now 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:18.270
 I did maybe five or six attacks 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:19.650
 maximum and I have selected those 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.090
 which I was most proud of because 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.039
 still it's not small bases 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.419
 of a d-max base scan are still 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:26.159
 not anywhere ready to tackle 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.550
 really very easily I had no 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:28.439
 problem 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.300
 I even more I do not like was afraid of 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:31.439
 the attacked I live there I put priest 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.449
 d'ars thing I said ok ok we 're going 

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:36.659
 attack that and we will try to 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:37.080
 erase his little his little mouth on the 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:39.449
 small village 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.219
 it did not happen to me, I did not 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:43.229
 used to attack his little that 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:44.999
 give me I was raised to the barbarians 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:46.770
 at home I'll tell you so attack that 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:48.749
 it's really enjoyable I say wow 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.360
 it's powerful there are tricks that are 

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:52.500
 well when art market there it is there we 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.430
 can see what I was talking about in 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.659
 beginning of video that is to say that 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.520
 normally a huge hole in the 

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:58.800
 village the eye the fate of 30 military 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.870
 franks just huge the village has been 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.370
 just destroyed as if there was a 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.000
 bomb that had fallen there that had done 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.460
 blow everything up 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.319
 so we'll scratch the 49th percent 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.659
 at the top of the base is trying to scratch 

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:10.889
 a 50th on the camp down I do not have 

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:13.409
 succeeded unfortunately what happened 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:13.889
 past so we'll finish on 49% that a 

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:15.419
 single star 

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:16.949
 I hope you will have who makes his 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:19.589
 ranges and I hope you will try 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:21.659
 this attac technique and you're in 

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:22.800
 will go out because obviously so that 

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:24.659
 it makes tiling is better 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.610

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:27.750
