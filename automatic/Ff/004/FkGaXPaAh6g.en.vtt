00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:54.859 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:57.399 

we<00:00:55.399> then<00:00:55.579> make<00:00:55.820> our<00:00:55.999> make<00:00:56.570> our<00:00:56.749> films<00:00:57.079> on<00:00:57.260> the

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:57.409 
we then make our make our films on the

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:59.770 
we then make our make our films on the
conductive<00:00:57.920> side<00:00:58.219> of<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:58.730> substrate<00:00:59.149> to<00:00:59.629> make

conductive side of the substrate to make
our<00:00:59.960> films<00:01:00.409> we<00:01:00.920> preheat<00:01:01.460> the<00:01:01.640> substrate<00:01:02.149> to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530

approximately<00:01:03.530> 90<00:01:04.100> degrees<00:01:04.399> Celsius<00:01:04.939> and<00:01:05.269> we

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
approximately 90 degrees Celsius and we

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.560 
approximately 90 degrees Celsius and we
then<00:01:06.049> use<00:01:06.350> a<00:01:06.380> syringe<00:01:06.860> to<00:01:07.250> apply<00:01:07.880> a<00:01:07.909> desired

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
then use a syringe to apply a desired

then use a syringe to apply a desired
amount<00:01:08.960> of<00:01:09.350> our<00:01:09.740> suspension<00:01:10.399> to<00:01:11.030> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.380 

the<00:01:19.500> syringe<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:20.160> then<00:01:20.340> be<00:01:20.520> used<00:01:20.550> to<00:01:21.090> spread

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
the syringe can then be used to spread

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.920 
the syringe can then be used to spread
out<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.990> suspension<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:23.640> cover<00:01:23.910> the<00:01:24.600> desired

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:37.730 
out the suspension to cover the desired
area<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.310> substrate

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.830 

you'll<00:01:38.369> see<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.759> we<00:01:38.909> try<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.180> cover<00:01:39.450> about

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
you'll see that we try and cover about

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.289 
you'll see that we try and cover about
one<00:01:40.200> square<00:01:40.680> centimeter<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:41.490> our<00:01:41.909> substrate

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
with the suspension this is to make it

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.139 
with the suspension this is to make it
easy<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.630> use<00:01:45.750> for<00:01:46.290> electrochemistry<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.250> SPV

measurements once we've applied the

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.139 
measurements once we've applied the
suspension<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:51.659> then<00:01:51.869> turn<00:01:52.140> up<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.470> heat<00:01:53.149> to

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
suspension we then turn up the heat to

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.429 
suspension we then turn up the heat to
around<00:01:55.049> 100<00:01:55.619> or<00:01:55.799> 110<00:01:56.610> degrees<00:01:57.060> Celsius<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.869> we

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
around 100 or 110 degrees Celsius and we

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:09.930
