00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.150
hi folks

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.280
this is the first video

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.060
slalom skating tips from

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.550
Night Wolves

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.780
and as our first video

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.150
we decided to talk about

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.540
skater's basic equipment

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.210
of skaters in general

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.810
and slalom skater

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.230
so

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.500
the most important thing

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.650
is the rockerment

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.270
mounting the wheels

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.920
so as you can see here

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.100
this is my skate in line

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.930
the middle wheels are bigger

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.840
than the tips

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.230
this cause an instability in your in line

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.080
that instability that helps

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.760
the skater to do spin and curves

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.530
moviment

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.640
in fact it takes off the estability of your in line

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.950
to your spin movements

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.650
become easier

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.080
so here we have an in line without rockerment

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.060
all the wheels touch the floor

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.650
here there is a smaller

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.250
so the in line stay more firm on the floor

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.060
doesn't allowing spin movements

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.660
the slalom in line

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.680
it's more unstable

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.060
so for who is starting

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.780
watch out the balance

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.760
well

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.340
so how is the rockerment?

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.730
this is an in line

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.970
that i took out the wheels

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.960
to show you

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.790
how we do the rockerment

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.460
well, so far i know

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.510
the standard measure

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.760
people used to say that the difference

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.290
of 4 mm

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.350
i use a huge difference

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.620
in this case as you can see

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.450
the difference is big

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.150
here are used wheels

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.700
so we measure using the eyes

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.440
but when you go to buy the wheels

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.540
you can buy the right measure

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.110
exemple

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.330
80 mm

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.850
76 mm

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.620
you'll have 4 mm of difference

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.900
so i'll put here

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.200
for you look

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.470
always the part spend less

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.910
for inside

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.130
the tendence

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.350
is always spend

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.630
inside the wheels

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.360
trainings right

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.440
the bigger on the middle

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.370
the smaller on the tip

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.070
so here you are folks

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.540
your in line Rockered

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.480
this rockerment is very huge

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.630
for sure it have more than 4mm

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.600
for who is

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.360
starting on slalom 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.710
it's indicated to start

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.770
with a smaller rockerment

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.360
4mm is the smaller

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.700
and then if you want

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.000
increase the difference

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.300
and check what happens

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.560
so guys

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.720
this is the very first video of slalom

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.570
