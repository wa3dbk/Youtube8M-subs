it's been linked with asking for years
and<00:02:49.109> years<00:02:49.169> obviously<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.680> Monaco<00:02:50.069> defensive

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
and years obviously a Monaco defensive

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.280 
and years obviously a Monaco defensive
mid<00:02:50.669> I've<00:02:51.359> only<00:02:51.510> watched<00:02:51.780> him<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.959> few<00:02:52.109> times

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
mid I've only watched him a few times

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.539 
mid I've only watched him a few times
especially<00:02:52.560> when<00:02:52.829> I'm<00:02:53.040> still<00:02:53.220> played<00:02:53.340> against

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.190 
especially when I'm still played against
Monaco<00:02:53.849> but<00:02:54.000> he<00:02:54.120> looked<00:02:54.269> fantastic<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:55.109> I

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
Monaco but he looked fantastic and I

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.349 
Monaco but he looked fantastic and I
think<00:02:55.620> it's<00:02:55.739> a<00:02:55.799> great<00:02:55.980> sign<00:02:56.370> of<00:02:56.489> inter<00:02:56.879> both

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359

let's go Madrid confirm griezmann into
more<00:03:36.780> of<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.900> striker<00:03:37.379> it<00:03:37.590> kind<00:03:37.889> of<00:03:38.010> hasn't<00:03:38.519> made

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
more of a striker it kind of hasn't made

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.189 
more of a striker it kind of hasn't made
as<00:03:38.760> much<00:03:38.879> space<00:03:39.090> for<00:03:39.150> Mandzukic<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:39.930> think

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
as much space for Mandzukic and I think

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:41.750 
as much space for Mandzukic and I think
that<00:03:40.650> they<00:03:40.769> may<00:03:40.949> be<00:03:41.010> bringing<00:03:41.250> in<00:03:41.489> another

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
that they may be bringing in another

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.490 
that they may be bringing in another
striker<00:03:42.060> with<00:03:42.269> that<00:03:42.419> 15<00:03:42.810> million<00:03:43.109> I<00:03:43.229> feel<00:03:43.409> it's

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
striker with that 15 million I feel it's

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.869 
striker with that 15 million I feel it's
a<00:03:43.530> great<00:03:43.739> son<00:03:43.919> in<00:03:44.040> over<00:03:44.159> you<00:03:44.370> they<00:03:44.549> are<00:03:44.699> really

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
a great son in over you they are really

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.429 
a great son in over you they are really
rated<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.540> I<00:03:45.780> think<00:03:45.840> would<00:03:46.049> be<00:03:46.139> a<00:03:46.169> great

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:46.439

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.420 
like I said a bunch of Irish players and
I<00:04:12.599> think<00:04:13.079> for<00:04:13.169> 1.5<00:04:13.680> mil<00:04:13.889> is<00:04:13.979> a<00:04:14.009> good<00:04:14.280> little

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
I think for 1.5 mil is a good little

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.490 
I think for 1.5 mil is a good little
sign<00:04:14.669> in<00:04:14.819> I<00:04:14.909> kind<00:04:15.150> of<00:04:15.209> wrote<00:04:15.359> McLean<00:04:15.689> I<00:04:15.870> never

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
sign in I kind of wrote McLean I never

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.839 
sign in I kind of wrote McLean I never
knew<00:04:16.650> if<00:04:16.769> it's<00:04:16.919> McLean<00:04:17.250> on<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.489> claim<00:04:17.699> but

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849

nonetheless I think it's a good sign up
for<00:04:19.139> 1.5<00:04:19.560> mil<00:04:19.739> could<00:04:19.949> have<00:04:20.039> a<00:04:20.070> good<00:04:20.250> season<00:04:20.430> you

when Fraser Forster was injured they had

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.300 
when Fraser Forster was injured they had
to<00:06:00.750> rely<00:06:00.960> on<00:06:01.020> Kelvin<00:06:01.410> date<00:06:01.560> is<00:06:01.740> it<00:06:01.890> Kelvin<00:06:02.220> or

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
to rely on Kelvin date is it Kelvin or

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.890 
to rely on Kelvin date is it Kelvin or
Kevin<00:06:02.640> Davis<00:06:02.910> they've<00:06:03.060> got<00:06:03.240> one<00:06:03.390> of<00:06:03.540> each<00:06:03.660> I

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
Kevin Davis they've got one of each I

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.380 
Kevin Davis they've got one of each I
think<00:06:04.290> the<00:06:04.350> goalies<00:06:04.680> Kelvin<00:06:05.070> but<00:06:05.250> they<00:06:06.180> had<00:06:06.300> to

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
think the goalies Kelvin but they had to

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.850 
think the goalies Kelvin but they had to
rely<00:06:06.600> on<00:06:06.690> him<00:06:06.840> for<00:06:06.870> a<00:06:07.020> little<00:06:07.110> while<00:06:07.290> I<00:06:07.470> think

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
rely on him for a little while I think

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.200 
rely on him for a little while I think
