ports so we have a plastic cover that

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.629 
ports so we have a plastic cover that
covers<00:01:49.859> them<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:51.409> this<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.469> for<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> display

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:53.639 
covers them and this is for a display

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
and if you look in there you can see

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.539 
and if you look in there you can see
land<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.579> my<00:01:56.880> power<00:01:57.200> some<00:01:58.200> USB<00:01:58.530> ports<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.340> so

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
land is my power some USB ports and so

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.679 
land is my power some USB ports and so
forth<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:00.929> is<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> pure<00:02:01.999> home<00:02:02.999> office<00:02:03.479> or
