of<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:37.950> no<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.219> mean<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.640> I'm<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.030> love<00:00:39.360> a

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
of that no I mean I I'm I love a

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.750 
of that no I mean I I'm I love a
bleached<00:00:39.719> brow<00:00:40.079> like<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.710> can<00:00:40.829> get<00:00:41.010> there<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.309> get

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
bleached brow like I can get there I get

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.729 
bleached brow like I can get there I get
it<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.300> just<00:00:42.450> think<00:00:42.809> for<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.050> regular

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
it but I just think for a regular

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.549 
it but I just think for a regular
everyday<00:00:44.059> look<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.600> keep<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.140> little<00:00:46.170> bit

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
everyday look to keep it a little bit

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.590 
everyday look to keep it a little bit
more<00:00:46.739> natural<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.399> think<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:48.000> better<00:00:48.329> way<00:00:48.539> to

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
more natural I think is a better way to

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.510 
more natural I think is a better way to
go<00:00:48.750> but<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.500> fill<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:50.039> with<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> little

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
go but to fill in with a little

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.520 
go but to fill in with a little
definition<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.420> little<00:00:51.629> bit<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.840> shape<00:00:52.110> can

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
definition a little bit of shape can

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.689 
definition a little bit of shape can
really<00:00:52.770> frames<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.219> whole<00:00:53.340> shape<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.640> your

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
really frames the whole shape of your

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.060 
really frames the whole shape of your
face<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.000> whether<00:00:54.840> you're<00:00:55.079> trying<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.559> thin

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
face so whether you're trying to thin

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.010 
face so whether you're trying to thin
something<00:00:56.610> out<00:00:56.760> or<00:00:57.000> just<00:00:57.030> give<00:00:57.510> yourself<00:00:57.899> a

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
something out or just give yourself a

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.170 
something out or just give yourself a
little<00:00:58.170> bit<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.410> frame<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.789> painter

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
little bit of frame is that that painter

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.479 
little bit of frame is that that painter
background<00:01:00.750> from<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.320> canvas<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.250> flat

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
background from you a canvas a flat

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.060 
background from you a canvas a flat
canvas<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.120> much<00:01:04.019> more<00:01:04.290> challenging<00:01:04.559> than<00:01:05.040> a

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
canvas is much more challenging than a

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.820 
canvas is much more challenging than a
living<00:01:05.549> canvas<00:01:05.820> because<00:01:06.360> there's<00:01:06.780> giving<00:01:07.590> you

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
living canvas because there's giving you

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.420 
living canvas because there's giving you
life<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.210> color<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.500> depth<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.280> you're

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
life and color and depth that you're

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.649 
life and color and depth that you're
working<00:01:11.670> with<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.150> when<00:01:12.240> you're<00:01:12.390> trying<00:01:12.570> to

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
working with and when you're trying to

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.230 
working with and when you're trying to
bring<00:01:13.439> something<00:01:13.710> out<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:13.979> nothing<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.700> much

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
bring something out of nothing it's much

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.190 
bring something out of nothing it's much
more<00:01:15.570> challenging

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
more challenging

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.249 
more challenging
I<00:01:16.320> felt<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:17.189> my<00:01:17.430> makeup<00:01:17.729> artistry<00:01:18.360> was<00:01:18.840> so

much more inspired and I connected so

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.480 
much more inspired and I connected so
much<00:01:21.330> with<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.229> faces<00:01:22.680> once<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.070> took<00:01:23.340> that

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
much with the faces once I took that

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.539 
much with the faces once I took that
painting<00:01:23.970> class<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.600> when<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.320> can<00:01:25.650> get<00:01:26.100> into
