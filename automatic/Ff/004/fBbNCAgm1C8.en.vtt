00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
one this is the variant in case you're

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.990 
one this is the variant in case you're
wondering<00:00:39.170> in<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.260> case<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.710> 12<00:00:41.040> figures<00:00:41.820> for

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
wondering in a case of 12 figures for

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.350 
wondering in a case of 12 figures for
every<00:00:42.300> wave<00:00:43.140> rarities<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.070> M<00:00:44.250> use<00:00:44.550> normal

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
every wave rarities of M use normal

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.020 
every wave rarities of M use normal
universe<00:00:45.660> figures<00:00:46.170> there's<00:00:46.739> 12<00:00:47.010> figures<00:00:47.309> you

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
universe figures there's 12 figures you

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.520 
universe figures there's 12 figures you
get<00:00:48.210> two<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.780> particular<00:00:49.140> wave<00:00:49.320> you're

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
get two for this particular wave you're

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.740 
get two for this particular wave you're
gonna<00:00:49.649> get<00:00:49.829> two<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.280> regular<00:00:50.399> version<00:00:50.750> and

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
gonna get two of the regular version and

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.170 
gonna get two of the regular version and
just<00:00:52.079> one<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:54.320> variants<00:00:55.320> which<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.430> quite

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
just one of the variants which is quite

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.660 
just one of the variants which is quite
normal<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> chase<00:00:58.620> figure<00:00:58.920> but<00:00:59.129> you

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
normal this is a chase figure but you

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.319 
normal this is a chase figure but you
know<00:01:00.199> between<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.410> two<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:02.010> think<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.730> one<00:01:02.969> is

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
know between the two I think this one is

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.420 
know between the two I think this one is
what<00:01:04.019> collectors<00:01:04.409> are<00:01:04.589> gonna<00:01:04.680> be<00:01:04.830> after<00:01:04.979> I

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
what collectors are gonna be after I

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.070 
what collectors are gonna be after I
think<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> better<00:01:06.150> figure<00:01:06.450> amongst<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
think it's the better figure amongst the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.899 
think it's the better figure amongst the
two<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:07.590> you're<00:01:07.710> big<00:01:07.920> diehard<00:01:08.460> spider-man

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
two but if you're big diehard spider-man

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.060 
two but if you're big diehard spider-man
fan<00:01:09.180> I'm<00:01:09.869> pretty<00:01:10.140> sure<00:01:10.260> gonna<00:01:10.439> hunt<00:01:10.590> down<00:01:10.680> both

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
fan I'm pretty sure gonna hunt down both

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.390 
fan I'm pretty sure gonna hunt down both
versions<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.720> by<00:01:13.229> far<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.979> sandman

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
versions and this by far the sandman

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.310 
versions and this by far the sandman
figure<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.560> quite<00:01:16.560> possibly<00:01:17.540> the<00:01:18.540> best<00:01:18.570> figure

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
figure is quite possibly the best figure

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.850 
figure is quite possibly the best figure
in<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.830> entire<00:01:20.220> wave<00:01:21.200> for<00:01:22.200> one<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.590> still

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
in this entire wave for one it still

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.700 
in this entire wave for one it still
retains<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:24.350> relatively<00:01:25.460> old<00:01:26.460> mold<00:01:27.320> in<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.530> it

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
retains a relatively old mold in that it

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.890 
retains a relatively old mold in that it
uses<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.689> absorbing<00:01:30.689> man<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.229> Luke<00:01:31.439> Cage

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
uses the absorbing man the Luke Cage

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.480 
uses the absorbing man the Luke Cage
body<00:01:33.900> mode<00:01:34.200> except<00:01:34.619> for<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.890> arms<00:01:35.009> obviously

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
body mode except for the arms obviously

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.969 
body mode except for the arms obviously
the<00:01:35.970> arms<00:01:36.240> are<00:01:36.420> redecoed<00:01:37.229> because<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
the arms are redecoed because the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.510 
the arms are redecoed because the
original<00:01:38.280> one<00:01:38.369> had<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.549> bicep<00:01:39.409> pivot<00:01:40.409> bicep<00:01:41.400> to

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
original one had a bicep pivot bicep to

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.609 
original one had a bicep pivot bicep to
him<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.880> double-jointed<00:01:42.240> elbows<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:43.049> wrists

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
him and double-jointed elbows and wrists

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.499 
him and double-jointed elbows and wrists
but<00:01:43.740> from<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.579> neck<00:01:44.820> down<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.990> still<00:01:46.320> the

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
but from the neck down it's still the

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.499 
but from the neck down it's still the
Luke<00:01:48.509> Cage<00:01:48.780> absorbing<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.860> mold<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:51.210> head

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
Luke Cage absorbing that mold the head

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.560 
Luke Cage absorbing that mold the head
sculpt<00:01:52.009> I'm<00:01:53.009> not<00:01:53.250> sure<00:01:53.549> but<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.790> kind<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.299> looks

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
sculpt I'm not sure but it kind of looks

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.910 
sculpt I'm not sure but it kind of looks
like<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.899> Norman<00:01:55.320> Osborn<00:01:57.439> mold<00:01:58.439> because<00:01:58.799> of

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
like the Norman Osborn mold because of

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.990 
like the Norman Osborn mold because of
