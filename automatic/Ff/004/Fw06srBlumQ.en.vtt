00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.240
 Hello everyone, jess is another 

00:00:02.269 --> 00:00:07.580
 release of my weekly show 3 in form 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.339
 of this week team of the week 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.299
 actually turned out very bad as 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:13.400
 you saw yourself 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.169
 I normally chose 3 in form of of 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.210
 offered us electronics art 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:19.220
 this time not all three of them turned out to be a form 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.200
 quick solid but all three info 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.210
 still cheap like that 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.910
 composition I played a link to this composition 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.490
 will be in the description for this video 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.890
 generally let's get down to the third 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.950
 the place of my three in form of I set 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.100
 musu sa first of all because i 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.920
 spent 67 damn thousand coins on him 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.730
 I was hoping that I would say you see what 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.350
 he's cool at feet ps 84 85 shouting this 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.640
 very cool dude you can put it 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.550
 a bunch of testes 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.190
 but it turned out no no no and no again 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.579
 the guys actually turned out that he had a punch 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.660
 very peculiar force of impact yes y 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.790
 him 87 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:03.170
 the hit is pretty strong but here's the accuracy 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.030
 hitting him clearly not up to 85 i 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.950
 tell you how I played for him 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.510
 first match in the very first match in 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.840
 the very first attack on the very first 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.909
 I had a great time with me 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.240
 center of the field and scored a goal and then I 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.430
 I thought it was not for nothing that I spent 67,000 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.310
 this inform will come first in 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.950
 my show 3 in form of but no it turned out 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.260
 that guys like guys i'm very 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.409
 I regret that I spent my coins on him 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:34.040
 what can I say ball control 81 from him 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:37.280
 there was a control terrible acceleration 85 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.500
 acceleration 85 maybe he is ok yes 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.170
 not bad accelerated but I would like 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.780
 so that it accelerates faster the impact force 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.409
 as I said, it gave a good choice 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.960
 position 85 till he is always in his place 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.240
 finish young 86 maybe if it 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.700
 put on lcd then it will 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.360
 ok there to finish so to speak 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.750
 complete all attacks but then h gives us 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.390
 without trading 88 for this guy not 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.220
 sure i guys i don't advise you 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.679
 buy if it only falls to you 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.780
 the package can test it 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.270
 you will like it I did not like it 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.520
 me he play 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.470
 on position lv it may be necessary to put 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.630
 his position on lfl etc. 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.580
 in general, such is my verdict 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.220
 guys don't buy it to me he doesn't at all 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.920
 liked 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.350
 in second place I go idris saga about 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.090
 this rival from lily which i 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.280
 put on the central position 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.500
 midfielder first 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.690
 due to the fact that he has a medium high work 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.010
 raid and why he is not my third 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.980
 place and on the second first 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.930
 because it costs 15,000 and now even 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.660
 already cheaper in general will not about him 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.790
 long rant balance 82 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.420
 good balance you are really good 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.680
 opornik he has a good selection of the bed 87 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.380
 i.e. good endurance for 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.050
 opornika and in this feature as well as in 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.910
 past all opornik for some reason they to 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.050
 wait to get the defense so they 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.810
 the result is everywhere 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.020
 which means that stamina is very important for 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.420
 this position in contrast is admissible from khabi 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.920
 alonso who is a very good opornik but 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.410
 he exhales as quickly 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.960
 as much as he is a good opornik good 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.820
 strength blow good tackles good selection 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:22.950
 the ball he has in general intercept him 84 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.690
 tackles yes not very 75 well I donâ€™t know guys 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.820
 I would not tell him very much 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.860
 liked his tackles generally good 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.480
 such an average opornik with which 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.520
 can be bundled with some 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.520
 African defenders how did it 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.290
 I in general like this, he insured me 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.780
 my two defenders who i like 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.700
 you see so-so mediocre me not 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.060
 I liked how they play good 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.800
 opornik in the French league cheap if 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.480
 you put the same in the French league 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.209
 david louise himself who all the time 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.310
 flies off to the attack then this guy is gay 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.410
 he will be his hedge 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.420
 so good solid opornik for their 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.870
 money he works out good interceptions 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.120
 good tackle he has a good choice 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.500
 positions again I say yes he often 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.160
 went ahead but everything seems to me 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.750
 opornik so do in this fifa 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.640
 if you want any 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.230
 African oporniku little human would 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.090
 there you need a sling from you 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:17.440
 french league then gee 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:20.049
 this is the best option for you and finally 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.500
 go to my current favorite 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:26.200
 oddly enough it turned out to be stefano mauri 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.400
 which plays the position of the cp-0 form we 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.670
 made cfd 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.440
 sfpd card that you can say about him well 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.950
 because he has as we see on 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:39.130
 card defending 68 and physics 72 then in 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.350
 center field he clearly does not belong and just 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.450
 the cfd position seems to me the shop stage is 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.360
 it is his position because he has 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.960
 good good field vision less 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.200
 81 fine for quik strong of information 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:56.230
 84 ball control is very good 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.160
 twist 84 short pass and 84 long 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.800
 after 8 st1 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.820
 in general these are all numbers but what can I 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.490
 tell you about him 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.280
 he ohrenitelny on the environment is very 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.620
 cool pass 83 is it really 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.230
 felt if not more 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.810
 Feels like he passed very cool not 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.640
 worse than the same khabi alonso or 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.530
 Nasri because of which I played and I am very 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.660
 like their groove in me he played on 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.810
 cfd position and there was no 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.000
 striker so he gave me 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.820
 very many good passes to the same sol 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.580
 who overwhelmed in general what guys 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.130
 good sap sfpd 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:36.190
 mauri put some over it 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.800
 striker with a good kick and he will 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.470
 you give away a cool groove and you will 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.080
 score will be happy about hitting 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.870
 what can I say 77 basically last for 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.700
 it is a very good blow if what if 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.410
 suddenly the attacker will not be on his 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.190
 positions in principle he can 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.980
 to secure 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.540
 even though he has a small ps but if he 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.490
 suddenly he will be in position 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.970
 center forward then chances are 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.550
 you 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.940
 he will score that's why i put it 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.680
 in first place on my list 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.650
 works out his money plays well 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.950
 on the position which he has marked 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.470
 on the card 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.600
 but that's all that is needed 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.620
 34 years 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.750
 form recipient it seems to me very 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.430
 cool and it deserves guys 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.950
 respect here such turned out 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.780
