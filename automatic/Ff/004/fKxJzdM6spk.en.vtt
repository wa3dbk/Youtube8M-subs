00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
it's a series of different aliens and

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.900 
it's a series of different aliens and
first<00:01:00.030> cheat<00:01:00.629> code<00:01:01.079> won't<00:01:01.829> not<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> cheat<00:01:02.579> code

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
first cheat code won't not a cheat code

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.500 
first cheat code won't not a cheat code
but<00:01:03.239> first<00:01:04.140> cheat<00:01:04.409> code<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:05.010> dark<00:01:05.909> heroes

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
but first cheat code is dark heroes

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.170 
but first cheat code is dark heroes
which<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.990> basically<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.619> skin<00:01:08.220> which<00:01:08.760> turns

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
which is basically a skin which turns

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.429 
which is basically a skin which turns
your<00:01:09.360> characters<00:01:10.140> into<00:01:10.650> vampires<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:12.439> that

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
is cannonbolt

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.870 
is cannonbolt
cannonbolt<00:01:16.640> forearms<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.939> heat<00:01:18.689> blast<00:01:19.880> and

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
cannonbolt forearms and heat blast and

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.460 
cannonbolt forearms and heat blast and
then<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.869> get<00:01:22.020> dark<00:01:22.320> heroes<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.189> then<00:01:24.470> and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
then now the second code is DNA force

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.030 
then now the second code is DNA force
which<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.909> another<00:01:33.240> skin<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.700> that<00:01:35.700> code<00:01:36.180> is

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
which is another skin and that code is

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:46.480 
which is another skin and that code is
