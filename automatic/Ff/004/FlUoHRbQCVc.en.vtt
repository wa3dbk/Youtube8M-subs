00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.230
 dear apple fan readers we were allowed to 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.559
 a look at the new db navigator 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.109
 throw and enjoy a little today 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.390
 advance video offer the developers have 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.609
 your focus on function and 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.439
 easier to access and the 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.689
 to optimize view there is to 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.930
 for example, this new map view what 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.849
 Everybody can see where which 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.669
 keep and can transport these 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.890
 directly in the connection request 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.870
 take over and then for a concrete 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.510
 connection by simply looking here 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.730
 select time and date with 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.760
 when we look for the connection 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.320
 we have the possibility here 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.480
 Restrict traffic or after 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.800
 only to second class to sort and 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.149
 then get similar as in the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.489
 old application all over 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.510
 connections are displayed then we with 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.359
 a click in the detail can see 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.969
 now is the possibility the journey 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.860
 to save once over this little one 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.420
 favorites button top right like us 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.610
 Secondly we can have done that 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.430
 put the whole under my travel 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.670
 if we do that is ours 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.670
 search at another access point 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.070
 namely about favorites and history where 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.530
 We then have the rider places above 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.450
 connections and travel plans and if we 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.100
 now on travel plans have there the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.829
 saved travel plan 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.180
 so the plan of a trip is still a lot 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.729
 easier one can on his 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.710
 connections faster and access 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.290
 You can also book directly here 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.720
 In addition, there is now the possibility 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.640
 to be accompanied at the trip 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.009
 in this overview you can always 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.869
 see when the next train arrive like 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.009
 a lot of time you have to change that 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.740
 of course only works if 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.710
 you are also good on the road 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.700
 made is the indication of 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.159
 departure times at a certain 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.229
 stop this one finds if you in 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.350
 the map is on the way now 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.720
 but open it and then on one 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.220
 corresponding stop clicks how to 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.170
 looks per stop always 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.090
 what is driving there and what is there 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.280
 We always go to the bochum now 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.130
 main station is right here 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.650
 where the bigger event can be seen 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.150
 and now just see those 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.519
 means of transport and then have here 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.680
 the possibility of the window down to 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.810
 pull up and then see everything 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.510
 there drives all the local traffic 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.350
 and also the next departures loud 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.819
 timetable 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.860
 who would like to be here now, for example 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.350
 bochum main station directly everything departure 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.810
 or set arrival and then again 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.819
 we are looking for a connection 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.160
 briefly summarize what 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.049
 The db navigator is really new to you 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.880
 It looks like there's a new design and that 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.260
 software was completely from scratch 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.260
 reprogrammed both the 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.360
 user interface as well as the backend 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.880
 what is behind the user management 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.769
 was also easier to access 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.420
 made some functions earlier 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.000
 just super bad found 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.709
 Also new is the function my journey 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.049
 we just showed you 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.880
 There it then gives up the whole course 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.579
 the map and corresponding 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.100
 Information when the next change 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.140
 the whole thing happens for the apple as well 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.760
 watch available 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.310
 Also new or expanded is the 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.380
 Function favorites and history has there 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.410
 as previously seen the connections 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.750
 and the concrete travel plans the 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.609
 a trip much easier on the 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.590
 then you can all the departure times 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.209
 At a stop see also cars 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.609
 of nimble and bicycles of call a 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.590
 bike are with it the handyticket is 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.660
 still available and can now over 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.280
 a bar at the top faster 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.840
 to be called a pass book 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.510
 There is no connection, however, the 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.880
 reason for that is the really elaborate 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.079
 qr code must be scanned here 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.700
 the developers, however, with apple in the 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.230
 talk if there is something in the near future 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.230
 We do not know what happened yet
