00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.990
 after the match can do which 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.369
 I would like to duplicate weapons 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.470
 let's show you how to get there 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.160
 Produce and multiply objects 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.530
 You can thus very much money 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.360
 can get 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.310
 the whole works with everyone 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.059
 possible stackable 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:38.410
 I'll say things drafts 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:41.190
 weapons torches dietrich media ex so 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.710
 everything you stack is the first 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.390
 the first thing you need is a pile 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.160
 farmer's object of hers as possible 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.440
 I take a lot in my case now 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.820
 the third of them I have 100 pieces me 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.030
 recommend the third too 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.309
 because you use it for a while 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.570
 i can buy very good traders 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.070
 believe 8 dollars 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.070
 look at it for a moment 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.960
 we have determined it at the bottom 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.180
 exactly the trigger 8 dollars the piece 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.060
 So if you buy 1000 pieces of it 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.310
 what would that be the maximum he would be 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.080
 8,000 dollars going on that's not too much 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.479
 or you can of course do it yourself 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.130
 create with the draft of one 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.990
 Metal part will be five animal 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.330
 that too is possible 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.670
 wet here 200 metal parts around 1000 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.250
 I think so too 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.479
 feasible so now but to the actual 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.390
 Knit the first thing you have to do 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.399
 is the old item in my case you the 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.409
 freshness of which you have so much in 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.960
 yours is your safe 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.840
 pack 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.729
 I 'll do it so easy now 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.929
 click once and y under triangle 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.420
 to put them all in there 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.369
 then you have the subject 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.610
 select with the cursor over it 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:58.600
 go and simultaneously press the a and b button 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.190
 or ickx and circle button if you the 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.380
 done correctly then appears 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.509
 just like me, the little one 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.360
 window though the safe already 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.610
 is closed and then you can 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:14.430
 your player hid normally again 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.430
 open with the iks or square button 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.270
 already here you should see immediately 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.819
 that little window again or 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.770
 is still open and you but 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.380
 Nevertheless, your church in the background 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.330
 You can choose to move normally 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.390
 Now next, the item from which 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.209
 you would like to double in my case 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.050
 I suppose now just 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.330
 I'll take that army 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.340
 whisk and press y respectively 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.360
 triangle after that the little one disappears 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.410
 window and the object became 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.900
 according to the number as before 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.550
 Dietrich was or item was in 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.050
 the safe I am demonstrating 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.850
 that a second time in the me 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.580
 now again a and b respectively 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.510
 Nick and circle on the army throwing knife 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.130
 express what I had 100 and 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.430
 now just a draft for 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.510
 duplicate example 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.970
 we'll take what we take now 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.300
 best or no 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.300
 we take 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:19.130
 yes, well the king taker the king and 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:22.520
 we now have 100 of them as well 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.650
 So see, you can do it too 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.950
 whole as I said with stacks 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.120
 the 999 are the faster 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.950
 Of course you can do it all afterwards 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.220
 sell as an example now in 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.800
 Hundred stack king gets her faith 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.080
 I'm around the $ 50,000 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.310
 That's a lot you should do 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.560
 of course always remember that he 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.090
 should keep at least one of them 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.190
 to duplicate it again 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.150
 yes that was already the whole bridge 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.459
 and that fits from my side 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.209
 again from here until next time 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.209
 that I have an abo da 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.230
 you will not find anything better anywhere
