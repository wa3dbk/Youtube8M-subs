flying penguins today I'm going to be
talking<00:00:05.790> about<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.420> new<00:00:06.569> loop<00:00:06.930> interrupt

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
talking about the new loop interrupt

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.120 
talking about the new loop interrupt
block<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:08.099> what<00:00:08.250> it<00:00:08.370> does<00:00:09.920> the<00:00:10.920> loop

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
block and what it does the loop

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.539 
block and what it does the loop
interrupt<00:00:11.639> block<00:00:11.849> only<00:00:12.179> has<00:00:12.389> one<00:00:12.690> setting<00:00:13.549> so

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
interrupt block only has one setting so

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.490 
interrupt block only has one setting so
as<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:15.059> can<00:00:15.179> see<00:00:15.240> this<00:00:15.599> button<00:00:15.839> doesn't<00:00:16.350> do

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
as you can see this button doesn't do

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.370 
as you can see this button doesn't do
anything<00:00:17.010> for<00:00:17.279> on<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.270> top<00:00:18.539> right<00:00:18.900> there<00:00:19.260> is

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
anything for on the top right there is

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.380 
anything for on the top right there is
something<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:20.220> can<00:00:20.400> click<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.240> can

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
something that you can click so you can

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.970 
something that you can click so you can
change<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.840> name<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.260> loop<00:00:22.439> interrupt

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
change the name of the loop interrupt

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.540 
change the name of the loop interrupt
block<00:00:23.990> this<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.199> very<00:00:25.470> useful<00:00:25.949> as<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.220> will<00:00:26.369> show

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
block this is very useful as I will show

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.970 
block this is very useful as I will show
you<00:00:26.609> later<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.019> can<00:00:28.199> name<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.410> pretty<00:00:28.740> much

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
you later so you can name it pretty much

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.950 
you later so you can name it pretty much
anything<00:00:29.279> like<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.179> name<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.330> Bob<00:00:30.660> for

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
anything like you can name a Bob for

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.479 
anything like you can name a Bob for
example<00:00:32.750> okay<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:33.960> now<00:00:34.649> let<00:00:34.950> me<00:00:35.100> show<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.370> a

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
example okay so now let me show you a

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.819 
example okay so now let me show you a
program<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.120> made<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.750> uses<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.380> new<00:00:37.559> loop

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
program I made that uses the new loop

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.369 
program I made that uses the new loop
interrupt<00:00:38.430> block<00:00:38.780> so<00:00:39.780> what<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.170> program

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
interrupt block so what this program

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.400 
interrupt block so what this program
does<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.910> asks<00:00:42.329> if<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.600> left<00:00:42.870> middle<00:00:43.200> or

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
does is it asks if the left middle or

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.190 
does is it asks if the left middle or
right<00:00:43.530> bunny<00:00:43.950> was<00:00:44.190> pushed<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:45.660> left<00:00:45.899> pointer

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
right bunny was pushed the left pointer

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.139 
right bunny was pushed the left pointer
was<00:00:46.320> pushed<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.829> says<00:00:47.070> left<00:00:47.399> if<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> middle

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
was pushed it says left if the middle

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.060 
was pushed it says left if the middle
button<00:00:48.420> was<00:00:48.510> pushed<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.930> says<00:00:49.140> start<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
button was pushed it says start the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.799 
button was pushed it says start the
right<00:00:50.309> button<00:00:50.670> was<00:00:50.820> closed<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.300> says<00:00:51.539> right

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
right button was closed it says right

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.470 
right button was closed it says right
and<00:00:52.079> then<00:00:52.680> after<00:00:53.280> any<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.670> those<00:00:53.789> noises<00:00:54.300> it

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
and then after any of those noises it

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.200 
and then after any of those noises it
stops<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.989> loop<00:00:55.219> it's<00:00:56.219> really<00:00:56.489> easy<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.879> stop

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
stops the loop it's really easy to stop

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.420 
stops the loop it's really easy to stop
the<00:00:57.449> loop<00:00:57.660> because<00:00:58.379> if<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.859> if<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.399> a

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
the loop because if the if you have a

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.209 
the loop because if the if you have a
loop<00:00:59.699> interrupt<00:01:00.270> block<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.440> set<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.010> name

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
loop interrupt block if you set the name

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.670 
loop interrupt block if you set the name
of<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.460> same<00:01:02.760> as<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.329> name<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.049> loop<00:01:04.260> then

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
of the same as the name of the loop then

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.350 
of the same as the name of the loop then
it<00:01:04.830> instantly<00:01:05.280> stops<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.850> loop<00:01:06.030> when<00:01:06.210> that

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
it instantly stops the loop when that

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.870 
it instantly stops the loop when that
block<00:01:06.630> runs<00:01:06.930> let<00:01:07.830> me<00:01:07.950> show<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.520> I'm<00:01:08.580> going

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
block runs let me show you so I'm going

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.929 
block runs let me show you so I'm going
to<00:01:08.909> download<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.570> run<00:01:11.060> now<00:01:12.060> I'm<00:01:12.180> go<00:01:13.790> when<00:01:14.790> this

turns<00:01:15.270> back<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> start<00:01:16.740> button<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.490> means

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
turns back to a start button that means

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.570 
turns back to a start button that means
the<00:01:17.850> program<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.420> finished<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.140> let<00:01:20.009> me<00:01:20.130> press

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.990 
the left button as you could hear it
said<00:01:24.750> left<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.290> then<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.530> program<00:01:25.920> stops<00:01:26.220> now

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
said left and then the program stops now

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.510 
said left and then the program stops now
let<00:01:27.180> me<00:01:27.270> download<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.720> running-mate<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.520> press

the middle button as you get here it

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.760 
the middle button as you get here it
said<00:01:36.000> start<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.570> then<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.020> program<00:01:37.439> stopped

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
said start and then the program stopped

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.350 
said start and then the program stopped
now<00:01:38.549> let<00:01:38.790> me<00:01:38.909> rest<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.750> right<00:01:39.930> button<00:01:44.119> as<00:01:45.119> you

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
now let me rest the right button as you

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.389 
now let me rest the right button as you
could<00:01:45.540> hear<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:46.380> said<00:01:46.710> right<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.130> then<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
could hear it's said right and then the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.539 
could hear it's said right and then the
program<00:01:47.700> stopped<00:01:48.649> so<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.799> program<00:01:50.250> stops

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
program stopped so the program stops

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.240 
program stopped so the program stops
because<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.420> only<00:01:51.780> part<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> program<00:01:53.009> is

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
because the only part of the program is

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.800 
because the only part of the program is
the<00:01:53.430> loop<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.820> then<00:01:53.939> everything<00:01:54.450> inside<00:01:54.750> of

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
the loop and then everything inside of

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.920 
the loop and then everything inside of
the<00:01:55.079> loop<00:01:56.060> thank<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.180> for<00:01:57.390> watching<00:01:57.780> this
