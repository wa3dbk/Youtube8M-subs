00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.899 
going to be well off well I don't think
you<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:30.900> always<00:01:31.320> do<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.650> opposite<00:01:32.070> you'll

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
you can always do the opposite you'll

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.830 
you can always do the opposite you'll
have<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:34.490> difference<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.509> lay<00:01:36.659> the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
have a difference so you have to lay the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.630 
have a difference so you have to lay the
foundation<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.770> be<00:01:37.860> aware<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.220> what

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
foundation you have to be aware of what

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.210 
foundation you have to be aware of what
your<00:01:38.850> personal<00:01:39.240> normal<00:01:39.990> style<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:40.979> also

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
your personal normal style is but also

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.649 
your personal normal style is but also
know<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.700> they're<00:01:42.090> going<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.299> be<00:01:42.390> certain

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
know that they're going to be certain

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.980 
know that they're going to be certain
key<00:01:43.110> really<00:01:43.590> important<00:01:44.070> pots<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:45.780> big

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
key really important pots and the big

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.899 
key really important pots and the big
pots<00:01:46.259> are<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.829> key<00:01:47.009> situations<00:01:47.670> where<00:01:47.850> you

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
pots are the key situations where you

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.609 
pots are the key situations where you
think<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.390> use<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.780> table<00:01:48.960> image<00:01:49.350> to

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
think you can use that table image to

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.840 
think you can use that table image to
your<00:01:49.649> advantage<00:01:49.979> that's<00:01:50.310> when<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.640> need<00:01:50.790> to

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
used to be that way but now they think

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.109 
used to be that way but now they think
they<00:02:04.920> know<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.189> he<00:02:05.280> makes<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.579> few<00:02:05.729> plays<00:02:05.909> but

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
they know that he makes a few plays but

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.219 
they know that he makes a few plays but
they<00:02:06.210> used<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.450> think<00:02:06.630> he<00:02:06.659> was<00:02:06.750> just<00:02:06.869> very

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
they used to think he was just very

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.050 
they used to think he was just very
solid<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:07.890> he<00:02:08.039> had<00:02:08.340> license<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.879> make<00:02:09.030> a

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
solid and so he had license to make a

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.910 
solid and so he had license to make a
lot<00:02:09.209> more<00:02:09.270> plays<00:02:09.599> because<00:02:09.810> they<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.679> know

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
lot more plays because they and you know

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.830 
lot more plays because they and you know
what<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.099> like<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.520> break<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.879> down<00:02:12.000> into<00:02:12.360> your

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
what I like to break it down into your

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
what I like to break it down into your
short-term<00:02:13.200> in<00:02:13.440> your<00:02:13.530> long

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
short-term in your long

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.260 
short-term in your long
I'm<00:02:13.920> image<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.520> can<00:02:14.640> actually<00:02:14.940> break<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.180> down

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
I'm image you can actually break it down

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.310 
I'm image you can actually break it down
more<00:02:15.450> than<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.690> but<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:16.050> gets<00:02:16.200> very

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
more than that but it gets very

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.530 
more than that but it gets very
difficult<00:02:16.830> but<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:17.640> very<00:02:17.820> much<00:02:18.000> have<00:02:18.210> sort<00:02:18.480> of

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
difficult but you very much have sort of

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.180 
difficult but you very much have sort of
a<00:02:18.660> long<00:02:18.960> term<00:02:19.200> like<00:02:19.530> what<00:02:19.680> people<00:02:19.920> think<00:02:20.070> of

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
a long term like what people think of

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.070 
a long term like what people think of
you<00:02:20.250> as<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.550> player<00:02:20.700> overall<00:02:21.120> image<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:21.990> then

same<00:03:20.190> kind<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.489> action<00:03:20.880> so<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.660> but<00:03:22.110> it's

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
same kind of action so it but it's

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.140 
same kind of action so it but it's
volatile<00:03:22.680> too<00:03:22.890> I<00:03:23.100> mean<00:03:23.370> Gavin<00:03:23.820> is<00:03:23.940> going<00:03:24.090> to

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
volatile too I mean Gavin is going to

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.470 
volatile too I mean Gavin is going to
have<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.269> hard<00:03:24.540> time<00:03:25.760> weathering<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:26.940> real<00:03:27.180> long

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
have a hard time weathering a real long

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.300

period<00:03:27.959> of<00:03:28.049> no<00:03:28.230> cards<00:03:28.709> because<00:03:28.890> people<00:03:29.250> are

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
period of no cards because people are

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.490 
period of no cards because people are
looking<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.760> give<00:03:29.910> him<00:03:30.090> action<00:03:30.480> but<00:03:30.750> if<00:03:31.230> he

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
looking to give him action but if he

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.890 
looking to give him action but if he
does<00:03:31.709> catch<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.250> few<00:03:32.430> flops<00:03:32.730> he<00:03:33.360> can<00:03:33.540> get<00:03:33.630> a<00:03:33.690> hold

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
does catch a few flops he can get a hold

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.449 
does catch a few flops he can get a hold
of<00:03:34.019> chips<00:03:34.260> faster<00:03:34.799> than<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:34.980> lot<00:03:35.190> of<00:03:35.310> other

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
of chips faster than a lot of other

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.280 
of chips faster than a lot of other
players<00:03:35.730> so<00:03:36.060> it's<00:03:36.450> kind<00:03:36.660> of<00:03:36.720> feast<00:03:36.900> or<00:03:37.080> famine

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
players so it's kind of feast or famine

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.020 
players so it's kind of feast or famine
maybe<00:03:37.680> with<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:38.040> style<00:03:38.310> whereas<00:03:38.730> like<00:03:38.880> if

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
maybe with that style whereas like if

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.460 
maybe with that style whereas like if
you<00:03:39.120> have<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.330> tight<00:03:39.540> image<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.110> you<00:03:40.440> can

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
you have the tight image and you can

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.590 
you have the tight image and you can
steal<00:03:40.830> some<00:03:41.070> of<00:03:41.100> those<00:03:41.250> key<00:03:41.489> pots<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:41.970> keep<00:03:42.180> you

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.210 
steal some of those key pots to keep you
know<00:03:42.630> your<00:03:42.959> chips<00:03:43.290> kind<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.650> slowly<00:03:43.860> growing

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
know your chips kind of slowly growing

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.039 
know your chips kind of slowly growing
sometimes<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.120> can<00:03:45.269> hang<00:03:45.480> around<00:03:45.600> and<00:03:45.959> win

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
sometimes you can hang around and win

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.330 
sometimes you can hang around and win
