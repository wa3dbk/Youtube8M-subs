or any other applications that make use

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:11.110 
or any other applications that make use
of<00:02:08.689> that<00:02:09.399> but<00:02:10.399> for<00:02:10.519> now<00:02:10.640> we're<00:02:10.819> going<00:02:10.970> to

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
of that but for now we're going to

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.270 
of that but for now we're going to
single<00:02:11.659> player<00:02:11.840> mode<00:02:11.959> with

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
single player mode with

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.059 
single player mode with
do<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.610> quick<00:02:12.819> game<00:02:13.060> so<00:02:13.720> this<00:02:14.560> is<00:02:14.590> quite<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.920> nifty

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
do a quick game so this is quite a nifty

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.920 
do a quick game so this is quite a nifty
thing<00:02:15.370> obviously<00:02:15.490> it's<00:02:15.760> cover<00:02:16.000> flow<00:02:16.270> but

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
thing obviously it's cover flow but

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.270 
thing obviously it's cover flow but
letting<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:17.319> choose<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.740> levels<00:02:18.069> and

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
letting you choose the levels and

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.610 
letting you choose the levels and
obviously<00:02:18.670> from<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.090> left<00:02:19.330> to<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:20.080> right<00:02:20.260> is

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
obviously from the left to the right is

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.460 
obviously from the left to the right is
the<00:02:21.540> difficulty<00:02:22.540> of<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.810> game<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.319> have

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
the difficulty of the game and you have

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.050 
the difficulty of the game and you have
to<00:02:23.590> be<00:02:23.709> bigger<00:02:23.950> more<00:02:24.220> experienced<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.910> go

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
to be bigger more experienced to go

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.910 
to be bigger more experienced to go
further<00:02:25.750> through<00:02:26.110> these<00:02:26.290> obviously<00:02:26.680> as<00:02:26.860> you

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
further through these obviously as you

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.610 
further through these obviously as you
win<00:02:27.220> more<00:02:27.459> and<00:02:27.610> more<00:02:27.730> money<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:29.350> can<00:02:29.470> go

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
win more and more money you can go

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.990 
win more and more money you can go
through<00:02:29.920> this<00:02:30.069> but<00:02:30.310> this<00:02:30.489> I<00:02:30.640> mean<00:02:30.790> this<00:02:30.850> is

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
through this but this I mean this is

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.670 
through this but this I mean this is
just<00:02:31.120> a<00:02:31.360> nifty<00:02:31.660> little<00:02:31.810> way<00:02:32.020> I<00:02:32.290> think<00:02:33.360> of

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
just a nifty little way I think of

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.270 
just a nifty little way I think of
selecting<00:02:35.680> what<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:35.890> want<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.069> do<00:02:36.160> and

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
selecting what you want to do and

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.070 
selecting what you want to do and
obviously<00:02:36.370> Apple<00:02:36.940> kind<00:02:37.480> of<00:02:37.569> really<00:02:37.780> have<00:02:37.930> to

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
obviously Apple kind of really have to

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.420 
obviously Apple kind of really have to
do<00:02:38.170> this<00:02:38.200> because<00:02:38.500> it's<00:02:38.739> their<00:02:38.950> cup<00:02:39.190> of<00:02:39.280> low

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
do this because it's their cup of low

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.690 
do this because it's their cup of low
technology<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:41.069> mean<00:02:42.069> it's<00:02:42.220> quite<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.430> cool

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
technology I mean it's quite a cool

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.790 
technology I mean it's quite a cool
thing<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:42.970> do<00:02:43.180> so<00:02:43.420> let's<00:02:43.660> say<00:02:43.840> went<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.709> the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
thing to do so let's say went to the

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.530 
thing to do so let's say went to the
garage<00:02:44.920> which<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.519> first<00:02:45.700> level<00:02:45.940> you<00:02:46.480> have

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
garage which is the first level you have

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.630 
garage which is the first level you have
no<00:02:46.780> buying<00:02:47.230> tells<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:47.980> all<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.280> information

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
no buying tells you all the information

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.460 
no buying tells you all the information
about<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.150> prize<00:02:49.360> is<00:02:49.570> for<00:02:49.600> a<00:02:49.930> second<00:02:50.260> at<00:02:50.350> third

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
about the prize is for a second at third

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.990 
about the prize is for a second at third
place<00:02:50.769> so<00:02:51.580> we're<00:02:51.760> going<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:51.940> go<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.030> play<00:02:54.000> since

place so we're going to go to play since

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.580 
place so we're going to go to play since
the<00:02:55.120> pause<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.480> game<00:02:55.540> touch<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.260> screen<00:02:56.410> in

the pause the game touch the screen in

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.550 
the pause the game touch the screen in
any<00:02:56.739> two<00:02:56.920> corners<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:57.700> if<00:02:57.819> i<00:02:57.940> do<00:02:58.000> this<00:02:58.560> that

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
any two corners so if i do this that

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.020

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
twenty dollars I shouldn't really done

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.650 
twenty dollars I shouldn't really done
that<00:03:12.190> because<00:03:12.459> only<00:03:12.730> got<00:03:12.880> a<00:03:12.910> six<00:03:13.209> and<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.450> seven

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
but is ok but what is actually pretty

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.600 
but is ok but what is actually pretty
neat<00:03:16.630> about<00:03:16.780> this<00:03:16.930> is<00:03:17.440> if<00:03:17.739> you<00:03:17.860> turn<00:03:18.100> it<00:03:18.280> back

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
neat about this is if you turn it back

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.830 
neat about this is if you turn it back
to<00:03:18.640> portrait<00:03:20.850> it<00:03:21.850> will<00:03:21.970> actually<00:03:22.209> take<00:03:22.510> you<00:03:22.570> to

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.920 
bet hundred dollars so I'll show you
what<00:03:36.549> video<00:03:36.850> so<00:03:37.120> these<00:03:37.239> are<00:03:37.299> actual<00:03:37.750> real

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
what video so these are actual real

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.750 
what video so these are actual real
recordings<00:03:38.440> of<00:03:38.620> obviously<00:03:39.250> actors<00:03:39.610> that

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
recordings of obviously actors that

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.080 
recordings of obviously actors that
Apple<00:03:40.090> paid<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:40.959> do<00:03:41.079> these<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:42.730> can<00:03:42.880> see<00:03:43.060> that

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
Apple paid to do these you can see that

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.670 
Apple paid to do these you can see that
it<00:03:43.390> kind<00:03:43.600> of<00:03:43.660> makes<00:03:43.780> it<00:03:43.930> much<00:03:44.109> more<00:03:44.320> realistic

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
it kind of makes it much more realistic

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.130 
it kind of makes it much more realistic
and<00:03:45.010> interactive<00:03:45.549> as<00:03:45.640> a<00:03:45.670> poker<00:03:45.910> game<00:03:46.060> and<00:03:46.989> if

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
they do do different expressions

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.949 
they do do different expressions
depending<00:03:48.790> on<00:03:49.290> what's<00:03:50.290> going<00:03:50.590> on<00:03:50.680> that<00:03:51.459> guy's

really wow I just got a straight pretty
good<00:04:24.210> I<00:04:24.420> mean<00:04:24.570> that<00:04:24.750> was<00:04:25.910> was<00:04:26.910> pretty

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
good I mean that was was pretty

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.400 
good I mean that was was pretty
impressive<00:04:27.390> so<00:04:27.690> yeah<00:04:27.810> that's<00:04:28.020> that's<00:04:28.260> my

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
impressive so yeah that's that's my

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.490 
impressive so yeah that's that's my
skills<00:04:28.800> of<00:04:29.180> the<00:04:30.180> plane<00:04:30.510> and<00:04:31.110> then<00:04:31.260> that<00:04:31.410> was

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
skills of the plane and then that was

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.840 
skills of the plane and then that was
complete<00:04:31.800> fluke<00:04:32.010> but<00:04:32.070> as<00:04:32.400> you<00:04:32.520> can<00:04:32.580> see<00:04:32.730> how<00:04:32.820> it

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
complete fluke but as you can see how it

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.430 
complete fluke but as you can see how it
makes<00:04:33.270> it<00:04:33.420> a<00:04:33.480> little<00:04:33.570> bit<00:04:33.780> more<00:04:33.900> interactive

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
makes it a little bit more interactive

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.640 
makes it a little bit more interactive
and<00:04:34.670> and<00:04:35.670> I<00:04:35.760> think<00:04:35.940> this<00:04:36.030> is<00:04:36.090> one<00:04:36.360> of<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:37.170> most

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
and and I think this is one of the most

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.170 
and and I think this is one of the most
highly<00:04:37.950> developed<00:04:38.160> games<00:04:38.580> but<00:04:38.850> obviously

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
highly developed games but obviously

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.490 
highly developed games but obviously
it's<00:04:39.330> because<00:04:39.600> it<00:04:39.720> was<00:04:39.810> developed<00:04:39.990> by<00:04:40.200> Apple

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
it's because it was developed by Apple

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.870 
it's because it was developed by Apple
so<00:04:41.010> I'm<00:04:41.100> going<00:04:41.130> to<00:04:41.250> go<00:04:41.400> ahead<00:04:41.430> and<00:04:41.610> give<00:04:41.850> this

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
so I'm going to go ahead and give this

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.320 
so I'm going to go ahead and give this
one<00:04:42.210> a<00:04:42.240> 9<00:04:42.540> out<00:04:42.720> of<00:04:42.750> 10<00:04:43.340> very<00:04:44.340> addictive<00:04:44.820> very
