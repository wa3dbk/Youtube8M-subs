prime<00:00:17.440> beta<00:00:18.070> version<00:00:19.230> since<00:00:20.230> i<00:00:20.800> did<00:00:21.250> the<00:00:21.580> BET

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
prime beta version since i did the BET

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.029 
prime beta version since i did the BET
right<00:00:21.789> fusion<00:00:22.360> beta<00:00:22.539> version<00:00:23.259> i<00:00:23.710> might<00:00:23.949> as

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
right fusion beta version i might as

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.370 
right fusion beta version i might as
well<00:00:24.130> just<00:00:24.429> do<00:00:24.609> prime<00:00:24.970> I<00:00:25.420> mean<00:00:25.960> after<00:00:26.169> all

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
well just do prime I mean after all

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.279 
well just do prime I mean after all
fusion<00:00:27.009> apartment<00:00:27.519> release<00:00:27.789> the<00:00:28.689> same<00:00:28.960> time

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
fusion apartment release the same time

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.980 
fusion apartment release the same time
so<00:00:30.279> I<00:00:30.310> guess<00:00:30.820> it<00:00:30.939> would<00:00:31.060> be<00:00:31.089> fair<00:00:31.390> to<00:00:31.419> do<00:00:31.689> one

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
so I guess it would be fair to do one

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.160 
so I guess it would be fair to do one
for<00:00:32.200> prime<00:00:32.500> now<00:00:33.490> keep<00:00:33.700> in<00:00:33.850> mind<00:00:33.910> that<00:00:34.210> as<00:00:34.480> with
