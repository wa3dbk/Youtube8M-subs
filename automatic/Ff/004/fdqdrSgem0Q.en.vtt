00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 welcome on how do we do 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:07.770
 today I want you to see how 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.480
 make very sausage puff pastries 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.570
 simple and very fast and especially very 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.929
 delicious go it's gone for 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.940
 start taking puff pastry 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.730
 whatever it is or does or you buy 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.529
 in commerce in commerce it is 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.080
 very well I respect it and it can 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.789
 complicate case went there a little 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.880
 little with the frozen water already made I took 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.040
 a little advanced then we take some 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.130
 sausages of strasbourg their like me 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.380
 I take a classic 1.6 that we buy 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.239
 in trade also I'm going to 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.649
 cut in half because otherwise it makes 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.059
 defect was too big that is not 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.730
 necessarily place I'm going to do 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.610
 two it's useless to do more than 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.809
 I make you have 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.770
 but a year ago you can very well 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:58.890
 to make one live then for that 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:06.080
 so we spread quite thinly labat on 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:09.140
 take the small piece of sausage on 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.970
 trace the width 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.960
 it takes almost that we can roll to 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.840
 about three times so it takes concrete 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.549
 go one centimeter of pint 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:31.020
 for the length did the same thing 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:36.869
 with the other one here and then we take a 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:39.020
 egg yolk that we beat and we go 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.020
 come 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:47.340
 gilded the end facing the st just for that 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.049
 we can weld there the paw to the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.899
 finish 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:54.299
 here and finally there is more than rolling 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.610
 so to ride it's simple we take 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.380
 the soci on the role and then everything 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.810
 foolishly 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.290
 here and there we come to the finish and 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.380
 we just stick here he had recruited 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.880
 sausages that is finished 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.010
 there is more than doing the other we do the 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:17.069
 same thing this one the bo is a small 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.800
 little more delicate then made think 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.849
 like that we cut a little bit 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.849
 pass something clean 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:40.500
 here you have more than the golden 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:44.340
 over and towards small drawings 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.700
 so until the little real that's 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.239
 really a type and story to do 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.010
 like paul baker or relapse there you go 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.340
 and here there is more serious is baked 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.430
 for 20 between 20 and 30 minutes and at 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.739
 enjoy hot but I expect you to 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.079
 right now 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:08.360
 and that's the result of a good appetite and 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.360
 soon on how do we do
