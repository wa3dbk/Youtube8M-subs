00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
it's a big clunky gun and I don't really

it's a big clunky gun and I don't really
think<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.120> would<00:00:57.210> want<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.629> wear<00:00:57.750> one<00:00:57.989> on

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
think that I would want to wear one on

my<00:00:58.379> thigh<00:00:58.710> or<00:00:58.739> even<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.219> my<00:00:59.370> rig<00:00:59.579> anywhere

my thigh or even on my rig anywhere

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.959 
my thigh or even on my rig anywhere
because<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:00.930> heavy<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.500> big<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.730> it's

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
because it's just heavy and big and it's

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.369

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
one of those things i don't find is very

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.410

realistic other things that I don't find

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.359 
realistic other things that I don't find
are<00:01:06.570> very<00:01:06.750> realistic<00:01:07.260> alright<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:08.010> amounts

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
are very realistic alright the amounts

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.280 
are very realistic alright the amounts
of<00:01:08.490> damage<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.939> certain<00:01:09.390> guns<00:01:09.630> will<00:01:09.840> do<00:01:10.049> or

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
of damage that certain guns will do or

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.820 
of damage that certain guns will do or

the cyclic rates of certain guns are

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.530 
the cyclic rates of certain guns are
unreasonable<00:01:14.150> it's<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.299> one<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.479> those

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
that it's a it's it's a good way to

good way to learn about you know what

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.300 
good way to learn about you know what
types<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.150> weapons<00:01:24.869> may<00:01:25.049> may<00:01:25.590> be<00:01:25.650> available<00:01:26.189> or

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
what somebody in the gaming design world

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.990 
what somebody in the gaming design world
thinks<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.470> good<00:01:28.710> weapon<00:01:28.890> but<00:01:29.700> again<00:01:29.790> I

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
thinks is a good weapon but again I

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.249 
thinks is a good weapon but again I
don't<00:01:30.270> really<00:01:30.509> think<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:31.020> would<00:01:31.079> be<00:01:31.229> a

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
don't really think that it would be a

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.020 
don't really think that it would be a
great<00:01:31.530> way<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.740> learn<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.340> know<00:01:32.430> what<00:01:32.700> what<00:01:32.939> is

which what I thought was a lot of fun in
the<00:02:00.299> game<00:02:00.450> had<00:02:00.750> some<00:02:01.049> realism<00:02:01.469> but<00:02:01.799> other<00:02:02.399> than

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
the game had some realism but other than

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.969 
the game had some realism but other than
that<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.850> didn't<00:02:03.240> find<00:02:03.590> things<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.649> were<00:02:04.799> that

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
that I didn't find things that were that

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.490 
that I didn't find things that were that
realistic<00:02:05.659> you<00:02:06.659> know<00:02:06.689> one<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:06.930> my<00:02:07.020> one<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.409> my

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
realistic you know one of my one of my

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.900 
realistic you know one of my one of my
favorite<00:02:07.890> guns<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.220> mp5<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.479> really

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
favorite guns is the mp5 and I really

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.540 
favorite guns is the mp5 and I really
find<00:02:10.120> that<00:02:10.330> effective<00:02:10.810> within<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.590> game<00:02:11.800> the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
find that effective within the game the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.740 
find that effective within the game the
coolant<00:02:12.820> commander<00:02:13.210> was<00:02:13.330> another<00:02:13.510> one<00:02:13.720> that

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
coolant commander was another one that

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.170 
coolant commander was another one that
was<00:02:13.960> very<00:02:14.170> effective<00:02:14.710> but<00:02:15.250> again<00:02:15.580> I<00:02:15.610> look<00:02:16.000> at

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
was very effective but again I look at

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.610 
was very effective but again I look at
you<00:02:16.360> know<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.600> type<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:16.810> sighting<00:02:17.260> systems

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
you know the type of sighting systems

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.050 
you know the type of sighting systems
that<00:02:17.740> are<00:02:17.860> available<00:02:17.920> in<00:02:18.460> the<00:02:18.550> game<00:02:18.790> and

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
that are available in the game and

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.690 
that are available in the game and
they're<00:02:19.180> really<00:02:19.420> not<00:02:20.040> realistic<00:02:21.040> as<00:02:21.370> far<00:02:21.580> as

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
they're really not realistic as far as

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.430 
they're really not realistic as far as
what's<00:02:21.910> what's<00:02:22.330> currently<00:02:22.660> available<00:02:22.750> and

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
what's what's currently available and

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.440

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
we're old and that was one of the things

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.880 
we're old and that was one of the things
I<00:02:25.600> really<00:02:25.630> didn't<00:02:26.200> like<00:02:26.230> about<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.680> game
