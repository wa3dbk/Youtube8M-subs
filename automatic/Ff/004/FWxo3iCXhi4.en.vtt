different software but it's the Mac Mini
worth<00:00:37.980> it

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
worth it

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.780

some would say know someone and you

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.630 
some would say know someone and you
could<00:00:41.910> argue<00:00:42.920> rightfully<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.309> no<00:00:44.489> it's

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
could argue rightfully so that no it's

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.569 
could argue rightfully so that no it's
not<00:00:44.760> worth<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.110> if<00:00:46.110> all<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.920> want<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.280> is

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
not worth it if all you want to do is

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.540 
not worth it if all you want to do is
browse<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.149> web<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.480> check<00:00:49.200> email<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.739> play

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550

games and if you want a small form

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.619 
games and if you want a small form
factor<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.280> could<00:00:53.430> probably<00:00:53.730> save<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> little

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
factor you could probably save a little

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.470 
factor you could probably save a little
bit<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.960> money<00:00:55.140> by<00:00:56.129> getting<00:00:56.760> another<00:00:57.090> computer

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.010 
neat and it's as far as Mac's were
concerned<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.520> form<00:02:03.119> factor<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.600> didn't

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
concerned and the form factor I didn't

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.139 
concerned and the form factor I didn't
need<00:02:04.079> much<00:02:04.290> more<00:02:04.530> at<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.979> point<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:05.939> as<00:02:06.060> I

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
need much more at that point and so as I

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.089 
need much more at that point and so as I
started<00:02:06.659> use<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.020> more<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.320> more<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.560> was

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
started use it more and more I was

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.469 
started use it more and more I was
realizing<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.580> doesn't<00:02:08.789> kind<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.119> neat<00:02:09.330> I

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
realizing it doesn't kind of neat I

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.059 
realizing it doesn't kind of neat I
really<00:02:09.869> like<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.140> software<00:02:10.440> I'm<00:02:10.619> finding<00:02:10.950> and

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
really like the software I'm finding and

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.309 
really like the software I'm finding and
it's<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:12.150> software<00:02:12.569> that's<00:02:12.660> available<00:02:12.840> for

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
it's the software that's available for

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.700 
it's the software that's available for
Mac<00:02:13.470> Oh

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
Mac Oh

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.590 
Mac Oh
10<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.310> lot<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.060> free<00:02:15.270> stuff<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:16.880> I<00:02:17.880> was<00:02:18.210> really

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
10 a lot of free stuff I I was really

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.360 
10 a lot of free stuff I I was really
figuring<00:02:19.140> out<00:02:19.230> how<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.440> work<00:02:19.710> it<00:02:19.920> into<00:02:20.160> my

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
figuring out how to work it into my

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.340 
figuring out how to work it into my
normal<00:02:20.820> workflow<00:02:21.210> beyond<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:22.020> know<00:02:22.140> using

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
normal workflow beyond you know using

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.100 
normal workflow beyond you know using
Windows<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:24.000> used<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.510> had<00:02:24.660> that<00:02:24.780> Mac<00:02:24.930> Mini

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
Windows and I used I had that Mac Mini

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.130 
Windows and I used I had that Mac Mini
for<00:02:25.320> a<00:02:25.410> couple<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.190> years<00:02:26.400> really<00:02:27.150> before<00:02:27.870> and

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
for a couple of years really before and

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.100 
for a couple of years really before and
I<00:02:28.170> used<00:02:28.380> it<00:02:28.500> every<00:02:28.740> day<00:02:28.890> before<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:30.300> started<00:02:31.020> to

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
I used it every day before I started to

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.650 
I used it every day before I started to
replace<00:02:31.290> more<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.860> my<00:02:32.100> computers<00:02:32.520> with<00:02:32.760> Mac's

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
replace more of my computers with Mac's

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.570 
replace more of my computers with Mac's
largely<00:02:34.230> because<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.650> experience<00:02:35.100> I<00:02:35.220> had<00:02:35.400> it

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
largely because the experience I had it

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.420 
largely because the experience I had it
was<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.700> really<00:02:36.150> good<00:02:36.630> experience<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:38.370> was

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
was a really good experience and it was

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.760 
was a really good experience and it was
so<00:02:39.230> affordable

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
so affordable

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.520 
so affordable
in<00:02:41.100> terms<00:02:41.490> of<00:02:41.670> Macs<00:02:42.210> some<00:02:43.080> would<00:02:43.170> say<00:02:43.230> it's<00:02:43.410> not

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
in terms of Macs some would say it's not

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.930 
in terms of Macs some would say it's not
affordable<00:02:43.830> in<00:02:43.980> terms<00:02:44.130> of<00:02:44.280> PCs<00:02:44.580> yeah<00:02:44.760> you're

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
it's a good one to go with although now

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000 
it's a good one to go with although now
I<00:03:00.030> would<00:03:00.480> probably<00:03:00.510> say<00:03:01.080> you<00:03:01.470> might<00:03:01.740> consider

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
I would probably say you might consider

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.280

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
that Mac Mini it's like a core duo it's

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.650 
that Mac Mini it's like a core duo it's
not<00:03:28.350> even<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.590> Core<00:03:28.800> 2<00:03:28.830> Duo<00:03:29.300> the<00:03:30.300> one<00:03:30.480> I've<00:03:30.600> got

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
not even a Core 2 Duo the one I've got

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.640 
not even a Core 2 Duo the one I've got
now<00:03:31.050> I<00:03:31.080> think<00:03:31.800> is<00:03:32.070> I<00:03:33.050> think<00:03:34.050> it<00:03:34.140> is<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.320> Core<00:03:34.620> 2

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.570 
now I think is I think it is a Core 2
Duo<00:03:36.020> it's<00:03:37.020> been<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.260> while<00:03:37.440> since<00:03:37.710> I've<00:03:37.890> looked

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
Duo it's been a while since I've looked

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.220 
Duo it's been a while since I've looked
at<00:03:38.700> its<00:03:38.820> innards<00:03:39.150> I<00:03:39.390> mean<00:03:39.570> it<00:03:39.780> works

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
at its innards I mean it works
