00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.850 

we're<00:00:00.120> gonna<00:00:00.210> take<00:00:00.539> a<00:00:00.570> look<00:00:00.930> at<00:00:01.170> some<00:00:01.680> of<00:00:01.709> the

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
we're gonna take a look at some of the

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.970 
we're gonna take a look at some of the
first<00:00:02.100> steps<00:00:02.510> in<00:00:03.510> putting<00:00:04.140> this<00:00:04.290> design<00:00:04.740> to

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
first steps in putting this design to

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.299 
first steps in putting this design to
the<00:00:05.130> ground<00:00:05.839> now<00:00:06.839> this<00:00:07.020> plan<00:00:07.319> was<00:00:07.649> created<00:00:08.130> for

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
the ground now this plan was created for

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.970 
the ground now this plan was created for
a<00:00:08.370> yard<00:00:08.610> with<00:00:08.880> an<00:00:09.000> already<00:00:09.179> existing<00:00:09.710> lawn<00:00:10.710> and

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
a yard with an already existing lawn and

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.549 
a yard with an already existing lawn and
landscape<00:00:11.610> so<00:00:11.940> what<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:12.750> means<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.500> that

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
landscape so what that means is that

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.240 
landscape so what that means is that
we'll<00:00:14.099> have<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.490> cut<00:00:14.700> all<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.000> lawn<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.599> grass

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
we'll have to cut all the lawn and grass

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.400 
we'll have to cut all the lawn and grass
out<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.520> these<00:00:17.730> areas<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.240> make<00:00:18.630> room<00:00:18.930> for<00:00:19.199> our

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
out of these areas to make room for our

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.220 
out of these areas to make room for our
beds<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.189> borders<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.689> few<00:00:21.869> weeks<00:00:22.050> before

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
beds and borders and a few weeks before

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.210 
beds and borders and a few weeks before
we<00:00:22.439> get<00:00:22.710> here<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.310> cut<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.090> out<00:00:24.980> we<00:00:25.980> will

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
we get here to cut this out we will

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.630 
we get here to cut this out we will
spray<00:00:27.060> these<00:00:27.269> areas<00:00:27.720> with<00:00:28.080> an<00:00:28.230> herbicide

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
spray these areas with an herbicide

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.070 
spray these areas with an herbicide
we're<00:00:29.640> gonna<00:00:29.730> be<00:00:29.939> taking<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.359> few<00:00:30.539> inches<00:00:30.750> off

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
we're gonna be taking a few inches off

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.930 
we're gonna be taking a few inches off
the<00:00:31.109> top<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.830> few<00:00:32.610> inches<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.969> soil<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.750> grass

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
the top a few inches of soil and grass

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.299 
the top a few inches of soil and grass
however<00:00:36.020> the<00:00:37.020> roots<00:00:37.230> go<00:00:37.410> much<00:00:37.739> deeper<00:00:37.770> than

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
however the roots go much deeper than

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.430 
however the roots go much deeper than
that<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.820> best<00:00:39.000> way<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.410> address<00:00:40.410> that

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
that and so the best way to address that

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.150 
that and so the best way to address that
would<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.070> be<00:00:41.190> come<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:42.950> spray<00:00:43.950> these

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
would to be come in and spray these

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.130 
would to be come in and spray these
areas<00:00:44.550> with<00:00:45.000> an<00:00:45.149> herbicide<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.809> give<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
areas with an herbicide and give it a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.069 
areas with an herbicide and give it a
few<00:00:46.350> weeks<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.770> work<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:50.460> once<00:00:50.670> we're<00:00:50.850> ready

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
few weeks to work so once we're ready

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.709 
few weeks to work so once we're ready
I'll<00:00:52.079> come<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.879> mark<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.059> entire<00:00:54.149> area

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
I'll come in and mark the entire area

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.799 
I'll come in and mark the entire area
and<00:00:54.870> put<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.320> put<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.039> entire<00:00:56.460> design<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
and put the put the entire design on the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.310 
and put the put the entire design on the
ground<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.620> way<00:00:59.100> we<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.430> see<00:00:59.730> it<00:01:00.320> and

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
ground and that way we can see it and

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.590 
ground and that way we can see it and
make<00:01:02.160> sure<00:01:02.309> it's<00:01:02.489> all<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.820> proportion<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
make sure it's all in proportion and

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.479 
make sure it's all in proportion and
that<00:01:03.660> everything<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.530> where<00:01:04.920> we<00:01:05.100> want<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.430> to

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
that everything is where we want it to

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.140 
that everything is where we want it to
be<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.189> don't<00:01:08.400> want<00:01:08.970> any

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
be and that we don't want any

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.960 
be and that we don't want any
alterations<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.950> then<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.250> also<00:01:11.430> gives<00:01:11.790> us

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
alterations and so then it also gives us

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.090 
alterations and so then it also gives us
a<00:01:12.150> guideline<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.630> follow<00:01:12.810> when<00:01:13.439> we<00:01:13.590> do<00:01:13.770> start

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
a guideline to follow when we do start

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.390 
a guideline to follow when we do start
to<00:01:14.159> take<00:01:14.430> all<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.939> out<00:01:15.770> so<00:01:16.770> once<00:01:17.220> we're

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
to take all of this out so once we're

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.010 
to take all of this out so once we're
happy<00:01:17.549> with<00:01:17.850> everything<00:01:18.180> we'll<00:01:18.570> bring<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.930> a

smaller ones because you'll be tempted

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.679 
smaller ones because you'll be tempted
to<00:01:56.340> get<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> smaller<00:01:56.909> one<00:01:57.000> because<00:01:57.390> they<00:01:57.540> are

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
to get a smaller one because they are

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.039 
to get a smaller one because they are
lighter<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.850> smaller<00:01:59.850> but<00:02:00.450> just<00:02:00.750> for<00:02:00.899> that

lighter and smaller but just for that

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.590 
lighter and smaller but just for that
same<00:02:01.320> reason<00:02:01.890> they<00:02:02.310> don't<00:02:02.460> work<00:02:02.759> well<00:02:03.060> they

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
same reason they don't work well they

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.179 
same reason they don't work well they
don't<00:02:03.750> get<00:02:03.990> any<00:02:04.140> traction<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.890> what'll

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
don't get any traction and what'll

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.500 
get the larger sod cutter if you have
the<00:02:30.989> opportunity<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:32.640> in<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:32.910> picture<00:02:33.150> what

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
the opportunity so in this picture what

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.809 
the opportunity so in this picture what
we're<00:02:33.660> doing<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.080> just<00:02:34.470> cutting<00:02:35.250> along<00:02:35.580> the

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
we're doing is just cutting along the

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.880 
we're doing is just cutting along the
line<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.600> I<00:02:36.630> have<00:02:36.750> marked<00:02:37.410> out<00:02:39.769> and<00:02:40.769> what

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
line that I have marked out and what

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.289 
line that I have marked out and what
we'll<00:02:41.010> do<00:02:41.130> is<00:02:41.280> we'll<00:02:41.430> come<00:02:41.489> along<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.150> just

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
we'll do is we'll come along and just

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.509 
we'll do is we'll come along and just
mark<00:02:42.750> this<00:02:42.900> entire<00:02:43.260> border<00:02:43.680> area<00:02:44.040> out<00:02:44.160> first

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
mark this entire border area out first

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.449 
mark this entire border area out first
and<00:02:44.849> then<00:02:45.569> we'll<00:02:46.230> cut<00:02:46.440> as<00:02:46.590> much<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:47.099> the

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
and then we'll cut as much of the

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.690 
and then we'll cut as much of the
interior<00:02:48.030> as<00:02:48.390> we<00:02:48.660> can<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.380> then<00:02:50.220> of<00:02:50.430> course

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
interior as we can and then of course

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.699 
interior as we can and then of course
they'll<00:02:51.060> be<00:02:51.120> corners<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:52.049> such<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.500> you'll

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
they'll be corners and such that you'll

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.560 
they'll be corners and such that you'll
have<00:02:52.859> you'll<00:02:53.010> have<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.190> little<00:02:53.400> bit<00:02:53.519> of<00:02:53.670> cleanup

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
have you'll have a little bit of cleanup

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.210 
have you'll have a little bit of cleanup
to<00:02:54.930> do<00:02:55.079> but<00:02:55.350> but<00:02:55.620> not<00:02:55.829> much<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:58.260> once<00:02:58.769> we've<00:02:59.010> cut

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
to do but but not much so once we've cut

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.509 
to do but but not much so once we've cut
all<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.459> that<00:02:59.609> out<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:01.019> sod<00:03:01.260> simply<00:03:01.799> rolls<00:03:02.280> up

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
all of that out the sod simply rolls up

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.970 
all of that out the sod simply rolls up
in<00:03:02.730> strips<00:03:03.390> like<00:03:03.660> this<00:03:03.720> which<00:03:04.560> makes<00:03:04.799> it

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
in strips like this which makes it

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.550 
in strips like this which makes it
really<00:03:05.010> easy<00:03:05.310> work<00:03:05.850> now<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.329> want<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:07.380> have<00:03:07.530> a

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
really easy work now you want to have a

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.599 
really easy work now you want to have a
little<00:03:07.799> bit<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.130> moisture<00:03:08.459> in<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:08.910> soil<00:03:10.609> that

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
little bit of moisture in the soil that

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.640 
little bit of moisture in the soil that
makes<00:03:11.850> it<00:03:12.000> hold<00:03:12.209> together<00:03:12.390> better<00:03:12.840> if<00:03:13.500> the

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
makes it hold together better if the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.530 
makes it hold together better if the
soil<00:03:13.890> is<00:03:14.010> completely<00:03:14.280> dry<00:03:14.760> everything<00:03:15.209> just

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
soil is completely dry everything just

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.870 
soil is completely dry everything just
crumbles<00:03:16.049> and<00:03:16.319> you'll<00:03:16.650> end<00:03:16.859> up<00:03:17.010> more<00:03:17.579> or<00:03:17.730> less

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
crumbles and you'll end up more or less

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.759 
crumbles and you'll end up more or less
just<00:03:17.910> having<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.510> shovel<00:03:18.780> all<00:03:19.109> of<00:03:19.290> this<00:03:19.500> out<00:03:19.739> of

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
just having to shovel all of this out of

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.759 
just having to shovel all of this out of
here<00:03:20.100> but<00:03:20.310> if<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:21.600> have<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.319> little<00:03:22.560> bit<00:03:22.680> of

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
here but if you have a little bit of

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.500 
here but if you have a little bit of
moisture<00:03:22.920> in<00:03:23.280> in<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.670> soil<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.150> not<00:03:24.209> too

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
moisture in in the soil and not too

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.710 
moisture in in the soil and not too
soggy<00:03:24.810> you<00:03:24.989> don't<00:03:25.290> want<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.560> soggy<00:03:26.569> it'll<00:03:27.569> roll

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
soggy you don't want a soggy it'll roll

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.960 
soggy you don't want a soggy it'll roll
up<00:03:27.900> in<00:03:28.079> strips<00:03:28.440> like<00:03:28.680> this<00:03:28.739> and<00:03:29.190> then<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.819> can

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
up in strips like this and then you can

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.500 
up in strips like this and then you can
simply<00:03:30.620> roll<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.650> up<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.190> haul<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:32.970> away<00:03:33.180> or

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
simply roll it up and haul it away or

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.809 
simply roll it up and haul it away or
make<00:03:34.139> compost<00:03:34.650> out<00:03:34.859> of<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.160> or<00:03:37.609> do<00:03:38.609> whatever

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
make compost out of it or do whatever

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.870 
make compost out of it or do whatever
anyway<00:03:39.810> so<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.769> sock<00:03:40.950> cutters<00:03:41.250> have<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.459> have<00:03:41.850> a

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
anyway so the sock cutters have a have a

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.680 
anyway so the sock cutters have a have a
variable<00:03:42.600> cut<00:03:42.959> depth<00:03:43.260> generally<00:03:43.980> from<00:03:44.940> one<00:03:45.510> to

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
variable cut depth generally from one to
