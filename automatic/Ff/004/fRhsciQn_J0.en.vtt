00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.970
 today it's just a 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.860
 good news that concerns the book the 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.910
 strike of which I have already spoken to you 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.289
 abundantly on and well my blog of 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.390

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.460
 youtube channel in and in my emails 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.820
 for those who subscribe to the mailing 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.740
 list 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.480
 so I'll make you quick recap 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.580
 for those who do not know this book 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.710
 so the book the demands strike 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.480
 also known as rebellion 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.730
 of atlas which was the title of the edition 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.530
 hackers who went out in 2009 is also 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.440
 known as its original name 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.899
 which is atlas shrugged so who wants 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.239
 to say atlas ca it's like that 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.800
 the shoulders so in fact this book is 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.930
 released in the 50s 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.870
 and it's a book that has an influence 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.210
 huge in the united states 1 it's the book 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.620
 which was the most read in the United States 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.960
 after the Bible it is estimated that roughly 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.340
 10% of Americans who have not read what he 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.079
 still makes more than 30 million 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.329
 people and it's a book that has 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.550
 inspired perhaps thousands of 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.989
 million entrepreneurs both at 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.240
 united states and the world 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.180
 among known buyers who have been 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.189
 very influenced by this book there is steve 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.470
 jobs there is downright the confusing 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.670
 of apple steve wozniak who explained it 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.049
 in an interview I think it was 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.909
 for business or something like that 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.830
 than before creating apple 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.290
 it was his bedside book actually 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.080
 steve jobs the strike has finally revolt 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.850
 atlas and that he was particularly very 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.430
 inspired by one of the characters in the novel 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.100
 who's going and giving back and that's 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.500
 inspired him to be not become great 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.970
 entrepreneurs that they were there was 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.110
 other very well known entrepreneurs then 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.310
 someone who knew maybe 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.010
 less but who is very well known to 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.990
 united states it is peter diamond of 10 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.860
 especially the author of the book gives up 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.290
 his who created the x prize the x prize which 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.080
 was the first prize in the 90s 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.030
 gave a reward for the first 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.300
 company that would happen to bring three 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.530
 people in the water space with a 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.600
 private means it's virgin galactic 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.800
 Richard Branson who won this award 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.160
 and since then they have made lots of others 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.660
 prize they made the x prize for the 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
 first sort of hour body ie 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.330
 the first device that will be able to 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.170
 detect a whole lot of diseases from 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.580
 automatic way 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.470
 there they make an x files for 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.430
 revolutionize the education of children 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.050
 in poor countries 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.640
 in short he created this foundation which is 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.910
 gained tremendous success and he too 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.370
 been very influenced by so the strike 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.900
 delman and it's a book in the 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.210
 French translation is a story 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.400
 awful in the 50s ago 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.860
 a Swiss publisher who started doing 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.510
 the French translation and in fact 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.160
 she herself who said perfectly the 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.180
 French has repudiated translations into 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.650
 saying it was a translation 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.390
 completely null of his work 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.860
 and anyway in addition the work was 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.450
 not sold well and the publisher did 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.920
 bankruptcy and suddenly he saw that I believe 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.380
 a third or two thirds of the supply that has 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.480
 been translated into French and for more 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.420
 of 50 years there has not been a single 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.430
 French translation that was made of 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.959
 this book while he had an influence 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.280
 huge both in the united states but 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.420
 also in canada in britain in 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.290
 all Anglo-Saxon countries and in 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.650
 other countries too 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.680
 and so there is a woman who has 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.880
 insurgent against that in the 2000s 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.260
 who said it was completely 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.500
 inadmissible because the case with a book 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.970
 as monumental as gigantic too 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.709
 deeply impacting that revolt 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.750
 atlas can not be translated into 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.390
 French and who put himself alone in 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.739
 his corner to translate this book which is 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.300
 huge so unfortunately I have 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.890
 searched for my paper copy to make 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.510
 this video but I find more I believe 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.769
 that I will still lend to someone and 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.060
 I remember that it was I 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.290
 think about you already happened to lend 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.180
 a book someone and makes you more 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.709
 you remember good at least it goes around 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.790
 it's cool but it's a book that's 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.340
 still pretty big he has to do at 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.459
 less than several hundred pages 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.140
 easily a thousand pages and it's a novel 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.420
 I assure you it's not a book 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.250
 super annoying that it reads like a 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.810
 story because it is one and 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.320
 so began to translate that on his 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.519
 free time 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.530
 what to do a pirate edition without 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.000
 request the consent of the rights holders and 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.830
 which was released in 2009 pdf 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.730
 so it's nice to revolt atlas but this 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.290
 she did not know it's just that we 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.510
 same time she was doing that there was 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.130
 so well publishers 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.140
 French who had made contact with 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.580
 the rights holders in the United States who 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.270
 had obtained the agreement and they were 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.310
 doing a translation 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.120
 official so the book came out in 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.530
 2011 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.240
 officially in French under the title 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.260
 not terrible the strike must be 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.620
 to admit that the title has not and not 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.240
 awesome and from then on it was actually 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.269
 only available in paper format 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.280
 and the good news since I come from 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.710
 see that it came out also in the format 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.630
 kindle so the kindle is this little 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.950
 amazon device that allows you to read 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.150
 books in digital format and the 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.410
 read in full sun thanks to inked 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.530
 electronic but it also allows you 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.010
 to read books on your ipad your 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.990
 your tablet your smartphone 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.910
 and then on your computer also a 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.070
 mac pc you can download the 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.660
 amazon reader for free on amazon 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.060

 to read books for free on all

 the devices you want you 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.030
 do not even need to have kindle 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.620
 so this is a great news the book 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.930
 came out in kindle format plus it 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.560
 is much cheaper than the version 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.000
 paper 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.590
 so me what I encourage you to 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.060
 do it really is a book I think 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.979
 that all entrepreneurs should 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.830
 read we may not agree with 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.970
 the book theory but he finds me 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.860
 personally this book a little too much 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.660
 extreme but it's still a book 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.770
 that carry a lot of ideas that are 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.060
 extremely important for 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.160
 entrepreneurs and besides that's it's 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.960
 tell in the form of a novel and that's 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.790
 it's easy to read 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.080
 I do not hide from you that the first 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.340
 pages of the first tens of pages 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.750
 are a little bit difficult as 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.620
 many novels you have to when 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.690
 even give yourself time to go back 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.360
 in but after that it's all right so 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.010
 do I trust you I know I have 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.380
 already read a lot of books that I 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.060
 spoken here in this chain or on my 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.680

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.830
