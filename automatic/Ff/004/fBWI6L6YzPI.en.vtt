00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.940 

if<00:00:21.820> I<00:00:21.940> had<00:00:22.060> to<00:00:22.150> rank<00:00:22.360> the<00:00:22.630> best<00:00:22.930> control<00:00:23.500> setups

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
if I had to rank the best control setups

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.280 
if I had to rank the best control setups
for<00:00:24.160> a<00:00:24.220> first-person<00:00:24.700> shooter<00:00:24.970> this<00:00:25.869> damn

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.290 
for a first-person shooter this damn

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.320 
for a first-person shooter this damn
thing<00:00:26.619> wouldn't<00:00:26.800> even<00:00:26.980> make<00:00:27.250> the<00:00:27.369> list<00:00:27.400> now

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
thing wouldn't even make the list now

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.420 
thing wouldn't even make the list now
for<00:00:28.660> me<00:00:28.779> the<00:00:28.930> best<00:00:29.170> way<00:00:29.410> to<00:00:29.439> control<00:00:29.890> a<00:00:29.920> shooter

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
for me the best way to control a shooter

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.490 
for me the best way to control a shooter
is<00:00:30.670> with<00:00:31.119> something<00:00:31.420> like<00:00:31.570> the<00:00:31.689> Wii<00:00:31.900> Remote<00:00:32.290> or

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
is with something like the Wii Remote or

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.410 
is with something like the Wii Remote or
PlayStation<00:00:33.280> Move<00:00:33.489> that<00:00:34.000> way<00:00:34.120> you<00:00:34.180> get<00:00:34.360> the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
PlayStation Move that way you get the

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.540 
PlayStation Move that way you get the
accuracy<00:00:35.170> of<00:00:35.260> a<00:00:35.350> pointer<00:00:35.800> with<00:00:36.309> the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
accuracy of a pointer with the

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.820 
accuracy of a pointer with the
maneuverability<00:00:37.390> of<00:00:37.420> an<00:00:37.600> analog<00:00:37.930> stick<00:00:38.290> of

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
maneuverability of an analog stick of

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:39.810 
maneuverability of an analog stick of
course<00:00:39.040> if<00:00:39.190> you're<00:00:39.309> good<00:00:39.489> at<00:00:39.580> maneuvering

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
course if you're good at maneuvering

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.910 
course if you're good at maneuvering
with<00:00:40.120> a<00:00:40.180> keyboard<00:00:40.690> a<00:00:40.900> simple<00:00:41.230> Mouse<00:00:41.410> can't<00:00:41.800> be

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
with a keyboard a simple Mouse can't be

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.590 
with a keyboard a simple Mouse can't be
beat<00:00:42.160> but<00:00:42.640> you<00:00:42.970> know<00:00:43.090> what<00:00:43.239> else<00:00:43.390> would<00:00:43.540> make

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
beat but you know what else would make

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
for first-person shooters it just didn't

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.380 
for first-person shooters it just didn't
have<00:00:53.530> many<00:00:53.829> first-person<00:00:54.579> shooters<00:00:54.940> for<00:00:55.239> this

duty world at war just maybe ice your
palms<00:01:06.100> after<00:01:06.729> playing

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.790 

now<00:01:22.310> on<00:01:22.700> its<00:01:22.880> own<00:01:23.030> world<00:01:23.540> at<00:01:23.720> war<00:01:23.990> is<00:01:24.020> just<00:01:24.530> an

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
now on its own world at war is just an

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.250 
now on its own world at war is just an
inherently<00:01:25.490> good<00:01:25.820> handheld<00:01:26.390> shooter<00:01:26.780> but<00:01:27.140> the

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
inherently good handheld shooter but the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.990 
inherently good handheld shooter but the
thing<00:01:27.440> that<00:01:27.620> really<00:01:27.770> makes<00:01:28.040> it<00:01:28.159> stand<00:01:28.520> out<00:01:28.760> on

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
thing that really makes it stand out on

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.170 
thing that really makes it stand out on
the<00:01:29.090> DS<00:01:29.300> is<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:30.560> DES<00:01:30.800> itself<00:01:31.430> playing<00:01:32.060> this

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
the DS is the DES itself playing this

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.210 
the DS is the DES itself playing this
game<00:01:32.390> with<00:01:32.600> touch<00:01:32.869> just<00:01:33.409> makes<00:01:33.800> all<00:01:34.010> the

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
game with touch just makes all the

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.830 
game with touch just makes all the
difference<00:01:34.340> in<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.820> world<00:01:35.000> you<00:01:35.270> can<00:01:35.570> get<00:01:35.690> your

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
difference in the world you can get your

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.930 
difference in the world you can get your
aim<00:01:36.050> down<00:01:36.409> to<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.680> pixel<00:01:37.190> and<00:01:37.400> not<00:01:37.700> only<00:01:37.820> that

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
aim down to the pixel and not only that

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.830 
aim down to the pixel and not only that
it's<00:01:38.720> also<00:01:38.869> faster<00:01:39.680> than<00:01:40.210> fumbling<00:01:41.210> with<00:01:41.360> dual

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
it's also faster than fumbling with dual

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.780 
it's also faster than fumbling with dual
thumb<00:01:42.140> sticks<00:01:42.530> it's<00:01:42.950> really<00:01:43.160> an<00:01:43.250> example<00:01:43.550> of

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
thumb sticks it's really an example of

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.180 
thumb sticks it's really an example of
game<00:01:44.090> design<00:01:44.479> totally<00:01:45.350> benefiting<00:01:45.979> from

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
game design totally benefiting from

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.609 
game design totally benefiting from
hardware<00:01:46.729> design<00:01:47.090> much<00:01:47.869> to<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.229> dismay<00:01:48.409> of

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
hardware design much to the dismay of

00:01:48.619 --> 00:02:00.710 
hardware design much to the dismay of
these<00:01:48.920> poor<00:01:49.280> mofos

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.830 

so<00:02:01.470> the<00:02:01.860> touchscreen<00:02:02.340> changes<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> lot<00:02:03.510> about

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
so the touchscreen changes a lot about

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.810 
so the touchscreen changes a lot about
call<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.140> duty<00:02:04.590> some<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.220> its<00:02:05.340> for<00:02:05.550> the<00:02:05.580> better

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
call of duty some of its for the better

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.390 
call of duty some of its for the better
like<00:02:06.090> aiming<00:02:06.600> with<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.840> stylus<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:08.010> lot<00:02:08.250> of

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:08.400 
like aiming with the stylus but a lot of

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.910 
like aiming with the stylus but a lot of
its<00:02:08.550> more<00:02:09.450> subjective<00:02:10.200> one<00:02:10.740> of<00:02:10.830> the

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
its more subjective one of the

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.740 
its more subjective one of the
interesting<00:02:11.370> things<00:02:11.610> about<00:02:11.730> world<00:02:12.180> at<00:02:12.360> war<00:02:12.540> on

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
interesting things about world at war on

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.080 
interesting things about world at war on
the<00:02:12.870> DS<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.530> that<00:02:13.740> it<00:02:14.190> doesn't<00:02:14.550> just<00:02:14.580> do<00:02:14.820> touch

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
the DS is that it doesn't just do touch

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.000 
the DS is that it doesn't just do touch
aiming<00:02:15.600> it<00:02:15.810> pushes<00:02:16.140> touch<00:02:16.380> throughout<00:02:16.830> the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
aiming it pushes touch throughout the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.190 
aiming it pushes touch throughout the
experience<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:17.790> not<00:02:18.390> all<00:02:18.630> of<00:02:18.660> those<00:02:18.930> ideas

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
experience and not all of those ideas

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.860 
experience and not all of those ideas
hit<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.800> target<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.490> ships<00:02:20.880> are<00:02:21.120> fiery<00:02:21.420> data

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
hit the target the ships are fiery data

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.690 
hit the target the ships are fiery data
take<00:02:22.590> them<00:02:22.800> out<00:02:23.010> cool

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.950 

if<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:28.970> want<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.210> see<00:02:29.360> what<00:02:29.480> I'm<00:02:29.570> talking

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
if you want to see what I'm talking

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.630 
if you want to see what I'm talking
about<00:02:30.200> look<00:02:30.680> no<00:02:30.890> further<00:02:31.100> than<00:02:31.430> the

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
about look no further than the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.850 
about look no further than the
touchscreen<00:02:32.090> display<00:02:32.810> this<00:02:33.290> is<00:02:33.470> really<00:02:33.710> where

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
touchscreen display this is really where

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.560 
touchscreen display this is really where
all<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.100> action<00:02:34.430> takes<00:02:34.460> place<00:02:34.970> in<00:02:35.210> terms<00:02:35.390> of

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
all the action takes place in terms of

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.780 
all the action takes place in terms of
control<00:02:36.020> you<00:02:36.380> have<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.590> big<00:02:36.770> open<00:02:37.190> area<00:02:37.340> which

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
control you have a big open area which

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.520

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
lots of little touch minigames you might

lots of little touch minigames you might
have<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.120> defuse<00:03:08.600> a<00:03:08.630> bomb<00:03:08.930> or<00:03:09.320> use<00:03:09.800> Morse<00:03:10.190> code

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
and this stuff's actually kind of fun

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.780 
and this stuff's actually kind of fun
the<00:03:12.290> first<00:03:12.470> time<00:03:12.650> around<00:03:12.800> but<00:03:13.460> after

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
the first time around but after

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.600 
the first time around but after
repeating<00:03:14.570> them<00:03:14.750> it<00:03:15.500> feels<00:03:15.740> more<00:03:16.070> gimmicky

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
repeating them it feels more gimmicky

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.490 
repeating them it feels more gimmicky
than<00:03:16.790> fun<00:03:17.090> but<00:03:17.480> again<00:03:17.720> for<00:03:18.110> better<00:03:18.290> or<00:03:18.470> worse

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
than fun but again for better or worse

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.430 
than fun but again for better or worse
that<00:03:19.340> stuff<00:03:19.610> at<00:03:19.730> least<00:03:19.970> gives<00:03:20.240> this

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
that stuff at least gives this

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.840 
that stuff at least gives this
multi-platform<00:03:21.440> game<00:03:21.710> its<00:03:22.160> own<00:03:22.310> distinct

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
feel on the Nintendo DS now the gameplay

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.880 
feel on the Nintendo DS now the gameplay
is<00:03:26.210> pretty<00:03:26.510> much<00:03:26.690> what<00:03:26.930> you'd<00:03:27.080> expect<00:03:27.200> but

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
is pretty much what you'd expect but

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.550 
is pretty much what you'd expect but
given<00:03:28.850> the<00:03:29.000> hardware's<00:03:29.390> limitations<00:03:30.080> it

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
given the hardware's limitations it

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.920 
given the hardware's limitations it
almost<00:03:30.830> has<00:03:31.070> a<00:03:31.100> gallery<00:03:31.700> shooter<00:03:32.360> feel<00:03:32.630> at

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
almost has a gallery shooter feel at

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.840 
almost has a gallery shooter feel at
times<00:03:33.230> like<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:34.130> bad<00:03:34.280> guys<00:03:34.490> aren't<00:03:34.730> very

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
times like the bad guys aren't very

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.870 
times like the bad guys aren't very
mobile<00:03:35.390> they<00:03:35.660> mostly<00:03:35.990> just<00:03:36.080> pop<00:03:37.010> up<00:03:37.250> like

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
mobile they mostly just pop up like

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.060 
mobile they mostly just pop up like
cutouts<00:03:38.360> but<00:03:38.870> it's<00:03:38.990> still<00:03:39.140> fun<00:03:39.470> and<00:03:39.680> for<00:03:39.950> what

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
cutouts but it's still fun and for what

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.260 
cutouts but it's still fun and for what
it's<00:03:40.220> worth<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.910> game<00:03:41.060> is<00:03:41.150> actually

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
it's worth the game is actually

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.510 
it's worth the game is actually
impressive<00:03:41.990> on<00:03:42.110> the<00:03:42.200> DS<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.770> environments

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
impressive on the DS the environments

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.280 
impressive on the DS the environments
are<00:03:43.610> really<00:03:43.850> big<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.300> the<00:03:44.780> graphics<00:03:45.140> are

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
are really big and the graphics are

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:56.809 
are really big and the graphics are
surprisingly<00:03:45.830> good<00:03:45.980> given<00:03:46.490> the<00:03:46.550> platform

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.130 

I<00:03:58.969> realize<00:03:59.969> it<00:04:00.420> might<00:04:00.569> not<00:04:00.750> look<00:04:00.900> all<00:04:01.109> that

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
I realize it might not look all that

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.679 
I realize it might not look all that
great<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:01.920> maybe<00:04:02.790> I'm<00:04:02.939> kind<00:04:03.150> of<00:04:03.180> gushing<00:04:03.599> a

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:03.689 
great and maybe I'm kind of gushing a

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:05.839 
great and maybe I'm kind of gushing a
bit<00:04:03.870> but<00:04:04.260> I'm<00:04:04.349> just<00:04:04.500> so<00:04:05.010> interested<00:04:05.670> in<00:04:05.700> the

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
bit but I'm just so interested in the

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.660 
bit but I'm just so interested in the
idea<00:04:06.180> of<00:04:06.480> improving<00:04:06.840> game<00:04:07.650> control<00:04:08.189> not<00:04:08.640> just

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
idea of improving game control not just

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.940 
idea of improving game control not just
changing<00:04:09.390> it<00:04:09.540> to<00:04:09.689> be<00:04:09.810> different<00:04:10.319> but<00:04:10.620> actually

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
changing it to be different but actually

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.190 
changing it to be different but actually
making<00:04:11.459> it<00:04:11.670> better<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.329> lot<00:04:12.750> of<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.959> things

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
making it better a lot of the things

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.259 
making it better a lot of the things
about<00:04:13.379> the<00:04:13.680> D<00:04:13.890> s<00:04:14.069> and<00:04:14.549> the<00:04:14.700> we-we're<00:04:15.239> just

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
about the D s and the we-we're just

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.270 
about the D s and the we-we're just
gimmicky<00:04:16.079> changes<00:04:16.590> just<00:04:16.829> to<00:04:16.979> be<00:04:17.100> different

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
gimmicky changes just to be different

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.180 
gimmicky changes just to be different
but<00:04:17.940> some<00:04:18.329> really<00:04:18.600> were<00:04:18.900> improvements<00:04:19.590> on<00:04:20.039> the

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
but some really were improvements on the

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.550 
but some really were improvements on the
Nintendo<00:04:20.669> DS<00:04:20.880> world<00:04:21.750> at<00:04:21.900> war<00:04:22.049> is<00:04:22.199> certainly

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
Nintendo DS world at war is certainly

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.529 
Nintendo DS world at war is certainly
different<00:04:22.949> to<00:04:23.250> be<00:04:23.340> different<00:04:23.880> but<00:04:24.210> in<00:04:24.330> some

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
different to be different but in some

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:29.150 
different to be different but in some
ways<00:04:24.780> it<00:04:25.350> was<00:04:25.380> also<00:04:25.800> different<00:04:26.070> to<00:04:26.759> be<00:04:26.880> better
