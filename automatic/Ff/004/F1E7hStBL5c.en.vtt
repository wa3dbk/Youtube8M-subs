drank too much and and this is the story

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.220 
drank too much and and this is the story
that<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.699> can<00:00:53.850> only<00:00:54.000> tell<00:00:54.330> as<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.480> crime<00:00:54.809> story

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.740 
that you can only tell as a crime story
and<00:00:55.890> that's<00:00:56.100> how<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.580> start<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.150> didn't<00:00:57.420> intend

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
and that's how I start I didn't intend

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.560 
and that's how I start I didn't intend
to<00:00:57.809> be<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> crime<00:00:58.320> writer<00:00:58.589> but<00:00:58.860> then<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.570> realized

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
to be a crime writer but then I realized

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.950 
to be a crime writer but then I realized
that<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.339> it's<00:01:02.339> a<00:01:02.430> great<00:01:02.640> shower

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.469 

I<00:01:06.159> think<00:01:07.159> I'm<00:01:07.310> at<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.580> most<00:01:07.790> happy<00:01:08.060> when<00:01:08.180> when

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
I think I'm at the most happy when when

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.450 
I think I'm at the most happy when when
when<00:01:08.750> I<00:01:08.869> finished<00:01:09.440> the<00:01:09.560> first<00:01:09.830> draft<00:01:09.920> of<00:01:10.340> the

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
when I finished the first draft of the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.800 
when I finished the first draft of the
story<00:01:10.729> when<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:10.970> story's<00:01:11.360> there<00:01:11.600> when<00:01:11.780> I

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
story when the story's there when I

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.960 
story when the story's there when I
written<00:01:12.049> it<00:01:12.260> through<00:01:12.500> for<00:01:12.770> whatever<00:01:13.400> four<00:01:13.820> or

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
written it through for whatever four or

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.180 
written it through for whatever four or
five<00:01:14.119> hundred<00:01:14.420> pages<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:14.990> I<00:01:15.050> know<00:01:15.350> oh<00:01:15.590> it's

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
five hundred pages and I know oh it's

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.240 
five hundred pages and I know oh it's
there<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:16.729> then<00:01:17.650> what<00:01:18.650> you<00:01:18.770> have<00:01:18.890> to<00:01:19.009> do<00:01:19.130> is

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
there and then what you have to do is

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.800 
there and then what you have to do is
that<00:01:19.400> we<00:01:19.520> writing<00:01:19.970> but<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.210> rewriting<00:01:20.720> is

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
that we writing but the rewriting is

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.040 
that we writing but the rewriting is
funny<00:01:21.110> because<00:01:21.290> that's<00:01:22.540> you<00:01:23.540> can<00:01:23.690> only<00:01:23.840> make

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
funny because that's you can only make

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.350 
funny because that's you can only make
it<00:01:24.080> better<00:01:24.229> so<00:01:24.830> I<00:01:25.070> think<00:01:25.159> that<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:25.970> happiest

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
it better so I think that the happiest

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.690 
it better so I think that the happiest
moment<00:01:26.720> is<00:01:26.810> when<00:01:27.020> when<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:27.500> when<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:28.340> story's

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
moment is when when the when the story's

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.490 
moment is when when the when the story's
there<00:01:28.970> and<00:01:29.149> you<00:01:29.240> know<00:01:29.390> you<00:01:29.570> manage<00:01:29.899> to<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:30.290> sort

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
there and you know you manage to to sort

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.580 
there and you know you manage to to sort
of<00:01:30.560> finish<00:01:30.800> it<00:01:31.100> for<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.060> first<00:01:32.240> time

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.399 

I<00:01:36.880> do<00:01:37.880> not<00:01:38.210> have<00:01:38.450> a<00:01:38.479> right<00:01:38.719> in<00:01:38.869> between<00:01:39.049> but<00:01:39.380> I

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
I do not have a right in between but I

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.810 

well<00:02:18.530> I<00:02:18.560> don't<00:02:18.920> feel<00:02:19.370> really<00:02:19.580> comfortable

with<00:02:20.510> being<00:02:20.840> grouped<00:02:21.290> together<00:02:21.500> with<00:02:21.830> any

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
with being grouped together with any

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.890 
with being grouped together with any
party<00:02:22.340> because<00:02:22.670> I'm<00:02:22.790> responsible<00:02:23.180> for<00:02:23.750> my<00:02:23.870> own

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
party because I'm responsible for my own

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.140 
party because I'm responsible for my own
writing<00:02:24.230> you<00:02:25.070> you<00:02:25.250> write<00:02:25.370> your<00:02:25.550> own<00:02:25.700> books<00:02:25.940> and

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
writing you you write your own books and

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.910 
writing you you write your own books and
you're<00:02:26.420> not<00:02:26.570> responsible<00:02:27.170> for<00:02:27.230> both<00:02:27.590> but<00:02:27.830> the

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
you're not responsible for both but the

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.430 
you're not responsible for both but the
other<00:02:28.040> writers<00:02:28.610> writing<00:02:28.850> in<00:02:29.840> Swedish<00:02:30.290> or

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
other writers writing in Swedish or

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.610 
other writers writing in Swedish or
Danish<00:02:30.740> or<00:02:30.860> Norwegian<00:02:30.890> or<00:02:31.340> whatever<00:02:32.440> but<00:02:33.440> I

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
Danish or Norwegian or whatever but I

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.410 
Danish or Norwegian or whatever but I
realized<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.190> it's<00:02:34.370> it's<00:02:34.820> a<00:02:34.910> phenomenon

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
realized that it's it's a phenomenon

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.550 
realized that it's it's a phenomenon
Nordic<00:02:35.900> crime<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:37.900> so<00:02:38.900> I<00:02:38.930> suppose<00:02:39.260> there<00:02:39.440> is

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
Nordic crime and so I suppose there is

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.170 
Nordic crime and so I suppose there is
something<00:02:39.980> after<00:02:40.280> all<00:02:40.430> with<00:02:40.640> with<00:02:40.850> in<00:02:40.970> the

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
something after all with with in the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.790 
something after all with with in the
Nordic<00:02:41.540> scene<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.990> Nordic<00:02:42.290> countries<00:02:42.440> that

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
Nordic scene the Nordic countries that

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.920 
Nordic scene the Nordic countries that
is<00:02:42.920> sort<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.820> appealing<00:02:44.270> to<00:02:44.390> readers

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.920 

a<00:02:47.989> lot<00:02:48.799> of<00:02:48.829> authors<00:02:49.340> not<00:02:50.060> many<00:02:50.329> crime<00:02:50.719> author

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
a lot of authors not many crime author

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.170 
a lot of authors not many crime author
