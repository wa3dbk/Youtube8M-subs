we always like to kind of update you on
what<00:01:01.219> things<00:01:01.429> have<00:01:01.579> been<00:01:01.640> happening<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.260> we

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
what things have been happening and we

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.750 
what things have been happening and we
have<00:01:03.350> two<00:01:03.530> outstanding<00:01:03.829> forecast<00:01:04.489> so<00:01:04.640> we're

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
have two outstanding forecast so we're

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.070 
have two outstanding forecast so we're
going<00:01:04.879> to<00:01:04.970> review<00:01:05.210> that<00:01:05.269> neither<00:01:05.630> of<00:01:05.750> which<00:01:05.840> we

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
going to review that neither of which we

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.050 
going to review that neither of which we
can<00:01:06.260> verify<00:01:06.440> and<00:01:06.860> we'll<00:01:07.310> also<00:01:07.490> put<00:01:07.850> a<00:01:07.880> new<00:01:08.030> one

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
can verify and we'll also put a new one

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.030 
can verify and we'll also put a new one
out<00:01:08.330> as<00:01:08.450> well<00:01:08.600> so<00:01:09.200> first<00:01:09.500> of<00:01:09.590> all<00:01:09.650> let's<00:01:09.710> take<00:01:10.010> a

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
out as well so first of all let's take a

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.910 
out as well so first of all let's take a
look<00:01:10.280> back<00:01:10.490> and<00:01:10.850> this<00:01:11.120> was<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.590> specific<00:01:12.590> long

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
look back and this was the specific long

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.649 
look back and this was the specific long
shot<00:01:13.220> that<00:01:13.430> was<00:01:13.520> made<00:01:13.700> on<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:14.000> third<00:01:14.210> of<00:01:14.360> July

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
shot that was made on the third of July

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.410 
shot that was made on the third of July
at<00:01:14.960> that<00:01:15.500> time<00:01:15.800> we<00:01:16.340> were<00:01:16.460> looking<00:01:16.880> at<00:01:17.000> a<00:01:17.030> dry

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
at that time we were looking at a dry

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.570 
at that time we were looking at a dry
autumn<00:01:17.690> september-october<00:01:18.470> November<00:01:19.250> below

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580

autumn september-october November below
average<00:01:19.760> precipitation<00:01:20.260> was<00:01:21.260> the<00:01:21.470> target<00:01:21.740> and

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
average precipitation was the target and

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.790 
average precipitation was the target and
specifically<00:01:23.330> we<00:01:23.570> felt<00:01:23.810> if<00:01:24.110> we<00:01:24.350> had<00:01:24.500> one<00:01:24.530> of

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
specifically we felt if we had one of

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.130 
specifically we felt if we had one of
the<00:01:24.860> 15<00:01:25.310> driest<00:01:25.700> autumns<00:01:26.000> of<00:01:26.120> record<00:01:26.510> we<00:01:26.990> would

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
the 15 driest autumns of record we would

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.660 
the 15 driest autumns of record we would
hit<00:01:27.260> the<00:01:27.350> bullseye<00:01:27.740> now<00:01:27.950> of<00:01:28.040> course<00:01:28.190> autos<00:01:28.550> not

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
hit the bullseye now of course autos not

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.950 
hit the bullseye now of course autos not
over<00:01:28.940> because<00:01:29.090> we<00:01:29.360> still<00:01:29.510> have<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.720> month<00:01:29.870> of

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
over because we still have the month of

over because we still have the month of
November<00:01:30.290> ahead<00:01:30.500> of<00:01:30.620> us<00:01:30.740> but<00:01:31.310> to<00:01:31.460> give<00:01:31.610> you

November ahead of us but to give you
some<00:01:31.940> sense<00:01:32.120> of<00:01:32.330> what<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.630> precipitation<00:01:33.230> has

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
some sense of what the precipitation has

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.560 
some sense of what the precipitation has
been<00:01:33.590> like<00:01:33.740> for<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:33.980> past<00:01:34.160> 60<00:01:35.060> days<00:01:35.090> at<00:01:35.540> least

little bit hard to see because the

northeastern Pennsylvania has been doing

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.380 
northeastern Pennsylvania has been doing
very<00:01:55.130> well<00:01:55.520> and<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.760> little<00:01:56.000> bit<00:01:56.090> along<00:01:56.360> the

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
very well and a little bit along the

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.450 
very well and a little bit along the
Delaware<00:01:56.870> River<00:01:56.900> Valley<00:01:57.320> but<00:01:57.830> otherwise<00:01:58.070> it's

been driver see elsewhere across the
state<00:02:00.440> so<00:02:00.890> we're<00:02:01.070> kind<00:02:01.310> of<00:02:01.370> on<00:02:01.460> target<00:02:02.000> at

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
state so we're kind of on target at

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.940 
state so we're kind of on target at
least<00:02:02.360> at<00:02:02.510> this<00:02:02.600> point<00:02:02.690> for<00:02:03.410> that<00:02:03.560> one<00:02:03.740> and

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
least at this point for that one and

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.920 
least at this point for that one and
possibly<00:02:04.430> depending<00:02:05.210> upon<00:02:05.330> how<00:02:05.570> November

plays out it could end up being one of

plays out it could end up being one of
the<00:02:07.430> 15<00:02:07.790> driest<00:02:08.360> so<00:02:08.649> another<00:02:09.649> one<00:02:09.860> that<00:02:10.009> we

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
the 15 driest so another one that we

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.220 
the 15 driest so another one that we
forecast<00:02:10.819> was<00:02:11.060> looking<00:02:11.480> at<00:02:11.599> what<00:02:11.780> happened

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
forecast was looking at what happened

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.100 
forecast was looking at what happened
during<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.980> month<00:02:13.160> of<00:02:13.250> August<00:02:13.700> in<00:02:14.629> the<00:02:14.900> Ohio

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.160 
Valley and these are the average
temperatures<00:02:16.879> in<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.000> IAO<00:02:17.150> Valley<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.690> it

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
temperatures in the IAO Valley and it

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.720 
temperatures in the IAO Valley and it
was<00:02:18.290> very<00:02:18.470> very<00:02:18.680> warm<00:02:19.010> in<00:02:19.129> fact<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.459> was<00:02:19.550> one<00:02:19.700> of

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
was very very warm in fact it was one of

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.449 
was very very warm in fact it was one of
the<00:02:19.879> warmest<00:02:20.269> august<00:02:20.719> of<00:02:21.200> record<00:02:21.620> in<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.219> Ohio

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
the warmest august of record in the Ohio

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.789 
the warmest august of record in the Ohio
Valley<00:02:22.489> and<00:02:22.969> then<00:02:23.060> if<00:02:23.239> we<00:02:23.390> followed<00:02:23.930> suit<00:02:24.769> with

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
Valley and then if we followed suit with

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:25.540 
Valley and then if we followed suit with
that<00:02:25.099> and<00:02:25.340> then

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
that and then

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.220 
that and then
look<00:02:25.640> at<00:02:25.760> what<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.150> October<00:02:26.750> temperatures

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
look at what the October temperatures

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.620 
look at what the October temperatures
were<00:02:27.350> like<00:02:27.530> in<00:02:27.730> Pennsylvania<00:02:28.730> we<00:02:29.210> found<00:02:29.450> out

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
were like in Pennsylvania we found out

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.630 
were like in Pennsylvania we found out
that<00:02:29.660> there<00:02:30.020> were<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.260> vast<00:02:30.800> majority<00:02:31.010> of<00:02:31.490> them

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
that there were a vast majority of them

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.070 
that there were a vast majority of them
were<00:02:31.670> above<00:02:32.060> normal<00:02:32.330> in<00:02:32.510> fact<00:02:32.720> some<00:02:32.870> of<00:02:32.930> them

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
were above normal in fact some of them

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.080 
were above normal in fact some of them
were<00:02:33.200> way<00:02:33.440> above<00:02:33.590> normal<00:02:33.770> in<00:02:34.280> fact<00:02:34.730> we<00:02:34.910> then

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
were way above normal in fact we then

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.310 
were way above normal in fact we then
thinned<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.480> out<00:02:35.570> even<00:02:35.870> further<00:02:35.990> than<00:02:36.170> looked

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
thinned it out even further than looked

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.230 
thinned it out even further than looked
at<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.560> top<00:02:36.740> six<00:02:37.040> we<00:02:37.160> find<00:02:37.370> out<00:02:37.520> that<00:02:37.670> five<00:02:38.090> of

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
at the top six we find out that five of

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.420 
at the top six we find out that five of
the<00:02:38.330> six<00:02:38.540> were<00:02:38.780> well<00:02:38.960> above<00:02:39.080> average<00:02:39.380> so<00:02:40.130> that

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
the six were well above average so that

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.520 
the six were well above average so that
led<00:02:40.640> us<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:41.150> following<00:02:41.630> which<00:02:42.110> is<00:02:42.320> to<00:02:42.500> say

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
led us to the following which is to say

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.980 
led us to the following which is to say
warm<00:02:43.010> October<00:02:43.160> this<00:02:44.060> was<00:02:44.210> made<00:02:44.390> on<00:02:44.510> September

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
warm October this was made on September

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.170 
warm October this was made on September
of<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.170> 11th<00:02:45.560> at<00:02:45.680> average<00:02:46.460> temperatures<00:02:47.030> at

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
of the 11th at average temperatures at

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.700 
of the 11th at average temperatures at
least<00:02:47.330> a<00:02:47.420> degree<00:02:47.660> above<00:02:47.750> normal<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:48.470> of

least a degree above normal and of
course<00:02:48.800> we<00:02:49.070> know<00:02:49.190> that<00:02:49.370> has<00:02:49.490> certainly

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
course we know that has certainly

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.160 
course we know that has certainly
happened<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.210> it<00:02:50.570> was<00:02:50.660> going<00:02:50.810> to<00:02:50.870> be<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.050> one

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
happened and it was going to be the one

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.900 
happened and it was going to be the one
on<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.320> top<00:02:51.380> 15<00:02:51.980> warmest<00:02:52.370> October<00:02:52.760> is<00:02:52.820> now

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
on the top 15 warmest October is now

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.760 
on the top 15 warmest October is now
October<00:02:53.390> of<00:02:53.450> course<00:02:53.660> is<00:02:53.780> not<00:02:53.930> over<00:02:54.170> yet<00:02:54.290> so

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
October of course is not over yet so

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.500 
October of course is not over yet so
we're<00:02:54.890> not<00:02:54.980> going<00:02:55.160> to<00:02:55.310> jump<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.300> gun<00:02:56.330> and

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
we're not going to jump the gun and

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.150 
we're not going to jump the gun and
declare<00:02:56.990> victory<00:02:57.110> but<00:02:57.410> at<00:02:57.500> least<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.860> first

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160

28 days of October this is the departure

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.800 
28 days of October this is the departure
from<00:03:01.100> normal<00:03:01.160> across<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.820> Northeast<00:03:02.240> these

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
from normal across the Northeast these

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.410 
from normal across the Northeast these
areas<00:03:03.200> that<00:03:03.350> are<00:03:03.440> in<00:03:03.560> these<00:03:03.710> lighter<00:03:04.670> orange

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
areas that are in these lighter orange

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.300 
areas that are in these lighter orange
colors<00:03:05.960> are<00:03:06.260> indicating<00:03:06.830> around<00:03:07.010> four<00:03:07.280> or

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310

five<00:03:07.670> degrees<00:03:08.060> above<00:03:08.510> normal<00:03:08.570> most<00:03:09.410> of

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
five degrees above normal most of

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.560 
five degrees above normal most of
Pennsylvania<00:03:10.190> is<00:03:10.250> around<00:03:10.520> five<00:03:10.820> or<00:03:10.850> six<00:03:11.330> some

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
Pennsylvania is around five or six some

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.300 
Pennsylvania is around five or six some
places<00:03:11.780> aight<00:03:12.110> near<00:03:12.650> 10<00:03:12.950> degrees<00:03:12.980> above

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
places aight near 10 degrees above

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.670 
places aight near 10 degrees above
normal<00:03:13.610> so<00:03:14.390> I<00:03:14.420> think<00:03:14.990> we're<00:03:15.170> definitely<00:03:15.410> on

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
normal so I think we're definitely on

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.810 
normal so I think we're definitely on
our<00:03:15.710> way<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:16.970> not<00:03:17.390> only<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:18.670> target<00:03:19.670> but

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
our way to to not only a target but

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.160 
our way to to not only a target but
probably<00:03:20.060> even<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.300> bull's-eye<00:03:20.690> with<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:20.990> one

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
probably even a bull's-eye with that one

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.800 
probably even a bull's-eye with that one
so<00:03:21.830> here's<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.310> tally<00:03:22.550> we<00:03:23.390> began<00:03:23.630> a<00:03:23.690> new

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
so here's the tally we began a new

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.320 
so here's the tally we began a new
season<00:03:24.110> on<00:03:24.320> the<00:03:24.380> first<00:03:24.590> of<00:03:24.710> July<00:03:25.010> and<00:03:25.250> so<00:03:26.060> far

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
season on the first of July and so far

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.810 
season on the first of July and so far
we've<00:03:26.570> had<00:03:26.600> one<00:03:27.020> miss<00:03:27.230> we've<00:03:27.950> had<00:03:28.160> one<00:03:28.400> hit<00:03:28.670> the

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
we've had one miss we've had one hit the

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.090 
we've had one miss we've had one hit the
target<00:03:29.270> and<00:03:29.390> we<00:03:30.050> have<00:03:30.260> no<00:03:30.440> bull's-eyes<00:03:30.860> so

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
target and we have no bull's-eyes so

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.830 
target and we have no bull's-eyes so
it's<00:03:31.400> hopeful<00:03:31.850> at<00:03:32.060> this<00:03:32.209> particular<00:03:32.510> point

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
it's hopeful at this particular point

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.680 
it's hopeful at this particular point
that<00:03:33.680> with<00:03:34.580> the<00:03:34.790> two<00:03:35.060> forecasts<00:03:35.570> we're

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
that with the two forecasts we're

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.090 
that with the two forecasts we're
looking<00:03:35.900> at<00:03:36.020> we<00:03:36.140> will<00:03:36.290> get<00:03:36.440> a<00:03:36.470> perhaps<00:03:36.980> a

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
looking at we will get a perhaps a

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.740 
looking at we will get a perhaps a
bull's<00:03:37.280> eye<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.700> at<00:03:38.000> least<00:03:38.060> a<00:03:38.239> target<00:03:38.600> maybe

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
bull's eye and at least a target maybe

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.540 
bull's eye and at least a target maybe
two<00:03:38.989> bull's-eyes<00:03:39.350> so<00:03:39.620> that's<00:03:40.070> always<00:03:40.280> good

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
two bull's-eyes so that's always good

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.990 
two bull's-eyes so that's always good
news<00:03:40.580> now<00:03:41.330> the<00:03:41.390> next<00:03:42.489> long<00:03:43.489> shot<00:03:43.760> that<00:03:43.790> we're

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
going to put out that hit the hesitate

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.660 
going to put out that hit the hesitate

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
to call it a forecast it's really not

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.729 
to call it a forecast it's really not
exactly<00:03:47.450> forecast<00:03:47.900> is<00:03:48.050> more<00:03:48.230> of<00:03:48.290> an<00:03:48.380> outlook

exactly forecast is more of an outlook

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.690 
exactly forecast is more of an outlook
is<00:03:49.480> going<00:03:50.480> to<00:03:50.600> be<00:03:50.720> looking<00:03:51.020> at<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:51.380> very<00:03:52.100> warm

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
is going to be looking at the very warm

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.150 
is going to be looking at the very warm
and<00:03:52.970> usually<00:03:53.450> warmth<00:03:53.780> September<00:03:54.530> in<00:03:54.560> October

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
and usually warmth September in October

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.590 
and usually warmth September in October
that<00:03:55.310> we've<00:03:55.459> had<00:03:55.670> in<00:03:55.910> Pennsylvania<00:03:56.540> they

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
that we've had in Pennsylvania they

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.240 
that we've had in Pennsylvania they
don't<00:03:56.750> see<00:03:56.930> it<00:03:56.959> here<00:03:57.290> yet<00:03:57.530> but<00:03:57.560> I<00:03:57.739> suspect<00:03:57.950> that

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
don't see it here yet but I suspect that

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.620 
don't see it here yet but I suspect that
that<00:03:58.459> when<00:03:58.760> we<00:03:58.880> finally<00:03:59.090> get<00:03:59.300> it<00:03:59.450> it's<00:03:59.540> going

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
that when we finally get it it's going

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.060 
that when we finally get it it's going
to<00:03:59.720> be<00:03:59.810> somewhere<00:04:00.200> up<00:04:00.320> in<00:04:00.440> this<00:04:00.560> range<00:04:00.860> and

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
to be somewhere up in this range and

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.560 
to be somewhere up in this range and
we're<00:04:01.550> going<00:04:01.670> to<00:04:01.700> look<00:04:01.790> back<00:04:01.850> at<00:04:02.239> all<00:04:02.360> the

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
we're going to look back at all the

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.270 
we're going to look back at all the
other<00:04:02.600> very<00:04:03.110> warm<00:04:03.440> combinations<00:04:04.160> of

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
other very warm combinations of

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.460 
other very warm combinations of
september-october<00:04:04.730> these<00:04:05.690> many<00:04:05.989> years<00:04:06.260> in

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
september-october these many years in

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.930 
september-october these many years in
here<00:04:06.680> and<00:04:06.770> there's<00:04:06.920> a<00:04:06.980> few<00:04:07.160> others<00:04:07.400> around<00:04:07.700> as

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
here and there's a few others around as

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.870 
here and there's a few others around as
well<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:08.390> from<00:04:09.080> that<00:04:09.430> we're<00:04:10.430> going<00:04:10.550> to<00:04:10.670> see

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
well and from that we're going to see

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.910 
well and from that we're going to see
what<00:04:11.030> happened<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.630> year<00:04:11.660> following<00:04:12.200> that<00:04:12.739> is

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
what happened the year following that is

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.310 
what happened the year following that is
in<00:04:13.100> the<00:04:13.459> following<00:04:13.790> combination<00:04:14.570> of<00:04:14.750> februari

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
in the following combination of februari

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.849 
in the following combination of februari
in<00:04:15.440> march<00:04:15.709> and<00:04:15.920> 1901<00:04:16.720> 1972<00:04:17.720> 1932<00:04:18.530> or<00:04:18.680> some<00:04:18.799> of

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
in march and 1901 1972 1932 or some of

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.090 
in march and 1901 1972 1932 or some of
those<00:04:18.950> years<00:04:19.190> so<00:04:19.280> it<00:04:19.340> was<00:04:19.430> 1900<00:04:20.169> 1971<00:04:21.169> 1931

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
those years so it was 1900 1971 1931

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.040 
those years so it was 1900 1971 1931
with<00:04:22.280> a<00:04:22.340> very<00:04:22.550> warm<00:04:22.880> september-october<00:04:23.360> and

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
with a very warm september-october and

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.500 
with a very warm september-october and
this<00:04:24.890> is<00:04:25.100> the<00:04:25.280> temperature<00:04:25.820> pattern<00:04:26.270> across

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
this is the temperature pattern across

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.530 
this is the temperature pattern across
the<00:04:26.600> u.s.<00:04:27.080> everybody<00:04:28.010> is<00:04:28.220> in<00:04:28.430> green<00:04:28.820> or<00:04:29.150> blue

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
the u.s. everybody is in green or blue

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.210 
the u.s. everybody is in green or blue
indicating<00:04:30.050> below<00:04:30.290> average<00:04:30.440> temperatures<00:04:30.890> in

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
indicating below average temperatures in

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.220 
indicating below average temperatures in
some<00:04:31.400> places<00:04:31.640> are<00:04:32.000> in<00:04:32.390> dark<00:04:32.630> blue<00:04:32.780> indicating

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
some places are in dark blue indicating

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.770 
some places are in dark blue indicating
pretty<00:04:33.650> far<00:04:33.830> below<00:04:33.979> average<00:04:34.220> so<00:04:35.000> if<00:04:35.360> we<00:04:35.419> then

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
pretty far below average so if we then

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.420 
pretty far below average so if we then
tease<00:04:36.050> it<00:04:36.229> out<00:04:36.320> and<00:04:36.560> just<00:04:36.710> look<00:04:36.890> specifically

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
tease it out and just look specifically

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.740 
tease it out and just look specifically
at<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.850> at<00:04:38.090> the

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
at the at the

central part of the state and then

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.990 
central part of the state and then
specifically<00:04:45.040> saw<00:04:46.040> what<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:46.460> departures

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
specifically saw what the departures

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.460 
specifically saw what the departures
were<00:04:47.090> like<00:04:47.270> in<00:04:47.450> those<00:04:47.570> years<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.350> year

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
were like in those years the year

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.080 
were like in those years the year
following<00:04:48.650> of<00:04:48.980> course<00:04:49.190> that<00:04:49.550> very<00:04:49.790> warm

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
following of course that very warm

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.540 
following of course that very warm
september-october<00:04:50.510> combination<00:04:51.500> and<00:04:51.680> we<00:04:52.340> see

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
september-october combination and we see

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.750 
september-october combination and we see
