00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.790
The answer is very simple.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.820
It's simply practice.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.460
There's no substitute for practice.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.150
You'll find that there's no way that you can
cheat in archery.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.580
Practice, practice practice.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.500
The whole secret of archery is being consistent.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.699
The word accuracy does not apply to the bow,
it applies to the person.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.600
The person shooting the bow becomes accurate.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.080
A bow is always accurate.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.810
It has no variation.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.309
A person has variation.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.489
In order to become accurate, you have to practice.

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.449
Consistency is the answer.

00:00:52.449 --> 00:01:01.469
To start off with your archery experience,
do not by any means, move too far away from

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.949
the target.

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.610
The further you move away from the target,
the less apt you are to hit the target.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.330
Start close.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.310
Five yards would be a good starting distance
from the target.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.530
As you improve, as your accuracy improves,
then you can move back gradually.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:28.890
Even five yards at a time would be a limit
to move back until at each distance, you achieve

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.500
the accuracy that you want.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.940
Eventually you'll move back to the distance
that you want to shoot.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.970
In archery, you can actually move back to
100 yards from the target.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:51.060
That is a legitimate Olympic distance that
you would be required to shoot at if you were

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.700
going into that type of shooting.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.430
Start from five yards.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.250
Always be consistent.
