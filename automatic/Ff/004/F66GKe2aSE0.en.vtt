the<00:00:17.840> first<00:00:17.990> thing<00:00:18.350> I'm<00:00:18.560> gonna<00:00:18.710> review

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
the first thing I'm gonna review

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.600 
the first thing I'm gonna review
unfortunately<00:00:20.359> it's<00:00:20.690> in<00:00:20.870> pretty<00:00:21.430> pretty<00:00:22.430> bad

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610

unfortunately it's in pretty pretty bad
shape<00:00:23.320> but<00:00:24.550> I<00:00:25.990> think<00:00:26.990> that<00:00:27.289> if<00:00:27.620> this<00:00:27.740> guitar

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
shape but I think that if this guitar

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.139 
shape but I think that if this guitar
was<00:00:30.970> not<00:00:31.970> so<00:00:32.239> beat<00:00:32.509> up<00:00:32.539> it<00:00:33.170> would<00:00:33.289> be<00:00:34.030> it<00:00:35.030> would

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
was not so beat up it would be it would

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.290 
was not so beat up it would be it would
be<00:00:35.500> nice<00:00:36.500> a<00:00:36.530> guitar<00:00:36.920> but<00:00:37.100> as<00:00:37.220> it<00:00:37.370> is<00:00:37.489> it<00:00:38.060> can<00:00:38.210> be

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
be nice a guitar but as it is it can be

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.600
