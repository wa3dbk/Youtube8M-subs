impressions<00:03:56.810> as<00:03:56.959> I<00:03:57.110> said<00:03:57.349> I<00:03:57.380> was<00:03:57.590> gonna<00:03:57.739> do

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
impressions as I said I was gonna do

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.530 
impressions as I said I was gonna do
that<00:03:58.310> I<00:03:58.550> think<00:03:58.970> it's<00:03:59.390> something<00:03:59.569> like<00:03:59.720> GTA<00:04:00.440> now

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
that I think it's something like GTA now

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.759 
that I think it's something like GTA now
the<00:04:02.540> reason<00:04:02.840> why<00:04:02.959> I'm<00:04:03.019> saying<00:04:03.319> this<00:04:03.440> because

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
the reason why I'm saying this because

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:10.120 
the reason why I'm saying this because
GTA<00:04:04.519> has<00:04:04.880> one<00:04:05.360> cause<00:04:05.769> GTA<00:04:06.769> has<00:04:08.200> guns<00:04:09.200> so<00:04:09.920> that

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
GTA has one cause GTA has guns so that

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.979 
GTA has one cause GTA has guns so that
is<00:04:10.250> what<00:04:10.459> battlefield<00:04:10.970> is<00:04:11.090> like<00:04:11.299> cars<00:04:11.600> guns

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
is what battlefield is like cars guns

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.750 
is what battlefield is like cars guns
and<00:04:12.410> but<00:04:13.400> I<00:04:14.049> think<00:04:15.049> that<00:04:15.470> this<00:04:16.160> is<00:04:16.370> better<00:04:16.579> than

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
and but I think that this is better than

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.170 
and but I think that this is better than
GTA<00:04:17.120> 1<00:04:17.780> because<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.709> FPS<00:04:19.370> is<00:04:19.549> way<00:04:19.790> better

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
GTA 1 because the FPS is way better

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.629 
GTA 1 because the FPS is way better
obviously<00:04:20.930> this<00:04:21.139> battlefield<00:04:21.739> is<00:04:22.040> an<00:04:22.160> FPS

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
obviously this battlefield is an FPS

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.600 
obviously this battlefield is an FPS
game<00:04:22.669> we<00:04:23.090> all<00:04:23.210> know<00:04:23.389> that<00:04:23.570> and<00:04:23.930> too<00:04:24.710> because<00:04:25.370> I

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
game we all know that and too because I

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.150 
game we all know that and too because I
think<00:04:25.760> battlefield<00:04:26.510> can<00:04:26.810> combined<00:04:27.590> with<00:04:27.800> jets

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
think battlefield can combined with jets

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.290 
think battlefield can combined with jets
helicopters<00:04:28.750> cars<00:04:30.039> motorcycles<00:04:31.039> you<00:04:31.820> name<00:04:32.060> it

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
helicopters cars motorcycles you name it

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.740 
helicopters cars motorcycles you name it
it's<00:04:32.660> gonna<00:04:32.840> be<00:04:33.080> epic<00:04:33.350> and<00:04:34.010> trust<00:04:34.789> me<00:04:35.000> whether

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
it's gonna be epic and trust me whether

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.330 
it's gonna be epic and trust me whether
it's<00:04:35.960> worth<00:04:36.169> your<00:04:36.380> money<00:04:36.410> or<00:04:36.710> not<00:04:36.979> that's<00:04:37.190> not

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
it's worth your money or not that's not

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.710
