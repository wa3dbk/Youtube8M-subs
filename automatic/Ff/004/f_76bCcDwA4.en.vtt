00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.519 
this is a game I played a few years ago
and<00:00:13.219> the<00:00:14.219> opening<00:00:14.549> was<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.570> CARICOM<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.320> pano

this<00:00:24.269> game<00:00:24.449> things<00:00:24.720> turned<00:00:24.990> out<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.109> little<00:00:25.380> bit

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
this game things turned out a little bit

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:36.200 
this game things turned out a little bit
differently<00:00:26.039> as<00:00:26.760> we<00:00:26.880> will<00:00:27.029> see<00:00:34.910> this<00:00:35.910> was<00:00:36.090> all

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
differently as we will see this was all

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.660 
differently as we will see this was all
fairly<00:00:36.540> standard<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.530> here<00:00:38.100> white<00:00:38.489> usually

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
fairly standard and here white usually

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.010 
fairly standard and here white usually
plays<00:00:39.180> Bishop<00:00:39.960> b5<00:00:41.360> trying<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.540> eliminate<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
plays Bishop b5 trying to eliminate the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.720 
plays Bishop b5 trying to eliminate the
knight<00:00:43.200> on<00:00:43.230> c6<00:00:45.440> with<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.559> move<00:00:46.770> white<00:00:47.579> is

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
knight on c6 with this move white is

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.740 
knight on c6 with this move white is
hoping<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.149> set<00:00:48.450> up<00:00:49.039> the<00:00:50.039> pawn<00:00:50.280> advance<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
hoping to set up the pawn advance on the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.139 
hoping to set up the pawn advance on the
Queen<00:00:51.960> side<00:00:51.989> with<00:00:52.320> before<00:00:52.579> for<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.670> neglects

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
Queen side with before for this neglects

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.049 
Queen side with before for this neglects
development<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:58.489> think<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.609> move<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.030> a

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
development I think this move is a

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.250 
development I think this move is a
mistake<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:01.199> Queen<00:01:01.440> stops<00:01:01.770> controlling<00:01:02.370> d4

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
mistake the Queen stops controlling d4

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.760 
mistake the Queen stops controlling d4
and<00:01:04.549> he's<00:01:05.549> still<00:01:05.820> wasting<00:01:06.210> time<00:01:06.770> making

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
and he's still wasting time making

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.800 
and he's still wasting time making
different<00:01:08.189> moves<00:01:08.369> while<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.760> King<00:01:09.000> is

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
different moves while the King is

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.330 
different moves while the King is
sitting<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.770> center<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
sitting in this in the center of the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.780 
sitting in this in the center of the
board<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:13.500> important<00:01:13.920> part<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.220> strategy<00:01:14.700> in

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
board the important part of strategy in

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.780 
board the important part of strategy in
chess<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.240> knowing<00:01:15.630> which<00:01:16.350> pieces<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.979> change

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
chess is knowing which pieces to change

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.850 
chess is knowing which pieces to change
and<00:01:18.060> which<00:01:18.240> pieces<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:19.140> keep<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.590> board

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
and which pieces to to keep on the board

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.109 
and which pieces to to keep on the board
so<00:01:20.610> with<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.060> move<00:01:21.390> Knight<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.960> g5<00:01:23.119> black

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
so with this move Knight to g5 black

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.020 
so with this move Knight to g5 black
realizes<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.080> knight<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:25.830> f3<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.850> key

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
realizes that knight on f3 is the key

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.910 
realizes that knight on f3 is the key
piece<00:01:27.270> because<00:01:27.659> it's<00:01:27.810> controlling<00:01:28.290> d4<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.860> d5

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
piece because it's controlling d4 and d5

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.480 
piece because it's controlling d4 and d5
squares<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.600> changing<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.829> knight<00:01:32.070> on

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
squares so it's changing that knight on

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.590 
squares so it's changing that knight on
f3<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:33.090> very<00:01:33.299> beneficial<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.960> black<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:35.600> given

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
f3 is very beneficial to black and given

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.060 
f3 is very beneficial to black and given
later<00:01:36.799> exploit<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.979> absence<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.610> night

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.210 

now<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.640> pawn<00:01:44.880> on<00:01:44.909> d4<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.420> hanging<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.220> white

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
now the pawn on d4 is hanging and white

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.010 
now the pawn on d4 is hanging and white
has<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.549> spend<00:01:47.820> some<00:01:47.970> more<00:01:48.090> time<00:01:48.149> defending<00:01:48.750> it

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
has to spend some more time defending it

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.630 
has to spend some more time defending it
and<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.500> meantime<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.100> King<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.520> still

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
lose the game immediately I think this

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.630 
lose the game immediately I think this
was<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.860> mistake

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
was a mistake

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.610 
was a mistake
white<00:02:11.940> had<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.240> play<00:02:12.420> something<00:02:12.750> like<00:02:12.780> h4<00:02:13.380> and

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
white had to play something like h4 and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.800 
white had to play something like h4 and
force<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.240> black<00:02:15.240> queen

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
force the black queen

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
to go away from g5 now blacks position

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:31.580 
to go away from g5 now blacks position
becomes<00:02:21.840> even<00:02:22.110> better<00:02:30.110> here<00:02:31.110> I<00:02:31.170> just<00:02:31.350> have<00:02:31.470> to

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
becomes even better here I just have to

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.220 
becomes even better here I just have to

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
play something like Bishop to a5 just

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.610

bring out their works to das and ea8
displacement<00:02:43.950> measure<00:02:44.070> moves<00:02:44.520> but<00:02:45.150> instead<00:02:45.390> I

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
displacement measure moves but instead I

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.250 
displacement measure moves but instead I
decided<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:46.080> try<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.380> play<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:48.000> nice<00:02:48.390> move<00:02:48.810> that

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
decided to try to play a nice move that

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.690 
decided to try to play a nice move that
looked<00:02:49.470> pretty<00:02:49.650> but<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.040> didn't<00:02:50.280> really<00:02:50.400> work

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
looked pretty but it didn't really work

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.140 
looked pretty but it didn't really work
out<00:02:51.150> all<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.330> well<00:02:51.480> if<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.380> opponent<00:02:52.770> had

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
out all that well if the opponent had

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:09.900 
out all that well if the opponent had
defended<00:02:54.150> better

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.339 

here<00:03:10.910> I<00:03:10.940> could<00:03:11.360> take<00:03:11.599> on<00:03:11.780> b2<00:03:12.290> but<00:03:13.129> I<00:03:14.080> just<00:03:15.080> felt

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
here I could take on b2 but I just felt

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.259 
here I could take on b2 but I just felt
it<00:03:15.470> would<00:03:15.590> be<00:03:15.709> very<00:03:15.860> unfortunate<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.760> let<00:03:16.970> the

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
it would be very unfortunate to let the

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.600 
it would be very unfortunate to let the
White<00:03:17.750> King<00:03:17.959> Castle<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:18.980> let<00:03:19.099> him<00:03:19.280> out<00:03:19.370> of<00:03:19.519> the

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
White King Castle and let him out of the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.710 
White King Castle and let him out of the
center<00:03:21.400> so<00:03:22.400> I<00:03:22.459> decided<00:03:22.819> to<00:03:22.970> play<00:03:23.239> another<00:03:23.420> move

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
center so I decided to play another move

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:35.420 
center so I decided to play another move
and<00:03:23.989> keep<00:03:24.500> that<00:03:24.680> white<00:03:24.920> pawn<00:03:25.160> alive

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.300 

now<00:03:36.329> it<00:03:36.959> may<00:03:37.200> seem<00:03:37.230> that<00:03:37.709> white<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.159> getting

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
now it may seem that white is getting

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.030 
now it may seem that white is getting
some<00:03:38.579> counter<00:03:38.969> play<00:03:39.150> against<00:03:39.480> f7<00:03:40.040> but

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
some counter play against f7 but

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.179 
some counter play against f7 but
actually<00:03:41.790> he's<00:03:42.420> losing<00:03:42.840> by<00:03:43.590> force<00:03:43.920> in<00:03:44.099> this

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:44.189 
actually he's losing by force in this

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:46.369 
actually he's losing by force in this
position<00:03:44.700> because<00:03:44.849> black<00:03:45.180> has<00:03:45.390> a<00:03:45.420> nice<00:03:45.659> Queen

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
position because black has a nice Queen

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:57.379 
position because black has a nice Queen
sacrifice<00:03:46.890> I<00:03:55.609> think<00:03:56.609> what<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:56.879> have<00:03:57.030> resigned

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
sacrifice I think what you have resigned

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.319 
sacrifice I think what you have resigned
in<00:03:57.510> this<00:03:57.629> position<00:03:58.340> but<00:03:59.340> instead<00:03:59.670> he<00:03:59.969> carried

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
in this position but instead he carried

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:14.449 
in this position but instead he carried
on<00:04:00.560> playing<00:04:01.560> for<00:04:02.040> a<00:04:02.069> few<00:04:02.280> more<00:04:02.549> moves

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.360 

and<00:04:15.180> here<00:04:15.420> finally<00:04:15.870> white<00:04:16.049> resigned<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:17.040> was

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
and here finally white resigned I was

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.719 
and here finally white resigned I was
very<00:04:17.519> pleased<00:04:17.910> to<00:04:18.030> that<00:04:18.239> game<00:04:18.479> because<00:04:19.729> the

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
very pleased to that game because the

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.450 
very pleased to that game because the
pawn<00:04:21.000> break<00:04:21.299> in<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.750> century<00:04:22.139> with<00:04:22.259> E<00:04:22.440> 5<00:04:22.680> was

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
pawn break in the century with E 5 was

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.930 
pawn break in the century with E 5 was
such<00:04:23.669> a<00:04:23.699> natural<00:04:23.940> way<00:04:24.360> to<00:04:24.389> play<00:04:24.720> and<00:04:25.789> the<00:04:26.789> game

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
such a natural way to play and the game

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.790 
such a natural way to play and the game
just<00:04:27.240> generally<00:04:27.750> went<00:04:27.930> pretty<00:04:28.080> smoothly<00:04:28.500> for

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
just generally went pretty smoothly for

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.949 
just generally went pretty smoothly for
me
