slightly offbeat line but not not really
bad<00:00:17.699> very<00:00:18.270> interesting<00:00:20.000> way<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.029> deviate<00:00:21.930> from

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
bad very interesting way to deviate from

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.500 
bad very interesting way to deviate from
main<00:00:22.680> lines<00:00:24.859> yeah<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.220> maybe<00:00:26.699> retrying<00:00:27.359> to

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
main lines yeah is maybe retrying to

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.810 
main lines yeah is maybe retrying to
play<00:00:27.750> d4<00:00:28.050> in<00:00:28.470> one<00:00:28.710> move<00:00:31.130> well<00:00:32.130> there<00:00:32.340> seems<00:00:32.550> to

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
play d4 in one move well there seems to

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.910 
play d4 in one move well there seems to
be<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.239> seems<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.380> be<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.620> known<00:00:35.070> porn<00:00:35.760> sack

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.770 

yeah<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.190> can<00:00:41.460> take<00:00:41.700> take<00:00:42.149> twice<00:00:42.510> on<00:00:42.780> d4<00:00:43.640> but

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
yeah I can take take twice on d4 but

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.430 
yeah I can take take twice on d4 but
admittedly<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:46.020> looks<00:00:46.200> risky<00:00:51.440> alternative

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
admittedly it looks risky alternative

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.479 
admittedly it looks risky alternative
would<00:00:52.590> be<00:00:52.649> d5<00:00:53.840> ok<00:00:54.840> let's<00:00:55.260> go<00:00:55.469> D<00:00:55.680> Phi<00:00:55.890> if<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.219> not

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
to grab this pawn it really looks very

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:08.550 
to grab this pawn it really looks very
dangerous<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.539> grab<00:01:00.750> it

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
is the easiest white resigned yeah yeah

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.550 
is the easiest white resigned yeah yeah
this<00:04:22.200> is<00:04:22.350> too<00:04:22.500> much<00:04:22.530> it's<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.550> exchange<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:24.560> I

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
this is too much it's the exchange and I

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.730 
this is too much it's the exchange and I

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
have the center and two two pawns I

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.810 
have the center and two two pawns I
think<00:04:29.090> yeah<00:04:30.090> it's<00:04:30.390> so<00:04:30.630> just<00:04:30.930> a<00:04:31.169> Bishop<00:04:32.040> g5<00:04:32.460> with

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
think yeah it's so just a Bishop g5 with

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.250 
think yeah it's so just a Bishop g5 with
the<00:04:33.000> start<00:04:33.360> of<00:04:33.540> a<00:04:33.800> really<00:04:34.800> ill<00:04:35.130> time<00:04:35.490> plan

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
the start of a really ill time plan

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.620 
the start of a really ill time plan
the<00:04:36.950> point<00:04:37.220> sack<00:04:37.490> is<00:04:37.640> very<00:04:37.850> interesting<00:04:38.450> i

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
the point sack is very interesting i

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.890 
the point sack is very interesting i
don't<00:04:38.870> i<00:04:39.230> don't<00:04:39.380> think<00:04:39.710> i<00:04:39.860> should<00:04:40.100> risk<00:04:40.340> that

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
don't i don't think i should risk that

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.170 
don't i don't think i should risk that
this<00:04:41.900> kind<00:04:42.260> of<00:04:42.410> position<00:04:43.010> I<00:04:43.190> don't<00:04:43.670> really<00:04:43.940> see

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
this kind of position I don't really see

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.140 
this kind of position I don't really see
a<00:04:44.210> direct<00:04:44.780> reputation<00:04:45.610> but<00:04:46.610> it<00:04:46.760> feels<00:04:46.940> like

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
a direct reputation but it feels like

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.270 
a direct reputation but it feels like
white<00:04:47.570> is<00:04:47.780> gaining<00:04:48.050> lots<00:04:48.350> of<00:04:48.560> time<00:04:48.830> let's<00:04:49.100> say

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
white is gaining lots of time let's say

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.010 
white is gaining lots of time let's say
just<00:04:49.310> for<00:04:49.640> example<00:04:50.980> something<00:04:51.980> like<00:04:52.190> that<00:04:53.020> is

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
just for example something like that is

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.300 
just for example something like that is
a<00:04:54.080> bit<00:04:54.410> tricky<00:04:54.580> maybe<00:04:55.580> I<00:04:55.700> go<00:04:55.940> back<00:04:56.980> then<00:04:57.980> and

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
a bit tricky maybe I go back then and

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.790 
a bit tricky maybe I go back then and
know<00:04:58.760> something<00:04:59.240> like<00:04:59.420> that<00:04:59.660> and<00:04:59.870> it's<00:05:00.380> not<00:05:00.620> so

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
know something like that and it's not so

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.950 
know something like that and it's not so
easy<00:05:00.830> for<00:05:01.340> black<00:05:01.550> to<00:05:01.730> free<00:05:02.030> himself<00:05:02.270> of<00:05:02.750> here

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
easy for black to free himself of here

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.500 
easy for black to free himself of here
if<00:05:03.650> I<00:05:03.770> want<00:05:04.010> replace<00:05:04.610> something<00:05:04.880> like<00:05:05.210> these

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
if I want replace something like these

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.360 
if I want replace something like these
six<00:05:05.750> I<00:05:05.900> need<00:05:06.080> to<00:05:06.200> move<00:05:06.350> the<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:06.890> bishop<00:05:07.250> at

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
six I need to move the the bishop at

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.360 
six I need to move the the bishop at
some<00:05:07.610> point<00:05:07.910> well<00:05:08.780> let's<00:05:08.930> say<00:05:09.080> b6<00:05:09.650> for<00:05:09.890> example

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
some point well let's say b6 for example

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.940 
some point well let's say b6 for example
is<00:05:10.460> going<00:05:10.700> to<00:05:10.820> play<00:05:11.030> you<00:05:11.090> five<00:05:11.950> threatening

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
is going to play you five threatening

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.510 
is going to play you five threatening
here<00:05:13.250> and<00:05:13.550> so<00:05:13.880> on<00:05:14.060> this<00:05:14.210> is<00:05:14.270> very<00:05:14.630> very<00:05:15.520> clumsy

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
here and so on this is very very clumsy

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.140 
here and so on this is very very clumsy
position<00:05:16.970> for<00:05:17.120> black<00:05:17.330> so<00:05:18.700> this<00:05:19.700> is<00:05:19.850> probably

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
position for black so this is probably

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.960 
position for black so this is probably
the<00:05:20.390> easier<00:05:20.870> way<00:05:21.080> to<00:05:21.110> play<00:05:21.560> i<00:05:23.860> hopes<00:05:24.860> too<00:05:25.700> much

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
the easier way to play i hopes too much

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.110 
the easier way to play i hopes too much
too<00:05:26.360> many<00:05:26.660> moose<00:05:27.220> computer<00:05:28.220> wants<00:05:28.520> to<00:05:28.670> go<00:05:28.820> here

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
too many moose computer wants to go here

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.440 
too many moose computer wants to go here
immediately<00:05:29.480> attacking<00:05:30.470> me<00:05:30.620> form<00:05:30.950> and<00:05:31.450> then

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
immediately attacking me form and then

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.230 
immediately attacking me form and then
queen<00:05:32.840> bee<00:05:32.990> 60<00:05:33.440> yeah<00:05:34.370> this<00:05:34.580> is<00:05:34.730> not<00:05:34.940> bad<00:05:35.210> at<00:05:35.360> all

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
queen bee 60 yeah this is not bad at all

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:44.200 
queen bee 60 yeah this is not bad at all
yeah<00:05:38.240> it's<00:05:38.420> also<00:05:38.600> good<00:05:39.020> good<00:05:39.440> way<00:05:39.620> to<00:05:39.680> play<00:05:43.210> and

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
yeah it's also good good way to play and

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.910 
yeah it's also good good way to play and
now<00:05:44.360> my<00:05:44.540> idea<00:05:44.870> was<00:05:45.050> to<00:05:45.260> play<00:05:45.500> b5<00:05:46.010> if<00:05:46.190> he<00:05:46.310> plays

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:47.920 
now my idea was to play b5 if he plays

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.830 
now my idea was to play b5 if he plays
move<00:05:48.920> like<00:05:49.220> that<00:05:49.250> I<00:05:49.670> thought<00:05:50.210> maybe<00:05:50.270> even

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
move like that I thought maybe even

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.970 
move like that I thought maybe even
really<00:05:51.200> be<00:05:51.440> five<00:05:52.090> Queen<00:05:53.090> takes<00:05:53.260> this<00:05:54.260> Bishop<00:05:54.830> a

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:54.980 
really be five Queen takes this Bishop a

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.660 
really be five Queen takes this Bishop a
six<00:05:55.780> winning<00:05:56.780> next<00:05:57.470> big<00:05:57.800> change<00:05:58.100> and<00:05:58.280> after

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.670 
six winning next big change and after

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.260 
six winning next big change and after
that<00:05:58.960> he's<00:05:59.960> in<00:06:00.230> a<00:06:00.380> very<00:06:00.620> naughty<00:06:01.250> pin<00:06:01.670> and<00:06:01.910> he

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
that he's in a very naughty pin and he

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.030 
that he's in a very naughty pin and he
will<00:06:02.450> lose<00:06:02.690> the<00:06:03.050> Knight<00:06:03.850> to<00:06:04.850> Queen<00:06:05.180> a<00:06:05.300> five

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
will lose the Knight to Queen a five

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.350 
will lose the Knight to Queen a five
this<00:06:07.040> was<00:06:07.430> my<00:06:08.030> idea<00:06:08.330> but<00:06:08.870> Bishop<00:06:09.080> g5<00:06:09.650> I<00:06:10.360> think

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
this was my idea but Bishop g5 I think

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.600 
this was my idea but Bishop g5 I think
he<00:06:11.570> just<00:06:11.600> needs<00:06:12.170> to<00:06:12.290> do<00:06:12.710> something<00:06:13.010> else<00:06:13.310> and

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
he just needs to do something else and

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.880 
he just needs to do something else and
maybe<00:06:14.270> even<00:06:14.570> trade<00:06:14.870> only<00:06:15.020> seven<00:06:15.440> but<00:06:15.590> this<00:06:15.740> is

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:15.890 
maybe even trade only seven but this is

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.310 
maybe even trade only seven but this is
not<00:06:16.040> a<00:06:16.100> means<00:06:16.370> you<00:06:16.520> want<00:06:16.700> to<00:06:16.820> play<00:06:17.140> after<00:06:18.140> that

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.320 
not a means you want to play after that

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.050 
not a means you want to play after that
however<00:06:18.530> I<00:06:18.800> think<00:06:19.100> like<00:06:19.280> it's<00:06:19.490> just<00:06:19.670> winning

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
however I think like it's just winning

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.680
