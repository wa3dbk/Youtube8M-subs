00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.210
 and good kids are already here in another 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.040
 expected video of course and good since 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.380
 what is in the title a recovery 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.170
 of books this time we started with a book 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.900
 of month and that leaves duplicated and with a 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.820
 Pajama costume because it's a pajama 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.290
 if it arrives pija it seems to me a tablecloth 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.840
 you will see what is for you is disguised 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:34.550
 of semaphore of teletubbies or of o 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.020
 of the good chess field of chess not 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.720
 it would be those colors but good you have already 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.460
 understood what 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.220
 that the truth is that it's funny is 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.890
 funny also and if you look at the only 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.360
 what is placed is not messi but there is 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.970
 a goalkeeper who is also fixed and also 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.530
 is messi or is it duplicated is it 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.460
 double fault never had this happened to me 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.649
 I 'm going to spend the field d 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.360
 of a match but in the field of 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.540
 training never and by the way you go 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.070
 to see apart from being of 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.309
 Merci goalkeeper looks at what stops he makes or 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.659
 Whether the fabric messi porter if not 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.150
 you have a good substitute goalkeeper already 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.830
 you know here in getting this the second 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.690
 good ship what bothers me most about 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.360
 this is that it is not even a bus or is this 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.950
 in theory it is like this according to the fifa or if 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.890
 would happen again this would happen again 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.360
 it's not a failure of the game by 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.630
 decision to fail the game but good 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.759
 You have seen me get red for this lack 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.800
 you're going to see the repetition to see if 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.539
 at least you can find a fault 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.090
 no longer a red but to see if you see the 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.580
 missing is there as per sturridge if of 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.550
 Suddenly he does so he makes a feint and 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.770
 fades and well then the cifa gives 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.390
 for sure that sokratis red and good 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.509
 I put it here because you see that I 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.860
 enervan these things and well this is the 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.440
 best of all, you see it here 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.789
 referee as how is the dance doing 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.590
 of the belly or the dance of the rain or 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.070
 know what he does if I go the ball out 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.050
 of band and 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.610
 and I do not know why, because the referee started 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.590
 tossing about about the Christian and 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.410
 go through it now you see that benzema is 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.790
 Join the party and start to start giving 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.870
 also with him the truth is that 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.480
 it made me quite funny this 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.369
 and well now you see how it returns to 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.050
 leave again it is stuck stays a while 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.510
 stopped and comes back out from from the 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.450
 midfield to the referee and good 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.180
