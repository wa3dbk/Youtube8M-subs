00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
get when you get 100 mounts so once you

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.740 
get when you get 100 mounts so once you
have<00:02:30.080> 100<00:02:30.349> miles<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.830> instantly<00:02:31.430> have<00:02:31.750> 101

mounts<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:34.489> Alliance<00:02:34.849> version<00:02:35.239> is<00:02:35.450> a<00:02:35.480> blue

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
mounts the Alliance version is a blue

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.070 
mounts the Alliance version is a blue
one<00:02:36.280> but<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.489> Horde<00:02:37.760> one<00:02:37.940> is<00:02:38.180> much<00:02:38.810> better

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
one but the Horde one is much better

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.759 
one but the Horde one is much better
looking<00:02:39.260> as<00:02:39.530> red<00:02:40.040> dragon<00:02:40.459> Hawk<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:42.170> I<00:02:42.530> think

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
looking as red dragon Hawk and I think

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.150 
looking as red dragon Hawk and I think
in<00:02:42.860> this<00:02:42.980> video<00:02:43.250> I<00:02:43.280> go<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:45.010> orgrimmar<00:02:46.010> and

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
in this video I go to a orgrimmar and

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.729 
in this video I go to a orgrimmar and
test<00:02:46.459> to<00:02:46.670> see<00:02:46.880> that<00:02:47.060> it<00:02:47.349> can<00:02:48.349> actually<00:02:48.560> be

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
test to see that it can actually be

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.479 
test to see that it can actually be
summoned<00:02:49.250> there<00:02:49.400> since<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:50.410> tooltip<00:02:51.410> says<00:02:51.769> it

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
summoned there since the tooltip says it

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.130 
summoned there since the tooltip says it
can<00:02:52.640> only<00:02:52.730> be<00:02:52.940> summoned<00:02:53.150> in<00:02:54.549> outlands<00:02:55.549> and

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140

do<00:03:02.930> some<00:03:03.200> more<00:03:03.230> videos<00:03:03.769> I<00:03:04.700> still<00:03:05.120> been

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
do some more videos I still been

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.520 
do some more videos I still been
tweaking<00:03:05.420> around<00:03:05.720> with<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.989> quality<00:03:06.319> of

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
tweaking around with the quality of

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.059 
tweaking around with the quality of
videos<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.340> I<00:03:07.819> think<00:03:08.569> I<00:03:08.629> found<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:09.079> good<00:03:09.379> way<00:03:09.680> to

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
videos and I think I found a good way to

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.970 
videos and I think I found a good way to
keep<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.940> quality<00:03:11.209> very<00:03:11.720> high<00:03:12.109> in<00:03:12.889> the

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
keep the quality very high in the

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.370 
keep the quality very high in the
resolution<00:03:13.549> but<00:03:14.299> it<00:03:14.480> just<00:03:14.660> takes<00:03:14.900> a<00:03:15.019> while<00:03:15.049> to

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
resolution but it just takes a while to

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
resolution but it just takes a while to
process<00:03:15.590> so<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:17.389> videos<00:03:17.690> will<00:03:17.900> be<00:03:17.950> very<00:03:18.950> clear

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
process so the videos will be very clear

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.120 
process so the videos will be very clear
but<00:03:19.880> they<00:03:20.120> might<00:03:20.359> just<00:03:20.630> take<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.840> while<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:21.440> come

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
but they might just take a while to come

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.680 
but they might just take a while to come
out<00:03:23.170> alright<00:03:24.170> everyone<00:03:24.500> thanks<00:03:25.150> for<00:03:26.150> watching
