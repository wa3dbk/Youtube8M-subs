00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.730
 hi to all the peoples of simba network 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.830
 my name as always omega cardi and vi 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.830
 I welcome back to this new one 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.350
 episode of vg news address book that like of 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.600
 usual look or neal nudes of 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.880
 summarize them as briefly as 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.800
 possible the main ones 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.840
 news in the videogame field of the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.609
 weeks and I would say that even between 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.520
 Today's episode we can begin 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.899
 without wasting any more time 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.140
 I already had it last week 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.420
 anticipated that playstation 4 st in 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.920
 these last days celebrating his 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.780
 first year of life 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.030
 and it arrives just during this 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.670
 occasion the announcement that the same 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.489
 Sony's console sold at 15 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.010
 November the beauty of 14 million 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.739
 life a really exorbitant number that 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.690
 testifies as much as this last console 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.280
 sony was actually a real one 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.930
 and just success in this first year 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.390
 of life 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:07.650
 to be precise , 14 have been sold 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.210
 400 million 6,835 units 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.360
 numbers that go even further 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.070
 those of playstation 2 that until now 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.080
 turned out to be the best-selling console 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.840
 of all times therefore sony exceeds if 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.330
 itself and in this first year of life of 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.200
 fish out of four really get numbers 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.549
 from record 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.460
 we continue to talk about consoles of 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.470
 new generation because after a first one 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.200
 year a bit of break-in if we want so 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.350
 defining it gets closer and closer 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.560
 moment when ps 4 and xbox one 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.360
 they will definitely retire 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.930
 answer and 60 and playstation 3 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.090
 this is already slowly happening e 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.460
 is witnessed by the sales data 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.110
 of this last period as far as 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.229
 it's about xbox one and ds4 they saw 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.780
 an increase of 73 percent compared to 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.180
 xbox 360 and playstation 3 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.790
 so the latter in the fact that plan 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.540
 plan the user is moving now 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.240
 from the consoles of the old general 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.060
 the new ones and therefore that actually 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.370
 now the time is ripe to send 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.540
 definitely retired the old ones 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.420
 consul 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.430
 let's continue talking about magic spells 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.580
 chatted destiny a game that 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.040
 had to represent a colossal municipality 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.420
 with the title it would have destroyed 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.730
 however all the competition and that in 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.770
 reality then found a cold one 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.980
 reception by the press with 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.200
 so let's say not too homogeneous judgments 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.050
 here are some who actually ask for it 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.570
 masterpiece and hosanna and others who 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.310
 so instead we say this not svilu isco 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.360
 they tend to call it a game enough 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.120
 mediocre 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.820
 in any case, bungee has made it known that 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.880
 from 9 December will be available on 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.610
 playstation 3 playstation 4 and xbox 360 e 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.250
 xbox one and the darkness of the deep 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.040
 then the first expansion for defined a 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.489
 package that will offer many new ones 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.030
 adventures and will allow us to dive 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.769
 even more in this new world 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.510
 created by bungee this still not 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.900
 we have details on what actually 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.220
 this dlc will add a second one 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.290
 just that obviously if 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.420
 in the expansion it could be a 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.850
 payment and then will arrive on the 9th 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.890
 December on all consoles where 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.590
 pour out so if you are lovers 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.110
 of the game and you want to continue playing 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.790
 surely the title banci 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.630
 December is the date you need to mark 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.640
 on the calendar 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.680
 let's go ahead reconnect them it's still there 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.140
 a news that I saw already anticipated the 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.120
 last week or sales 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.010
 amazing call of duty advanced 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.920
 warfare and its first week of 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.650
 exit during the last few days 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.680
 came the official data that goes 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.489
 beyond the most optimistic expectations of 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.170
 activision 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.650
 in fact, in the widespread bulletin 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.870
 the company reads that the launch of 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.350
 call of duty advanced warfare was the 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.970
 biggest launch in history 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.010
 of 2014 entertainment therefore not 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.500
 only exceeded any other 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.290
 videogame but also any other 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.110
 multimedia product such as film music and 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.739
 books throughout the year 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.359
 14 the division company also wants the 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.760
 barriers that since he created the 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.490
 true franchise in the early 2000s the 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.350
 titolo call of duty billed more than 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.840
 10 billion dollars going that in 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.080
 this case to overcome big productions 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.910
 movies like hunger games 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.150
 transformers iron man the avengers messi 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.220
 together therefore really numbers 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.340
 exorbitant evidence of success 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.370
 of a saga that will surely remain 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.370
 still on the crest of a wave for a long time 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.220
 time and that still represents perhaps 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.380
 world the few video games that every year 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.620
 actually manages to continue to 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.930
 continually sell those looking for some 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.390
 undermine this leadership position 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.970
 that a call of duty within the fps range 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.280
 military is obviously electronic ars 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.200
 with its battlefield 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.240
 despite everything, however, the public has 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.169
 reserved enough reception 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.780
 cold to the last hardline chapter e 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:17.640
 tronic cards is so anxious to say 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.710
 let people know that you are in line 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.000
 represents only a parenthesis in the 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.490
 butt franchise 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.880
 it is not a spin off of the series 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:30.300
 main is to rest assured that from 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.060
 battlefield 5 will return to the classic 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.400
 military setting in addition to 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.930
 this electronics wants to inform the 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.110
 own fans that there is absolutely 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.810
 no danger that battlefield does 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.550
 of call of duty or that goes out with 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.860
 annual frequency 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:50.790
 developers want to do it 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.410
 which anyway is hardline anyway 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.800
 the same beats the film four have 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.640
 a very long life standard for 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.490
 accompany us to the exit of 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.689
 fight 5 of not say so 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.399
 publish a video game every year 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:06.069
 as it happens instead with the saga of call 

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:07.479
 of duty and with this latest news I would say 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:09.519
 which we also have for this week 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:12.099
 finished so I recommend releasing 

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:13.059
 a good fiat liked to comment 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:15.549
 to let me know your opinion 

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:17.259
 on the news we found today is 

00:06:15.549 --> 00:06:18.849
 to continue to suffer gene ma network 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:20.639
 not to miss all the next ones 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:23.409
 news episodes with lots of news 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:25.869
 always to debate and discuss together 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:28.329
 so even for today really everything 

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:29.949
 so now we give the hd from giba network 

00:06:28.329 --> 00:06:32.189
 I'll talk to you next Monday 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:32.189
 bye bye
