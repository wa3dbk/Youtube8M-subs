little bit of back for me at the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.850 
little bit of back for me at the
beginning<00:00:38.030> it<00:00:38.570> was<00:00:38.600> pushing<00:00:39.170> heavier<00:00:39.559> weight

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
beginning it was pushing heavier weight

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.970 
beginning it was pushing heavier weight
with<00:00:40.300> less<00:00:41.300> reps<00:00:41.630> but<00:00:42.470> I've<00:00:42.559> been<00:00:42.710> really

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
with less reps but I've been really

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.710 
with less reps but I've been really
getting<00:00:43.280> after<00:00:43.610> these<00:00:43.790> hamstrings<00:00:44.480> and

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
getting after these hamstrings and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.869 
getting after these hamstrings and
glutes<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.500> putting<00:00:46.100> in<00:00:46.190> some<00:00:46.400> calves<00:00:46.640> work

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
glutes and putting in some calves work

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.820 
glutes and putting in some calves work
my<00:00:47.330> diet<00:00:47.570> has<00:00:47.900> been<00:00:47.930> changing<00:00:48.530> just

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
my diet has been changing just

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.799 
my diet has been changing just
dramatically<00:00:49.550> because<00:00:49.850> I<00:00:50.059> wanted<00:00:50.420> to<00:00:50.540> drop<00:00:50.750> a

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
dramatically because I wanted to drop a

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.210 
dramatically because I wanted to drop a
little<00:00:50.989> bit<00:00:51.170> more<00:00:51.440> so<00:00:51.559> we'd<00:00:51.739> had<00:00:51.890> to<00:00:52.010> take<00:00:52.190> a

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
little bit more so we'd had to take a

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.710 
little bit more so we'd had to take a
lot<00:00:52.430> more<00:00:52.640> calories<00:00:52.820> out

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
lot more calories out

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.110 
lot more calories out
not<00:00:54.110> really<00:00:54.260> calories<00:00:54.739> but<00:00:54.949> my<00:00:55.519> carbs<00:00:55.879> and

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
not really calories but my carbs and

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.020 
not really calories but my carbs and
stuff<00:00:56.360> so<00:00:57.320> I'm<00:00:57.409> really<00:00:57.769> home<00:00:58.129> carbs<00:00:58.670> right<00:00:58.909> now

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
stuff so I'm really home carbs right now

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.009 
stuff so I'm really home carbs right now
if<00:00:59.210> you<00:00:59.330> can't<00:00:59.570> tell<00:01:00.970> Gregg<00:01:01.970> really<00:01:02.659> just

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019

and<00:01:12.530> what<00:01:12.680> we<00:01:12.830> need<00:01:12.979> to<00:01:13.100> do<00:01:13.250> as<00:01:13.400> far<00:01:13.640> as<00:01:13.700> weight

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
and what we need to do as far as weight

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.930 
and what we need to do as far as weight
and<00:01:14.180> repetitions<00:01:14.900> and<00:01:15.229> how<00:01:15.680> far<00:01:15.979> along<00:01:16.340> and

throughout the course of this prep we've

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.620 
throughout the course of this prep we've
we<00:01:26.530> prioritized<00:01:27.280> her<00:01:27.580> shoulder<00:01:28.000> training<00:01:28.420> in

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
we prioritized her shoulder training in

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.080 
we prioritized her shoulder training in
the<00:01:29.080> upper<00:01:29.320> body<00:01:29.530> so<00:01:29.860> we<00:01:30.430> generally<00:01:30.910> start

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
the upper body so we generally start

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.360 
the upper body so we generally start
with<00:01:31.450> a<00:01:32.140> military<00:01:32.770> press

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
with a military press

a<00:01:35.740> barbell<00:01:36.490> military<00:01:36.970> press<00:01:37.470> should<00:01:38.470> usually

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
a barbell military press should usually

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.450 
a barbell military press should usually
do<00:01:39.150> straight<00:01:40.150> sets<00:01:40.450> between<00:01:41.410> 10<00:01:41.710> and<00:01:41.740> 20<00:01:42.220> reps

do straight sets between 10 and 20 reps

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.980 
do straight sets between 10 and 20 reps
depending<00:01:42.940> on<00:01:43.030> what<00:01:43.270> point<00:01:43.570> of<00:01:43.660> the<00:01:43.750> prep

we're in the 10 rep range primarily from

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.170 
we're in the 10 rep range primarily from
there<00:01:49.930> we'll<00:01:50.410> do<00:01:50.560> side<00:01:51.190> laterals<00:01:51.730> to<00:01:51.970> help

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
there we'll do side laterals to help

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.360 
there we'll do side laterals to help
bring<00:01:52.450> out<00:01:52.600> her<00:01:53.200> side<00:01:53.500> delts<00:01:53.950> and<00:01:54.100> keep<00:01:54.220> our

bring out her side delts and keep our
shoulders<00:01:54.550> full<00:01:55.090> looking<00:01:55.540> and<00:01:56.470> then<00:01:56.620> for<00:01:56.830> rear

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
shoulders full looking and then for rear

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.070 
shoulders full looking and then for rear
delts<00:01:57.340> you<00:01:57.520> see<00:01:57.730> that<00:01:57.910> we're<00:01:58.060> doing<00:01:58.180> a<00:01:58.480> partial

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
delts you see that we're doing a partial

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.130 
delts you see that we're doing a partial
movement<00:01:59.770> I<00:02:00.010> want<00:02:00.850> to<00:02:00.910> be<00:02:01.030> able<00:02:01.300> to<00:02:01.480> develop

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
movement I want to be able to develop

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.200 
movement I want to be able to develop
for<00:02:02.350> rear<00:02:02.500> delt<00:02:02.710> muscles<00:02:03.130> without<00:02:03.550> developing

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
for rear delt muscles without developing

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.110 
for rear delt muscles without developing
or<00:02:04.420> her<00:02:04.690> middle<00:02:04.900> back<00:02:05.170> too<00:02:05.470> much<00:02:05.650> so<00:02:06.340> you<00:02:06.970> just

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
or her middle back too much so you just

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.430 
or her middle back too much so you just
kind<00:02:07.330> of<00:02:07.360> have<00:02:07.480> to<00:02:07.600> play<00:02:07.750> with<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:08.080> movements

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
kind of have to play with the movements

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.200 
kind of have to play with the movements
we<00:02:08.560> do<00:02:08.680> a<00:02:08.710> lot<00:02:08.950> of<00:02:08.980> partial<00:02:09.520> movements<00:02:10.000> in

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
we do a lot of partial movements in

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.330 
we do a lot of partial movements in
order<00:02:10.480> to<00:02:10.660> get<00:02:11.380> certain<00:02:11.710> muscles<00:02:12.070> without

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
order to get certain muscles without

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.920 
order to get certain muscles without
hitting<00:02:12.550> ones<00:02:12.880> that<00:02:13.060> we<00:02:13.180> don't<00:02:13.330> want<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.720> over

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
hitting ones that we don't want to over

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.440 
hitting ones that we don't want to over
develop<00:02:14.410> we<00:02:14.800> do<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:14.950> variety<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.700> back<00:02:15.970> training

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
develop we do a variety of back training

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.630 
develop we do a variety of back training
different<00:02:17.050> grips<00:02:17.440> on<00:02:17.650> pull<00:02:17.860> downs<00:02:18.100> different

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
different grips on pull downs different

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.330 
different grips on pull downs different
kinds<00:02:18.910> of<00:02:19.000> rows<00:02:19.210> a<00:02:19.570> lot<00:02:20.290> of<00:02:20.380> hyper<00:02:20.590> extensions

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
kinds of rows a lot of hyper extensions

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.980 
kinds of rows a lot of hyper extensions
to<00:02:21.550> really<00:02:21.820> fill<00:02:22.090> in<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:22.540> tighten<00:02:22.870> up<00:02:22.930> her

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
to really fill in and tighten up her

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.200 
to really fill in and tighten up her
lower<00:02:23.320> back<00:02:23.650> which<00:02:23.950> is<00:02:24.100> important<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:24.880> as<00:02:25.030> far

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
lower back which is important and as far

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.970 
lower back which is important and as far
as<00:02:25.330> everybody<00:02:25.600> goes<00:02:25.930> that's<00:02:26.140> really<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.620> lot

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
as everybody goes that's really it a lot

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.490 
as everybody goes that's really it a lot
of<00:02:27.100> abs<00:02:27.280> keep<00:02:28.270> your<00:02:28.330> core<00:02:28.780> tight<00:02:29.020> you<00:02:29.440> have

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
of abs keep your core tight you have

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.070 
of abs keep your core tight you have
great<00:02:29.830> ABS<00:02:30.070> we<00:02:30.940> don't<00:02:31.120> use<00:02:31.270> any<00:02:31.510> weights<00:02:31.810> when

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
great ABS we don't use any weights when

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.260 
great ABS we don't use any weights when
we<00:02:32.200> do<00:02:32.350> half<00:02:32.530> training<00:02:33.040> all<00:02:33.760> body<00:02:34.000> weight

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
we do half training all body weight

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.270 
we do half training all body weight
stuff<00:02:34.570> just<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:34.959> keep<00:02:35.110> her<00:02:35.290> waist<00:02:35.500> small<00:02:35.920> and

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
stuff just to keep her waist small and

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.330 
stuff just to keep her waist small and
toned<00:02:36.600> width<00:02:37.600> on<00:02:37.990> under<00:02:38.380> quads<00:02:38.680> developed

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
toned width on under quads developed

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.040 
toned width on under quads developed
very<00:02:39.610> quickly<00:02:39.700> when<00:02:40.330> we<00:02:40.420> started<00:02:40.750> training

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
very quickly when we started training

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.470 
very quickly when we started training
her<00:02:41.260> so<00:02:41.830> her<00:02:42.070> lower<00:02:42.580> body<00:02:42.850> training<00:02:43.120> has

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
her so her lower body training has

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.170 
her so her lower body training has
evolved<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.080> lot<00:02:44.230> from<00:02:44.680> where<00:02:45.520> we<00:02:45.640> once<00:02:45.940> we're

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
evolved a lot from where we once we're

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.900 
evolved a lot from where we once we're
doing<00:02:46.480> lots<00:02:46.660> of<00:02:46.840> squats<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:48.130> full<00:02:48.550> range<00:02:48.790> of

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
doing lots of squats and full range of

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.850 
doing lots of squats and full range of
motion<00:02:49.060> like<00:02:49.450> presses<00:02:49.900> now<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.230> whole<00:02:50.590> goal

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
motion like presses now the whole goal

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.190 
motion like presses now the whole goal
is<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.459> make<00:02:51.730> her<00:02:52.000> glutes<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.720> hamstrings

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
is to make her glutes and hamstrings

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.590 
is to make her glutes and hamstrings
grow<00:02:53.560> without<00:02:54.340> getting<00:02:54.760> your<00:02:54.850> quads<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.420> grow

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
grow without getting your quads to grow

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.990 
grow without getting your quads to grow
anymore<00:02:55.989> because<00:02:56.350> they<00:02:56.590> are<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:57.580> right<00:02:57.760> size

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
anymore because they are the right size

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.030 
anymore because they are the right size
and<00:02:58.330> they<00:02:58.600> grow<00:02:58.840> easy<00:02:59.140> so<00:02:59.470> we<00:02:59.590> have<00:02:59.709> to<00:02:59.800> be<00:02:59.890> very

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
and they grow easy so we have to be very

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.100 
and they grow easy so we have to be very
careful<00:03:00.550> with<00:03:00.640> that<00:03:00.700> so<00:03:01.120> we<00:03:01.540> start<00:03:01.870> with<00:03:01.989> the

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
careful with that so we start with the

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.920 
careful with that so we start with the
glute<00:03:02.350> kickback<00:03:02.380> machine<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:04.000> on<00:03:04.450> every<00:03:04.750> leg

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
glute kickback machine and on every leg

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.140 
glute kickback machine and on every leg
workout<00:03:05.290> just<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.770> help<00:03:05.920> grow<00:03:06.489> our<00:03:06.520> glutes<00:03:06.910> and

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
workout just to help grow our glutes and

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.910 
workout just to help grow our glutes and
we'll<00:03:07.300> do<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.480> lot<00:03:07.870> of<00:03:07.900> stuff<00:03:08.230> like<00:03:08.410> that<00:03:08.590> lifts

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
we'll do a lot of stuff like that lifts

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.210 
we'll do a lot of stuff like that lifts
a<00:03:09.430> lot<00:03:09.940> of<00:03:10.060> leg<00:03:10.270> curls<00:03:10.630> for<00:03:10.870> hamstrings<00:03:11.440> the

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
a lot of leg curls for hamstrings the

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.570 
a lot of leg curls for hamstrings the
only<00:03:12.520> quad<00:03:12.850> work<00:03:13.209> that<00:03:13.480> she<00:03:13.660> gets<00:03:13.870> as<00:03:14.200> just

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
only quad work that she gets as just

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.270 
only quad work that she gets as just
squats<00:03:15.580> and<00:03:15.940> lunges<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:16.989> even<00:03:17.680> on<00:03:17.800> her<00:03:17.920> squats

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
squats and lunges and even on her squats

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.850 
squats and lunges and even on her squats
and<00:03:18.640> like<00:03:18.820> you<00:03:18.940> see<00:03:19.150> when<00:03:19.420> we're<00:03:19.570> doing

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
and like you see when we're doing

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.200 
and like you see when we're doing
dumbbell<00:03:20.860> squats<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.640> when<00:03:22.060> we

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
dumbbell squats and when we

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.460 
dumbbell squats and when we
doing<00:03:22.660> leg<00:03:23.590> press<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.190> single<00:03:24.700> leg<00:03:24.880> leg<00:03:25.090> press

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
doing leg press and single leg leg press

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.470 
doing leg press and single leg leg press
we<00:03:26.470> use<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.650> partial<00:03:27.100> range<00:03:27.490> of<00:03:27.640> motion<00:03:27.970> so<00:03:28.270> that

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
we use a partial range of motion so that

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.050 
we use a partial range of motion so that
she's<00:03:29.470> using<00:03:29.680> her<00:03:29.950> glutes<00:03:30.220> and<00:03:30.370> hamstrings<00:03:30.850> at

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
she's using her glutes and hamstrings at

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.820 
she's using her glutes and hamstrings at
the<00:03:31.150> bottom<00:03:31.450> of<00:03:31.570> the<00:03:31.630> movement<00:03:32.050> but<00:03:32.260> we<00:03:32.410> limits

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
the bottom of the movement but we limits

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.100 
the bottom of the movement but we limits
the<00:03:33.550> amount<00:03:33.640> of<00:03:33.880> quad<00:03:34.120> involvement<00:03:34.690> she<00:03:34.870> gets

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
the amount of quad involvement she gets

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.980 
the amount of quad involvement she gets
so<00:03:35.500> she's<00:03:35.680> not<00:03:35.830> using<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.280> top<00:03:36.490> half<00:03:36.760> of<00:03:37.630> a

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
so she's not using the top half of a

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.770 
so she's not using the top half of a
movement<00:03:38.200> that<00:03:38.830> stimulates<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.490> quads<00:03:39.780> so

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
movement that stimulates the quads so

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.630 
movement that stimulates the quads so
with<00:03:41.050> her<00:03:41.170> it's<00:03:41.410> just<00:03:41.650> it's<00:03:41.920> kind<00:03:42.160> of<00:03:42.250> tricking

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
with her it's just it's kind of tricking

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.360 
with her it's just it's kind of tricking
tricking<00:03:43.180> her<00:03:43.300> body<00:03:43.990> to<00:03:44.260> only<00:03:44.440> use<00:03:44.740> the<00:03:45.190> body

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
tricking her body to only use the body

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.130 
tricking her body to only use the body
parts<00:03:45.730> that<00:03:45.820> we<00:03:46.030> want<00:03:46.240> to<00:03:46.300> use<00:03:46.480> keep<00:03:46.900> her<00:03:46.990> from

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
parts that we want to use keep her from

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.260 
parts that we want to use keep her from
over<00:03:47.320> developing<00:03:47.860> your<00:03:47.950> quads<00:03:48.190> so<00:03:48.640> that's<00:03:49.090> our

focus when we're in the gym training

00:03:50.740 --> 00:04:01.910 
focus when we're in the gym training
