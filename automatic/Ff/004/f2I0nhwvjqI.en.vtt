the bottom side of the leg there but

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.950 
the bottom side of the leg there but
again<00:02:05.790> they<00:02:06.000> could<00:02:06.149> use<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> little<00:02:06.420> bit<00:02:06.780> more

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
entry and exit from the top if you want

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.330 
entry and exit from the top if you want
it<00:02:24.299> very<00:02:24.840> simply<00:02:25.349> like<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.560> notice<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.129> mesh

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
it very simply like that notice the mesh

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.429 
it very simply like that notice the mesh
liner<00:02:26.610> on<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:26.849> inside<00:02:27.060> it's<00:02:27.629> gonna<00:02:27.750> be<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:28.049> the

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
liner on the inside it's gonna be a the

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:29.720 
liner on the inside it's gonna be a the
ability<00:02:28.709> to<00:02:28.769> have<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:28.920> be<00:02:29.129> more<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.459> slip

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
ability to have that be more of a slip

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.190 
ability to have that be more of a slip
liner<00:02:29.939> so<00:02:30.329> it's<00:02:30.480> gonna<00:02:30.599> allow<00:02:30.840> some<00:02:31.049> air

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
liner so it's gonna allow some air

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.449 
liner so it's gonna allow some air
circulation<00:02:31.620> but<00:02:31.829> it's<00:02:31.950> actually<00:02:32.189> not<00:02:32.220> going

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
circulation but it's actually not going

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.470 
circulation but it's actually not going
to<00:02:32.519> stick<00:02:32.760> against<00:02:33.030> your<00:02:33.150> pants<00:02:33.390> if<00:02:33.450> you

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
want but again it's that gore-tex liner

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.289 
want but again it's that gore-tex liner
which<00:02:52.769> is<00:02:52.920> going<00:02:53.129> to<00:02:53.220> be<00:02:53.310> baked<00:02:53.609> in<00:02:53.879> it's<00:02:54.209> a

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
which is going to be baked in it's a

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.910 
which is going to be baked in it's a
floating<00:02:54.629> liner<00:02:54.930> there's<00:02:55.200> no<00:02:55.349> venting<00:02:55.739> here

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
floating liner there's no venting here

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.309 
floating liner there's no venting here
but<00:02:56.250> really<00:02:56.370> this<00:02:56.639> pant<00:02:56.909> is<00:02:57.120> designed<00:02:57.690> for

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
but really this pant is designed for

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.960 
but really this pant is designed for
inclement<00:02:58.859> weather<00:02:59.040> it's<00:02:59.459> designed<00:02:59.849> for

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
inclement weather it's designed for

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.910 
inclement weather it's designed for
potentially<00:03:00.599> cooler<00:03:00.930> season<00:03:01.260> riding<00:03:01.439> so

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
potentially cooler season riding so

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.490 
potentially cooler season riding so
think<00:03:02.159> about<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.430> more<00:03:02.609> in<00:03:02.870> that<00:03:03.870> fall<00:03:04.170> arena

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
think about it more in that fall arena

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.319 
think about it more in that fall arena
maybe<00:03:05.069> in<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.400> spring<00:03:05.760> arena<00:03:06.090> maybe

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
maybe in that spring arena maybe

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:07.789 
maybe in that spring arena maybe
stretching<00:03:06.659> into<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.049> winter<00:03:07.230> depending<00:03:07.709> on

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
stretching into the winter depending on

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.319 
stretching into the winter depending on
what<00:03:07.920> your<00:03:08.040> base<00:03:08.220> or<00:03:08.430> mid<00:03:08.609> layer<00:03:08.760> setup<00:03:09.150> looks

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
what your base or mid layer setup looks

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:10.910 
what your base or mid layer setup looks
like<00:03:09.510> but<00:03:09.840> again<00:03:10.079> you<00:03:10.230> do<00:03:10.379> have<00:03:10.409> some<00:03:10.769> of<00:03:10.829> the

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
like but again you do have some of the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.170 
like but again you do have some of the
pro<00:03:11.040> shape<00:03:11.250> armor<00:03:11.549> and<00:03:11.700> you're<00:03:11.790> making<00:03:12.060> more

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
pro shape armor and you're making more

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.580 
pro shape armor and you're making more
you're<00:03:12.389> making<00:03:12.659> more<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.840> an<00:03:12.959> investment<00:03:13.260> in

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
you're making more of an investment in

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.780 
you're making more of an investment in
the<00:03:13.920> gore-tex<00:03:14.129> side<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:14.579> things<00:03:14.730> for

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
the gore-tex side of things for

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
the back very very simple elastication

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.089

at the top again giving you that
flexibility<00:03:20.639> factor<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.209> can<00:03:21.329> see<00:03:21.480> down<00:03:21.629> the

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
flexibility factor you can see down the

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.720 
flexibility factor you can see down the
back<00:03:21.959> nothing<00:03:22.560> special<00:03:22.769> going<00:03:22.919> on<00:03:23.160> there<00:03:23.370> come

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
back nothing special going on there come

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.800

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
back around to the front for me and

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.539 
back around to the front for me and
again<00:03:25.079> the<00:03:25.349> other<00:03:25.379> piece<00:03:25.859> are<00:03:26.010> reflective<00:03:26.430> on

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
again the other piece are reflective on

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.069 
again the other piece are reflective on
the<00:03:26.609> front<00:03:26.849> would<00:03:27.180> be<00:03:27.209> on<00:03:27.389> the<00:03:27.480> left<00:03:27.690> side<00:03:27.870> you

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
the front would be on the left side you

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.990 
the front would be on the left side you
are<00:03:28.199> going<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.500> have<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.680> diamond<00:03:28.980> logo<00:03:29.489> from

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.670 
are going to have a diamond logo from
Diana<00:03:30.389> so<00:03:30.449> you<00:03:30.599> can<00:03:30.750> see<00:03:30.900> that<00:03:31.079> right<00:03:31.230> there<00:03:31.500> I
