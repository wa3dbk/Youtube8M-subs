00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.430
 30 times 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.650
 they slept the little else falls 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.770
 they would not like it themselves 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.510
 If you were insured, you would be right back 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:38.070
 not only asked for the charm 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.640
 increase if I knew that I am them 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.640
 what to take away 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.839
 I ask you for help I do not know 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.690
 how many of your sons of the 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:57.719
 know past 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.250
 That's why I come to the one you should have 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.559
 told me then that your ship in 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.930
 storm would have fallen 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:07.289
 if you did not die 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:10.369
 What about Robert King? What about ? 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:14.130
 my husband is not around the thing 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.810
 one thing must be clear between us you 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.000
 can not my business 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.340
 take care of 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.649
 Klaus I want you ready I can 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.610
 I slept talking there are certainly 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.479
 a possibility the thing still 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.929
 to dissuade see quite a draw 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.049
 from one in which business can win 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:36.440
 but I have a military career 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.920
 I am only with the hessian regiment 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.709
 my condition 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.259
 but only if our Greek 2 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:45.149
 No one from the same regiment gives up 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.679
 every fall creek that stayed in 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.990
 of course the risk was the same 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.149
 the hessian broadcast knew when it came to 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.189
 money has such a project then 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.109
 he stands for that that really 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.600
 really great and the big one 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:59.430
 TV cinema will be so from 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.170
 hatchback is I think the Hessian 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.240
 Broadcasting not as big and like yourself 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.119
 it turned out to be a giant 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.880
 Success has been repeated 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.150
 and now after this year 40 years 44 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.799
 Years, it comes just this in this 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.370
 set of television jewels 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.370
 I have to go 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:31.100
 to donate one of the foreigners 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.600
 I think we love the crowd 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:38.220
 The return is immediately through the 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:41.790
 alley camera Sunday before come before 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.710
 to beat everything 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.270
 I say all and who is not right 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.270
 Strolls are through the alley 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.870
 that was our first the law in general 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.590
 Washington commissioned me this 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.300
 align 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.000
 He thinks he has a right to it 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.040
 He is one of the first to know 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.330
 I also thank you for the gunpowder 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.060

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:23.880
 wound brought here 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:26.010
 you want it all the way in 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:31.650
 to switch my country and let 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:34.380

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.900

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.420
