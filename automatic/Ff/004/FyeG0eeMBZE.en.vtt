our

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:00.740 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.220 

this<00:01:01.340> is<00:01:01.610> an<00:01:01.850> alternative<00:01:02.270> energy<00:01:02.690> city<00:01:02.960> we

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
this is an alternative energy city we

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.380 
this is an alternative energy city we
have<00:01:03.440> windmills<00:01:03.890> solar<00:01:04.370> panels<00:01:04.880> and<00:01:05.059> then<00:01:05.330> we

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
have windmills solar panels and then we

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.180 
have windmills solar panels and then we
also<00:01:05.540> have<00:01:05.720> a<00:01:05.840> scale<00:01:06.200> model<00:01:06.470> of<00:01:06.710> Folsom<00:01:07.160> dam

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
also have a scale model of Folsom dam

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.040 
also have a scale model of Folsom dam
the<00:01:07.580> water<00:01:07.790> is<00:01:07.970> forced<00:01:08.300> through<00:01:08.480> this<00:01:08.690> pipe

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
the water is forced through this pipe

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.590 
the water is forced through this pipe
which<00:01:09.350> spins<00:01:09.800> a<00:01:10.040> turbine<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:10.910> that<00:01:11.240> makes

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
which spins a turbine and that makes

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.770 
which spins a turbine and that makes
energy<00:01:12.400> we've<00:01:13.400> gotten<00:01:13.730> as<00:01:13.820> high<00:01:14.000> as<00:01:14.210> 10<00:01:14.540> volt

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
energy we've gotten as high as 10 volt

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.240 
energy we've gotten as high as 10 volt
so<00:01:14.990> that's<00:01:15.140> almost<00:01:15.410> enough<00:01:15.560> to<00:01:15.710> start<00:01:15.950> a<00:01:16.040> car

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
so that's almost enough to start a car

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.820 
so that's almost enough to start a car
making<00:01:16.910> energy<00:01:17.240> just<00:01:17.690> by<00:01:17.780> or<00:01:17.990> so<00:01:18.200> this<00:01:18.590> easy

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
making energy just by or so this easy

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.910 
making energy just by or so this easy
could<00:01:19.730> change<00:01:20.120> a<00:01:20.300> lot<00:01:20.390> of<00:01:20.570> people's<00:01:21.200> lives<00:01:21.320> all

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
could change a lot of people's lives all

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.070 
could change a lot of people's lives all
our<00:01:22.190> imagination<00:01:22.820> is<00:01:23.000> it's<00:01:23.300> endless<00:01:23.690> and<00:01:23.900> I

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
our imagination is it's endless and I

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.390 
our imagination is it's endless and I
think<00:01:24.140> that<00:01:24.530> if<00:01:24.620> we<00:01:24.740> just<00:01:24.920> keep<00:01:25.100> finding

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
think that if we just keep finding

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.010 
think that if we just keep finding
something<00:01:25.730> new<00:01:25.820> to<00:01:26.120> create<00:01:26.450> then<00:01:26.720> we'll<00:01:26.930> be

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
something new to create then we'll be

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.980 
something new to create then we'll be
able<00:01:27.050> to<00:01:27.290> change<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.890> world<00:01:28.690> how<00:01:29.690> are<00:01:29.870> you

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
able to change the world how are you

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.750 
able to change the world how are you
using<00:01:30.200> your<00:01:30.470> students<00:01:30.830> imaginations<00:01:31.490> to

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
using your students imaginations to

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.000 
using your students imaginations to
create<00:01:32.390> these<00:01:32.630> amazing<00:01:32.690> things<00:01:33.110> from<00:01:33.920> the

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
create these amazing things from the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.380 
create these amazing things from the
very<00:01:34.280> beginning<00:01:34.490> as<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:34.970> students<00:01:35.300> are

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
very beginning as the students are

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.610 
very beginning as the students are
starting<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.660> think<00:01:35.870> about<00:01:35.990> designing<00:01:36.410> this

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
starting to think about designing this

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.469 
starting to think about designing this
alternative<00:01:37.040> energy<00:01:37.400> city<00:01:37.610> they<00:01:38.060> start<00:01:38.360> to

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
alternative energy city they start to

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.270 
alternative energy city they start to
realize<00:01:38.750> there<00:01:38.990> is<00:01:39.110> no<00:01:39.260> limits<00:01:39.619> they<00:01:39.979> have

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
realize there is no limits they have

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.530 
realize there is no limits they have
that<00:01:40.490> imagination<00:01:41.030> they<00:01:41.240> have<00:01:41.390> that

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
that imagination they have that

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.880 
that imagination they have that
creativity<00:01:41.930> they<00:01:42.229> know<00:01:42.380> that<00:01:42.560> there's<00:01:42.740> no

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
creativity they know that there's no

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.740 
creativity they know that there's no
real<00:01:43.130> wrong<00:01:43.369> way<00:01:43.610> to<00:01:43.670> do<00:01:43.910> something<00:01:44.360> and<00:01:44.540> just

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
real wrong way to do something and just

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.780 
real wrong way to do something and just
letting<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.260> students<00:01:45.680> be<00:01:45.979> students<00:01:46.460> these

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
letting the students be students these

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.580 
letting the students be students these
students<00:01:47.180> prove<00:01:47.450> that<00:01:47.900> with<00:01:48.080> their<00:01:48.200> limitless

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
students prove that with their limitless

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.920 
students prove that with their limitless
imaginations<00:01:49.280> we<00:01:49.729> can<00:01:49.880> time<00:01:50.180> your<00:01:50.420> new<00:01:50.660> broke

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
imaginations we can time your new broke

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.560 
imaginations we can time your new broke
so<00:01:51.619> I<00:01:51.650> wanted<00:01:52.040> to<00:01:52.100> check<00:01:52.400> in<00:01:52.610> with<00:01:52.820> pioneers<00:01:53.420> of

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
so I wanted to check in with pioneers of

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.110 
so I wanted to check in with pioneers of
a<00:01:53.630> different<00:01:53.960> kind

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.660 

I<00:01:57.210> think<00:01:58.020> there's<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.320> myth<00:01:58.620> out<00:01:58.800> there<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.100> in

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
I think there's a myth out there that in

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.160 
I think there's a myth out there that in
mathematics<00:02:00.210> there's<00:02:00.420> sort<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.720> recipe

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
mathematics there's sort of a recipe

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.630 
mathematics there's sort of a recipe
that<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.470> follow<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.950> know<00:02:02.070> first<00:02:02.400> you<00:02:02.490> do

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
that you follow you know first you do

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.580 
that you follow you know first you do
this<00:02:02.760> and<00:02:03.060> then<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.270> do<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.600> which<00:02:04.230> doesn't

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
this and then you do that which doesn't

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.830 
this and then you do that which doesn't
sound<00:02:04.830> very<00:02:05.220> creative<00:02:05.910> but<00:02:06.120> the<00:02:06.540> problems

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
sound very creative but the problems

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.020 
sound very creative but the problems
that<00:02:06.870> we<00:02:07.080> typically<00:02:07.530> work<00:02:07.770> on<00:02:07.980> here<00:02:08.430> are<00:02:08.670> ones

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
that we typically work on here are ones

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.260 
that we typically work on here are ones
where<00:02:09.570> there's<00:02:10.229> nothing<00:02:10.920> much<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.880> tap<00:02:12.060> into

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
where there's nothing much to tap into

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.540 
where there's nothing much to tap into
other<00:02:12.510> than<00:02:12.720> imaginations<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.860> imagination

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
other than imaginations the imagination

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.520 
other than imaginations the imagination
starts<00:02:14.820> with<00:02:15.240> of<00:02:15.510> course<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.750> director<00:02:16.320> and

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
starts with of course the director and

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.500 
starts with of course the director and
his<00:02:16.590> vision<00:02:17.040> for<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.370> film<00:02:17.640> then<00:02:18.240> there's<00:02:18.450> the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
his vision for the film then there's the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.810 
his vision for the film then there's the
imagination<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.650> artists<00:02:20.190> designing<00:02:20.730> the

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
imagination of the artists designing the

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.640 
imagination of the artists designing the
worlds<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.360> looks<00:02:21.660> at<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.930> characters<00:02:22.380> and

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
worlds and looks at the characters and

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.190 
worlds and looks at the characters and
then<00:02:23.400> as<00:02:23.520> technologists<00:02:24.300> we<00:02:24.480> have<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.780> find

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
then as technologists we have to find

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.070 
then as technologists we have to find
ways<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.710> building<00:02:26.160> tools<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:27.660> bring<00:02:27.870> those

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
ways of building tools to bring those

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.230 
ways of building tools to bring those
worlds<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.650> those<00:02:28.830> characters<00:02:29.280> polite<00:02:29.730> I'm<00:02:30.180> a

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
worlds and those characters polite I'm a

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.240 
worlds and those characters polite I'm a
director<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.050> photography<00:02:31.260> for<00:02:31.830> lighting<00:02:32.130> I

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
director of photography for lighting I

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.550 
director of photography for lighting I
have<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.550> shot<00:02:32.820> from<00:02:33.210> wally<00:02:33.780> up<00:02:34.080> so<00:02:34.440> we're

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
have a shot from wally up so we're

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.870 
have a shot from wally up so we're
starting<00:02:34.710> to<00:02:34.920> build<00:02:35.130> up<00:02:35.280> this<00:02:35.460> world<00:02:35.700> but

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
starting to build up this world but

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.310 
starting to build up this world but
there<00:02:36.030> isn't<00:02:36.210> a<00:02:36.240> real<00:02:36.420> sense<00:02:36.660> of<00:02:36.780> where<00:02:37.020> any<00:02:37.230> of

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
there isn't a real sense of where any of

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.930 
there isn't a real sense of where any of
the<00:02:37.500> light<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:37.830> coming<00:02:38.040> from<00:02:38.160> or<00:02:38.580> what<00:02:38.700> time<00:02:38.910> of

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
the light is coming from or what time of

the light is coming from or what time of
day<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.360> is<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.780> can't<00:02:40.050> see<00:02:40.350> Wally<00:02:40.680> in<00:02:40.860> here

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
day it is you can't see Wally in here

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.340 
day it is you can't see Wally in here
he's<00:02:41.130> actually<00:02:41.310> down<00:02:41.700> here<00:02:42.060> teeny<00:02:42.420> tiny<00:02:42.750> we

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
he's actually down here teeny tiny we

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.810 
he's actually down here teeny tiny we
have<00:02:43.500> all<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.770> these<00:02:43.890> tricks<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.490> we<00:02:44.580> learned

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
have all of these tricks that we learned

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.820 
have all of these tricks that we learned
over<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.150> course<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.510> Wally<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:46.440> make<00:02:46.620> him

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
over the course of Wally to make him

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.960 
over the course of Wally to make him
show<00:02:47.010> up<00:02:47.130> we<00:02:47.250> hit<00:02:47.430> him<00:02:47.520> with<00:02:47.670> some<00:02:47.820> bright

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
show up we hit him with some bright

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.300 
show up we hit him with some bright
light<00:02:48.210> we<00:02:48.420> give<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.960> very<00:02:49.410> bright<00:02:49.710> trail<00:02:50.100> of

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
light we give a a very bright trail of

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.370 
light we give a a very bright trail of
dust<00:02:50.580> behind<00:02:50.880> him<00:02:51.270> so<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.540> very<00:02:51.870> least<00:02:52.110> see

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
dust behind him so you very least see

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.500 
dust behind him so you very least see
that<00:02:52.560> he's<00:02:52.710> their<00:02:52.950> technology<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:53.940> huge

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
that he's their technology is a huge

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.870 
that he's their technology is a huge
piece<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:55.230> but<00:02:55.650> how<00:02:55.980> do<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.760> the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
piece of this but how do you and the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.030 
piece of this but how do you and the
rest<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.210> the<00:02:57.330> team<00:02:57.540> use<00:02:58.290> your<00:02:58.440> imagination<00:02:58.500> is

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
rest of the team use your imagination is

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.000 
rest of the team use your imagination is
to<00:02:59.310> create<00:02:59.640> these<00:02:59.820> great<00:03:00.180> new<00:03:00.480> worlds<00:03:01.230> for<00:03:01.410> me

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
to create these great new worlds for me

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.800 
to create these great new worlds for me
lighting<00:03:02.430> is<00:03:02.520> perfect<00:03:02.880> combination<00:03:03.360> of

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
it is all based on imagination because
