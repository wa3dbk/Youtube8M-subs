00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
interesting that took a turn for the

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.460 
interesting that took a turn for the
worst<00:03:22.180> like<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:25.239> fast<00:03:25.569> I<00:03:26.020> don't<00:03:26.260> know<00:03:26.319> how<00:03:26.440> I

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.270 
felt about that it was all going so well
and<00:03:28.420> then<00:03:28.750> it<00:03:28.930> just<00:03:29.050> was<00:03:29.200> just<00:03:29.230> like<00:03:29.470> no<00:03:29.860> big

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
that kind of contradicted the creative

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.910 
creative again never be creative again
and<00:03:43.510> just<00:03:43.720> by<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:43.959> way<00:03:44.049> guys<00:03:44.200> that<00:03:44.410> said<00:03:44.620> green

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
and just by the way guys that said green

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.320 
and just by the way guys that said green
is<00:03:45.069> not<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.250> creative<00:03:45.670> color<00:03:45.790> but<00:03:46.060> i'm<00:03:46.150> pretty

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
is not a creative color but i'm pretty

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.880 
is not a creative color but i'm pretty
sure<00:03:46.450> green<00:03:46.870> is<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.140> most<00:03:47.350> creative<00:03:47.530> color

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
sure green is the most creative color

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.990 
sure green is the most creative color
because<00:03:48.190> if<00:03:48.280> you<00:03:48.370> see<00:03:48.580> green<00:03:48.850> it

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
because if you see green it

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.130 
because if you see green it
automatically<00:03:49.480> makes<00:03:49.600> you<00:03:49.750> more<00:03:49.870> creative
