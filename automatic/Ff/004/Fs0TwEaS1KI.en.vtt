[Music]
all<00:00:12.299> right<00:00:12.450> so<00:00:12.629> what<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:12.990> difference

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:13.379 
all right so what is the difference

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.689 
all right so what is the difference
between<00:00:14.480> the<00:00:15.480> f-number<00:00:16.470> on<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> lens<00:00:17.189> so<00:00:17.490> what

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
between the f-number on a lens so what

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.999 
between the f-number on a lens so what
is<00:00:17.849> what<00:00:18.150> does<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.390> f-number<00:00:18.750> mean<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:19.380> yeah

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:20.009 
is what does the f-number mean so yeah

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:21.859 
is what does the f-number mean so yeah
I've<00:00:20.130> got<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.310> 70<00:00:20.700> to<00:00:20.820> 200<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.480> here<00:00:21.599> I've<00:00:21.689> got<00:00:21.750> a

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
I've got a 70 to 200 and here I've got a

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.260 
I've got a 70 to 200 and here I've got a
70<00:00:22.259> to<00:00:22.380> 200<00:00:22.529> they're<00:00:23.009> the<00:00:23.130> same<00:00:23.400> focal<00:00:24.060> length

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
70 to 200 they're the same focal length

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.249 
70 to 200 they're the same focal length
lens<00:00:24.660> one's<00:00:25.560> an<00:00:25.740> f4<00:00:26.250> lens<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.880> one's<00:00:27.300> an<00:00:27.450> F<00:00:27.599> 2.8

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:28.259 
lens one's an f4 lens and one's an F 2.8

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.429 
lens one's an f4 lens and one's an F 2.8
lens<00:00:28.469> now<00:00:29.219> the<00:00:29.279> f4<00:00:30.180> lens<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> lot<00:00:30.930> skinnier

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
lens now the f4 lens is a lot skinnier

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.360 
lens now the f4 lens is a lot skinnier
than<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.340> F<00:00:32.910> 2.8<00:00:33.750> lens<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.170> it's<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:34.980> Hart

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
than the F 2.8 lens and it's a but Hart

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.090 
than the F 2.8 lens and it's a but Hart
the<00:00:35.579> weight<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.239> it's<00:00:36.840> also<00:00:36.989> about<00:00:37.440> half<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
the weight and it's also about half the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.740 
the weight and it's also about half the
price<00:00:38.300> so<00:00:39.300> why<00:00:40.200> do<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.500> spend<00:00:41.190> more<00:00:41.579> on<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.000> on

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
price so why do you spend more on a on

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.850 
price so why do you spend more on a on
the<00:00:43.620> same<00:00:43.829> focal<00:00:44.280> length<00:00:44.460> lens<00:00:45.710> but<00:00:46.710> you've

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
the same focal length lens but you've

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.160 
the same focal length lens but you've
got<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.250> bigger<00:00:48.030> aperture<00:00:48.420> well<00:00:48.810> basically

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
got a bigger aperture well basically

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.930 
got a bigger aperture well basically
it's<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.710> glass<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.310> a<00:00:50.370> glass<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.790> this

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
it's the glass it's a glass of this

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.830 
it's the glass it's a glass of this
lenses<00:00:51.390> there's<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:52.820> lot<00:00:53.820> more<00:00:54.180> glass<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.780> a

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
lenses there's a lot more glass and a

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.420 
lenses there's a lot more glass and a
lot<00:00:54.989> more<00:00:55.170> precision<00:00:55.530> engineering<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.370> goes

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
lot more precision engineering that goes

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.069 
lot more precision engineering that goes
into<00:00:56.870> AF<00:00:58.670> 2.8<00:00:59.670> lens<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.149> an<00:01:00.210> F<00:01:00.360> for<00:01:00.390> lenses<00:01:00.930> it

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
into AF 2.8 lens and an F for lenses it

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.830 
into AF 2.8 lens and an F for lenses it
even<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:01.890> even<00:01:02.130> one<00:01:02.280> stop<00:01:02.660> faster<00:01:03.660> that

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
even it's even one stop faster that

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.560 
even it's even one stop faster that
means<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.170> lets<00:01:04.320> do<00:01:04.500> twice<00:01:04.769> as<00:01:05.040> much<00:01:05.070> light<00:01:05.519> as

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
means it lets do twice as much light as

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.980 
means it lets do twice as much light as
an<00:01:06.920> f4<00:01:07.920> lens<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.490> F<00:01:08.670> 2.8<00:01:09.149> lets<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.509> twice<00:01:09.810> as

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
an f4 lens so the F 2.8 lets in twice as

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.219 
an f4 lens so the F 2.8 lets in twice as
much<00:01:10.140> light<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:10.380> air<00:01:10.649> for<00:01:10.950> lens<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.549> that

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
much light as air for lens and that

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.010 
much light as air for lens and that
comes<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.710> basically<00:01:14.340> gives<00:01:14.700> me<00:01:14.790> a

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
comes and that basically gives me a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.570 
comes and that basically gives me a
shallower<00:01:16.020> depth<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.470> field<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.040> you're

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
shallower depth of field so you're

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.149 
shallower depth of field so you're
paying<00:01:17.850> for<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.900> quality<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> lens<00:01:19.740> and

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
paying for the quality of the lens and

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.580 
paying for the quality of the lens and
you're<00:01:20.340> paying<00:01:20.549> for<00:01:20.760> the<00:01:20.940> aperture<00:01:21.930> number

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
you're paying for the aperture number

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.620 
you're paying for the aperture number
the<00:01:22.740> F<00:01:22.890> number<00:01:23.370> so<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.670> lower<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.030> F<00:01:24.270> number

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
the F number so the lower the F number

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.690 
the F number so the lower the F number
the<00:01:24.750> more<00:01:24.900> expensive<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.590> lens<00:01:25.799> because<00:01:26.070> it's

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
the more expensive the lens because it's

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.980 
the more expensive the lens because it's
got<00:01:26.850> bigger<00:01:27.090> glass<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:27.840> got<00:01:27.960> a

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
got bigger glass and it's got a

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.390 
got bigger glass and it's got a
shallower<00:01:28.409> depth<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.799> field<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.190> when<00:01:29.310> I'm

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
shallower depth of field so when I'm

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.789 
shallower depth of field so when I'm
photographing<00:01:29.820> portraits<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:31.049> lens<00:01:31.380> is

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
photographing portraits this lens is

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.160 
photographing portraits this lens is
better<00:01:32.640> than<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.090> lens<00:01:33.390> because<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.990> has<00:01:34.140> a

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
better than this lens because it has a

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.800 
better than this lens because it has a
shallower<00:01:34.650> depth<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.190> field<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.729> that's<00:01:36.630> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
shallower depth of field so that's the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.930 
shallower depth of field so that's the
difference<00:01:37.140> between<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:38.130> f-number

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
difference between the f-number

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.789 
difference between the f-number
well<00:01:39.360> that's<00:01:39.510> what<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> F<00:01:39.900> number<00:01:40.320> means<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.770> a

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
well that's what the F number means on a

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.190 
well that's what the F number means on a
lens<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.400> that's<00:01:41.820> what<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.090> pay<00:01:42.270> for<00:01:42.299> if<00:01:42.600> you

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
lens so that's what you pay for if you

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.929 
lens so that's what you pay for if you
getting<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.860> really<00:01:44.010> cheap<00:01:44.310> lens<00:01:44.580> it's<00:01:44.790> got<00:01:44.909> a

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
getting a really cheap lens it's got a

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.179 
getting a really cheap lens it's got a
high<00:01:45.150> F<00:01:45.390> number<00:01:45.720> F<00:01:45.869> 5.6<00:01:46.680> F<00:01:47.689> 6.3<00:01:48.689> if<00:01:48.900> you<00:01:49.500> are

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
high F number F 5.6 F 6.3 if you are

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.890 
high F number F 5.6 F 6.3 if you are
getting<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.790> really<00:01:50.970> expensive<00:01:51.360> lens<00:01:51.750> you're

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
getting a really expensive lens you're

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.510 
getting a really expensive lens you're
going<00:01:51.930> for<00:01:52.260> a<00:01:52.290> very<00:01:52.560> low<00:01:52.860> F<00:01:53.100> number<00:01:53.490> F<00:01:53.990> 1.2<00:01:55.520> f2f

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
going for a very low F number F 1.2 f2f

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.670 
going for a very low F number F 1.2 f2f
2.8<00:01:57.240> those<00:01:57.869> are<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.200> really<00:01:58.470> expensive

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
2.8 those are the really expensive

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.609 
2.8 those are the really expensive
lenses<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.580> they<00:02:00.180> they're<00:02:00.750> worth<00:02:00.960> every<00:02:01.350> cent

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
lenses and they they're worth every cent

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.820 
lenses and they they're worth every cent
because<00:02:02.040> they<00:02:02.420> have<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> very<00:02:03.720> shallow<00:02:04.020> small

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
because they have a very shallow small

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.969 
because they have a very shallow small
depth<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.369> field<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.710> focusing<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.890> the

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979
