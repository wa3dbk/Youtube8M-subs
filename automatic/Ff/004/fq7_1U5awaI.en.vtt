00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.479 
right direction and that cloud syncing
is<00:02:55.140> also<00:02:55.470> kind<00:02:55.709> of<00:02:55.770> cool<00:02:56.010> for<00:02:56.040> your<00:02:56.400> own

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
this is your reading view this works a

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.629 
this is your reading view this works a
lot<00:04:59.569> like<00:04:59.629> there<00:04:59.990> the<00:05:00.259> reader<00:05:00.499> view<00:05:00.589> on<00:05:01.009> iOS

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
lot like there the reader view on iOS

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.540 
lot like there the reader view on iOS
but<00:05:02.599> I<00:05:02.900> actually<00:05:03.589> like<00:05:04.039> it<00:05:04.219> a<00:05:04.309> little<00:05:04.400> bit

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
but I actually like it a little bit

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.309 
but I actually like it a little bit
better<00:05:04.699> I<00:05:04.789> find<00:05:04.969> it<00:05:05.089> a<00:05:05.120> little<00:05:05.270> bit<00:05:05.389> works<00:05:06.169> with

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:06.319 
better I find it a little bit works with

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:08.110 
better I find it a little bit works with
more<00:05:06.499> web<00:05:06.650> pages<00:05:06.919> with<00:05:07.370> reader<00:05:07.580> for<00:05:07.789> example

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
more web pages with reader for example

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.579 
more web pages with reader for example
on<00:05:08.180> our<00:05:08.270> own<00:05:08.389> site<00:05:08.659> we<00:05:08.779> use<00:05:08.960> very<00:05:09.259> simple

00:05:09.579 --> 00:05:09.589 
on our own site we use very simple

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:12.339 
on our own site we use very simple
layouts<00:05:09.979> the<00:05:10.189> iOS<00:05:11.149> reader<00:05:11.479> version<00:05:11.749> often

layouts the iOS reader version often
just<00:05:12.529> quits<00:05:13.129> after<00:05:13.339> the<00:05:13.580> first<00:05:13.819> column<00:05:14.210> and

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
just quits after the first column and

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.610 
just quits after the first column and
doesn't<00:05:14.659> give<00:05:14.749> you<00:05:14.809> the<00:05:14.870> whole<00:05:15.050> article<00:05:15.469> this

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
doesn't give you the whole article this

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.309 
doesn't give you the whole article this
one<00:05:15.860> does<00:05:16.129> pretty<00:05:16.460> reliably<00:05:16.999> and<00:05:17.870> it's<00:05:18.020> a<00:05:18.080> very

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:18.319 
one does pretty reliably and it's a very

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:20.709 
one does pretty reliably and it's a very
readable<00:05:18.589> look<00:05:19.009> yeah<00:05:19.339> the<00:05:19.999> thing<00:05:20.389> that's<00:05:20.569> not

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:20.719 
readable look yeah the thing that's not

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:22.510 
readable look yeah the thing that's not
consistent<00:05:21.080> about<00:05:21.469> it<00:05:21.620> is<00:05:21.770> that<00:05:22.099> it<00:05:22.370> will

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
consistent about it is that it will

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.189 
consistent about it is that it will
sometimes<00:05:22.819> pull<00:05:23.330> down<00:05:23.479> images<00:05:23.870> and<00:05:24.050> sometimes

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 
sometimes pull down images and sometimes

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.110 
sometimes pull down images and sometimes
won't<00:05:24.620> and<00:05:24.919> if<00:05:25.370> you're<00:05:25.490> looking<00:05:25.699> at<00:05:25.759> sites

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
won't and if you're looking at sites

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.209 
won't and if you're looking at sites
that<00:05:26.270> have<00:05:26.389> multi-page<00:05:26.960> articles<00:05:27.529> sometimes

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:28.219 
that have multi-page articles sometimes

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:30.339 
that have multi-page articles sometimes
they<00:05:28.490> locate<00:05:28.789> all<00:05:28.909> those<00:05:29.059> pages<00:05:29.270> in<00:05:29.539> order<00:05:29.809> but

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:30.349 
they locate all those pages in order but

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:31.689 
they locate all those pages in order but
it's<00:05:30.529> definitely<00:05:30.680> a<00:05:30.919> good<00:05:31.069> first<00:05:31.249> start<00:05:31.520> and

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699 
it's definitely a good first start and

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.189 
it's definitely a good first start and
it<00:05:31.789> works<00:05:31.909> pretty<00:05:32.120> well<00:05:32.240> for<00:05:32.360> pages<00:05:32.870> that<00:05:32.899> have

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 
it works pretty well for pages that have

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.469 
it works pretty well for pages that have
everything<00:05:33.589> you<00:05:33.860> want<00:05:34.069> on<00:05:34.219> a<00:05:34.669> single<00:05:35.089> page<00:05:35.240> to

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
everything you want on a single page to

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.719 
everything you want on a single page to
start<00:05:35.689> with<00:05:36.009> obviously<00:05:37.009> much<00:05:37.309> more<00:05:37.550> readable

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
start with obviously much more readable

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.850 
start with obviously much more readable
text<00:05:38.089> works<00:05:38.479> nicely<00:05:38.749> in<00:05:39.080> portrait<00:05:39.499> mode<00:05:39.529> as

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
text works nicely in portrait mode as

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.999 
text works nicely in portrait mode as
well<00:05:43.899> there<00:05:44.899> is<00:05:45.050> no<00:05:45.199> pinch<00:05:45.439> zooming<00:05:45.800> there

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:46.009 
well there is no pinch zooming there

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:47.559 
well there is no pinch zooming there
they<00:05:46.219> just<00:05:46.430> try<00:05:46.580> to<00:05:46.610> give<00:05:46.819> you<00:05:46.909> what<00:05:47.449> they

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:47.569 
they just try to give you what they

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:48.909 
they just try to give you what they
think<00:05:47.810> is<00:05:47.899> a<00:05:47.930> readable<00:05:48.229> view<00:05:48.469> to<00:05:48.589> start<00:05:48.649> with

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
think is a readable view to start with

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:50.980 
think is a readable view to start with
in<00:05:49.039> the<00:05:49.459> text<00:05:49.759> is<00:05:49.879> not<00:05:50.029> so<00:05:50.300> super<00:05:50.659> huge<00:05:50.839> so

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
in the text is not so super huge so

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.149 
in the text is not so super huge so
those<00:05:51.199> of<00:05:51.349> you<00:05:51.409> who<00:05:51.560> don't<00:05:51.709> have<00:05:51.889> the<00:05:51.979> greatest

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
those of you who don't have the greatest

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:53.679 
those of you who don't have the greatest
size<00:05:52.399> might<00:05:52.669> still<00:05:52.879> find<00:05:53.029> that<00:05:53.240> a<00:05:53.270> little<00:05:53.569> bit

00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:53.689 
size might still find that a little bit

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:56.709 
size might still find that a little bit
small<00:05:53.990> to<00:05:54.020> read<00:05:55.060> probably<00:05:56.060> in<00:05:56.360> the<00:05:56.419> future

00:05:56.709 --> 00:05:56.719 
small to read probably in the future

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:58.209 
small to read probably in the future
they'll<00:05:56.899> add<00:05:57.080> some<00:05:57.289> in<00:05:57.589> the<00:05:57.740> future<00:05:58.009> we'll<00:05:58.099> add

they'll add some in the future we'll add

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:00.159 
they'll add some in the future we'll add
