00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:26.020
 Great 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:29.480
 The characteristic of this keyboard is that the speaker is playing at 12344 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.970
 Acoustically grand piano 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.400

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.060

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:06.180

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.990

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.990
 Even this bad child 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:16.230
 Den 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.230
 Oh 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.950
 Here moth Gahan 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.950
 me 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:31.759
 Hm 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.759
 I wonder do it where it was and where 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.440
 N'n'n N'a 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:48.270
 I'm what carp fishing in 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.009
 Moreover, when the great thing is with this put a harmony 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.939
 Hmmm 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.939
 Oh 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.760
 Not great 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:13.830
 Not really this ah 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:15.890
 Now the harmony button is off and pressing this 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.890
 air 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.610
 Put on the harmony 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.400
 Hmm 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:28.729
 Take I'm great 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:34.520
 According to the code name of the code 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:40.580
 It seems that the keyboard will automatically add the sound that was in the code . 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:42.569
 If you can use this freely you can have a wonderful harmony with just one web 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:49.729
 Than you think cool 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:49.729
 It seems that there are various 8 drum patterns, but I have a little spare time in my spare time 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.310
 Minutes 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:06:00.220
 Well it is while referring to the review of other people 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.740
 8I think this keyboard can be used very well 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:08.420

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:11.720

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:15.310
 I want to do piano mastering
