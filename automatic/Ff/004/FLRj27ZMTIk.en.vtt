hey guys Colin here from zeker comm with
another<00:00:06.980> quick<00:00:07.220> FAQ<00:00:08.080> people<00:00:09.080> ask<00:00:09.230> me<00:00:09.410> all<00:00:09.500> the

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590 
another quick FAQ people ask me all the

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.190 
another quick FAQ people ask me all the
time<00:00:09.769> about<00:00:09.799> FPS<00:00:10.789> or<00:00:11.090> frames<00:00:11.120> per<00:00:11.690> second<00:00:12.080> what

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
time about FPS or frames per second what

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.829 
time about FPS or frames per second what
it<00:00:12.320> means<00:00:12.589> and<00:00:13.070> what<00:00:13.910> the<00:00:14.059> optimal<00:00:14.420> settings

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
it means and what the optimal settings

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.440 
it means and what the optimal settings
are<00:00:15.019> for<00:00:15.290> frames<00:00:15.559> per<00:00:15.769> second<00:00:16.160> now<00:00:17.029> basically

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.450 
are for frames per second now basically

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.319 
are for frames per second now basically
what<00:00:17.990> FPS<00:00:18.650> is<00:00:18.890> is<00:00:19.160> it's<00:00:19.369> the<00:00:19.550> number<00:00:19.759> of<00:00:20.000> images

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:20.329 
what FPS is is it's the number of images

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.080 
what FPS is is it's the number of images
that<00:00:20.750> your<00:00:21.020> camera<00:00:21.560> is<00:00:21.770> going<00:00:22.070> to<00:00:22.130> stream<00:00:22.790> or

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
that your camera is going to stream or

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.359 
that your camera is going to stream or
your<00:00:23.210> record<00:00:23.540> is<00:00:23.599> going<00:00:23.720> to<00:00:23.809> capture<00:00:24.259> in<00:00:24.470> a

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
your record is going to capture in a

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.720 
your record is going to capture in a
given<00:00:25.669> second<00:00:26.180> so<00:00:26.869> 10<00:00:27.590> frames<00:00:27.890> per<00:00:28.009> second<00:00:28.520> or

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
given second so 10 frames per second or

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.519 
given second so 10 frames per second or
10<00:00:28.790> FPS<00:00:29.540> would<00:00:29.689> mean<00:00:29.840> that<00:00:29.930> you<00:00:30.079> have<00:00:30.230> 10

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
10 FPS would mean that you have 10

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.170 
10 FPS would mean that you have 10
images<00:00:30.800> for<00:00:31.219> every<00:00:31.399> second<00:00:31.730> of<00:00:31.790> time<00:00:31.969> that

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
images for every second of time that

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.319 
images for every second of time that
passes<00:00:32.419> it's<00:00:33.050> pretty<00:00:33.290> simple<00:00:33.680> now<00:00:34.610> when

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
passes it's pretty simple now when

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:36.910 
passes it's pretty simple now when
you're<00:00:35.449> trying<00:00:35.629> to<00:00:35.780> set<00:00:36.019> up<00:00:36.140> a<00:00:36.289> camera<00:00:36.559> and

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
you're trying to set up a camera and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.040 
you're trying to set up a camera and
think<00:00:37.460> about<00:00:37.699> how<00:00:37.940> many<00:00:38.179> FPS<00:00:38.390> you<00:00:38.780> need<00:00:38.929> to

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
think about how many FPS you need to

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.430 
think about how many FPS you need to
record<00:00:39.530> that's<00:00:40.519> a<00:00:40.640> different<00:00:40.999> story<00:00:41.320> to<00:00:42.320> give

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
record that's a different story to give

record that's a different story to give
you<00:00:42.530> an<00:00:42.620> idea<00:00:42.710> of<00:00:42.980> kind<00:00:43.850> of<00:00:43.969> the<00:00:44.089> real-time

now<00:01:05.059> for<00:01:05.840> CCTV<00:01:06.170> cameras<00:01:06.860> you're<00:01:07.340> trying<00:01:07.610> to

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
now for CCTV cameras you're trying to

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.950 
now for CCTV cameras you're trying to
create<00:01:08.060> something<00:01:08.450> different<00:01:08.480> you're

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
create something different you're

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.750 
create something different you're
actually<00:01:09.380> not<00:01:09.530> trying<00:01:09.860> to<00:01:09.950> recreate<00:01:10.190> real

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
actually not trying to recreate real

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.520 
actually not trying to recreate real
time<00:01:11.120> you're<00:01:11.810> just<00:01:12.020> trying<00:01:12.200> to<00:01:12.290> capture

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
time you're just trying to capture

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.000 
time you're just trying to capture
valuable<00:01:13.520> information<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.650> you<00:01:15.650> want<00:01:15.890> to

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
valuable information and you want to

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.800 
valuable information and you want to
only<00:01:16.520> capture<00:01:16.970> as<00:01:17.150> much<00:01:17.420> as<00:01:17.630> necessary

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
only capture as much as necessary

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.300 
only capture as much as necessary
because<00:01:18.470> otherwise<00:01:18.680> you<00:01:18.890> start<00:01:19.100> wasting

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
because otherwise you start wasting

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.730 
because otherwise you start wasting
storage<00:01:19.940> space<00:01:20.180> on<00:01:20.360> your<00:01:20.420> recorder<00:01:21.020> which

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
storage space on your recorder which

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.470 
storage space on your recorder which
could<00:01:22.010> be<00:01:22.100> used<00:01:22.370> to<00:01:22.490> prolong<00:01:23.000> evidence

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
could be used to prolong evidence

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.170 
could be used to prolong evidence
instead<00:01:24.110> of<00:01:24.230> capture<00:01:24.680> unnecessary<00:01:25.520> frames<00:01:25.910> of

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
instead of capture unnecessary frames of

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.490 
instead of capture unnecessary frames of
the<00:01:26.270> same<00:01:26.300> thing<00:01:26.690> over<00:01:26.900> and<00:01:27.050> over<00:01:27.230> and<00:01:27.380> over

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
the same thing over and over and over

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.760 
the same thing over and over and over
again<00:01:28.210> so<00:01:29.210> what<00:01:29.840> I<00:01:29.870> normally<00:01:29.960> recommend<00:01:30.380> is

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
again so what I normally recommend is

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.370 
again so what I normally recommend is
thinking<00:01:31.190> about<00:01:31.280> how<00:01:32.270> many<00:01:32.480> images<00:01:32.780> you<00:01:32.960> need

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
thinking about how many images you need

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.380 
thinking about how many images you need
to<00:01:33.830> capture<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.400> data<00:01:34.640> you're<00:01:34.850> looking<00:01:34.880> for

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
to capture the data you're looking for

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.810 
to capture the data you're looking for
if<00:01:35.750> you're<00:01:35.900> looking<00:01:36.140> at<00:01:36.230> a<00:01:36.290> driveway<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:37.070> it's

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
if you're looking at a driveway and it's

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.190 
if you're looking at a driveway and it's
real<00:01:38.090> tight<00:01:38.330> shot<00:01:38.630> you're<00:01:38.810> trying<00:01:38.990> to<00:01:39.080> get<00:01:39.170> a

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
real tight shot you're trying to get a

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.540 
real tight shot you're trying to get a
license<00:01:39.590> plate<00:01:39.650> and<00:01:39.950> a<00:01:39.980> vehicle<00:01:40.160> is<00:01:40.370> going<00:01:40.460> to

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
license plate and a vehicle is going to

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.490 
license plate and a vehicle is going to
pass<00:01:40.760> through<00:01:41.030> that<00:01:41.240> camera<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:41.930> they're

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
pass through that camera and they're

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.990 
pass through that camera and they're
going<00:01:42.650> to<00:01:42.710> be<00:01:42.800> in<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.130> out<00:01:43.190> in<00:01:43.250> less<00:01:43.670> than<00:01:43.880> a

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
going to be in and out in less than a

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.030 
going to be in and out in less than a
second<00:01:44.420> you<00:01:44.960> know<00:01:45.080> you<00:01:45.170> need<00:01:45.350> to<00:01:45.440> crank<00:01:45.830> the

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
second you know you need to crank the

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.860 
second you know you need to crank the
frames<00:01:46.310> per<00:01:46.550> second<00:01:46.970> on<00:01:47.030> that<00:01:47.210> camera<00:01:47.510> you

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
frames per second on that camera you

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.320 
frames per second on that camera you
need<00:01:48.410> it<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:48.650> be<00:01:48.770> at<00:01:48.920> something<00:01:49.340> like<00:01:49.460> 10<00:01:49.850> maybe

is only going to be a short amount of

optimal focused area of the camera

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.330 
optimal focused area of the camera
that<00:02:00.800> means<00:02:01.040> 10<00:02:01.930> 15<00:02:02.930> 20<00:02:03.530> frames<00:02:03.740> per<00:02:03.950> second

that means 10 15 20 frames per second

that means 10 15 20 frames per second
it's<00:02:04.580> a<00:02:04.760> good<00:02:05.150> chance<00:02:05.420> that<00:02:05.600> one<00:02:06.050> of<00:02:06.170> those

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
it's a good chance that one of those

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.630 
it's a good chance that one of those
frames<00:02:06.560> is<00:02:06.680> going<00:02:06.800> to<00:02:06.860> have<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:06.980> nice<00:02:07.100> clean

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
first one gave you so what you really

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.750 
first one gave you so what you really
need<00:02:44.630> to<00:02:44.750> do<00:02:44.959> then<00:02:45.170> is<00:02:45.349> focus<00:02:46.280> on<00:02:46.400> thinking

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
need to do then is focus on thinking

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.550 
need to do then is focus on thinking
about<00:02:47.000> how<00:02:47.360> many<00:02:47.540> frames<00:02:47.870> per<00:02:48.110> second<00:02:48.440> do<00:02:48.500> I

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
about how many frames per second do I

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.640 
about how many frames per second do I
really<00:02:48.920> need<00:02:49.100> you<00:02:49.310> if<00:02:49.819> I<00:02:49.970> just<00:02:50.180> need<00:02:50.390> one<00:02:51.350> frame

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
really need you if I just need one frame

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.960 
really need you if I just need one frame
per<00:02:51.860> second<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.430> prison<00:02:52.670> going<00:02:52.819> to<00:02:52.880> be

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
per second and the prison going to be

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.970 
per second and the prison going to be
there<00:02:53.120> for<00:02:53.269> two<00:02:53.300> minutes<00:02:53.680> that's<00:02:54.680> going<00:02:54.920> to

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
there for two minutes that's going to

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.949 
there for two minutes that's going to
give<00:02:55.160> you<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.310> hundred<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:55.940> twenty<00:02:56.330> images<00:02:56.569> to

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
give you a hundred and twenty images to

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.380 
give you a hundred and twenty images to
pick<00:02:57.110> from<00:02:57.380> that's<00:02:57.920> plenty<00:02:58.880> more<00:02:59.060> than<00:02:59.239> enough

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
pick from that's plenty more than enough

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.570 
pick from that's plenty more than enough
in<00:02:59.600> that<00:03:00.140> case<00:03:00.350> don't<00:03:00.890> go<00:03:01.100> more<00:03:01.280> than<00:03:01.340> one

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
in that case don't go more than one

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.370 
in that case don't go more than one
frame<00:03:01.760> per<00:03:01.970> second<00:03:02.360> it's<00:03:03.019> going<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.290> look

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
frame per second it's going to look

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.050 
frame per second it's going to look
really<00:03:03.440> choppy<00:03:04.130> when<00:03:04.340> you<00:03:04.459> watch<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:04.790> video

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
really choppy when you watch the video

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.820 
really choppy when you watch the video
but<00:03:05.600> it<00:03:05.720> doesn't<00:03:05.989> matter<00:03:06.170> because<00:03:06.410> you're<00:03:06.680> not

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
but it doesn't matter because you're not

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.640 
but it doesn't matter because you're not
losing<00:03:07.220> any<00:03:07.549> valuable<00:03:08.360> information<00:03:08.650> the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
losing any valuable information the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.870 
losing any valuable information the
opposite<00:03:10.069> goes<00:03:10.250> for<00:03:10.459> when<00:03:10.549> you're<00:03:10.670> trying<00:03:10.760> to

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
opposite goes for when you're trying to

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.000 
opposite goes for when you're trying to
catch<00:03:11.000> up<00:03:11.150> vehicles<00:03:11.600> or<00:03:11.810> high-speed<00:03:12.170> activity

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
catch up vehicles or high-speed activity

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.280 
catch up vehicles or high-speed activity
so<00:03:13.850> try<00:03:14.269> to<00:03:14.330> think<00:03:14.540> about<00:03:14.660> that<00:03:14.810> when<00:03:15.140> you're

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
so try to think about that when you're

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.840 
so try to think about that when you're
setting<00:03:15.500> up<00:03:15.709> your<00:03:15.769> frames<00:03:16.160> per<00:03:16.340> second<00:03:16.730> and

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
setting up your frames per second and

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.670 
setting up your frames per second and
try<00:03:17.000> to<00:03:17.060> think<00:03:17.150> about<00:03:17.360> what<00:03:17.500> recording<00:03:18.500> rate
