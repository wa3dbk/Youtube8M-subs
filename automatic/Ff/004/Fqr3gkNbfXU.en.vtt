talk<00:00:00.269> about<00:00:00.510> the<00:00:01.469> approach<00:00:02.010> or<00:00:02.370> the

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
talk about the approach or the

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.829 
talk about the approach or the
transition<00:00:03.210> from<00:00:03.659> swimming<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.220> turn<00:00:05.839> the

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
transition from swimming to the turn the

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.140 
transition from swimming to the turn the
number<00:00:07.259> one<00:00:07.470> thing<00:00:07.830> you<00:00:07.859> want<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.309> do<00:00:08.519> on<00:00:08.820> the

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
number one thing you want to do on the

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.280 
number one thing you want to do on the
approach<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:10.160> accelerate<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.719> lot<00:00:12.719> of<00:00:12.900> people

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
approach is accelerate a lot of people

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.790 
approach is accelerate a lot of people
slow<00:00:14.130> down<00:00:14.420> to<00:00:15.420> prepare<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.109> turn<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.770> you

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
slow down to prepare to turn and you

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.849 
slow down to prepare to turn and you
want<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.850> accelerate<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.930> wall<00:00:19.109> so

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
want to accelerate to the wall so

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.460 
want to accelerate to the wall so
swimmers<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.580> coaches<00:00:21.029> from<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.689> backstroke

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
swimmers and coaches from the backstroke

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.140 
swimmers and coaches from the backstroke
flags<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.220> course<00:00:23.400> sometimes<00:00:23.910> they're

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
flags and of course sometimes they're

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.929 
flags and of course sometimes they're
not<00:00:24.330> up<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.750> freestyle<00:00:25.320> but<00:00:25.949> from<00:00:26.220> about<00:00:26.519> five

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
not up in freestyle but from about five

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.320 
not up in freestyle but from about five
yards<00:00:27.599> out<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.830> wall<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.760> want<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.090> swim

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
yards out to the wall you want to swim

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.520 
yards out to the wall you want to swim
faster<00:00:31.260> than<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.470> have<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.949> whole<00:00:32.160> 25<00:00:32.730> and

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
faster than you have the whole 25 and

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.959 
faster than you have the whole 25 and
you<00:00:34.530> want<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.860> be<00:00:34.980> make<00:00:35.280> sure<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.730> you're

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
you want to be make sure that you're

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.360 
you want to be make sure that you're
leading<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.719> top<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.170> your<00:00:37.290> head<00:00:37.530> which

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
leading with the top of your head which

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.080 
leading with the top of your head which
means<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:39.660> your<00:00:39.930> target<00:00:40.469> may<00:00:41.100> not<00:00:41.129> be<00:00:41.670> right

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
means that your target may not be right

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.840 
means that your target may not be right
on<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.450> end<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.840> pool<00:00:43.530> it's<00:00:44.370> got<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.760> be

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
on the end of the pool it's got to be

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.850 
on the end of the pool it's got to be
somewhere<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.629> bottom<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.469> you're<00:00:46.649> not

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
somewhere on the bottom so you're not

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.840 
somewhere on the bottom so you're not
swimming<00:00:47.340> uphill<00:00:48.090> as<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.960> approach<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.590> wall

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
swimming uphill as you approach the wall

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.950 
swimming uphill as you approach the wall
Brett<00:00:50.850> do<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.120> have<00:00:51.300> any<00:00:51.420> other<00:00:51.629> thoughts

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
Brett do you have any other thoughts

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.680 
Brett do you have any other thoughts
with<00:00:52.199> regard<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.829> approach<00:00:53.510> well<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.539> think

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
with regard to the approach well I think

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.290 
with regard to the approach well I think
that<00:00:55.260> exactly<00:00:55.920> what<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.160> said<00:00:56.460> speeding<00:00:57.149> up

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
that exactly what you said speeding up

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.360 
that exactly what you said speeding up
into<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> wall<00:00:57.809> you'll<00:00:58.050> find<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.530> most<00:00:59.190> of

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
into the wall you'll find that most of

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.069 
into the wall you'll find that most of
you<00:00:59.460> competitors<00:01:00.090> especially<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> short

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
you competitors especially in the short

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.110 
you competitors especially in the short
course<00:01:01.350> will<00:01:01.890> be<00:01:02.039> right<00:01:02.309> next<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.789> each<00:01:02.940> other

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
course will be right next to each other

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.990 
course will be right next to each other
the<00:01:03.660> ones<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.110> slow<00:01:04.379> down<00:01:04.650> will<00:01:05.309> will<00:01:05.760> take

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the ones that slow down will will take

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.270 
the ones that slow down will will take
that<00:01:06.210> momentum<00:01:06.780> into<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.049> wall<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.770> won't

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
that momentum into the wall and it won't

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.100 
that momentum into the wall and it won't
be<00:01:08.460> as<00:01:08.610> strong<00:01:09.030> as<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> ones<00:01:09.810> who<00:01:09.990> actually

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
be as strong as the ones who actually

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.440 
be as strong as the ones who actually
speed<00:01:10.650> up<00:01:10.680> into<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.220> wall<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> ones<00:01:12.210> who

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
speed up into the wall so the ones who

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.109 
speed up into the wall so the ones who
decide<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.900> be<00:01:13.590> aggressive<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.340> be<00:01:14.760> strong

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
decide to be aggressive and be strong

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.940 
decide to be aggressive and be strong
and<00:01:15.150> forceful<00:01:15.540> into<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.049> wall<00:01:16.259> there'll<00:01:16.890> be

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
and forceful into the wall there'll be

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.740 
and forceful into the wall there'll be
the<00:01:17.100> ones<00:01:17.280> who<00:01:17.400> are<00:01:17.490> strong<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.210> forceful<00:01:18.450> and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
the ones who are strong and forceful and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.630 
the ones who are strong and forceful and
aggressive<00:01:18.840> off<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.590> wall<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.979> you'll<00:01:20.340> find

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
aggressive off the wall and you'll find

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.120 
aggressive off the wall and you'll find
that<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.909> can<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.360> can<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:21.780> blow<00:01:22.740> people

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
that you can you can just blow people

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.859 
that you can you can just blow people
away<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> walls<00:01:23.850> but<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.330> also<00:01:24.479> pick

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
away on the walls but you can also pick

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.929 
away on the walls but you can also pick
up<00:01:24.990> hundreds<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.530> seconds<00:01:26.070> vital<00:01:26.490> hundreds<00:01:26.820> of

seconds in easy transition work and the
you<00:01:31.350> know<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.250> more<00:01:32.520> streamline<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.299> go

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
you know the the more streamline you go

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.719 
you know the the more streamline you go
in<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.810> more<00:01:33.930> streamline<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.500> come<00:01:34.710> out<00:01:34.890> the

faster you will be towards the end of

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.120 
faster you will be towards the end of
the<00:01:37.890> race<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.030> turn<00:01:39.530> like<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.560> said<00:01:40.950> before
