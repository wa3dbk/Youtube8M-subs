oh look there's the space shuttle fly it
over<00:00:04.319> the<00:00:04.560> bridge<00:00:04.770> under<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.250> bridge<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.640> know

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.390 
is under the bridge it's all a
perspective<00:00:09.719> thing<00:00:10.050> what<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:10.950> can<00:00:11.099> see<00:00:11.280> is

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
perspective thing what you can see is

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.700 
perspective thing what you can see is
like<00:00:11.750> yeah<00:00:12.750> it's<00:00:12.900> not<00:00:13.019> really<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.380> size<00:00:13.559> of

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
like yeah it's not really the size of

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.539 
like yeah it's not really the size of
the<00:00:13.769> car

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
the car

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.849 
the car
cars<00:00:15.000> are<00:00:15.210> nearer<00:00:15.480> than<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.960> complain<00:00:16.619> and

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
cars are nearer than the complain and

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.790 
cars are nearer than the complain and
the<00:00:17.369> space<00:00:17.609> shuttle<00:00:17.910> on<00:00:17.940> its<00:00:18.150> back<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.800> yeah

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
the space shuttle on its back and yeah

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.710 
the space shuttle on its back and yeah
there<00:00:20.760> are<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> lot<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.150> people<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.810> pier<00:00:22.289> I

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
there are a lot of people on that pier I

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.990 
there are a lot of people on that pier I
think<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.529> seriously<00:00:25.949> damaging<00:00:26.580> the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
think this is seriously damaging the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.650 
think this is seriously damaging the
Zuma<00:00:27.510> tank<00:00:27.890> businesses<00:00:29.750> productivity<00:00:30.750> today

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
Zuma tank businesses productivity today

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.240 
Zuma tank businesses productivity today
come<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.840> wanted<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.320> come<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.739> way<00:00:37.250> come

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
come on I wanted to come this way come

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.540 
come on I wanted to come this way come
closer<00:00:39.559> so<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.710> see

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:52.560 

oh<00:00:46.980> yes<00:00:48.720> so<00:00:49.720> I<00:00:50.110> guess<00:00:50.790> yeah<00:00:51.790> it's<00:00:52.090> got<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.300> tale

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
oh yes so I guess yeah it's got the tale

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.600 
oh yes so I guess yeah it's got the tale
calling<00:00:52.990> on<00:00:53.110> so<00:00:53.350> that<00:00:53.500> you<00:00:53.950> the<00:00:54.250> engines

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
calling on so that you the engines

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.760 
calling on so that you the engines
aren't<00:00:54.850> causing<00:00:55.180> extra<00:00:55.510> drag<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:59.410> wait<00:00:59.620> this

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
aren't causing extra drag so wait this

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.310 
aren't causing extra drag so wait this
is<00:00:59.920> endeavour<00:01:00.280> this<00:01:00.640> one<00:01:00.820> right<00:01:01.780> that<00:01:02.050> was<00:01:02.230> the

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
is endeavour this one right that was the

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.920 
is endeavour this one right that was the
one<00:01:02.470> that<00:01:02.680> was<00:01:03.550> rebuilt<00:01:04.000> after<00:01:04.210> Challenger

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
one that was rebuilt after Challenger

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.969 
one that was rebuilt after Challenger
blew<00:01:05.050> up<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:07.270> it<00:01:08.110> was<00:01:08.260> a<00:01:08.290> it<00:01:08.530> was<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:08.770> best

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
blew up and it was a it was the best

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.440 
blew up and it was a it was the best
shuttle<00:01:09.430> that<00:01:09.640> was<00:01:09.729> built<00:01:09.940> because<00:01:10.270> they

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
shuttle that was built because they

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.990 
shuttle that was built because they
built<00:01:10.870> it<00:01:11.020> with<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:11.410> cutting-edge<00:01:12.070> 1980s

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
built it with the cutting-edge 1980s

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.630 
built it with the cutting-edge 1980s
technology

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
technology

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.719 
technology
yeah<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:15.910> they<00:01:16.030> had<00:01:16.240> had<00:01:16.570> more<00:01:16.780> fuel<00:01:17.140> cells

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
yeah and they had had more fuel cells

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.920 
yeah and they had had more fuel cells
better<00:01:18.729> endurance<00:01:20.729> yes<00:01:21.729> starting<00:01:22.690> to<00:01:22.810> see

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
better endurance yes starting to see

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:31.590 
better endurance yes starting to see
this<00:01:23.140> now<00:01:24.030> come<00:01:25.030> closer

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:40.200 

oh<00:01:31.680> dear<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:38.770> a<00:01:38.860> chase<00:01:39.070> plane<00:01:39.340> row<00:01:39.850> there's

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
oh dear it's a chase plane row there's

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.450 
oh dear it's a chase plane row there's
this<00:01:40.300> a<00:01:40.360> thing<00:01:40.600> hanging<00:01:40.780> at<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.080> back<00:01:41.229> oh<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
this a thing hanging at the back oh the

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.260 
this a thing hanging at the back oh the
tail<00:01:42.670> plane<00:01:42.970> has<00:01:43.210> extra<00:01:43.660> control<00:01:44.110> surfaces<00:01:44.619> I

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
tail plane has extra control surfaces I

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.700 
tail plane has extra control surfaces I
think

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.330 

there<00:01:51.370> we<00:01:51.549> go

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.490 

and<00:01:55.909> on<00:01:56.060> its<00:01:56.240> way<00:01:56.299> to<00:01:56.479> LA<00:01:56.990> where<00:01:57.229> they're<00:01:57.380> gonna

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
and on its way to LA where they're gonna

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.069 
and on its way to LA where they're gonna
cut<00:01:57.860> down<00:01:57.890> like<00:01:58.310> 300<00:01:59.180> trees<00:01:59.390> so<00:01:59.659> we<00:01:59.720> can<00:01:59.899> get<00:02:00.020> to

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
cut down like 300 trees so we can get to

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:08.380 
cut down like 300 trees so we can get to
the<00:02:00.470> museum<00:02:06.430> you<00:02:07.430> know<00:02:07.549> I'm<00:02:07.820> working<00:02:08.030> in<00:02:08.270> my

Building I wonder if we'll make another

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.430 
Building I wonder if we'll make another
pass<00:02:19.930> cool
