00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.939
 all here I want to share my experience 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.880
 orchid growing 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:14.500
 Let's start with what I gained acquired 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:17.980
 Orchids that donâ€™t give orchids and all 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.870
 they grew purchase pots it's time 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.620
 replant orchids after reading and 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.250
 after watching 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:26.230
 the information i started doing all this i 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.720
 I thought that well, I will do everything right 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.499
 because he had already seen enough things 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.769
 I have already studied everything well and in the end I have it all 

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:38.050
 did done right and through 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:41.260
 some time in six months from me 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.449
 found on for 1 disappear so me so 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.760
 orchids 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.379
 Well, I started alone stopped at this 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.780
 Information began to look further 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.809
 information and here came across too 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:57.670
 video of such a landing as I have now 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:01:00.149
 in front of you and she planted 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.559
 started a major first orchid 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.430
 try what it is and how it goes 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:09.250
 Do I like it but transplant 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.520
 really liked the fact that it is not necessary 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.399
 solder take off her put the day 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.460
 follow the orchid so she attacked 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:22.810
 appeared and put 101 something different when 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:28.750
 a lot of them are very convenient and I transplanted 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:31.359
 so this one bought such a bowl such bowls 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.380
 That computer science can not buy 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:40.119
 such cups love people there diy glass and I 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:44.619
 made drainage sphagnum in connection sits 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:47.259
 orchid bark and fallen asleep on top of 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.079
 Orchid neck should be welded 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:53.439
 open but because i already have it 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:55.960
 big so not harmful yet to the end 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.240
 but the neck of the orchid must be open 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.210
 right in the case of these upper roots because 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.229
 what does she like when over 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:10.530
 solve here this orchid grows in my 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:14.080
 such a spoon for two years somewhere around 2 years 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.060
 what problems are its boundaries and nothing 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.730
 I'm rotting too 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.760
 six months later, some affairs orchid 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.060
 I tried that they liked it 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.760
 this way and I do the same thing 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.390
 all your orchids were going on here 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.590
 here I did not have a pot many washi 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:39.519
 went and I didn't have enough stitches with you 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:44.380
 such so I took it with mayonnaise 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:45.250
 he himself took the pebbles from the sea and from me 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.269
 there was a pebble 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.820
 and I took just expanded clay transport 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:56.670
 flow affairs sneakers and bark and top 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:59.650
 consolidated and so I grow orchids all 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.319
 even dendrobium planted the same way 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:08.739
 how is it like i'm like 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:11.709
 accommodate and here is the landing method I'm on 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.660
 watched which is very comfortable and not necessary 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.739
 nothing even if you want to hit 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.230
 fertilize orchids 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.660
 just pours divorced weak 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:25.180
 the solution is his top dressing 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:28.060
 poured drainage some water and she herself on 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.730
 Bitch on so I'm here on such here 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:36.670
