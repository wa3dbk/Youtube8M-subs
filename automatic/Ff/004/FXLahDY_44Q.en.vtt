00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.960
 telcom reward two other four goalies with the basics and that 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.780
 the most important basis for any comment is right the microphone 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.740
 microphone 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.110
 but everyone somewhere at home everyone has 1 5 respectively and who has the commenting 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.609
 to get them anyway 1 but what kind of one 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.519
 but with that one so i would always comment with mine that i am currently 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:23.550
 used like that 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.920
 and currently the x300 panel is previously double budget z and both deliver 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.390
 some a very good place but both were not exactly that cheap 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.300
 Quarter finally stayed at about 60 euros when their ideas but 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.480
 the MMX now over 300 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.610
 but you do not have to spend everything who a cheap micro 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.250
 I'll post a comment on my Nico from 15 on 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.260
 I have watched 'Underweight' real and i have tested it once 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.350
 I took it with me and commented on some videos 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.740
 should have thought so too i made it for me i uploaded it Ali 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.820
 Quality is perfectly adequate then of course I have with the field 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.820
 thank god thank you bye what a better place Motto with the brand he was very 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.490
 accommodating 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.680
 but 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.370
 I want to say that I would say for the first time a coproduction of the FCS 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.970
 important 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.600
 and that is the Euro now actually only sets for flash estimate 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.350
 sky + align do not have a really good microphone 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.060
 mead 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.190
 otherwise knows that there is something clear 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.520
 for example, a pop show about this Celle whatever Migros is 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.820
 that has not seen so minimum something should be off if you 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.390
 not such a stand Nico has 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.810
 They have integrated this with all possibilities with which Euro 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.630
 invests times really fifth on a good stand Nico or maybe 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.450
 times 30 Euro 5 comply 12 the laws that's the basis with it 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.170
 your voice clearly come over as possible 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.310
 the other one is then adjust that shot to move Grete Steiner and 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.250
 The mobile phone system setting to be exact the woman's appearance and how we 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.680
 here our look 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.840
 explores Cairo Arkady's birthday too 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.939
 this is my next separate that her full my interest Nico from the laptop it 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.850
 is not really the one who disappears from the professions as said so professor for 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:04.680
 quality 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.930
 why do I give that comment 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.470
 and that was on a create this company left the pink boxer "I have 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.619
 the red way 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:15.289
 Tricycle we want to change the first interesting one have cones 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:18.980
 but you should all be so spacious that we have character too 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.029
 nobody else behind it okay 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:25.069
 here we have the one with the web cam percent and here is the beginning 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.109
 He now listened to me for the animal 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.109
 - become louder and quieter 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.489
 Nora will be more expensive 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.359
 funny 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.419
 funny funny 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:45.939
 okay matter percent and the microphone gain to see those levels 20 30 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.679
 Decibels are there 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:49.570
 and I have to say so 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.730
 that's not what we want here really just want to have a hundred here 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.290
 and here as possible 0 but that it is possible for any jihad you 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.709
 according to her speak 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.579
 It may be that you have to use the microphone amplification 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.060
 so it does not try here synonymous by tasting I recommend Jung 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:09.699
 and old there 0 and then you should be able to understand as optimal but too rarely 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:13.029
 to be still life and speak loud words that is very important 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:16.549
 Speak too fast Page and understandable speaker too slowly pulls 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:17.459
 circles 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:18.160
 and 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.910
 Predator or too quiet that she herself is watching the video Canaries why you quiet 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.219
 I'll ever take at least an hour to risk it all 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:26.999
 Furthermore 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:28.879
 and the eu commission improvements 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.400
 and who the vettel pursuers the immediately must stop activated Costa with more 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.269
 But computing power 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.040
 That should not matter to us at this moment I would like here the Fekter 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.919
 go through the disadvantages suppression for front speaker feedback he 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.160
 Lock when recording 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.179
 indispensable in their gameplay 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:50.699
 Andermatt otherwise as well-prepared care and outside air Swiss gate 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.889
 but of course it is clear 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:57.019
 if anything else there is the impact and this is especially important 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.939
 yes, that's your voice, suppose he does not make any noise you have to 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:05.090
 Example a lamp running lamps make noise grass neon lights and shelves 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.340
 what is it somebody especially the consultant that is a background noise like that 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.950
 you can not use Jenny's thumbs up quite important in Hagen 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:13.009
 put 

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:16.189
 so that the GEZ on the Enlightenment 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:19.919
 the thing is automatically synonymous with the level of recording correctly and 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.519
 painted him that's what we want so that your voice 

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:26.769
 Eagle shooting is adjusted at the level how do you go to Glauber 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.389
 So far, the new has to do with things 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.449
 I know this plague on Sanaa RPO side but I found whopping quality 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.210
 of course I know that way Rotter Detail develops Schmidinger as a jury 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.849
 not in there but it helps 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:44.580
 whether the customer himself is relieved that the state format on DVD quali-game 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.509
 Quality puts it on CD quality and that's enough 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.969
 not construction site should already be the DVD quality 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:55.270
 okay i hope that everything helped a little bit 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.040
 Try a short as unreadable best
