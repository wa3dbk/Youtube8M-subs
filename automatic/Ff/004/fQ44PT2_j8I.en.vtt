00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.460 

I<00:00:15.900> think<00:00:16.590> for<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.920> most<00:00:17.130> part<00:00:17.960> the<00:00:18.960> new<00:00:19.110> system

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
I think for the most part the new system

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.830 
I think for the most part the new system
is<00:00:19.590> helping<00:00:19.740> because<00:00:20.160> each<00:00:20.970> element<00:00:21.330> is

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
is helping because each element is

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.470 
is helping because each element is
described<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.320> certain<00:00:22.560> value<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.130> then<00:00:23.760> you

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
described a certain value and then you

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.090 
described a certain value and then you
get<00:00:24.630> positive<00:00:25.140> or<00:00:25.380> negative<00:00:25.770> grades<00:00:25.980> of

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.100 
get positive or negative grades of

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.680 
get positive or negative grades of
execution<00:00:26.670> depending<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.090> how<00:00:27.240> well<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.540> do

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.690 
execution depending on how well you do

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.140 
execution depending on how well you do
them<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.380> from<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.770> way<00:00:29.150> there's

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
them so from that way there's

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.330 
them so from that way there's
transparency<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.140> can<00:00:31.320> understand<00:00:32.099> why

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
transparency and you can understand why

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.450 
transparency and you can understand why
you<00:00:32.400> get<00:00:32.700> what<00:00:32.910> scores<00:00:33.950> some<00:00:34.950> people<00:00:35.220> think

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
you get what scores some people think

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.860 
you get what scores some people think
that<00:00:35.520> certain<00:00:35.910> things<00:00:36.120> are<00:00:36.240> not<00:00:36.420> valued

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
that certain things are not valued

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.370 
that certain things are not valued
correctly<00:00:37.579> or<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:39.510> know<00:00:39.630> people<00:00:40.020> can<00:00:40.170> still

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
correctly or you know people can still

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.400 
correctly or you know people can still
play<00:00:41.220> around<00:00:41.460> with<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> second<00:00:42.210> mark<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.720> you

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
play around with the second mark of you

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.600 
play around with the second mark of you
know<00:00:43.530> your<00:00:43.650> composition<00:00:44.220> your<00:00:44.370> skating

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
know your composition your skating

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.370 
know your composition your skating
skills<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.150> other<00:00:45.210> things<00:00:45.540> to<00:00:45.810> move<00:00:46.170> your

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
skills and other things to move your

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.440 
skills and other things to move your
placements<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.400> you<00:00:47.489> know<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:47.820> not<00:00:47.910> perfect

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
placements so you know it's not perfect

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:56.860 
placements so you know it's not perfect
but<00:00:48.630> skating<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.200> um<00:00:49.550> it's<00:00:50.550> very<00:00:50.670> personal

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.529 

to<00:00:57.500> perform<00:00:57.860> it's<00:00:58.100> an<00:00:58.489> impression<00:00:59.030> you<00:00:59.360> get

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
to perform it's an impression you get

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.569 
to perform it's an impression you get
when<00:00:59.780> you<00:00:59.930> you<00:01:00.530> see<00:01:00.739> someone<00:01:01.040> skate<00:01:01.309> and<00:01:01.460> the

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
when you you see someone skate and the

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.600 
when you you see someone skate and the
feeling<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:03.710> excitement<00:01:04.040> and<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:04.339> speed

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
feeling and the excitement and the speed

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.950 
feeling and the excitement and the speed
and<00:01:04.790> then<00:01:04.879> one<00:01:05.059> year<00:01:05.089> all<00:01:05.390> balled<00:01:05.630> down<00:01:05.810> in

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
and then one year all balled down in

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.020 
and then one year all balled down in
numbers<00:01:06.259> and<00:01:06.409> times<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:06.950> seconds<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:07.640> was

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
numbers and times and seconds and was

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.580 
numbers and times and seconds and was
that<00:01:08.180> held<00:01:08.390> long<00:01:08.570> enough<00:01:08.840> was<00:01:08.990> that<00:01:09.140> this<00:01:09.409> many

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
that held long enough was that this many

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.890 
that held long enough was that this many
rotations<00:01:09.920> was<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:10.970> edge<00:01:11.090> like<00:01:11.390> exaggerated

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
rotations was the edge like exaggerated

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.600 
rotations was the edge like exaggerated
and<00:01:12.049> you're<00:01:12.229> you<00:01:12.740> never<00:01:12.860> have<00:01:13.130> a<00:01:13.159> chance<00:01:13.430> to

like sit back and enjoy and I felt that

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.680

way even skating in this system I never

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.990 
way even skating in this system I never
had<00:01:17.930> a<00:01:17.960> chance<00:01:18.229> to<00:01:18.729> connect<00:01:19.729> with<00:01:19.880> the

end I think people remember an emotional
performance<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:51.110> right<00:01:51.830> now<00:01:52.039> sometimes<00:01:52.700> to

performance and right now sometimes to

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.790 
performance and right now sometimes to
me<00:01:53.090> it<00:01:53.149> feels<00:01:53.390> like<00:01:53.630> it's<00:01:54.020> information

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800

know<00:02:08.239> but<00:02:08.569> sometimes<00:02:09.289> it's<00:02:09.709> difficult<00:02:09.890> then

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
know but sometimes it's difficult then

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.270 
know but sometimes it's difficult then
to<00:02:10.759> really<00:02:11.390> be<00:02:11.690> emotionally<00:02:12.379> involved<00:02:12.739> I

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
to really be emotionally involved I

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.270 
to really be emotionally involved I
think<00:02:13.840> we<00:02:14.840> have<00:02:15.020> seen<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.500> right<00:02:15.680> people

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.530 

you<00:02:18.730> know<00:02:18.850> it<00:02:18.970> takes<00:02:19.210> a<00:02:19.360> while<00:02:19.390> for<00:02:21.510> changes<00:02:22.510> to

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
you know it takes a while for changes to

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.200 
you know it takes a while for changes to
happen<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.470> sink<00:02:23.740> into<00:02:23.980> everybody<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:25.090> know

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
happen to sink into everybody you know

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.470 
happen to sink into everybody you know
with<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.510> coaches<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:27.450> performers<00:02:28.450> and

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
with the coaches and the performers and

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:37.830 
with the coaches and the performers and
the<00:02:28.990> crowd<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:36.370> new<00:02:36.520> scoring<00:02:36.820> system<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.630> work

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
the crowd the new scoring system to work

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.220 
the crowd the new scoring system to work
and<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:38.830> think<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:40.000> know<00:02:40.120> it's<00:02:40.300> there<00:02:40.570> to<00:02:40.840> judge

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.680 

the<00:02:44.230> answer<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.770> judging<00:02:45.220> system<00:02:45.370> was<00:02:45.700> because

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
the answer to judging system was because

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.920 
the answer to judging system was because
they<00:02:47.080> wanted<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.560> stop<00:02:47.800> the<00:02:48.040> corruption<00:02:48.280> and

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
they wanted to stop the corruption and

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.390 
they wanted to stop the corruption and
what<00:02:49.930> did<00:02:50.080> what<00:02:50.320> was<00:02:50.500> happening<00:02:50.950> behind<00:02:51.310> the

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
what did what was happening behind the

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.449 
what did what was happening behind the
scenes<00:02:51.610> and<00:02:52.360> it's<00:02:52.780> not<00:02:52.959> so<00:02:53.260> much<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:54.070> system

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
scenes and it's not so much the system

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.460 
scenes and it's not so much the system
that<00:02:54.610> was<00:02:54.760> wrong<00:02:54.940> it<00:02:55.270> was<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.480> people<00:02:55.870> in<00:02:56.260> the

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
that was wrong it was the people in the

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.140 
that was wrong it was the people in the
system<00:02:56.830> so<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.430> doesn't<00:02:57.670> matter<00:02:57.760> what<00:02:57.970> system

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
system so it doesn't matter what system

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.690 
system so it doesn't matter what system
you<00:02:58.420> have<00:02:58.630> as<00:02:59.170> long<00:02:59.380> as<00:02:59.530> that<00:02:59.650> people<00:03:00.070> system

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
you have as long as that people system

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.780 
you have as long as that people system
is<00:03:00.790> corrupted<00:03:01.209> there's<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.510> problem
