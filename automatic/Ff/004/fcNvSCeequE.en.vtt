00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.640 
few years about something that I didn't
think<00:00:14.880> was<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.150> big<00:00:15.599> an<00:00:15.750> issue<00:00:15.900> that's<00:00:16.350> why<00:00:16.619> I

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
think was that big an issue that's why I

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.460 
think was that big an issue that's why I
haven't<00:00:16.949> said<00:00:17.340> anything<00:00:17.369> about<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:19.199> I

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
haven't said anything about it so I

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.470 
haven't said anything about it so I
suppose<00:00:19.949> you're<00:00:20.130> wondering<00:00:20.189> what<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.270> issue

mm-hmm
I<00:00:26.730> don't<00:00:27.660> know<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.080> just<00:00:29.070> think<00:00:29.220> it's<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.400> bit

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
I don't know I just think it's a bit

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.609 
I don't know I just think it's a bit
strange<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.480> suppose<00:00:30.990> that's<00:00:31.170> why<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.410> haven't

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
strange I suppose that's why I haven't

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.310 
strange I suppose that's why I haven't
said<00:00:31.890> anything<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.820> know<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.809> suppose

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
said anything you know I suppose

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.740 
said anything you know I suppose
obviously<00:00:34.860> I'm<00:00:35.040> not<00:00:35.219> going<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:36.090> say<00:00:36.300> every

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
obviously I'm not going to say every

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.340 
obviously I'm not going to say every
single<00:00:36.989> detail<00:00:37.620> about<00:00:37.649> my<00:00:37.950> life<00:00:38.540> so<00:00:39.540> that's

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
single detail about my life so that's

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.709 
single detail about my life so that's
why<00:00:40.739> felt<00:00:41.430> like<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.700> needed<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.000> cover<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.420> up<00:00:42.480> so

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
why felt like I needed to cover it up so

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.760 
why felt like I needed to cover it up so
much<00:00:43.070> but<00:00:44.210> honestly<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.420> truth<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.350> that

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
much but honestly the truth is is that

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.660 
much but honestly the truth is is that
this<00:00:47.250> isn't<00:00:47.670> actually<00:00:48.090> my<00:00:48.570> real<00:00:48.809> voice<00:00:49.670> so

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
this isn't actually my real voice so

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.080 
this isn't actually my real voice so
I've<00:00:50.879> been<00:00:51.030> putting<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:52.250> obviously<00:00:53.250> people

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
I've been putting on obviously people

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.689 
I've been putting on obviously people
who<00:00:54.360> who<00:00:54.809> saw<00:00:55.079> me<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.739> know<00:00:55.860> when<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.550> started

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
who who saw me you know when I started

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.240 
who who saw me you know when I started
YouTube<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.480> didn't<00:00:57.750> actually<00:00:58.699> do<00:00:59.699> any

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
YouTube I didn't actually do any

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.450 
YouTube I didn't actually do any
speaking<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.399> my<00:01:02.520> videos<00:01:03.140> so<00:01:04.159> when<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.309> did

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
speaking in my videos so when it did

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.370 
speaking in my videos so when it did
come<00:01:05.700> speaking<00:01:06.240> always<00:01:06.540> had<00:01:06.750> had<00:01:06.900> some<00:01:07.140> time

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
come speaking always had had some time

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.330 
come speaking always had had some time
sort<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.830> practice<00:01:08.659> so<00:01:09.659> my<00:01:10.229> real<00:01:10.560> speaking

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
sort of practice so my real speaking

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.660 
sort of practice so my real speaking
voice<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:13.200> they<00:01:14.010> just<00:01:14.280> have<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.490> bear

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
voice is this they just have to bear

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.070 
voice is this they just have to bear
with<00:01:14.700> me<00:01:15.060> for<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.299> second<00:01:15.689> because<00:01:15.720> I've

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
with me for a second because I've

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.660 
with me for a second because I've
started<00:01:16.920> with<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:18.360> well.she<00:01:18.990> voice

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
started with this this well.she voice

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.280 
started with this this well.she voice
but<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.970> isn't<00:01:21.299> my<00:01:21.689> actual<00:01:22.110> tone<00:01:24.140> so<00:01:25.140> you

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
but this isn't my actual tone so you

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.770 
but this isn't my actual tone so you
just<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.820> just

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.320 

okay<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.230> this<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.830> my<00:01:34.860> actual<00:01:35.400> speaking<00:01:36.090> tone

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
okay so this is my actual speaking tone

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.720 
okay so this is my actual speaking tone
now<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.380> little<00:01:37.530> bit<00:01:37.680> different<00:01:38.010> to<00:01:38.550> what

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
now it's a little bit different to what

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.190 
now it's a little bit different to what
all<00:01:38.910> you<00:01:39.060> guys<00:01:39.240> have<00:01:39.450> been<00:01:39.570> used<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.930> over<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
all you guys have been used to over the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.200 
all you guys have been used to over the
years<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.680> don't<00:01:40.920> know<00:01:41.010> if<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.430> should<00:01:41.460> carry<00:01:42.090> it

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
years I don't know if I should carry it

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.770 
years I don't know if I should carry it
on<00:01:42.390> or<00:01:42.600> not<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.770> suppose<00:01:44.760> people<00:01:45.030> used<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.540> it

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
on or not I suppose people used to it

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.680 
on or not I suppose people used to it
anyway<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.260> maybe<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.890> will<00:01:47.180> but<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.390> just

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
anyway so maybe I will but I just

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.500 
anyway so maybe I will but I just
thought<00:01:48.930> like<00:01:49.460> might<00:01:50.460> as<00:01:50.640> well<00:01:50.760> say<00:01:51.000> something

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
thought like might as well say something

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.300 
thought like might as well say something
because<00:01:51.690> it<00:01:52.050> was<00:01:52.170> sort<00:01:52.410> of<00:01:52.470> hurting<00:01:52.860> my<00:01:52.890> throat

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
because it was sort of hurting my throat

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.680 
because it was sort of hurting my throat
whenever<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.760> was<00:01:53.880> trying<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.120> do<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.540> know

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
whenever I was trying to do it you know

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.020 
whenever I was trying to do it you know
so<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.530> thought<00:01:55.800> to<00:01:55.980> myself<00:01:56.010> like<00:01:56.550> what<00:01:56.700> maybe<00:01:56.880> I

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
so I thought to myself like what maybe I

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.450 
so I thought to myself like what maybe I
should<00:01:57.330> just<00:01:57.510> say<00:01:57.690> something<00:01:58.230> but<00:01:59.160> then<00:01:59.370> I

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
should just say something but then I

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.430 
should just say something but then I
thought<00:01:59.670> why<00:01:59.910> not<00:01:59.940> just<00:02:00.630> carried<00:02:01.020> on<00:02:01.110> for<00:02:01.380> a

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
thought why not just carried on for a

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.660 
thought why not just carried on for a
little<00:02:01.620> bit<00:02:01.710> longer<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.040> just<00:02:02.160> see<00:02:02.400> how<00:02:02.550> it

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
little bit longer and just see how it

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.180 
little bit longer and just see how it
goes<00:02:02.850> but<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.540> just<00:02:03.900> genuinely<00:02:04.170> can't<00:02:04.770> carry<00:02:05.100> on

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
goes but I just genuinely can't carry on

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.520 
goes but I just genuinely can't carry on
doing<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.850> anymore<00:02:06.060> itself<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.260> thought<00:02:07.500> I

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
doing it anymore itself so I thought I

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.040 
doing it anymore itself so I thought I
would<00:02:07.800> just<00:02:07.920> actually<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.429> trying<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.869> know

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
would just actually just trying you know

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.870 
would just actually just trying you know
say<00:02:10.320> to<00:02:10.380> you<00:02:10.530> guys<00:02:10.740> that<00:02:11.010> actually<00:02:11.130> this<00:02:11.490> is<00:02:11.670> my

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
say to you guys that actually this is my

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.310

how it goes okay so obviously that video
is<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.070> load<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.250> shit<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.790> just<00:02:27.150> felt<00:02:27.330> this<00:02:27.420> new

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
is a load of shit I just felt this new

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.420 
is a load of shit I just felt this new
video<00:02:27.870> instead<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.440> just<00:02:28.590> wanted<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.160> try<00:02:29.400> it

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
video instead I just wanted to try it

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.960 
video instead I just wanted to try it
out<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:30.630> think<00:02:31.590> I<00:02:31.740> think<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.130> is<00:02:32.550> pretty<00:02:32.790> good

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
out I think I think that is pretty good

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.850 
out I think I think that is pretty good
though<00:02:33.180> it's<00:02:33.510> pretty<00:02:33.720> good<00:02:33.959> I<00:02:34.170> think<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.769> is

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
though it's pretty good I think that is

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.380 
though it's pretty good I think that is
convincing<00:02:35.370> I'm<00:02:35.790> sure<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.650> do<00:02:37.650> have<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.040> secret

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
convincing I'm sure I do have a secret

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.080 
convincing I'm sure I do have a secret
and<00:02:39.390> that<00:02:39.420> secret<00:02:39.600> is<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.440> lot<00:02:40.800> darker<00:02:41.489> than

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
and that secret is a lot darker than

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.160 
and that secret is a lot darker than
anything<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:43.019> you<00:02:43.110> could<00:02:43.290> ever<00:02:43.500> imagine
