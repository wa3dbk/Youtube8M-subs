all<00:00:01.680> right<00:00:01.890> the<00:00:02.520> time<00:00:02.730> has<00:00:02.790> come<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.270> break<00:00:03.389> the

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
all right the time has come to break the

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.070 
all right the time has come to break the
wineglass<00:00:04.549> but<00:00:05.549> I'm<00:00:06.299> not<00:00:06.540> gonna<00:00:06.690> do<00:00:06.870> it<00:00:06.960> with

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
wineglass but I'm not gonna do it with

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.379 
wineglass but I'm not gonna do it with
my<00:00:07.200> own<00:00:07.319> voice<00:00:07.639> my<00:00:08.639> contract<00:00:09.059> with<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.240> met

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
my own voice my contract with the met

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.930 
my own voice my contract with the met
won't<00:00:09.599> commit<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:10.370> and<00:00:11.370> there's<00:00:11.759> another

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
won't commit that and there's another

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.930 
won't commit that and there's another
problem<00:00:12.380> this<00:00:13.380> takes<00:00:13.650> practice<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.790> only

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
problem this takes practice and I only

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.630 
problem this takes practice and I only
have<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.360> one<00:00:15.389> wineglass<00:00:16.279> so<00:00:17.279> I'm<00:00:17.400> going<00:00:17.580> to

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
have the one wineglass so I'm going to

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.029 
have the one wineglass so I'm going to
try<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:17.940> first<00:00:18.240> using<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:19.039> ordinary

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
try it first using this ordinary

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.570 
try it first using this ordinary
laboratory<00:00:20.250> beaker<00:00:22.039> these<00:00:23.039> how<00:00:23.279> it's<00:00:23.430> going

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
laboratory beaker these how it's going

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.870 
laboratory beaker these how it's going
to<00:00:23.699> work<00:00:24.650> well<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:25.949> stuff<00:00:26.220> here<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.609> going<00:00:26.760> to

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
to work well this stuff here is going to

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.980 
to work well this stuff here is going to
substitute<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.510> me<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.050> make<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> pure<00:00:28.890> tone

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
substitute for me and make a pure tone

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.080 
substitute for me and make a pure tone
that<00:00:30.990> will<00:00:31.109> make<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.410> beaker<00:00:31.859> vibrate<00:00:32.399> and

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
that will make the beaker vibrate and

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.549 
that will make the beaker vibrate and
then<00:00:33.239> I've<00:00:33.329> got<00:00:33.480> this<00:00:33.570> microphone<00:00:33.870> here<00:00:34.410> which

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
then I've got this microphone here which

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.290 
then I've got this microphone here which
is<00:00:34.680> listening<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.100> what<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.460> beaker<00:00:35.730> does<00:00:35.940> and

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
is listening to what the beaker does and

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.630 
is listening to what the beaker does and
the<00:00:37.140> output<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.710> microphone<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.489> this

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
the output of the microphone is on this

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.760 
the output of the microphone is on this
oscilloscope<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.480> you'll<00:00:39.600> be<00:00:39.750> able<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.110> see<00:00:40.350> on

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
oscilloscope so you'll be able to see on

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.650 
oscilloscope so you'll be able to see on
the<00:00:41.010> oscilloscope<00:00:41.280> what<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> beaker<00:00:42.480> is

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
the oscilloscope what the beaker is

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:51.700 
the oscilloscope what the beaker is
doing<00:00:42.930> watch<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:44.239> you<00:00:45.239> see<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:48.469> okay<00:00:49.469> now

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
doing watch this you see that okay now

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.619 
doing watch this you see that okay now
what<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.039> do<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.520> turn<00:00:53.760> up<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
what I have to do is to turn up the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.599 
what I have to do is to turn up the
volume<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.789> makes<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.030> beaker<00:00:57.329> vibrate

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
volume and that makes the beaker vibrate

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.529 
volume and that makes the beaker vibrate
now<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.670> can<00:00:59.850> see<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.210> beaker<00:01:00.510> is

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
now you can see that the beaker is

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.020 
now you can see that the beaker is
vibrating<00:01:01.140> but<00:01:01.859> not<00:01:02.010> very<00:01:02.219> much<00:01:02.520> because<00:01:02.730> it's

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
vibrating but not very much because it's

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.640 
vibrating but not very much because it's
not<00:01:03.210> exactly<00:01:03.600> at<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> right<00:01:04.019> frequency<00:01:04.170> it

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
not exactly at the right frequency it

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.960 
not exactly at the right frequency it
has<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.920> be<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> precisely<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.790> right

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
has to be a precisely the right

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.210 
has to be a precisely the right
frequency<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.869> resonant<00:01:07.439> frequency<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
frequency the resonant frequency of the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.250 
frequency the resonant frequency of the
beaker<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:09.090> order<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.479> vibrate<00:01:09.840> enough<00:01:09.960> to

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
beaker in order to vibrate enough to

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.289 
beaker in order to vibrate enough to
make<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.500> break<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.400> I'm<00:01:11.520> going<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.850> tune<00:01:12.090> this

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
make it break so I'm going to tune this

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:22.690 
make it break so I'm going to tune this
to<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> right<00:01:13.020> frequency

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.320 

there<00:01:23.390> it<00:01:23.479> is<00:01:23.570> right<00:01:23.750> there

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.440 

that's<00:01:26.930> it<00:01:27.110> all<00:01:27.890> right<00:01:28.040> now<00:01:28.280> all<00:01:28.940> I<00:01:28.970> have<00:01:29.210> to<00:01:29.300> do

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
that's it all right now all I have to do

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.120 
that's it all right now all I have to do
is<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:29.720> turn<00:01:29.990> up<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.230> volume<00:01:30.380> all<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:30.860> way<00:01:31.040> up

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
is to turn up the volume all the way up

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.580 
is to turn up the volume all the way up
and<00:01:31.520> it<00:01:31.940> will<00:01:32.030> break<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:32.270> beaker<00:01:32.750> okay<00:01:33.530> you

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
and it will break the beaker okay you

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.350 
and it will break the beaker okay you
ready<00:01:33.800> for<00:01:33.950> this<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:34.910> people<00:01:35.210> in<00:01:35.270> the

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
ready for this and the people in the

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.550 
ready for this and the people in the
first<00:01:35.540> couple<00:01:35.690> of<00:01:35.840> rows<00:01:35.990> your<00:01:36.170> ears<00:01:36.380> will

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
first couple of rows your ears will

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.840 
first couple of rows your ears will
bleed<00:01:36.680> a<00:01:36.800> little<00:01:37.040> bit<00:01:37.190> but<00:01:37.400> don't<00:01:37.580> worry<00:01:37.670> about

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
bleed a little bit but don't worry about

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.640 
bleed a little bit but don't worry about
it<00:01:38.090> it's<00:01:38.210> not<00:01:38.330> serious<00:01:38.570> you<00:01:39.260> ready<00:01:39.440> for<00:01:39.530> this

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
it it's not serious you ready for this

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:46.410 
it it's not serious you ready for this
here<00:01:40.220> we<00:01:40.310> go

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.940 

so<00:01:47.420> we<00:01:47.630> managed<00:01:47.899> to<00:01:47.929> do<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.319> without<00:01:48.619> ever

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
so we managed to do it without ever

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.459 
so we managed to do it without ever
breaking<00:01:49.100> this<00:01:49.729> exquisite<00:01:50.270> wine<00:01:50.479> glass<00:01:50.810> you

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
breaking this exquisite wine glass you

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:52.690 
breaking this exquisite wine glass you
see<00:01:51.619> that's<00:01:51.770> why<00:01:51.890> they<00:01:52.039> bought<00:01:52.219> it<00:01:52.369> for<00:01:52.579> me

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
see that's why they bought it for me

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.859 
see that's why they bought it for me
they<00:01:52.880> knew<00:01:53.090> I'd<00:01:53.240> never<00:01:53.359> get<00:01:53.539> around<00:01:53.659> to

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
they knew I'd never get around to

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:00.820 
they knew I'd never get around to
breaking<00:01:54.229> it<00:01:54.880> alright<00:01:55.880> that's<00:01:56.630> it<00:01:56.750> for<00:01:56.899> today

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.890
