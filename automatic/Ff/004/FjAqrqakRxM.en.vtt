video here's what it looks like I

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.120 
video here's what it looks like I

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
believe it's supposed to be based on the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.600 
believe it's supposed to be based on the
the<00:01:11.610> g<00:01:11.820> one<00:01:11.850> version<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.780> guzzle<00:01:13.229> i<00:01:14.030> was<00:01:16.610> born

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
the g one version of guzzle i was born

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.630 
the g one version of guzzle i was born
when<00:01:18.000> transformers<00:01:18.869> came<00:01:19.320> out<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.280> wasn't

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
when transformers came out so I wasn't

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.359 
when transformers came out so I wasn't
old<00:01:20.850> enough<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.930> watch<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.590> cartoon<00:01:23.009> or

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
old enough to watch the cartoon or

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.850 
old enough to watch the cartoon or
understand<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:24.830> that's<00:01:25.830> my<00:01:26.100> guess<00:01:26.159> and

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
understand it but that's my guess and

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.910 
understand it but that's my guess and
here's<00:01:28.860> where<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.189> shows<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.700> creole<00:01:30.240> brick

and on their information on the back
that's<00:01:34.860> what<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.100> looks<00:01:35.220> like<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.610> back<00:01:35.939> it
