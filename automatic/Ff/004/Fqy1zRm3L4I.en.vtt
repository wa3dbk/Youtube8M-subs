 above me is already my problem and 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:19.230
 throwing thought I'd get a little 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:22.470
 But I did not have our business like this. 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.840
 I have to do is nephew until 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.520
 You can check the event of our time. 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:32.010
 all red right 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.630
 I also thought 'I was not there, it's a 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.310
 right-click the 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:40.560
 right and drink water 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:43.220
 we even tried to armor our house 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.220
 with four 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:51.240
 the committee notes with better touch 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.370
 user as I was playing here was a 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.280
 bullet also heard the shots 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:01.470
 the advantage of using it will require 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:11.720
 curative use our what happens here if 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:11.720
 the canned meat getting different 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:29.640
 hunger and thirst for health and 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:32.040
 but you do not want to use the 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:42.330
 the water you have to choose now is 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:55.260
 Look what I'm going to do I'm going to have it 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:56.370

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.240
 playing now 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:05.540
 and if you like the game back 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:08.760
 bringing around more videos and tease her and 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.760
 will make it viable to have a training mode 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.180
 I think you can not train and have the 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.180
 right size 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:23.930

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.040
 the ball right grip there is 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.230
 access only in the game with armament 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:34.940
 equipment and everything else and took the team 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:38.600
 to the player that the user takes advantage of 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:42.230

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:45.710

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:55.160
 top application of high second goal with 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:07:11.360
