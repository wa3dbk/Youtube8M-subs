00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello, let's do a little review 

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.099
 car charger 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.550
 battery 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:20.600
 This device is assembled on the diagrams from the book 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:20.600
 fault with the logbook issue and 96 for 87 here 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.830
 This device ranked second on 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.560
 exhibition of creativity 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:54.250
 Amateur radio with designer Dosaaf 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:56.379
 This is for 32 serious tourists. 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.620
 its feature is that it is possible 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:05.350
 train the battery i mean there are three 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:08.410
 mode of operation one sites mode one 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.710
 cycle or and will speak or discharge mc it 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:14.940
 several cycles can be 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:21.910
 automatically, well, entry is normal 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:24.660
 Charger mode is working 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.660
 good ventilation 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:34.340
 at the moment the device is on 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.450
 the battery in his two banks is stuck 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:42.080
 so when you turn on the device 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.940
 maximum 84 now we include it in a network 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:50.270
 begin to charge for the guys current 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:51.430
 you half impero can also turn on 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.910
 mode 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.890
 discharges see the glow next to 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.280
 discharged green frame is charging 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:07.430
 blue, you can increase the firebox 5 amps 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:09.940
 then shit yellow well try 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.400
 already tried to discharge 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.960
 discharge does not occur because 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.550
 battery and so deeply discharged if 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.210
 he was out correctly so that's as it should 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.850
 and as I said, two cans stuck together 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:27.740
 Here it has a voltage of 9 and 8 volts, but 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:30.200
 she is charged and when the discharge is 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.140
 the device discharges the battery to 10 and 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:38.150
 2 volts so now trying to charge 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.700
 any mode here charges up to 15 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.770
 14 8 volts 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:51.130
 battery discharges how are you 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:57.940
 to 10 there and eighty five volts here 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:03:00.490
 at the same time the ammeter burns with different colors 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.740
 during the discharge charge and charge by 5 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:07.390
 ampere ie you can see from afar 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:09.640
 condition of the device here of course 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.580
 The big plus is that you can 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.420
 train the battery that is so 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:20.220
 the way to remove sulfation is necessary 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:24.210
 do once or twice a year 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.920
 the device is used for block for 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:33.580
 rechargeable batteries with capacity from 40 to 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:36.820
 100 amps of device power is obtained 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:40.800
 idle 25 here in mode 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.800
 maximum current 180 here 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:56.590
 this particular issue of the magazine is easy to find in 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:56.590
 the Internet in beef in search in prl release 96 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:06.190
 Here they gave them not to charge the battery 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:10.120
 a normal device is giving birth to it 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:13.780
 small juice somewhere an half ampere 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.310
 chinese voltmeter shows 13 60 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:22.870
 soviet digital soviet voltmeter 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.870
 shows 13 and four volts 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.450
 Chinese school to indicate general then 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.450
 fine 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:44.130
 we press 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:44.130
 discharge here he started the device to discharge it 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.080
 we changed to green 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:59.889
 Immediately only by discharge, too , somewhere 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:04.750
 half ampere Well it's all in the mode of 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:07.120
 nc the device does all this automatically in 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.930
 In this mode 1 , we already select everything as 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.930
 him act 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:18.190
 Thank you all for subscribing 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:20.819
 Like the channel will be a lot 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.819
 interesting
