modes<00:04:10.640> so<00:04:11.480> what's<00:04:11.840> getting<00:04:12.049> a<00:04:12.110> big<00:04:12.380> bit

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
modes so what's getting a big bit

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.860 
modes so what's getting a big bit
different<00:04:13.640> people<00:04:13.940> and<00:04:14.120> it<00:04:14.209> obviously<00:04:14.330> his

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
different people and it obviously his

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:15.720 
different people and it obviously his
speed

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
speed

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.420 
speed
a<00:04:15.760> bit<00:04:16.000> low<00:04:16.180> so<00:04:16.209> obviously<00:04:16.690> gets<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.079> big<00:04:17.290> an

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
a bit low so obviously gets the big an

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.620 
a bit low so obviously gets the big an
acceleration<00:04:18.430> away<00:04:18.760> but<00:04:18.940> then<00:04:19.030> he<00:04:19.150> drops<00:04:19.449> off

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
acceleration away but then he drops off

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.900 
acceleration away but then he drops off
in<00:04:19.780> pace<00:04:20.049> so<00:04:20.889> I'm<00:04:20.949> giving<00:04:21.160> a<00:04:21.280> rating<00:04:21.579> of<00:04:21.639> eight
