00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.470
 yesterday the center of Calatayud was filled with 

00:00:02.979 --> 00:00:07.569
 little world if pins and crochet hooks 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.060
 in the bobbin lace show 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.800
 who made the lacemaker's association 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.750
 bilbilitanas we did not want it 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.039
 lose and even our partner diego 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.550
 it was given to labor 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.710
 this is art above all it is art with the 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.079
 and art with bobbins and art with 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.140
 hands so that everyone can see 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.329
 how do we work to encourage people and 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.899
 that you see that the bobbin lace is going 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:36.379
 advancing with the epoch with time or 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:39.050
 it is not limited simply do 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.519
 things that we are used to seeing yes 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.079
 that there has been tradition what happens that 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:45.890
 the bobbin lace was a while 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.570
 very stopped very stopped that was left 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.970
 do and now it's coming back to resurface 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.129
 in the truth is that in all Spain there 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.220
 many lace makers and that's what 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:58.909
 we try that everyone 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.530
 be encouraged and try the lace of 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.940
 bobbin which is what he likes most about 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.549
 make bobbin 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.070
 Well, big things, carpet, the big one 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.270
 this is a scarf for that I am left with a 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.940
 little narrow and then I want to do it 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.460
 another band-aid and with that I am in the 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.470
 4 but I'm going to pass since you 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.540
 very pretty that you have given her the skirt 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.240
 Well, the truth is quite relaxing 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.040
 is that you sit down and you get distracted from everything 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.250
 the rest of you are here focused on the 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.590
 work because if nothing to that already you 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.539
 you have been left without you have already confused 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.670
 undo everything I've done I taught them 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:35.600
 to all these I see that they are snooping 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.119
 because if they really like animals 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.740
 undo it and today like this and this one I went through 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.110
 here that there is no age to make balls 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.509
 no no age serves for two from 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.800
 little girls good notes very old 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.240
 and in these encounters for example 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.830
 you teach maybe the youngest people or 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.509
 people who do not know how to make bobbinies 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.280
 We understand that they learn something without 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.050
 find comfortable and see if we encourage 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:01.729
 because every day there are more people in this 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:04.399
 well, it 's very difficult to divide a 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.649
 learn is more and what to finish 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.060
 principle always costs at the beginning 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.830
 it always costs 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.090
 tell me all the ladies who are 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.739
 here that is very relaxing 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.420
 try this good at best with a 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.090
 little bit of patience and patience gets it 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.180
 If I find it very curious, it strikes me that 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.489
 they do some very nice things and I think 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.870
 that we go I do not know what is very difficult I 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.790
 I see very difficult they do not seem to 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.170
 they have a lot of management and that 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.060
 ok but I find it super 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.739
 complicated to do besides is that all 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.420
 you have dressed for the occasion man 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.940
 Of course we have dressed 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.060

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:45.560

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.100
 then we wear the saya the apron that 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.410

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.380
 and I wear a scarf lace 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.340
 Bobbin also 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.790
 look at me my monkey is practically made of 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.550
 everything already I show you a little you can 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.750
 do from a shawl for an occasion 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:13.360
 jewelery can be made special 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:17.830

 not that it has no age can be done to
