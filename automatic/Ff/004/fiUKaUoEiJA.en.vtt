I've<00:04:52.879> done<00:04:52.909> it<00:04:53.150> myself<00:04:53.300> but<00:04:53.840> I<00:04:54.680> really<00:04:55.009> like

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:55.159 
I've done it myself but I really like

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:57.249 
I've done it myself but I really like
the<00:04:55.310> way<00:04:55.430> it<00:04:55.490> turned<00:04:55.669> out<00:04:55.879> it's<00:04:56.659> got<00:04:56.810> a<00:04:56.870> bun<00:04:57.110> at

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259 
the way it turned out it's got a bun at

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.189 
the way it turned out it's got a bun at
the<00:04:57.379> back<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:57.889> then<00:04:58.009> it's<00:04:58.190> hot<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:59.120> this<00:04:59.900> is

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
the back and then it's hot and this is

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.529 
the back and then it's hot and this is
actually<00:05:00.650> a<00:05:00.680> hair<00:05:00.919> comb<00:05:01.159> that<00:05:01.729> I<00:05:02.090> purchased

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
actually a hair comb that I purchased

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.899 
actually a hair comb that I purchased
while<00:05:02.659> I<00:05:02.720> was<00:05:02.930> in<00:05:03.050> Hawaii<00:05:03.199> so<00:05:03.710> it's<00:05:03.889> got<00:05:04.129> little

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
while I was in Hawaii so it's got little

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:07.210 
while I was in Hawaii so it's got little
shinies<00:05:05.449> all<00:05:05.630> over<00:05:06.020> it<00:05:06.139> in<00:05:06.380> a<00:05:06.470> kind<00:05:06.650> of<00:05:06.800> golden

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
shinies all over it in a kind of golden

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.409 
shinies all over it in a kind of golden
color<00:05:07.370> and<00:05:07.699> I<00:05:07.759> think<00:05:07.970> it<00:05:08.060> turned<00:05:08.180> out<00:05:08.360> really

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
color and I think it turned out really

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.749 
color and I think it turned out really
nicely<00:05:08.930> because<00:05:09.800> it's<00:05:09.919> a<00:05:10.009> little<00:05:10.159> more<00:05:10.250> subtle

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 
nicely because it's a little more subtle

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:13.210 
nicely because it's a little more subtle
and<00:05:11.240> understated<00:05:11.419> than<00:05:12.229> a<00:05:12.319> tiara<00:05:12.680> would<00:05:13.039> be

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
and understated than a tiara would be

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.089 
and understated than a tiara would be
but<00:05:14.000> it's<00:05:14.419> still<00:05:14.630> really<00:05:14.840> fun<00:05:15.169> and<00:05:15.500> blingy<00:05:15.800> and

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
but it's still really fun and blingy and

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.680 
but it's still really fun and blingy and
I<00:05:16.220> really<00:05:16.490> wanted<00:05:16.699> something<00:05:16.909> shiny<00:05:17.300> in<00:05:17.479> my

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
I really wanted something shiny in my

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.050 
I really wanted something shiny in my
hair<00:05:17.900> so<00:05:18.650> other<00:05:18.919> than<00:05:19.009> that<00:05:19.190> I<00:05:19.580> borrowed<00:05:19.880> some

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
hair so other than that I borrowed some

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.920 
hair so other than that I borrowed some
