00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.409 

so<00:00:01.079> an<00:00:01.199> ankle<00:00:01.469> replacement<00:00:01.500> is<00:00:02.250> is<00:00:03.030> really

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
so an ankle replacement is is really

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.869 
so an ankle replacement is is really
just<00:00:03.600> changing<00:00:04.259> and<00:00:04.549> resurfacing<00:00:05.549> this

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
just changing and resurfacing this

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.940 
just changing and resurfacing this
surface<00:00:06.299> on<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.960> tibia<00:00:07.200> bone<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:07.770> this

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
surface on the tibia bone and this

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.169 
surface on the tibia bone and this
surface<00:00:08.130> on<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.490> tailless<00:00:08.790> bone<00:00:08.970> so<00:00:09.150> that

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
surface on the tailless bone so that

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.150 
surface on the tailless bone so that
we're<00:00:09.630> really<00:00:09.780> changing<00:00:10.500> that<00:00:10.620> gliding

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
we're really changing that gliding

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.070 
we're really changing that gliding
surface<00:00:11.550> from<00:00:11.759> from<00:00:12.150> an<00:00:12.240> arthritic<00:00:12.630> surface

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
surface from from an arthritic surface

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.079 
surface from from an arthritic surface
to<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.230> smooth<00:00:13.650> gliding<00:00:13.980> surface<00:00:14.400> on<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.610> metal

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
to a smooth gliding surface on a metal

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.019 
to a smooth gliding surface on a metal
and<00:00:15.269> plastic<00:00:16.130> bearing<00:00:17.130> surface<00:00:17.490> much<00:00:17.670> like<00:00:17.910> in

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
and plastic bearing surface much like in

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.910 
and plastic bearing surface much like in
a<00:00:18.119> total<00:00:18.449> hip<00:00:18.600> or<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.810> total<00:00:19.109> knee<00:00:19.230> what's

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
a total hip or a total knee what's

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.920 
a total hip or a total knee what's
involved<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.699> performing<00:00:21.180> an<00:00:21.660> ankle

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
involved in performing an ankle

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.279 
involved in performing an ankle
replacement<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:23.160> first<00:00:23.460> gain<00:00:24.420> exposure<00:00:24.930> to

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
replacement is to first gain exposure to

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.019 
replacement is to first gain exposure to
the<00:00:25.439> joint<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.340> incision<00:00:26.910> is

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
the joint and so the incision is

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.640 
the joint and so the incision is
directly<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.869> front<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.230> joint<00:00:28.410> so

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
directly in the front of the joint so

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.769 
directly in the front of the joint so
that<00:00:28.769> we<00:00:28.859> can<00:00:29.039> have<00:00:29.460> easy<00:00:29.820> access<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.300> looking

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
that we can have easy access to looking

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.380 
that we can have easy access to looking
straight<00:00:31.109> at<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.349> joint<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.859> then<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.880> series

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
straight at the joint and then a series

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.920 
straight at the joint and then a series
of<00:00:33.570> jigs<00:00:34.110> or<00:00:34.350> or<00:00:34.559> cutting<00:00:35.130> tools<00:00:35.460> are<00:00:35.930> inserted

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
of jigs or or cutting tools are inserted

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.680 
of jigs or or cutting tools are inserted
into<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> joint<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.520> use<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.210> shin<00:00:39.510> bone

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
into the joint and we use the shin bone

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.770 
into the joint and we use the shin bone
as<00:00:40.320> an<00:00:40.530> alignment<00:00:41.040> guide<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.270> we<00:00:42.329> can<00:00:42.510> we

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
as an alignment guide so that we can we

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.959 
as an alignment guide so that we can we
can<00:00:42.930> get<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.590> cut<00:00:43.860> surface<00:00:44.280> absolutely

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
can get the cut surface absolutely

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.479 
can get the cut surface absolutely
perfectly<00:00:45.450> aligned<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> leg<00:00:46.620> as<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.340> can

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
perfectly aligned to the leg as you can

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.279 
perfectly aligned to the leg as you can
imagine<00:00:47.610> if<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.360> put<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.660> crooked<00:00:49.110> or

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
imagine if this is put in crooked or

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.830 
imagine if this is put in crooked or
tilted<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.070> some<00:00:50.280> way<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.360> stresses

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
tilted in some way that the the stresses

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.330 
tilted in some way that the the stresses
on<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.020> ankle<00:00:52.379> will<00:00:52.530> be<00:00:52.649> abnormal<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.219> it

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
on the ankle will be abnormal and it

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.670 
on the ankle will be abnormal and it
will<00:00:53.430> wear<00:00:53.610> out<00:00:53.760> earlier<00:00:54.629> than<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.930> should<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
will wear out earlier than it should the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.740 
will wear out earlier than it should the
implants<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.550> are<00:00:56.670> placed<00:00:57.000> vary

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
implants that that are placed vary

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.410 
implants that that are placed vary
depending<00:00:58.020> on<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.520> particular<00:00:59.910> design

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
depending on the the particular design

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.029 
depending on the the particular design
and<00:01:00.600> there<00:01:00.690> are<00:01:00.780> there<00:01:01.079> are<00:01:01.140> four<00:01:01.530> designs

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
and there are there are four designs

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.319 
and there are there are four designs
currently<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.640> United<00:01:02.730> States<00:01:03.149> that

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
currently in the United States that

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.810 
currently in the United States that
we're<00:01:03.539> using<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.470> one<00:01:04.710> such<00:01:04.949> design<00:01:05.189> but

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
we're using this is one such design but

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.600 
we're using this is one such design but
they<00:01:05.939> all<00:01:06.119> replace<00:01:06.960> some<00:01:07.680> part<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.159> lower

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
they all replace some part of the lower

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.469 
they all replace some part of the lower
shin<00:01:09.299> bone<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.780> with<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> metal<00:01:10.740> backed<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:12.000> tray

of the of the ankle so that when that
the<00:01:36.450> ankle<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.530> working<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.820> bearing

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
the ankle is is working the the bearing

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.289 
the ankle is is working the the bearing
surface<00:01:39.990> smoothly<00:01:40.770> glides<00:01:41.280> back<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.000> forth

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.469 

the<00:01:49.070> reason<00:01:49.520> that<00:01:49.549> a<00:01:49.970> total<00:01:50.330> ankle

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
the reason that a total ankle

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.630 
the reason that a total ankle
replacement<00:01:50.659> is<00:01:51.259> not<00:01:51.409> often<00:01:51.799> indicated<00:01:52.490> for

replacement is not often indicated for
someone<00:01:52.909> that's<00:01:53.030> younger<00:01:53.540> is<00:01:53.960> because<00:01:54.500> we<00:01:55.220> are

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
someone that's younger is because we are

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.550 
someone that's younger is because we are
not<00:01:55.729> sure<00:01:55.790> how<00:01:56.180> long<00:01:56.540> these<00:01:57.140> types<00:01:57.440> of

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
not sure how long these types of

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.300 
not sure how long these types of
implants<00:01:57.979> will<00:01:58.159> last<00:01:58.369> as<00:01:58.940> you<00:01:59.720> can<00:01:59.869> imagine

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
implants will last as you can imagine

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.460 
implants will last as you can imagine
the<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.549> cycles<00:02:02.090> throughout<00:02:02.540> the<00:02:02.750> day<00:02:02.960> that

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
the the cycles throughout the day that

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.469 
the the cycles throughout the day that
this<00:02:03.619> ankle<00:02:03.979> goes<00:02:04.190> through<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:04.880> surfaces

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
this ankle goes through the surfaces

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.930 
this ankle goes through the surfaces
where<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.530> implant<00:02:07.190> contacts<00:02:07.789> a

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
where the the the implant contacts a

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.449 
where the the the implant contacts a
bone<00:02:08.119> can<00:02:08.600> become<00:02:08.869> loosened<00:02:09.380> and<00:02:09.590> so<00:02:10.190> over

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
bone can become loosened and so over

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.580 
bone can become loosened and so over
time<00:02:10.670> these<00:02:11.000> these<00:02:11.330> will<00:02:11.540> wear<00:02:11.989> out<00:02:12.140> like<00:02:12.170> any

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
time these these will wear out like any

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.170 
time these these will wear out like any
mechanical<00:02:13.130> device<00:02:13.190> like<00:02:13.610> your<00:02:13.760> car<00:02:13.970> it

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
mechanical device like your car it

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.670 
mechanical device like your car it
eventually<00:02:14.510> will<00:02:14.780> wear<00:02:14.959> out<00:02:15.140> you're<00:02:15.530> going<00:02:15.620> to

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
eventually will wear out you're going to

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.280 
eventually will wear out you're going to
have<00:02:15.800> some<00:02:16.040> years<00:02:16.280> of<00:02:16.489> good<00:02:16.910> good<00:02:17.300> use<00:02:17.900> of<00:02:17.930> this

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
have some years of good good use of this

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.660 
have some years of good good use of this
but<00:02:18.470> at<00:02:18.590> some<00:02:18.860> point<00:02:19.100> you're<00:02:19.250> going<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:19.459> have

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
but at some point you're going to have

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.910 
but at some point you're going to have
to<00:02:19.819> replace<00:02:20.120> this<00:02:20.390> again<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.470> so<00:02:21.650> we've<00:02:21.800> been

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
to replace this again and so we've been

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.740 
to replace this again and so we've been
reluctant<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.550> offer<00:02:22.910> that<00:02:23.269> to<00:02:23.480> younger

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
reluctant to offer that to younger

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.300 
reluctant to offer that to younger
people<00:02:23.900> knowing<00:02:24.500> that<00:02:24.680> this<00:02:24.920> is<00:02:25.130> something

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
people knowing that this is something

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.550 
people knowing that this is something
that<00:02:25.459> will<00:02:26.030> not<00:02:26.239> work<00:02:26.269> for<00:02:26.660> their<00:02:26.780> lifetime<00:02:26.959> so

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
that will not work for their lifetime so

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.290 
that will not work for their lifetime so
typically<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:28.010> younger<00:02:28.100> patient<00:02:28.850> would

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
typically a younger patient would

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.940 
typically a younger patient would
receive<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.690> fusion<00:02:30.230> operation<00:02:30.769> which<00:02:30.920> is

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
receive a fusion operation which is

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.229 
receive a fusion operation which is
something<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:31.489> would<00:02:31.670> last<00:02:31.850> for<00:02:32.150> their

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
something that would last for their

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.150 
something that would last for their
lifetime<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.900> there<00:02:33.470> are<00:02:33.620> advantages<00:02:33.950> and

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
lifetime and there are advantages and

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.100 
lifetime and there are advantages and
disadvantages<00:02:34.310> of<00:02:34.940> fusion<00:02:35.480> versus<00:02:35.810> ankle

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
disadvantages of fusion versus ankle

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.220 
disadvantages of fusion versus ankle
replacement<00:02:36.620> but<00:02:37.390> typically<00:02:38.390> we<00:02:38.569> wait<00:02:38.750> until

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
replacement but typically we wait until

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.570 
replacement but typically we wait until
patients<00:02:39.650> are<00:02:39.709> a<00:02:39.769> little<00:02:39.950> older<00:02:40.280> so<00:02:40.430> that

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
patients are a little older so that

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.729 
patients are a little older so that
hopefully<00:02:40.850> this<00:02:41.540> ankle<00:02:41.959> would<00:02:42.110> last<00:02:42.350> them<00:02:42.709> for

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
hopefully this ankle would last them for

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.229 
hopefully this ankle would last them for
their<00:02:43.160> needs<00:02:43.400> for<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.730> rest<00:02:43.910> of<00:02:44.000> their<00:02:44.120> life

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
their needs for the rest of their life

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.240 
their needs for the rest of their life
when<00:02:44.810> I<00:02:44.840> talked<00:02:45.230> to<00:02:45.350> my<00:02:45.410> colleagues<00:02:46.100> about

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
when I talked to my colleagues about

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.830 
when I talked to my colleagues about
total<00:02:46.730> ankle<00:02:46.850> replacement<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.540> we<00:02:47.600> talked

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
total ankle replacement and we talked

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.440 
total ankle replacement and we talked
about<00:02:47.989> you<00:02:48.440> know<00:02:48.530> what<00:02:49.069> our<00:02:49.420> what<00:02:50.420> our

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
about you know what our what our

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.360 
about you know what our what our
impressions<00:02:51.260> have<00:02:51.350> been<00:02:51.560> on<00:02:51.890> our<00:02:52.010> early

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
impressions have been on our early

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.039 
impressions have been on our early
experience<00:02:52.910> doing<00:02:53.180> total<00:02:53.480> ankles<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:53.930> and

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
experience doing total ankles and and

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.750 
experience doing total ankles and and
how<00:02:54.590> these<00:02:54.799> are<00:02:54.860> different<00:02:55.519> than<00:02:55.640> our

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
how these are different than our

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.819 
how these are different than our
patients<00:02:56.150> with<00:02:56.239> fusions<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:56.750> I<00:02:57.350> think<00:02:57.590> we<00:02:57.680> all

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
patients with fusions and I think we all

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.710 
patients with fusions and I think we all
pretty<00:02:58.010> much<00:02:58.130> agree<00:02:58.489> that<00:02:58.670> that<00:02:59.030> that<00:02:59.690> a

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
pretty much agree that that that a

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.030 
pretty much agree that that that a
patient<00:03:00.170> that's<00:03:00.260> really<00:03:00.350> happy<00:03:00.860> with<00:03:01.010> a

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
patient that's really happy with a

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.940 
patient that's really happy with a
fusion<00:03:01.400> it<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.299> is<00:03:02.570> happy<00:03:03.140> and<00:03:03.290> they're<00:03:03.590> happy

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
fusion it is is happy and they're happy

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.949 
fusion it is is happy and they're happy
that<00:03:03.980> their<00:03:04.220> pain<00:03:04.400> is<00:03:04.549> better<00:03:04.730> but<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.480> patient

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
that their pain is better but a patient

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.800 
that their pain is better but a patient
that<00:03:06.079> doesn't<00:03:06.560> have<00:03:06.799> any<00:03:06.980> pain<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.540> they<00:03:08.540> can

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
that doesn't have any pain and they can

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.960 
that doesn't have any pain and they can
have<00:03:09.109> that<00:03:09.380> range<00:03:09.739> of<00:03:09.920> motion<00:03:09.980> back<00:03:10.549> that<00:03:10.820> they

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
have that range of motion back that they

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.870 
have that range of motion back that they
never<00:03:11.269> had<00:03:11.660> for<00:03:12.200> many<00:03:12.290> years<00:03:12.680> or<00:03:12.920> that<00:03:13.459> they<00:03:13.640> or

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
never had for many years or that they or

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.970 
never had for many years or that they or
that<00:03:14.299> if<00:03:14.450> they<00:03:14.660> did<00:03:14.900> have<00:03:15.079> did<00:03:15.620> go<00:03:15.799> through

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
that if they did have did go through

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.050 
that if they did have did go through
that<00:03:16.100> range<00:03:16.280> of<00:03:16.340> motion<00:03:16.400> they<00:03:16.609> had<00:03:16.730> severe

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
that range of motion they had severe

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.210 
that range of motion they had severe
pain<00:03:17.269> to<00:03:17.810> have<00:03:18.019> that<00:03:18.290> motion<00:03:18.799> back<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:19.160> to

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
pain to have that motion back and to

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.420 
pain to have that motion back and to
have<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.370> functional<00:03:20.060> limb<00:03:20.239> they<00:03:20.989> are<00:03:21.290> so<00:03:22.130> much

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
have a functional limb they are so much

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.199 
have a functional limb they are so much
happier<00:03:23.209> and<00:03:23.450> so<00:03:24.140> I<00:03:24.170> think<00:03:24.380> a<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:25.000> think<00:03:26.000> to<00:03:26.060> see

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
happier and so I think a I think to see

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.180 
happier and so I think a I think to see
the<00:03:26.299> smile<00:03:26.510> on<00:03:26.540> a<00:03:26.750> patient's<00:03:27.170> faces<00:03:27.530> is<00:03:27.709> really

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
the smile on a patient's faces is really

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.810 
the smile on a patient's faces is really
what<00:03:28.459> what<00:03:29.180> drives<00:03:29.750> us<00:03:29.989> to<00:03:30.350> in<00:03:31.160> some<00:03:31.459> ways<00:03:31.609> take

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
what what drives us to in some ways take

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.490 
what what drives us to in some ways take
a<00:03:31.850> chance<00:03:32.239> a<00:03:32.450> little<00:03:32.660> bit<00:03:32.780> on<00:03:32.900> these<00:03:33.079> ankle

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
a chance a little bit on these ankle

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.349 
a chance a little bit on these ankle
replacements<00:03:34.070> and<00:03:34.190> hope<00:03:34.640> that<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:35.030> implant

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
replacements and hope that the implant

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:36.699 
replacements and hope that the implant
we're<00:03:35.480> putting<00:03:35.750> in<00:03:35.840> is<00:03:35.989> not<00:03:36.140> going<00:03:36.350> to<00:03:36.470> fail

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
we're putting in is not going to fail

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.110 
we're putting in is not going to fail
early<00:03:36.739> and<00:03:37.280> not<00:03:37.400> going<00:03:37.579> to<00:03:37.700> require<00:03:37.910> the

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
early and not going to require the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.370 
early and not going to require the
patient<00:03:38.299> to<00:03:38.480> have<00:03:38.540> additional<00:03:38.959> surgery

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
patient to have additional surgery

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.810 
patient to have additional surgery
because<00:03:39.799> certainly<00:03:40.070> the<00:03:40.220> studies<00:03:40.489> have<00:03:40.609> shown

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
because certainly the studies have shown

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.280 
because certainly the studies have shown
that<00:03:40.850> patients<00:03:41.450> with<00:03:41.540> ankle<00:03:41.780> replacement

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
that patients with ankle replacement

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.410 
that patients with ankle replacement
typically<00:03:43.220> have<00:03:43.400> more<00:03:43.730> subsequent

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
typically have more subsequent

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.360 
typically have more subsequent
operations<00:03:45.019> after<00:03:45.230> their<00:03:45.650> ankle<00:03:45.950> placement

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
operations after their ankle placement

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.440 
operations after their ankle placement
then<00:03:46.640> do<00:03:46.880> fusions<00:03:47.560> but<00:03:48.560> I<00:03:48.829> think<00:03:49.250> if<00:03:49.489> you<00:03:50.180> had<00:03:50.420> a

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
then do fusions but I think if you had a

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.500 
then do fusions but I think if you had a
patient<00:03:50.720> with<00:03:51.190> that<00:03:52.190> was<00:03:52.310> able<00:03:53.209> to<00:03:53.239> have<00:03:53.480> some

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
patient with that was able to have some

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.449 
patient with that was able to have some
range<00:03:53.930> of<00:03:54.049> motion<00:03:54.109> of<00:03:54.470> their<00:03:54.560> ankle<00:03:54.920> and<00:03:55.100> not

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
range of motion of their ankle and not

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.430 
range of motion of their ankle and not
have<00:03:55.760> it<00:03:55.790> caused<00:03:56.090> pain<00:03:56.419> I<00:03:56.449> think<00:03:56.660> that<00:03:57.049> person

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
have it caused pain I think that person

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.950 
have it caused pain I think that person
is<00:03:57.530> going<00:03:57.620> to<00:03:57.680> function<00:03:58.100> better<00:03:58.579> and<00:03:58.910> be<00:03:59.479> happy

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
is going to function better and be happy

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.750 
is going to function better and be happy
in<00:04:00.290> general<00:04:00.770> in<00:04:00.830> their<00:04:00.920> life<00:04:01.130> then<00:04:01.460> a<00:04:01.490> person

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
in general in their life then a person

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.400 
in general in their life then a person
with<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.060> fusion

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410
