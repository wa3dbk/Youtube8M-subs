you<00:02:24.250> like<00:02:24.460> which<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:24.970> don't<00:02:25.180> think<00:02:25.450> that's<00:02:25.630> even

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
you like which I don't think that's even

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.120 
you like which I don't think that's even
possible<00:02:25.900> but<00:02:26.320> let's<00:02:26.560> say<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.770> color<00:02:26.980> you

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
possible but let's say the color you

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.070 
possible but let's say the color you
really<00:02:27.160> like<00:02:27.580> is<00:02:27.760> in<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.030> middle<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.510> you

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
really like is in the middle and you

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.300 
really like is in the middle and you
want<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.380> scarf<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.800> be<00:02:29.920> wider

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
want the scarf to be wider

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.800 
want the scarf to be wider
then<00:02:30.730> what<00:02:30.910> you<00:02:30.970> can<00:02:31.000> do<00:02:31.210> is<00:02:31.330> you<00:02:31.450> can<00:02:31.570> do<00:02:31.690> what

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
then what you can do is you can do what

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.170 
then what you can do is you can do what
I'm<00:02:31.930> wearing<00:02:32.380> with<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:33.130> purple<00:02:33.640> scarf<00:02:33.910> or<00:02:34.060> any

other scarf you wanna wear underneath

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.190 
other scarf you wanna wear underneath
and<00:02:35.800> you<00:02:36.310> basically<00:02:36.610> are<00:02:36.700> creating<00:02:37.630> an<00:02:37.750> extra

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
and you basically are creating an extra

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.980 
and you basically are creating an extra
layer<00:02:38.380> so<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.340> can<00:02:39.520> have<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:40.030> purple<00:02:40.450> peeking

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
layer so you can have the purple peeking

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.710 
layer so you can have the purple peeking
out<00:02:41.080> at<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.590> front<00:02:41.860> I'm<00:02:42.670> gonna<00:02:42.880> not<00:02:43.360> have<00:02:43.540> it

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
want and stay there that long so I'm

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.810 
want and stay there that long so I'm
going<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.500> show<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:20.739> some<00:03:20.920> ways<00:03:21.100> to<00:03:21.310> tie<00:03:21.520> that

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
going to show you some ways to tie that

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.000 
going to show you some ways to tie that
might<00:03:21.970> take<00:03:22.180> a<00:03:22.209> little<00:03:22.300> more<00:03:22.540> time<00:03:22.600> but<00:03:23.380> it's

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
might take a little more time but it's

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.190 
might take a little more time but it's
they're<00:03:24.310> also<00:03:24.430> quite<00:03:24.730> easy<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.840> ends<00:03:26.110> are

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
they're also quite easy and the ends are

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.020 
they're also quite easy and the ends are
not<00:03:26.320> as<00:03:26.470> long<00:03:26.650> or<00:03:26.920> they're<00:03:27.430> not<00:03:27.610> there<00:03:27.820> at<00:03:27.940> all

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
not as long or they're not there at all

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.520 
not as long or they're not there at all
so<00:03:28.830> we're<00:03:29.830> putting<00:03:30.010> this<00:03:30.250> green<00:03:30.550> by<00:03:30.850> my<00:03:31.030> face

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
so we're putting this green by my face

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.460 
so we're putting this green by my face
and<00:03:32.530> we're<00:03:32.830> leaving<00:03:33.220> in<00:03:33.310> this<00:03:33.550> end<00:03:34.140> around<00:03:35.140> the

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
and we're leaving in this end around the

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.320 
and we're leaving in this end around the
length<00:03:35.709> that<00:03:36.010> we<00:03:36.070> would<00:03:36.310> want<00:03:36.520> the<00:03:36.670> tail<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.300> be

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
length that we would want the tail to be

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.280 
length that we would want the tail to be
at<00:03:38.050> the<00:03:38.320> side<00:03:39.060> remember<00:03:40.060> that<00:03:40.420> when<00:03:40.540> you<00:03:40.690> tie<00:03:40.959> a

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
at the side remember that when you tie a

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.590 
at the side remember that when you tie a
knot<00:03:41.590> I'm<00:03:42.190> gonna<00:03:42.459> tie<00:03:42.700> these<00:03:42.760> two<00:03:43.180> ends<00:03:43.390> right

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
knot I'm gonna tie these two ends right

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.930 
knot I'm gonna tie these two ends right
now<00:03:43.770> when<00:03:44.770> you<00:03:44.860> tie<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.070> knot<00:03:45.340> at<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:45.730> base<00:03:45.910> of

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
now when you tie a knot at the base of
