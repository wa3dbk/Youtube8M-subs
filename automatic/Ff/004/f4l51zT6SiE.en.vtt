 I think because in a very short time, I have 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.690

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.850

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.440

 they load the crops ready so we're going 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.300
 to do a little bit then a review of what 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.390
 that would be the houses and let's start 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.550
 out here, that's how they can see 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.240
 here would be the rise and we have here 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.450
 some pools that are great we have 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.880
 a few tables so simulate them is super 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.680
 well here some tables and a market type 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.450
 to add facebook because it would be a 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.690
 my video without someone making me some 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.039
 asked team to enter by guys and 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.450
 well here we would have the room 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.090
 television that is very good with the 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.100
 sofas here we would have a double bed and 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.000
 they give double but for what then so that 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.160
 bring your girlfriend guys hey another one in 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.649
 a pig a cow and they cost it there in 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.720
 so let's go here and then 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.289
 here there would be a closet that because it 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.960
 you can close like this serrat this good 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.840
 corpse good here good guys here 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.300
 some views came out and this is a glass 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.170
 Transparent that goes through 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.820
 well let's see what else there is here 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.370
 Now as you can see the house is very 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.260
 pretty up there is a tree that I do not know 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.690
 how you get there because just to 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.460
 and then here we would have grammy 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.260
 is that you can do your crops here 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.890
 a family little pigs 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.550
 kim and kris I do not know if you remember 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.460
 that great little pig best person 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.380
 this is a good god pig family 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.910
 anyway so this would be for nothing 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.840
 home the number three I hope you have them 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.840
 liked and good we go with the number 2 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.880
 and well guys we are now in the house 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.800
 number 2 which is a modern house 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.390
 minimalist is very tiny with 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.340
 talk here there are some crops that 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.160
 are growing and we would go through 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.470
 here here because there would be like to sit 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.200
 to be with madoff's friends what 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.470
 typical here a bed for a giant of 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.000
 30 blocks there and you could continue by 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.650
 here as you can see this simulates how 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.930
 a TV room the truth is that 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.120
 It is very good here if you change 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.050
 well, that 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.590
 quiet that was blocked is not going to 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.260
 look like this so here would be another 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.970
 you will go that this is a bed in the 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.790
 good kitchen is not a bed but yes 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.890
 it seems finally we were selling this here 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.950
 will stimulate the refrigerator of 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:35.230
 where did you get the ice say a 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.230
 program kids of a good program 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:42.230
 we will come here on the outskirts of the 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.450
 Home You You You You You You You You You 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.430
 you can see this a forest but words 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.980
 that I like a lot because they are in number 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.800
 two because apart from the other one because the house 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.140
 It was great but the map was just ice and 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.269
 I do not know how I like that simple 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.820
 forest and it 's here they have a crater 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.500
 to do this is scared and to 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.110
 push people 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.140
 there are some materials if you want 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.239
 do more for my little things and well there 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.340
 blogs or nigrÃ¡n where are you from the club 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.130
 are that I from a program guys from a 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.290
 king who can not read and get 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.299
 good guys so when this would be 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.489
 number two the house I hope you 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.949
 have liked it and then if we go already 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.610
 the number 1 that I do not expect anything 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:28.340
 have liked this house the previous one and 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.610
 come on now with number one there is a 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.610
 little leaf 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.509
 and good guys how can you see we're 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:41.110
 in number 1 that is again this 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:42.880
 piece of house good consultation god like 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.979
 you can see it's built with quartz what 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.500
 which I think I know very well here in 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.039
 snowy little things and then I show you the 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.570
 outskirts 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:52.389
 here as a room if these are 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.979
 tattoo bookstores sit here this 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.800
 would stimulate a kind of dining room 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:59.110
 guys and is let's say this here the 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.539
 truth is that no no no I do not know who is 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:05.500
 but body here this would be another dining room 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:07.860
 and we went up to the second floor or to be a 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.259
 plant here we would have a kind of 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:14.470
 shelf so to call it here 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:16.300
 we would have a klose a good wardrobe by 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.030
 so say it to place little things 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:23.020
 that would be a bath or a good simulator 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:25.240
 of bathroom without water because I'm worth it 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.620
 let's say around here that the network is crystal 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.240
 I think that because then very 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.160
 elegant and it looks very good for the fact 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.960
 to do quartz and good here 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.060
 we would have a television screen that 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.220
 is what this simulates this would be the fourth 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.330
 main as you can see here as 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:43.599
 that there is a lighting will go but 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:45.789
 and I do not know either, so let's say 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:48.219
 here really that there is such a bad 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:52.930
 and the worst is that they are supposed to be 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:56.800
 jokes god because you tell jokes 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:59.139
 good and I want to laugh they meditated good 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.960
 we have in the outskirts and so here 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:05.770
 There would be a little pond and things like that and so 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:08.800
 there's a piece of ya gonna see what's next 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:11.319
 let's say around here and not that is a quito 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.930
 quiet good here because there is grass 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:16.719
 and this would suppose as yes and here 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:21.210
 we would have a very nice piece of pool 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:21.210
 great and well here in this game 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:27.939
 the boys this would be house number one 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.770
 I hope you liked this 

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:31.270
 special because I was looking for 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.039

 they provide as you can see as this is 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.160
 pure ice 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.320
