00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
really extreme version of this but

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.660 
really extreme version of this but
things<00:01:52.020> like<00:01:52.320> emotional<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.159> physical<00:01:53.369> abuse

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
things like emotional and physical abuse

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.539 
things like emotional and physical abuse
are<00:01:54.210> happening<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.259> more<00:01:55.649> daily<00:01:56.070> basis<00:01:56.399> and

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
are happening on a more daily basis and

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.310 
are happening on a more daily basis and
I<00:01:56.610> think<00:01:56.790> people<00:01:57.210> are<00:01:57.420> realizing<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.259> the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
I think people are realizing and the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.450 
I think people are realizing and the
player<00:01:58.500> said<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.920> piece<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.250> she

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
player said in the piece that she

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.149 
player said in the piece that she
stopped<00:01:59.759> loving<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.899> sport<00:02:01.290> after<00:02:01.560> after

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
stopped loving the sport after after

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.859 
stopped loving the sport after after
sort<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.490> dealing<00:02:02.700> with<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:03.119> what<00:02:03.540> kind<00:02:03.780> of

sort of dealing with this what kind of

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.270 
sort of dealing with this what kind of
repercussions<00:02:04.170> can<00:02:04.680> something<00:02:05.070> like

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
repercussions can something like

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.830 
repercussions can something like
emotional<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:05.939> physical<00:02:06.060> abuse<00:02:06.479> within<00:02:06.750> a

we know that to be a particularly
horrible<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:23.160> traumatizing<00:02:23.670> experience

professors<00:02:26.010> with<00:02:26.840> Greece<00:02:27.840> by<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.740> way<00:02:28.890> let's

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
professors with Greece by the way let's

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.100 
professors with Greece by the way let's
take<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.610> little<00:02:30.030> bit<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.240> a<00:02:30.300> leaf<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.780> look<00:02:30.990> at

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
take a little bit of a leaf and look at

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.230 
take a little bit of a leaf and look at
the<00:02:31.230> recent<00:02:31.650> situation<00:02:32.460> where<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.880> two<00:02:33.030> girls

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
the recent situation where the two girls

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.820 
the recent situation where the two girls
harassed<00:02:33.750> another<00:02:34.140> girl<00:02:34.410> until<00:02:34.770> she

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
harassed another girl until she

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.910 
harassed another girl until she
committed<00:02:35.310> suicide<00:02:35.450> but<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.600> reason<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:36.990> draw

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
committed suicide but the reason I draw

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.660 
committed suicide but the reason I draw
that<00:02:38.160> connection<00:02:38.640> is<00:02:39.360> because<00:02:40.320> it<00:02:40.890> was<00:02:41.160> on<00:02:41.490> the

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
that connection is because it was on the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.260 
that connection is because it was on the
Internet

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
Internet

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.940 
Internet
it<00:02:42.330> was<00:02:42.480> widely<00:02:43.020> known<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.560> yet<00:02:43.680> nobody

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
it was widely known and yet nobody

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.210 
it was widely known and yet nobody
stepped<00:02:44.760> in<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.900> just<00:02:46.140> drew<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.560> parallel<00:02:46.860> in

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
stepped in and I just drew a parallel in

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.610 
stepped in and I just drew a parallel in
this<00:02:47.370> situation<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.420> University<00:02:49.140> failing

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
this situation to the University failing

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.740 
this situation to the University failing
to<00:02:49.740> step<00:02:49.980> in<00:02:50.190> even<00:02:50.490> though<00:02:50.750> repeated

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
to step in even though repeated

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.810 
to step in even though repeated
incidents<00:02:52.260> of<00:02:52.560> this<00:02:52.709> had<00:02:52.920> been<00:02:53.070> reported<00:02:53.670> to

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
incidents of this had been reported to

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.320 
incidents of this had been reported to
them<00:02:53.970> so<00:02:54.780> I<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:55.500> don't<00:02:56.040> think<00:02:56.370> that<00:02:56.970> these<00:02:57.180> are

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
them so I I don't think that these are

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.230 
them so I I don't think that these are
any<00:02:57.450> more<00:02:57.660> common<00:02:58.320> but<00:02:59.250> what<00:02:59.490> we<00:02:59.850> are<00:02:59.970> learning

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
any more common but what we are learning

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.220 
any more common but what we are learning
is<00:03:00.750> how<00:03:01.200> standard<00:03:02.130> they<00:03:02.280> are<00:03:02.520> and<00:03:02.880> how<00:03:03.230> often

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
is how standard they are and how often

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.970 
is how standard they are and how often
they're<00:03:04.740> covered<00:03:05.400> up<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:05.820> how<00:03:06.680> who<00:03:07.680> are<00:03:07.740> we

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
they're covered up and how who are we

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.090 
they're covered up and how who are we
seem<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.340> be<00:03:08.580> at<00:03:09.030> protecting<00:03:09.950> children<00:03:10.950> even

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
seem to be at protecting children even

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.240 
seem to be at protecting children even
though<00:03:11.280> we<00:03:11.400> claim<00:03:11.880> or<00:03:12.330> college<00:03:13.080> students<00:03:13.590> even

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
though we claim that such a crucial

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.650
