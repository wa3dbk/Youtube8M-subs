00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.109
 a video of today doing the nails in 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.290
 house in five steps 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:09.290
 step 1 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.969
 Let's always leave the nail tips 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:20.330
 in the same direction so we avoid 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.330
 these kamen step 2 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.890
 I always use a path to the cuticle 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.260
 those that reduce and molefe the cuticle 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.830
 is a natural nail protector then 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.180
 avoid taking too much on you and then 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.180
 with pliers or remove the excess 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.149
 step 3 this step is only once per 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.300
 month to remove bumps I 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.690
 I use a sandpaper with three steps, which 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.949
 removes overhang the player and the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.010
 grill 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.039
 first let's remove the overhang 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.649
 ripples or that final part exclaimed 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.180
 then we will police be smooth and 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.490
 finally give a shine 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.549
 step 4 that the vote divided into three 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.830
 first parts we will use a basis for 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.500
 protect the nail from the enamel you can 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.680
 using a builder designed your 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.990
 normal enamel nails always in the center 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.820
 from the cuticle to the tip and 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.340
 then the two sides is the 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.350
 easy for over 500 about a song 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.009
 I'll leave the link here on the screen. 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.950
 the last step of the 4th is to finish 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.549
 with a top coat to give more shine and 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.060
 Help Your Enamel Last Longer 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.500
 5th step theme of who is valuable for 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.630
 clean the ferrets 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.619
 I always taller on the sides with 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.229
 drying oil a moisturizing bath oil 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.790
 so it protects the skin and cuticle in the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.009
 enamel reader 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.180
 besides making it much easier to take 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.040
 the oxen 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.230
 then just clean 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.380
 with the help of a little cotton bud and 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:07.340
 nail polish remover and kisses to the 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.340
 next tips
