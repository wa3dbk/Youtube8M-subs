00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:54.699
Hello, Hookah.org.

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.010
It is Paul here once again with another Shisha
Fruits mix for you.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.049
This one is 100% percent Shisha Fruits, actually.

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:08.311
It’s the first one that I’ve done like
that, but after what I consider to be the

00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:13.329
disappointing session that I had with Shisha
Fruits Multi Fruits, I decided to go ahead

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:19.950
and make my own Multi Fruits blend based roughly
on the fruits that are shown on the top of

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.340
the Multi Fruits container.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.780
This is a combination of orange, banana, strawberry,
pineapple - which are four of the fruits that

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.200
are definitely shown on the container - and
then I decided to kind of spice that up a

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.429
little bit with some mango and a little bit
of peach.

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:43.710
Yes, six different flavors went into this
one and it’s a lot of work, there’s a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:55.070
lot of ratios you have to deal with but it’s
really tasty and I think that this is a very

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.360
good blend.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.750
What really sells this one to me, though,
is how it evolves.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.060
This is not just a general fruity flavor where
you can’t really pick anything out; each

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.239
of the different components has slightly different
properties and they come out in the smoke

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.730
at different times during the session.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.970
They all kind of build in the first maybe
twenty to thirty minutes of the session but

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:27.080
it starts with a really distinct pineapple
and peach combination, which is nice.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.880
I though those two flavors were very good
and they combined and complemented each other

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.159
very well.

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.200
As it heats up a little bit more, you start
to get some of the strawberry, a little bit

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.200
of the mango.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:46.670
I’d say fifth and sixth in this order comes
in the banana and then, finally, the orange.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.140
You saw how much orange I actually put in
there.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:58.360
It’s kind of surprising how subtle the flavor
that is in comparison to things like the pineapple.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:06.040
So this is a flavor, this is a blend that
evolves as you smoke it and I think that that

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.310
is really something unique and interesting
that you don’t find too often if you’re

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.370
just smoking one product.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:24.189
Obviously, the clouds are good but that is
pretty much standard for Shisha Fruits.

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:25.720
So yeah, that’s it.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.120
This is a mix from me to you.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.549
I’m gonna go ahead and call this one Tropicana,
because I’ve got nothing else to call it

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.800
and I’ll see you guys next time.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.599
Make sure to check us out, make sure to check
this flavor mixture out and let us know what

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:42.599

00:03:47.120 --> 00:04:09.680
