and play the old chef we don't have that

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.190 
and play the old chef we don't have that
just<00:05:13.280> yet<00:05:13.520> we<00:05:14.180> work<00:05:14.360> with<00:05:14.539> a<00:05:14.810> lot<00:05:14.840> of<00:05:15.080> different

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
just yet we work with a lot of different

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.529 
just yet we work with a lot of different
junior<00:05:15.889> developments<00:05:16.490> but<00:05:17.270> they're<00:05:17.419> not

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
junior developments but they're not

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:19.029 
junior developments but they're not
based<00:05:17.780> he<00:05:18.050> then<00:05:18.229> be<00:05:18.410> hid<00:05:18.620> so<00:05:18.860> it's

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
based he then be hid so it's

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.610 
based he then be hid so it's
logistically<00:05:19.580> it's<00:05:20.120> not<00:05:20.180> as<00:05:20.419> easy<00:05:20.479> to<00:05:20.750> just<00:05:21.080> to

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
logistically it's not as easy to just to

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.589 
logistically it's not as easy to just to
just<00:05:21.650> pull<00:05:22.010> those<00:05:22.160> guys<00:05:22.370> and<00:05:22.610> but<00:05:22.910> I<00:05:23.120> think

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:23.599 
just pull those guys and but I think

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:25.089 
just pull those guys and but I think
we've<00:05:23.720> done<00:05:23.870> okay<00:05:24.200> we've<00:05:24.410> got<00:05:24.590> some<00:05:24.770> good<00:05:24.919> gaze

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.099 
we've done okay we've got some good gaze

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:28.330 
we've done okay we've got some good gaze
on<00:05:25.340> boards<00:05:25.729> we<00:05:26.270> may<00:05:26.479> look<00:05:26.810> to<00:05:27.470> even<00:05:27.620> strengthen

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
on boards we may look to even strengthen

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.550 
on boards we may look to even strengthen

that coaching place and then start to

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.670 
that coaching place and then start to
build<00:05:35.090> on<00:05:35.300> the<00:05:35.389> imports<00:05:35.750> again<00:05:35.990> and<00:05:36.169> then<00:05:36.289> you

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
build on the imports again and then you

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.050 
build on the imports again and then you
know<00:05:36.800> we<00:05:36.919> can<00:05:37.039> look<00:05:37.190> at<00:05:37.310> what<00:05:37.460> we've<00:05:37.610> got<00:05:37.760> depth

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060
