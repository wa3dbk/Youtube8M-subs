00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
your driving style let's say one is for

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.130 
your driving style let's say one is for
your<00:01:08.729> drive<00:01:09.210> home<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:09.600> want<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.869> for<00:01:09.990> your

your drive home we want is for your
drive<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.530> work<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.040> then<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.880> can<00:01:11.909> turn<00:01:12.450> off

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
MDM mode and dynamic mode I should say

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.100 
MDM mode and dynamic mode I should say
and<00:01:19.020> these<00:01:19.500> are<00:01:19.680> things<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.220> are<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:20.880> been

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
and these are things that are have been

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.920 
and these are things that are have been
greatly<00:01:22.250> fine-tuned<00:01:23.299> so<00:01:24.299> one<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.659> things

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
greatly fine-tuned so one of the things

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.770 
greatly fine-tuned so one of the things
that<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.380> BMW<00:01:25.950> engineers<00:01:26.400> did<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:27.000> make<00:01:27.180> to

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
that the BMW engineers did to make to

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.840 
that the BMW engineers did to make to
just<00:01:28.170> help<00:01:28.530> eliminate<00:01:28.770> turbo<00:01:29.280> lag<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:29.670> these

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
just help eliminate turbo lag on these

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.940 
just help eliminate turbo lag on these
twin-scroll<00:01:30.479> turbo<00:01:30.900> they've<00:01:31.320> got<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> new

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
twin-scroll turbo they've got a new

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.950 
twin-scroll turbo they've got a new
cross<00:01:32.340> pipe<00:01:32.670> across<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.329> manifold<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
cross pipe across the manifold the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.050 
cross pipe across the manifold the
exhaust<00:01:34.229> manifolds<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.369> basically<00:01:35.850> is

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
exhaust manifolds that basically is

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.670 
exhaust manifolds that basically is
allowing<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> turbo<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.049> spin<00:01:37.259> up<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.590> a

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
allowing the turbo to spin up just a

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.620 
allowing the turbo to spin up just a
little<00:01:37.920> bit<00:01:38.070> quicker<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:39.030> can<00:01:39.240> really

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
little bit quicker and you can really

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.450

inch rotors upfront with six Pistons and
then<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:42.430> think<00:02:42.700> 15.6<00:02:43.540> in<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.959> rear<00:02:44.140> their<00:02:44.680> BMW

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
then I think 15.6 in the rear their BMW

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.920 
then I think 15.6 in the rear their BMW
did<00:02:45.670> announce<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.120> they<00:02:46.239> have<00:02:46.390> ceramic

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
did announce that they have ceramic

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.500 
did announce that they have ceramic
brakes<00:02:47.470> available<00:02:47.950> for<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.190> m6<00:02:48.550> in<00:02:49.120> another

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
brakes available for the m6 in another

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.300 
brakes available for the m6 in another
month<00:02:49.780> or<00:02:49.930> two<00:02:49.989> they're<00:02:50.320> not<00:02:50.470> available<00:02:50.739> today

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
month or two they're not available today

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.949 
month or two they're not available today
so<00:02:51.459> this<00:02:51.790> particular<00:02:51.970> car<00:02:52.420> doesn't<00:02:52.720> have<00:02:52.750> them

so this particular car doesn't have them
