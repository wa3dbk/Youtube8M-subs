that's the roofline

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.360 
that's the roofline
that's<00:00:26.050> a<00:00:26.140> nod<00:00:26.320> to<00:00:26.500> the<00:00:26.620> mountains<00:00:26.950> is<00:00:27.040> it<00:00:27.190> it

immaculate<00:00:40.629> and<00:00:41.079> I'm<00:00:41.199> guessing<00:00:41.499> you're

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
immaculate and I'm guessing you're

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.560 
immaculate and I'm guessing you're
making<00:00:41.890> it<00:00:42.010> as<00:00:42.129> wide<00:00:42.550> and<00:00:42.879> long<00:00:43.089> as<00:00:43.359> possible

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
that's the idea the altitude it's we're

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.169

literally a mile high here and it's a

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:50.610 
literally a mile high here and it's a
Kentucky<00:00:49.659> bluegrass<00:00:49.839> field<00:00:50.289> it's<00:00:50.530> the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
Kentucky bluegrass field it's the

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.469 
Kentucky bluegrass field it's the
maximum<00:00:51.190> dimensions<00:00:51.670> allowed<00:00:51.940> by<00:00:52.179> the<00:00:52.239> league

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
120 by 80 and it's a beautiful pitch and

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.819 
120 by 80 and it's a beautiful pitch and
they<00:00:55.300> keep<00:00:55.479> in<00:00:55.629> great<00:00:55.839> shape<00:00:56.019> throughout<00:00:56.379> here
