second expansion at the at the 930

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.050 
second expansion at the at the 930
position<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.920> natural<00:00:20.279> there<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.880> looks

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
position the natural there and looks

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.700 
position the natural there and looks
like<00:00:21.180> reach<00:00:21.359> little<00:00:22.080> confused<00:00:22.410> by<00:00:22.470> what<00:00:22.590> he's

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
like reach little confused by what he's

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.689 
like reach little confused by what he's
building<00:00:22.859> i'm<00:00:23.039> not<00:00:23.130> sure<00:00:23.250> if<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.400> just<00:00:23.550> build

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
building i'm not sure if you just build

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.210 
building i'm not sure if you just build
another<00:00:23.820> hydrolysed<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:25.130> hopefully<00:00:26.130> he

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
another hydrolysed and hopefully he

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.800 
another hydrolysed and hopefully he
didn't<00:00:26.550> hopefully<00:00:27.119> got<00:00:27.330> something<00:00:27.689> i<00:00:27.720> could

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
didn't hopefully got something i could

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.259 
didn't hopefully got something i could
the<00:00:27.930> filers<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.410> instead<00:00:28.730> so<00:00:29.730> hydras<00:00:30.090> would

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
the filers that instead so hydras would

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.639 
the filers that instead so hydras would
not<00:00:30.480> be<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:31.080> useful<00:00:31.230> um<00:00:32.660> it<00:00:33.660> looks<00:00:33.960> like<00:00:34.320> yeah

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
not be that useful um it looks like yeah

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.170 
not be that useful um it looks like yeah

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
lurkers but now the lurkers are fully

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.550 
lurkers but now the lurkers are fully
formed<00:01:14.430> from<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.610> ramp<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.030> now<00:01:15.470> reaches<00:01:16.470> can

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
formed from the ramp and now reaches can

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.230 
formed from the ramp and now reaches can
use<00:01:16.920> those<00:01:17.040> lurkers<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.549> ramp<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.880> polish

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240

lead in this game now and it's a really
curtains<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.939> opponent<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.479> feel<00:01:30.659> since

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
curtains for the opponent I feel since

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.179 
curtains for the opponent I feel since
the<00:01:31.140> opponent<00:01:31.439> really<00:01:31.710> fell<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:31.950> this

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
the opponent really fell in this

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.910 
the opponent really fell in this
breakout<00:01:32.689> attack<00:01:33.689> here<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.590> opponent

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
breakout attack here and the opponent

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.859 
breakout attack here and the opponent
really<00:01:35.130> uh<00:01:35.159> he<00:01:35.820> came<00:01:35.970> close<00:01:36.240> actually<00:01:36.659> he<00:01:36.780> had

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
really uh he came close actually he had

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.450 
really uh he came close actually he had
he<00:01:37.049> had<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> right<00:01:37.350> idea<00:01:37.409> certainly<00:01:38.009> just

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
he had the right idea certainly just

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.090 
he had the right idea certainly just
reach<00:01:39.450> had<00:01:39.659> really<00:01:39.960> fast<00:01:40.170> reaction<00:01:40.680> there<00:01:40.829> had

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
reach had really fast reaction there had

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.980 
reach had really fast reaction there had
a<00:01:41.130> really<00:01:41.310> fast<00:01:41.549> reaction<00:01:42.000> by<00:01:42.150> morphing<00:01:42.869> those

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
a really fast reaction by morphing those

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.660 
a really fast reaction by morphing those
hydros<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.920> lurkers<00:01:44.280> he<00:01:44.340> got<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> little

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
hydros in the lurkers he got a little

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.190 
hydros in the lurkers he got a little
lucky<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.090> be<00:01:45.210> honest<00:01:45.540> because<00:01:45.689> he<00:01:45.869> happened

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
lucky to be honest because he happened

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.109 
lucky to be honest because he happened
to<00:01:46.259> have<00:01:46.320> three<00:01:47.009> high<00:01:47.130> risks<00:01:47.579> there<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.909> they

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
to have three high risks there and they

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.760 
to have three high risks there and they
got<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> ramp<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:48.930> time<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.470> they<00:01:49.530> morph

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
got to the ramp on time and they morph

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.980 
got to the ramp on time and they morph
to<00:01:49.950> write<00:01:50.159> at<00:01:50.369> exactly<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.299> perfect<00:01:51.570> time

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
to write at exactly the perfect time

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.690 
to write at exactly the perfect time
because<00:01:52.020> otherwise<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:53.189> turn<00:01:53.369> would<00:01:53.579> have

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
because otherwise the turn would have

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.830 
because otherwise the turn would have
gotten<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.060> there<00:01:54.210> was<00:01:54.329> absolutely<00:01:54.689> no

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
gotten in there was absolutely no

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.569 
gotten in there was absolutely no
defense<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> space<00:01:55.680> now<00:01:56.100> he's<00:01:56.280> putting<00:01:56.399> up

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
defense in the space now he's putting up

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.219 
defense in the space now he's putting up
some<00:01:56.729> creep<00:01:56.909> colonies<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.390> defend<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.960> but<00:01:58.079> I

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
some creep colonies to defend it but I

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.359 
some creep colonies to defend it but I
think<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.649> term<00:01:58.829> player<00:01:59.040> would<00:01:59.189> have<00:01:59.219> been

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
think the term player would have been

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.310 
think the term player would have been
will<00:01:59.520> take<00:01:59.670> out<00:01:59.820> these<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.299> hatchery<00:02:00.689> at<00:02:00.899> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
will take out these that hatchery at the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.080 
will take out these that hatchery at the
nine<00:02:01.860> o'clock<00:02:01.979> base<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.610> all<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.909> drones

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
nine o'clock base and all the drones

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.030 
nine o'clock base and all the drones
there<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.869> was<00:02:04.020> set<00:02:04.200> reach<00:02:04.380> back<00:02:04.560> really

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
there and that was set reach back really

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.249 
there and that was set reach back really
badly<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.549> reach<00:02:06.360> getting<00:02:06.600> lucky<00:02:06.869> there<00:02:07.049> but

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
badly so reach getting lucky there but

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.990 
badly so reach getting lucky there but
uh<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.890> know<00:02:08.009> sometimes<00:02:08.369> pro<00:02:08.550> gamers<00:02:08.819> get

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
uh you know sometimes pro gamers get

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.999 
uh you know sometimes pro gamers get
lucky<00:02:09.239> too<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.629> it's<00:02:09.780> uh<00:02:09.869> then<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> double

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
lucky too and it's uh then it's a double

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.380 
lucky too and it's uh then it's a double
whammy<00:02:11.039> for<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.550> amateurs<00:02:11.910> trying<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.209> face

whammy for the amateurs trying to face

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.130 
whammy for the amateurs trying to face

Nikki's now a big force of lurkers and

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.150 
Nikki's now a big force of lurkers and
Ling's<00:02:16.020> there<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.350> couple<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:16.740> squares<00:02:17.040> to

Ling's there and couple of squares to

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.410 
Ling's there and couple of squares to
deal<00:02:17.310> with<00:02:17.459> science<00:02:17.790> vessels<00:02:18.060> but<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.270> haven't

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
deal with science vessels but I haven't

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.550 
deal with science vessels but I haven't
seen<00:02:18.690> any<00:02:18.780> science<00:02:19.050> vessels<00:02:19.350> from<00:02:19.440> the

seen any science vessels from the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.590 
seen any science vessels from the
opponent<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.610> opponent's<00:02:21.060> just<00:02:21.180> seems<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.510> be

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
opponent the opponent's just seems to be

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.910 
opponent the opponent's just seems to be
a<00:02:21.630> little<00:02:21.930> slow<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.290> getting<00:02:22.530> up<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.740> tech

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
a little slow and getting up the tech

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.980 
a little slow and getting up the tech
tree<00:02:23.069> here<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.459> he's<00:02:24.000> bring<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.450> tank<00:02:24.630> out<00:02:24.840> but

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
tree here and he's bring a tank out but

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.770 
tree here and he's bring a tank out but
it's<00:02:25.110> unprotected<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:25.830> seems<00:02:26.480> reach<00:02:27.480> could<00:02:27.690> go

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
it's unprotected it seems reach could go

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.760 
it's unprotected it seems reach could go
in<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:27.959> try<00:02:28.080> pick<00:02:28.260> up<00:02:28.410> but<00:02:28.530> looks<00:02:28.709> like

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
in and try pick up but looks like

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.290 
in and try pick up but looks like
reinforcements<00:02:29.610> are<00:02:29.700> going<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:29.910> follow<00:02:30.090> up

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
reinforcements are going to follow up

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.530 
reinforcements are going to follow up
there<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.740> we<00:02:31.740> saw<00:02:31.920> Defiler<00:02:32.310> for<00:02:32.520> reach<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:32.910> I

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
there and we saw Defiler for reach so I

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.660 
there and we saw Defiler for reach so I
guess<00:02:33.990> he's<00:02:34.020> gonna<00:02:34.620> start<00:02:35.160> casting<00:02:35.310> dark

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
guess he's gonna start casting dark

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.830 
guess he's gonna start casting dark
storm<00:02:35.880> soon<00:02:36.060> I'll<00:02:36.209> be<00:02:36.240> interesting<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.750> see

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
storm soon I'll be interesting to see

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.720 
storm soon I'll be interesting to see
how<00:02:36.870> good<00:02:37.170> as<00:02:37.320> storms<00:02:37.620> are<00:02:37.770> that's<00:02:38.250> one<00:02:38.430> unit

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
how good as storms are that's one unit

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.460 
how good as storms are that's one unit
and<00:02:38.850> finally<00:02:39.150> science<00:02:39.420> well<00:02:39.720> it's<00:02:39.810> cannery<00:02:40.260> d8

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
and finally science well it's cannery d8

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.040 
and finally science well it's cannery d8
it<00:02:40.560> looks<00:02:40.709> like<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.830> lurker<00:02:41.100> there<00:02:41.340> oh<00:02:41.630> oh<00:02:42.630> oh

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
it looks like a lurker there oh oh oh

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.690 
it looks like a lurker there oh oh oh

opponents<00:04:21.060> Mike<00:04:21.150> role<00:04:21.390> isn't<00:04:21.630> very<00:04:21.930> good<00:04:22.109> it's

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
opponents Mike role isn't very good it's

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.850 
opponents Mike role isn't very good it's
reaches<00:04:24.060> just<00:04:24.539> a<00:04:24.690> lot<00:04:24.870> better<00:04:25.020> even

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
reaches just a lot better even

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.189 
reaches just a lot better even
off<00:04:25.919> race<00:04:26.129> in<00:04:26.280> this<00:04:26.400> opponent<00:04:26.639> is<00:04:27.199> presumably

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
off race in this opponent is presumably

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.129 
off race in this opponent is presumably
on<00:04:28.409> his<00:04:28.800> his<00:04:29.250> best<00:04:29.430> game<00:04:29.789> so<00:04:30.139> unfortunately

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
on his his best game so unfortunately

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.209 
on his his best game so unfortunately
for<00:04:31.259> his<00:04:31.349> opponent<00:04:31.620> I<00:04:31.650> feel<00:04:31.800> like<00:04:31.919> that<00:04:32.039> is

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:32.219 
for his opponent I feel like that is

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:34.520 
for his opponent I feel like that is
really<00:04:32.669> curtains<00:04:33.090> he<00:04:33.930> really<00:04:34.169> doesn't<00:04:34.409> have<00:04:34.439> a

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
really curtains he really doesn't have a

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.980 
really curtains he really doesn't have a
chance<00:04:34.710> back<00:04:34.949> now<00:04:35.219> it<00:04:35.819> was<00:04:36.090> actually<00:04:36.569> don't<00:04:36.900> he

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
chance back now it was actually don't he

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.029 
chance back now it was actually don't he
didn't<00:04:37.139> take<00:04:37.199> down<00:04:37.379> in<00:04:37.469> the<00:04:37.530> hatchery<00:04:37.889> there

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
didn't take down in the hatchery there

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.550 
didn't take down in the hatchery there
so<00:04:38.159> I'll<00:04:38.280> take<00:04:38.520> it<00:04:38.669> back<00:04:38.789> but<00:04:39.139> i'm<00:04:40.139> not<00:04:40.319> sure<00:04:40.469> if

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
so I'll take it back but i'm not sure if

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.129 
so I'll take it back but i'm not sure if
we<00:04:40.650> pullin<00:04:40.919> expanded<00:04:41.490> at<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.789> corner<00:04:42.210> or<00:04:42.990> if

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
we pullin expanded at the corner or if

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:44.689 
we pullin expanded at the corner or if
he's<00:04:43.259> got<00:04:43.409> a<00:04:43.469> hidden<00:04:43.770> expansion<00:04:44.250> if<00:04:44.400> he<00:04:44.490> has<00:04:44.580> an

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
he's got a hidden expansion if he has an

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.040 
he's got a hidden expansion if he has an
expansion<00:04:45.000> at<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.180> one<00:04:45.330> o'clock<00:04:45.569> corner<00:04:45.870> or

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
expansion at the one o'clock corner or

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.629 
expansion at the one o'clock corner or
hit<00:04:46.650> expansion<00:04:46.889> somewhere<00:04:47.310> on<00:04:47.370> this<00:04:47.430> map

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
hit expansion somewhere on this map

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.219 
hit expansion somewhere on this map
that's<00:04:47.819> really<00:04:48.180> what<00:04:48.300> he<00:04:48.419> needs<00:04:48.629> to<00:04:48.900> have<00:04:48.990> any

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
that's really what he needs to have any

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.290 
that's really what he needs to have any
kind<00:04:49.469> of<00:04:49.530> chance<00:04:49.830> here<00:04:50.099> because<00:04:50.669> ultras<00:04:51.090> have

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
kind of chance here because ultras have

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.629 
kind of chance here because ultras have
come<00:04:51.479> out<00:04:51.599> now<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.810> Zerg<00:04:52.800> player<00:04:52.979> has<00:04:53.189> rounded

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
come out now the Zerg player has rounded

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.059 
come out now the Zerg player has rounded
out<00:04:53.729> his<00:04:53.909> tech<00:04:54.090> tree<00:04:54.330> and<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:55.740> Terran<00:04:56.009> player

isn't gonna be able to handle it with

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.019 
isn't gonna be able to handle it with
just<00:04:57.659> two<00:04:58.560> bases<00:04:58.979> full<00:04:59.159> of<00:04:59.310> medical<00:04:59.610> making

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:00.029 
just two bases full of medical making

medical marines especially if the mind

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.769 
medical marines especially if the mind
that<00:05:01.800> means<00:05:02.009> probably<00:05:02.370> mined<00:05:02.550> out<00:05:02.729> in<00:05:03.270> case<00:05:03.539> um

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:03.779 
that means probably mined out in case um

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:05.480 
that means probably mined out in case um
that<00:05:03.990> attack<00:05:04.229> wasn't<00:05:04.469> very<00:05:04.710> bad<00:05:04.949> it<00:05:05.189> was<00:05:05.279> just

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
that attack wasn't very bad it was just

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.580 
that attack wasn't very bad it was just
um<00:05:05.669> once<00:05:06.060> again<00:05:06.150> he<00:05:06.719> didn't<00:05:06.990> protect<00:05:07.199> his<00:05:07.379> tank

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
um once again he didn't protect his tank

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:08.450 
um once again he didn't protect his tank
small<00:05:07.770> enough<00:05:07.889> and<00:05:07.979> looks<00:05:08.159> like<00:05:08.250> he's<00:05:08.370> going

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
small enough and looks like he's going

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.059

zerg<00:06:20.039> I<00:06:20.520> mean<00:06:21.330> at<00:06:21.449> least<00:06:21.479> as<00:06:21.750> a<00:06:21.779> build<00:06:22.169> order

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:22.379 
zerg I mean at least as a build order

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:23.600 
zerg I mean at least as a build order
was<00:06:22.529> quite<00:06:22.710> well<00:06:22.860> I<00:06:22.889> think<00:06:23.009> his<00:06:23.189> control<00:06:23.520> could

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
was quite well I think his control could

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.339 
was quite well I think his control could
have<00:06:23.729> been<00:06:23.819> better<00:06:24.000> but<00:06:24.270> uh<00:06:24.330> you<00:06:24.930> know<00:06:24.960> I<00:06:25.080> mean

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:25.349 
have been better but uh you know I mean

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:26.929 
have been better but uh you know I mean
this<00:06:25.439> is<00:06:25.500> off<00:06:25.740> raise<00:06:25.979> for<00:06:26.189> him<00:06:26.310> and<00:06:26.550> in<00:06:26.819> a

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:26.939 
this is off raise for him and in a

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:28.700 
this is off raise for him and in a
combination<00:06:27.569> that<00:06:27.599> I<00:06:27.750> think<00:06:27.990> you<00:06:28.110> hardly<00:06:28.589> ever

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710
