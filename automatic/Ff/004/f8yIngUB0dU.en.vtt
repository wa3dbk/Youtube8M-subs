00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
always does this but the funny thing is

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.080 
always does this but the funny thing is
when<00:01:40.119> it<00:01:40.210> dries<00:01:40.479> it<00:01:40.810> goes<00:01:40.990> right<00:01:41.200> back<00:01:41.409> to<00:01:42.090> like

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
when it dries it goes right back to like

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:51.029 
when it dries it goes right back to like
nothing<00:01:44.280> back<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.460> way<00:01:45.610> it<00:01:45.640> was<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:50.860> is

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039
