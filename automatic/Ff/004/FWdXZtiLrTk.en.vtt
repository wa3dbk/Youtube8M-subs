 who has taken my cheese who has 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.630

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.369
 if you find changes in your life

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.739
 constant movement to ensure 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.009
 our survival this is what you 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:35.190
 happened to the little people to know keys and 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.300
 cost are small creatures that act and 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.130
 they think like today's people guys 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.700
 coexisted with the two oli mice and 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:47.400
 scurrying runs in their struggle for 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.260
 survival inside the 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.960
 labyrinth the story started when 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.020
 keys and kof found a lot 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.970
 that is a central station if they 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.100
 They were filled with joy and decided 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.220
 build your world around which 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.090
 will be what they did not know is because of everything 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.729
 this their lives would not be the same them 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.730
 They are returning every day like 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.450
 the mice to eat and they thought that 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:18.150
 life and they're going to have that but not 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.150
 it was like this the book who has taken my 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.460
 spencer johnson cheese account that at 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.380
 principle of the two men quoted and the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.940
 mice went every day to eat their 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.610
 favorite cheeses 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.230
 typical people became comfortable and they 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.800
 They took the shoes and kept 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:37.190
 instead oli and I ran they took them away and 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.830
 they swore on their necks or just in case 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.530
 they would need the fight again 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.780
 started when chemists could not 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.240
 find the cheese one day they came back 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.840
 to the central station they could not believe 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.630
 what they saw that is shouted who took 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.660
 my cheese and refused to look for a new 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.750
 He hoped to find the cheese in 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:04.530
 the central station will again some 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.720
 day after that he was paralyzed 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.140
 waiting for someone to return his 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.420
 cheese at the beginning that cost him to leave 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.230
 the impression of not having cheese and started 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.780
 to fight against your mind 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.239
 and his companion told him to 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.180
 someone had to return their cheese 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.670
 until one day 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.060
 He made the decision to leave again 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.840
 maze and get the station that 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.900
 it will be bigger than in your life there was 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.599
 seen by incredible it seems there already 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.079
 there were olli mice and 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:44.079
 I ran that since they realized that 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:47.079
 the cheese had finished they started 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.940
 look for a new cheese cheese in this 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:52.120
 History is a metaphor for our day 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.420
 a day of life represents success 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.849
 race and other worldly riches that 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.690
 we possess or want when we find 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:04.750
 our weight and everything revolves around 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.450
 what we possess therefore we 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.599
 we submerge in our comfort zone 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.690
 we become obsessed with that and we want 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:16.329
 keep being like this forever when the 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.419
 things are going well who is going to want to change 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.350
 what happens if by chance the 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.510
 change as 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.930
 we can deal with it you're going to 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.150
 wait and trust that one day I could 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.170
 find your cheese again in the 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.770
 c station 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.870
 the fable teaches us to be alert and 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.210
 accept the change the change is 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.880
 inevitable we are constantly 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.400
 movement we are dynamic because 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.610
 we are alive we are still in front and 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.040
 fighting until we achieve all that 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.800
 we want in life so do not give 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.650
