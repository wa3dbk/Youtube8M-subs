00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.010
 tha 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.120
 hello i am laurence of marriage 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.980
 painter and engraver I will you 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.230
 show today how to draw a 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.000
 house so we'll start from the premise 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.890
 that a house is a cube 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.390
 how to draw a cube in perspective 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.740
 well I'm just going 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.450
 install verticals that will be 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.430
 always vertical she never moves 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.320
 the verticals on the other hand on the 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.640
 forgetfulness that will go along so I'm going 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.449
 install two vanishing points that are going 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.289
 meet on the same line called 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:48.510
 the skyline 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:49.589
 and here is a vanishing point and a 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.870
 second vanishing point 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.010
 it is obvious that the points of 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.309
 leakage can lie outside the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.729
 page 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:02.539
 so here's a crate in perspective 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:05.309
 to install the roof I will follow the 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.170
 master a brief point for the for the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.930
 do the roof then I'm going to install 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.820
 the slopes that will change according to the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.820
 region in which the house is located 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.110
 this slope here will also join the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.149
 same vanishing point 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.579
 I will install as I proposed 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:30.950
 in another video on the street of 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:33.479
 beams that leave the vanishing point 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.649
 and that will allow me to install 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.240
 very easily windows doors elements 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.850
 architected to 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.460
 so I'm just these 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.460
 beams that will follow the slope 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.700
 natural windows of the house 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.869
 so you have to understand that 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.119
 according to the regions the houses did not 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.649
 not the same proportions especially 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.689
 for windows you adapt to each 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.070
 region 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.979
 then we install chimneys that 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.569
 will also follow the same slope that will 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.030
 they follow exactly the same principle 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.319
 only for the house with a point of 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.840
 leak in one direction and a vanishing point 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.840
 in the other direction the attics 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.870
 and here you have your house ready to 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.280
 to be invited then the trick is the 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.010
 next to give more character to 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.160
 your house decide you a place 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.260
 bright often at 45 degrees the sun has 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:39.330
 mid-morning and you can 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:41.400
 thus sinking so as to accentuate the 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.170
 relief of your house you know 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.640
 how to draw a house but 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.510
 do not forget to respect the character 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.510
 from each region
