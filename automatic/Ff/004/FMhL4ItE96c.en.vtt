00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.190
 it takes pulque truth totally here is the test where da ponte there is no 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.570
 point to the network let's see why the master baker or Jesus is 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.840
 truth is called 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.080
 that is already ready with the flour and tell me what is the happened that there is 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.660
 make good the first step with pleasure we are seeing is the flour 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.420
 and it is perfectly aware that if there is no flour powder and pandora 2 is the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.950
 number one 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.290
 the second step is to put us the sugar 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.800
 I understand that it is the part of the center to the area 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.610

 since it is done 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:17.589
 percent the mixture of sugar with flour efe I imagine that it is necessary to 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:21.669
