00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
over it and then manipulating the the

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.480 
over it and then manipulating the the
loops<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.530> delays<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.040> stuff<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:22.400> I

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
loops and the delays and stuff and I

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.920 
loops and the delays and stuff and I
always<00:02:22.730> was<00:02:22.940> like<00:02:22.970> very<00:02:23.300> interested<00:02:23.780> in<00:02:23.840> that

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
always was like very interested in that

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.949 
always was like very interested in that
so<00:02:24.170> over<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.190> years<00:02:25.459> I've<00:02:25.670> expanded<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.569> guess

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
so over the years I've expanded I guess

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.440 
so over the years I've expanded I guess
my<00:02:27.260> setup<00:02:27.950> it<00:02:28.430> was<00:02:28.580> pretty<00:02:28.760> uh<00:02:28.880> pretty

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
my setup it was pretty uh pretty

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.140 
my setup it was pretty uh pretty
exciting<00:02:30.080> obviously<00:02:30.530> winning<00:02:31.340> something<00:02:31.790> and

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
exciting obviously winning something and

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.640 
exciting obviously winning something and
getting<00:02:32.330> some<00:02:32.570> sort<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.900> recognition<00:02:33.350> we've

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
getting some sort of recognition we've

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.070 
getting some sort of recognition we've
been<00:02:33.770> doing<00:02:34.010> this<00:02:34.100> for<00:02:34.280> so<00:02:34.459> long<00:02:34.670> but<00:02:35.000> um<00:02:35.209> yeah

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
been doing this for so long but um yeah

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.930 
been doing this for so long but um yeah
once<00:02:36.320> we<00:02:36.440> dug<00:02:36.620> into<00:02:36.800> it<00:02:36.890> more<00:02:37.130> realize<00:02:37.700> exactly

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
once we dug into it more realize exactly

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.610 
once we dug into it more realize exactly
would<00:02:38.300> it<00:02:38.450> entail<00:02:38.750> they<00:02:38.989> we<00:02:39.440> were<00:02:39.530> pretty

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
would it entail they we were pretty

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.220 
would it entail they we were pretty
psyched<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.280> then<00:02:40.670> this<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.630> facilities

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
psyched and then this the facilities

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.770 
psyched and then this the facilities
here<00:02:42.260> really<00:02:42.769> helped<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.280> just<00:02:43.540> make<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.570> nice

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
here really helped to just make it nice

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
this is the biggest live room I think

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.000

out<00:05:48.479> of<00:05:48.539> all<00:05:48.720> the<00:05:48.840> studios<00:05:49.199> I've<00:05:49.350> been<00:05:49.530> in<00:05:49.680> all

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
out of all the studios I've been in all

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.140 
out of all the studios I've been in all
three<00:05:51.289> biggest<00:05:52.289> live<00:05:52.590> room<00:05:52.830> I've<00:05:53.250> seen<00:05:53.610> and<00:05:53.850> I

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
three biggest live room I've seen and I

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.580 
three biggest live room I've seen and I
think<00:05:54.449> that<00:05:54.690> worked<00:05:54.870> perfectly<00:05:54.960> for<00:05:55.350> the

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
think that worked perfectly for the

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:56.960 
think that worked perfectly for the
drums<00:05:55.860> you<00:05:56.130> know<00:05:56.160> even<00:05:56.400> though<00:05:56.580> everything's

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
drums you know even though everything's

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.490 
drums you know even though everything's
about<00:05:57.180> being<00:05:57.449> dark<00:05:57.690> and<00:05:57.840> evil<00:05:57.930> I<00:05:58.169> think<00:05:58.350> that<00:05:58.470> a

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
about being dark and evil I think that a

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.920 
about being dark and evil I think that a
bright<00:05:58.740> punchy<00:05:58.979> sound<00:05:59.250> is<00:05:59.550> pretty<00:06:00.539> worth<00:06:00.690> much

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
bright punchy sound is pretty worth much

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.440 
bright punchy sound is pretty worth much
what<00:06:01.110> we're<00:06:01.229> going
