if<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.540> actually<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:40.290> see<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.710> cover

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
if you actually just see the cover

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.920 
if you actually just see the cover
you're<00:01:41.579> saying<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> very<00:01:42.000> act<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.540> putting

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
you're saying the very act of putting

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.800 
you're saying the very act of putting

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
the mature label on the video game

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.120 
the mature label on the video game
actually<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:45.960> hurt<00:01:46.140> kids<00:01:46.380> too<00:01:46.619> well<00:01:46.950> I've

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
actually can hurt kids too well I've

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.469 
actually can hurt kids too well I've
said<00:01:47.340> it'd<00:01:47.520> probably<00:01:47.700> be<00:01:47.909> better<00:01:48.180> if<00:01:48.360> we

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
said it'd probably be better if we

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.030 
said it'd probably be better if we
didn't<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.810> labels<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.350> games<00:01:49.680> altogether

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
didn't have labels on games altogether

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.120 
didn't have labels on games altogether
so<00:01:50.759> I'd<00:01:50.909> rather<00:01:51.119> kids<00:01:51.509> by<00:01:51.810> incredibly<00:01:52.680> violent

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
so I'd rather kids by incredibly violent

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.609 
so I'd rather kids by incredibly violent
pornographic<00:01:53.970> games<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.450> be<00:01:54.570> surprised<00:01:55.020> than

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
pornographic games and be surprised than

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.740 
pornographic games and be surprised than
to<00:01:55.740> consciously<00:01:56.189> go<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.880> do<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.119> because<00:01:57.329> then

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
to consciously go and do it because then

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.420 
to consciously go and do it because then
