too<00:00:17.010> much<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.760> tautology<00:00:18.330> but<00:00:18.779> it's<00:00:18.929> a<00:00:19.050> this

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
too much of a tautology but it's a this

photographer and she started off by
making<00:00:25.439> what<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.800> think<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.220> many<00:00:26.400> documentary

that<00:00:29.159> she<00:00:29.310> made<00:00:29.490> then<00:00:30.359> she<00:00:30.599> goes<00:00:30.749> into<00:00:31.079> this

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
that she made then she goes into this

kind<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.859> romantic<00:00:32.550> phase<00:00:32.940> where<00:00:33.239> she<00:00:33.390> would

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
kind of romantic phase where she would

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.570 
kind of romantic phase where she would
give<00:00:33.630> big<00:00:33.870> landscapes<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.710> clouds<00:00:35.340> and

romantic photographer absolutely hated
it<00:00:39.200> just<00:00:40.200> something<00:00:40.530> why<00:00:40.650> she<00:00:40.830> wanted<00:00:41.160> to

we<00:00:47.340> think<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.850> photographing<00:00:48.570> landscape<00:00:48.990> was

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
we think of photographing landscape was

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.390 
we think of photographing landscape was
almost<00:00:49.590> something<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.100> do<00:00:50.220> naturally

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
almost something that we do naturally

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.760 
almost something that we do naturally
anyone<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.330> it<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.600> point<00:00:52.260> guard<00:00:52.620> with

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
anyone can do it you point guard with

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.080 
anyone can do it you point guard with
your<00:00:52.860> camera<00:00:53.160> your<00:00:53.340> point<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.880> take<00:00:54.060> a

your camera your point it you take a
picture<00:00:54.330> and<00:00:54.540> you<00:00:54.630> made<00:00:54.810> a<00:00:54.840> landscape

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
picture and you made a landscape

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.200 
picture and you made a landscape
photograph<00:00:55.650> one<00:00:56.460> things<00:00:56.670> you've<00:00:56.820> got<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.060> look

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
photograph one things you've got to look

at<00:00:57.390> with<00:00:57.540> Phi<00:00:57.720> is<00:00:58.110> well<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.040> two<00:00:59.220> things

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
at with Phi is well the two things

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.780 
at with Phi is well the two things
really<00:00:59.610> well<00:00:59.850> first<00:01:00.060> of<00:01:00.150> all<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:01.200> her<00:01:01.530> use<00:01:01.740> of

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
really well first of all is her use of

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.880 
really well first of all is her use of
cameras<00:01:02.960> we<00:01:03.960> take<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.320> for<00:01:04.470> granted<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
cameras we take that for granted in the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.760 
cameras we take that for granted in the
particular<00:01:05.189> square<00:01:05.549> format<00:01:06.350> very<00:01:07.350> very<00:01:07.590> few

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
particular square format very very few

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.800 
particular square format very very few
photographers<00:01:07.979> can<00:01:08.609> actually<00:01:09.179> can't<00:01:09.450> handle

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
photographers can actually can't handle

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.690 
photographers can actually can't handle
the<00:01:09.869> square<00:01:10.109> format<00:01:10.469> because<00:01:11.280> what<00:01:11.429> they<00:01:11.549> tend

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the square format because what they tend

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.099 
the square format because what they tend
to<00:01:11.789> do<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.179> square<00:01:12.420> format<00:01:12.780> they<00:01:12.929> take

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:13.109 
to do in that square format they take

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:15.319 
to do in that square format they take
the<00:01:13.229> diagonals<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.859> they<00:01:13.979> put<00:01:14.219> the<00:01:14.789> subject

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
the diagonals and they put the subject

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:18.230 
the diagonals and they put the subject
bang<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.749> middle<00:01:16.020> okay<00:01:16.649> and<00:01:17.240> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
bang in the middle okay and the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.359 
bang in the middle okay and the
composition<00:01:18.509> just<00:01:18.749> hangs<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.530> fade<00:01:20.189> as

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
composition just hangs on that fade as

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.209 
composition just hangs on that fade as
it's<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:20.759> much<00:01:20.939> more<00:01:21.090> subtly<00:01:21.950> the<00:01:22.950> most

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.219 
it's so much more subtly the most

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:25.039 
it's so much more subtly the most
important<00:01:23.729> aspect<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.210> her<00:01:24.390> relationship<00:01:24.810> to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
important aspect is her relationship to

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.649 
important aspect is her relationship to
light<00:01:25.460> we<00:01:26.460> take<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.850> for<00:01:27.030> granted<00:01:27.060> we<00:01:27.479> just

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
light we take that for granted we just

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.669 
light we take that for granted we just
think<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.929> light<00:01:28.079> as<00:01:28.289> something<00:01:28.560> which

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
think of light as something which

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:30.289 
think of light as something which
illuminates<00:01:29.219> it<00:01:29.429> sufficiently<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.060> make<00:01:30.179> an

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
illuminates it sufficiently to make an

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.249 
illuminates it sufficiently to make an
exposure<00:01:30.600> for<00:01:31.499> Fae<00:01:31.829> it's<00:01:32.219> actually<00:01:32.700> about<00:01:33.259> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
exposure for Fae it's actually about the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.870 
exposure for Fae it's actually about the
way<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.499> which<00:01:34.560> light<00:01:34.799> expresses<00:01:35.340> itself<00:01:35.579> on

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
way in which light expresses itself on

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.620 
way in which light expresses itself on
that<00:01:36.149> landscape

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
that landscape

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.870 
that landscape
I'm<00:01:36.810> appropriately<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.950> landscape<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.729> not

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
I'm appropriately the landscape it's not

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.520 
I'm appropriately the landscape it's not
just<00:01:39.090> about<00:01:39.179> you<00:01:39.869> know<00:01:39.899> giving<00:01:40.319> a<00:01:40.380> nice

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
just about you know giving a nice

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.050 
just about you know giving a nice
casting<00:01:40.979> their<00:01:41.159> shadows<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.639> think<00:01:41.819> it's<00:01:41.969> got

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
casting their shadows I think it's got

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.730 
casting their shadows I think it's got
to<00:01:42.149> be<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.329> right<00:01:42.569> kind<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.899> light<00:01:43.109> in<00:01:43.319> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
to be the right kind of light in the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.260 
to be the right kind of light in the
right<00:01:43.920> way<00:01:44.069> coming<00:01:44.369> for<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.520> right<00:01:44.759> angle<00:01:45.179> and

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
right way coming for the right angle and

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.699 
right way coming for the right angle and
the<00:01:45.359> right<00:01:45.420> position<00:01:45.869> then<00:01:46.139> choosing<00:01:46.590> your

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:46.709 
the right position then choosing your

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:48.319 
the right position then choosing your
viewpoint<00:01:47.100> then<00:01:47.490> setting<00:01:47.819> it<00:01:47.880> up<00:01:47.999> and<00:01:48.149> framing

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
viewpoint then setting it up and framing

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.330 
viewpoint then setting it up and framing
it's<00:01:48.569> a<00:01:48.600> whole<00:01:48.840> set<00:01:49.319> of<00:01:49.499> things<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.889> now<00:01:50.310> you

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
it's a whole set of things and now you

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.219 
it's a whole set of things and now you
don't<00:01:50.639> do<00:01:50.819> that<00:01:50.969> just<00:01:51.209> going<00:01:51.539> out<00:01:51.719> to<00:01:51.959> a<00:01:51.990> place
