00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.420 
and a lot of this bothers a lot of
people<00:01:10.290> because<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.890> nice<00:01:11.040> motorcycle

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
people because it's a nice motorcycle

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.660 
people because it's a nice motorcycle
and<00:01:12.030> I'm<00:01:12.150> being<00:01:12.420> mean<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.350> if<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.490> had

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
and I'm being mean to it and if I had

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.190 
and I'm being mean to it and if I had
that<00:01:14.790> motorcycle<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.540> would<00:01:15.659> never<00:01:15.810> treat<00:01:16.049> it

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
that motorcycle I would never treat it

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.219 
that motorcycle I would never treat it
the<00:01:16.290> way<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.439> treat<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.659> say<00:01:18.659> well<00:01:18.869> but<00:01:19.170> I

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
the way you treat it and say well but I

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.320 
the way you treat it and say well but I
guess<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.619> should<00:01:19.799> buy<00:01:20.100> your<00:01:20.490> own<00:01:20.640> motorcycle

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
guess you should buy your own motorcycle

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.080 
guess you should buy your own motorcycle
or<00:01:21.390> treat<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.720> how<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.869> want<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.229> treat<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:23.090> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
or treat it how you want to treat it the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.190 
or treat it how you want to treat it the
crash<00:01:24.360> bars<00:01:25.070> that<00:01:26.070> are<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.490> bike<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.200> for

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
crash bars that are on that bike and for

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.440 
crash bars that are on that bike and for
how<00:01:28.320> slow<00:01:28.680> I'm<00:01:28.860> going<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.369> falling<00:01:29.759> down<00:01:29.909> that

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
how slow I'm going and falling down that

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.340 
how slow I'm going and falling down that
nothing<00:01:31.259> Bad's<00:01:31.500> gonna<00:01:31.799> happen<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:33.020> that<00:01:34.020> to

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
nothing Bad's gonna happen to that to

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.800 
nothing Bad's gonna happen to that to
that<00:01:34.500> bike<00:01:34.770> going<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.790> slow<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.299> mean<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.540> guess

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
that bike going that slow I mean I guess

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.840 
that bike going that slow I mean I guess
it's<00:01:36.960> never<00:01:37.170> good<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.799> drop<00:01:38.040> your<00:01:38.220> motorcycle

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
it's never good to drop your motorcycle

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.260 
it's never good to drop your motorcycle
but<00:01:40.640> sometimes<00:01:41.640> I'd<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.090> do<00:01:42.210> dumb<00:01:42.420> stuff

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
but sometimes I'd like to do dumb stuff

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.600 
but sometimes I'd like to do dumb stuff
sometimes<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.360> nail<00:01:45.570> it
