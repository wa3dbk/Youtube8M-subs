a couple of different parts where we get

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.420 
a couple of different parts where we get
Richthofen<00:02:50.959> as<00:02:51.109> the<00:02:51.349> zombie<00:02:51.739> she<00:02:52.190> can<00:02:52.310> hear

Richthofen as the zombie she can hear

Richthofen as the zombie she can hear
the<00:02:52.519> sort<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:52.760> quotes<00:02:53.090> that<00:02:53.299> he<00:02:53.420> says<00:02:53.660> oh<00:02:53.930> you

the sort of quotes that he says oh you
gotta<00:02:54.739> be<00:02:54.950> fuckin

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.990 

that's<00:04:36.860> just<00:04:37.070> a<00:04:37.190> few<00:04:37.370> selections<00:04:37.880> of

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
that's just a few selections of

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.370 
that's just a few selections of
different<00:04:38.330> quotes<00:04:38.570> now<00:04:38.780> as<00:04:38.840> you<00:04:38.960> can<00:04:39.050> see<00:04:39.230> the

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
different quotes now as you can see the

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.010 
different quotes now as you can see the
screen<00:04:39.680> shaking<00:04:40.280> a<00:04:40.400> lot<00:04:40.610> and<00:04:40.910> I<00:04:41.150> think<00:04:41.540> that<00:04:41.780> is

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
screen shaking a lot and I think that is

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.380 
screen shaking a lot and I think that is
because<00:04:42.740> of<00:04:42.950> Maxis<00:04:43.340> and<00:04:43.370> Richtofen<00:04:43.790> fighting

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
because of Maxis and Richtofen fighting

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.020 
because of Maxis and Richtofen fighting
each<00:04:44.480> other<00:04:44.720> literally<00:04:45.320> to<00:04:46.130> gain<00:04:46.340> control<00:04:46.580> as

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
each other literally to gain control as

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.270 
each other literally to gain control as
you<00:04:47.150> can<00:04:47.270> see<00:04:47.480> Richthofen<00:04:48.230> is<00:04:48.590> constantly

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
you can see Richthofen is constantly

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.830 
you can see Richthofen is constantly
pushing<00:04:49.700> through<00:04:49.970> to<00:04:50.150> actually<00:04:50.570> kind<00:04:50.780> of

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
pushing through to actually kind of

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.590 
pushing through to actually kind of
communicate<00:04:51.380> with<00:04:51.560> us<00:04:51.710> and<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.940> only<00:04:53.150> benefit

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
communicate with us and the only benefit

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.420 
communicate with us and the only benefit
I<00:04:53.630> can<00:04:53.870> see<00:04:54.080> from<00:04:54.260> actually<00:04:54.740> doing<00:04:55.160> this

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
I can see from actually doing this

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.090 
I can see from actually doing this
continuation<00:04:56.240> III<00:04:56.900> is<00:04:57.140> that<00:04:57.530> ripped<00:04:57.770> off<00:04:57.920> and

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
continuation III is that ripped off and

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.740 
continuation III is that ripped off and
returns<00:04:58.370> as<00:04:58.550> a<00:04:58.610> blue<00:04:58.940> zombie<00:04:59.270> that<00:04:59.390> gives<00:04:59.630> you

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
returns as a blue zombie that gives you

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.930 
returns as a blue zombie that gives you
drop's<00:05:00.050> every<00:05:00.830> time<00:05:01.070> so<00:05:01.310> I<00:05:01.340> guess<00:05:01.580> it's<00:05:01.790> nice

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
drop's every time so I guess it's nice

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.300 
drop's every time so I guess it's nice
to<00:05:02.210> know<00:05:02.300> that<00:05:02.330> there<00:05:02.660> will<00:05:02.780> always<00:05:02.960> be<00:05:03.140> a<00:05:03.650> drop

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
to know that there will always be a drop

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.280 
to know that there will always be a drop
when<00:05:04.520> you<00:05:04.670> see<00:05:04.850> a<00:05:04.880> blue<00:05:05.150> eyed<00:05:05.330> zombie<00:05:05.810> and<00:05:06.050> you

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
when you see a blue eyed zombie and you

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.750 
when you see a blue eyed zombie and you
get<00:05:06.410> to<00:05:06.530> hear<00:05:06.620> Richthofen<00:05:07.160> being<00:05:07.340> a<00:05:07.400> bit<00:05:07.520> funny

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
get to hear Richthofen being a bit funny

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.640
