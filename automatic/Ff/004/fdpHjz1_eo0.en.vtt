00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.440
 i 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:22.360
 or the one I had is talked about if so blue and 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.850
 today we will talk about why the prince 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.770
 rosa y vegueta could not reach the 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.020
 transformation of your person and interest 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.140
 during everything we saw in dragon ball 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:35.680
 z in movies and a little for which the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.630
 taste of dragon ball gt like power to the 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.610
 end of dragon ball z you see all the 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.400
 potential that he managed to vegueta that was 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.530
 achieve to reach the super saiyan 2 and 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.559
 why and why do I believe that I never 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.239
 we'll see him as a super 6-3 in a 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.010
 interview that akira toriyama gave us 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.019
 on the transformations of 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.510
 movies of the battle of the gods 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.280
 he spoke that he was looking for a new direction in 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.589
 about the transformations that they had 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.330
 his heroes and what or who would focus 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.430
 both in the super saiyan 2 nor in the 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.560
 super if of interest I think that is 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.020
 something that would apply to everyone else 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.150
 characters because if they remember the scene 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.520
 in which bills hit the bulge and 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.890
 vegueta is enraged and gives him a bit of 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.440
 quarrel says in addition to the teacher 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.170
 roshi says he has managed to overcome goku 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.390
 this has been the perfect scene for 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.320
 joists would have transformed into super 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.260
 saiyan 3 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.640
 but obviously this was not the case if 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.920
 we have already seen the resurrection of 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.140
 freezer we can see that vegueta achieved the 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.090
 transformation of super saiyan two super 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.250
 Indians and besides that he achieved 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.650
 next phase that the super is Indians 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.050
 super be and in and dominates her as much as 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.030
 can see that they are again at the 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.009
 pair so in the course of the 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.140
 dragon ball mission super maybe already 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.970
 clarify these doubts and as the only 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.530
 bull and llama and do they would look for 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.900
 eta warriors in other ways to 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.940
 reach the super side god without having 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.090
 to go through the immense power of super 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.490
 63 good going to the saga of dragon 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.440
 ball z because vegueta could not reach the 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.340
 next level can be for several 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.869
 factors 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.520
 we can say that he lost a little 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.950
 motivation to train by having your 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.230
 rival deceased and without being clear when 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.630
 I would see him again but his blood sahin 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.459
 still the reasons to continue training and 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.530
 keep growing 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.330
 and counted on the help of the machine of the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.430
 gravity that the family of 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.280
 bulma with which he could train in 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.440
 extremely high and obviously after that 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.510
 effort he managed to take his body to 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.670
 next level is super follow but not 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.459
 as much as to reach the super saiyan 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.860
 3 as we can see vegueta tried to be 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.170
 a better father gases to tron ​​of the future 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.150
 so we can assume that in the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.980
 growth of his son trunks he was 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.620
 present in the family 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.840
 maybe it blurs 11 a little bit is objective 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.659
 to become stronger and as there was no 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.400
 one less likely threat was the 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:54.040
 need to take your body to 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.470
 limit continuously and on the contrary okur 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.200
 I did not have distractions I could train 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.659
 all the time he had the focus is the 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.430
 best fighter among the dead and 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.709
 win the martial arts tournament of 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.200
 another world many things with which 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.209
 vegeta did not count on earth if 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.040
 they ask why some children if they could 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.819
 address the transformation of his person 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.680
 and three and vegueta is not because the two is 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.319
 because the two were such a super saiyan 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.120
 time something near the maximum power since 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.700
 they could maintain the transformation and 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.920
 are relaxed and the merger between 12 and 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.370
 hybrids made us a unique being 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.959
 stronger and more capacity addition 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.840
 who learned the transformation not 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.099
 only well then q although the vegetable 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.050
 who knew of the existence of 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:41.500
 transformation until after 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.300
 commit suicide to kill the fat man but 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.160
 they trained in the room of time 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.769
 because what can you say that your 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.840
 body was in another dimension what 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.930
 made them more susceptible to reach 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.690
 the super saiyan 3 some advantages with 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.730
 that there was no vegueta for those who 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.090
 they wanted to know why he could not 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.340
 arrive in lapse 7 simply because 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.900
 he no longer trained hard he can move that he 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.299
 became more of a family man 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.099
 thanks to bully trans and that so 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.349
 we saw in a mustache driving their cars and 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.940
 taking them to the mall one 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.549
 reason may also be the writers 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.709
 maybe they did not see a need to 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.320
 see vegueta in this transformation and 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.510
 that for gt the transformation that 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.450
 I needed to fight with the enemies 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.880
 stronger super saint 4 adjustment and 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.889
 if they transformed it into super saint 4 it was 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.690
 with the machine that gives him the daring was 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.180
 just to have the excuse of merging 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.150
 the and create characters I played is super 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.860
 6-4 and show us the strongest character 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.620
 that we have seen throughout the franchise 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.750
 from the set so far 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.310
 I do not know that it was also a loss of 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.860
 his person Indians with three super saints 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.470
 four but I think that would be another 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.630
 discussion for another video so 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.810
 unfortunately I think we would not see 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.900
 in any official work that has 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:01.050
 continuation that is canon to vegueta 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.770
 transform super saiyan 3 maybe if I 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.919
 we can see in games 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.389
 different independent animations of 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.819
 what palin the time of dragon ball z 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.879
 and there if we can enjoy vegueta 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:15.620
 super saiyan 3 so it only remains 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:18.830
 wait to see what happens in dragon ball 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.120
 super and see if they surprise us with some 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.159
 new transformation that maybe not 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.680
 let's know and that vegetate can reach 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:26.919
 to do 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.169
 this has been all for today and if they want 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.539
 know more about characters about the 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.669
 history or curious data of dragon ball 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:36.610
 z please let me know the 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:39.400
 comments in like to share it and
