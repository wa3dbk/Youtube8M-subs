00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
playing with him for a while it took a

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.880 
playing with him for a while it took a
little<00:02:34.980> bit<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.430> get<00:02:35.550> used<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:36.000> um<00:02:36.590> but<00:02:37.590> after<00:02:37.830> I

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
little bit to get used to um but after I

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.110 
little bit to get used to um but after I
got<00:02:37.920> used<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:40.580> couldn't<00:02:41.580> really<00:02:41.730> tell<00:02:42.090> if

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
got used to it I couldn't really tell if

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.690 
got used to it I couldn't really tell if
it<00:02:42.540> made<00:02:42.720> my<00:02:42.930> aim<00:02:43.200> any<00:02:43.440> better<00:02:43.680> but<00:02:44.430> it

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
it made my aim any better but it

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.120 
it made my aim any better but it
definitely<00:02:44.940> just<00:02:45.209> made<00:02:45.980> holding<00:02:46.980> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
definitely just made holding the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.250 
definitely just made holding the
controller<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:48.050> lot<00:02:49.050> more<00:02:49.200> comfortable<00:02:49.880> I<00:02:51.260> like

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
controller a lot more comfortable I like

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.960 
controller a lot more comfortable I like
the<00:02:52.530> fact<00:02:52.739> that<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.160> get<00:02:53.370> this<00:02:53.640> more

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
the fact that you get this more

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.380 
the fact that you get this more
extension<00:02:55.220> then<00:02:56.220> having<00:02:56.580> your<00:02:56.730> faint<00:02:57.180> your

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
extension then having your faint your

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.500 
extension then having your faint your
thumbs<00:02:57.690> set<00:02:58.380> really<00:02:58.980> low<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.520> think<00:03:00.420> this

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
thumbs set really low I think this

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.430 
thumbs set really low I think this
extension<00:03:01.020> at<00:03:01.470> least<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.950> me<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.360> feels<00:03:03.360> a<00:03:03.870> lot

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
extension at least to me it feels a lot

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.949 
extension at least to me it feels a lot
more<00:03:04.500> better<00:03:06.950> so<00:03:08.000> that's<00:03:09.000> my<00:03:09.299> opinion<00:03:09.630> though

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
more better so that's my opinion though

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.430 
more better so that's my opinion though
but<00:03:10.260> uh<00:03:10.290> so<00:03:11.810> anyone<00:03:12.810> else<00:03:13.110> that's<00:03:13.350> been

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
but uh so anyone else that's been

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.140 
but uh so anyone else that's been
looking<00:03:13.799> into<00:03:13.950> buying<00:03:14.220> these<00:03:14.549> you<00:03:15.000> know
