00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:56.609 
traffic through the show and a lot of
interest<00:04:55.419> in<00:04:55.659> some<00:04:56.199> of<00:04:56.229> the<00:04:56.379> new

00:04:56.609 --> 00:04:56.619 
interest in some of the new

00:04:56.619 --> 00:04:59.579 
interest in some of the new
up-and-coming<00:04:57.249> technologies<00:04:58.139> not<00:04:59.139> just<00:04:59.469> a

00:04:59.579 --> 00:04:59.589 
up-and-coming technologies not just a

00:04:59.589 --> 00:05:02.039 
up-and-coming technologies not just a
traditional<00:05:00.159> mining<00:05:00.609> technology<00:05:01.269> so<00:05:01.539> we've

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:02.049 
traditional mining technology so we've

00:05:02.049 --> 00:05:03.719 
traditional mining technology so we've
had<00:05:02.229> a<00:05:02.289> tremendous<00:05:02.529> interest<00:05:03.189> in<00:05:03.369> a<00:05:03.429> lot<00:05:03.609> of

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
had a tremendous interest in a lot of

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.359 
had a tremendous interest in a lot of
people<00:05:04.059> for<00:05:04.599> our<00:05:04.719> graphene<00:05:05.319> which<00:05:05.859> is<00:05:06.039> a<00:05:06.069> nice

00:05:06.359 --> 00:05:06.369 
people for our graphene which is a nice

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:08.309 
people for our graphene which is a nice
generation<00:05:07.059> material<00:05:07.569> that<00:05:08.139> we<00:05:08.289> are

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:08.319 
generation material that we are

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:10.829 
generation material that we are
developing<00:05:08.829> from<00:05:09.459> the<00:05:09.759> light<00:05:09.939> knife<00:05:10.239> graphite

00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:10.839 
developing from the light knife graphite

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:13.019 
developing from the light knife graphite
so<00:05:11.589> overall<00:05:12.129> it's<00:05:12.519> been<00:05:12.699> a<00:05:12.729> wonderful

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:13.029 
so overall it's been a wonderful

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:16.049 
so overall it's been a wonderful
experience<00:05:14.459> what's<00:05:15.459> the<00:05:15.519> difference<00:05:15.879> between

experience what's the difference between

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:19.499 
experience what's the difference between
a<00:05:16.239> graphene<00:05:16.779> and<00:05:17.019> a<00:05:17.079> graphite<00:05:17.529> a<00:05:18.239> graphene<00:05:19.239> is
