all right so we're here at the 2013

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.810 
all right so we're here at the 2013
first<00:00:23.830> robotics<00:00:23.980> World<00:00:24.280> Championship<00:00:24.760> and

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
first robotics World Championship and

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.120 
first robotics World Championship and
the<00:00:24.910> Archimedes<00:00:25.390> division<00:00:25.810> with<00:00:26.410> the<00:00:26.770> dealer

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
the Archimedes division with the dealer

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.760 
the Archimedes division with the dealer
and<00:00:28.050> Trevor<00:00:29.190> Curtis<00:00:30.190> and<00:00:30.430> Brandon<00:00:30.700> to<00:00:31.770> 987

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
and Trevor Curtis and Brandon to 987

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.960 
and Trevor Curtis and Brandon to 987
they're<00:00:33.190> gonna<00:00:33.280> tell<00:00:33.490> us<00:00:33.580> a<00:00:33.610> little<00:00:33.670> bit<00:00:33.790> about

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
they're gonna tell us a little bit about

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.300 
they're gonna tell us a little bit about
the<00:00:34.120> robot<00:00:34.450> so<00:00:35.260> can<00:00:35.740> you<00:00:35.800> talk<00:00:35.950> to<00:00:36.070> me<00:00:36.130> a<00:00:36.190> little

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.310 
the robot so can you talk to me a little

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.460 
the robot so can you talk to me a little
bit<00:00:36.400> about<00:00:36.490> your<00:00:36.700> drivetrain<00:00:37.230> yeah<00:00:38.230> so

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
bit about your drivetrain yeah so

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.630 
bit about your drivetrain yeah so
basically<00:00:38.590> what<00:00:38.860> it<00:00:38.950> is<00:00:39.040> is<00:00:39.309> we<00:00:39.430> have<00:00:39.460> a

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
basically what it is is we have a

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.299 
basically what it is is we have a
twosome<00:00:40.420> drivetrain<00:00:41.080> so<00:00:41.680> I<00:00:41.710> mean<00:00:41.950> it's<00:00:42.100> two

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
twosome drivetrain so I mean it's two

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:43.710 
twosome drivetrain so I mean it's two
Sims<00:00:42.610> on<00:00:42.820> each<00:00:42.970> of<00:00:43.120> our<00:00:43.180> drive<00:00:43.420> trains

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
Sims on each of our drive trains

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.950 
Sims on each of our drive trains
basically<00:00:44.620> it's<00:00:44.800> a<00:00:44.920> two-speed<00:00:45.460> so<00:00:46.239> on<00:00:46.809> our

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
basically it's a two-speed so on our

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.260 
basically it's a two-speed so on our
high<00:00:47.140> we<00:00:47.410> go<00:00:47.559> 16<00:00:48.010> feet<00:00:48.190> per<00:00:48.309> second<00:00:48.700> and<00:00:48.790> in<00:00:49.180> our

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
high we go 16 feet per second and in our

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.720 
high we go 16 feet per second and in our
low<00:00:49.480> we<00:00:49.780> go<00:00:49.960> about<00:00:50.440> 4<00:00:50.650> feet<00:00:50.800> per<00:00:50.980> second<00:00:51.309> so

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
low we go about 4 feet per second so

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.829 
low we go about 4 feet per second so
basically<00:00:51.970> what<00:00:52.150> it<00:00:52.270> gives<00:00:52.360> us<00:00:52.540> is<00:00:52.660> it<00:00:52.809> gives

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
basically what it gives us is it gives

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:55.259 
basically what it gives us is it gives
us<00:00:53.080> a<00:00:53.230> speed<00:00:53.530> for<00:00:54.129> the<00:00:54.190> high<00:00:54.339> and<00:00:54.370> a<00:00:54.910> torque<00:00:55.150> to

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
us a speed for the high and a torque to

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.210 
us a speed for the high and a torque to
push<00:00:55.420> people<00:00:55.660> around<00:00:55.839> for<00:00:55.989> the<00:00:56.140> low<00:00:56.320> and<00:00:56.830> also

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
push people around for the low and also

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.970 
push people around for the low and also
we<00:00:57.370> are<00:00:57.550> a<00:00:57.580> belt-driven<00:00:58.559> drivetrain<00:00:59.559> so

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
we are a belt-driven drivetrain so

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.079 
we are a belt-driven drivetrain so
basically<00:01:00.250> don't<00:01:00.370> have<00:01:00.519> all<00:01:00.640> the<00:01:00.730> weight<00:01:00.879> of

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
basically don't have all the weight of

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:02.549 
basically don't have all the weight of
chains<00:01:01.540> and<00:01:01.780> stuff<00:01:02.019> like<00:01:02.140> that

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
chains and stuff like that

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:03.750 
chains and stuff like that
because<00:01:02.800> it<00:01:02.920> gets<00:01:03.040> it<00:01:03.129> away<00:01:03.309> and<00:01:03.400> also<00:01:03.550> it's

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
because it gets it away and also it's

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.540 
because it gets it away and also it's
really<00:01:03.970> hard<00:01:04.150> to<00:01:04.239> adjust<00:01:04.540> on<00:01:04.690> the<00:01:04.720> fly<00:01:05.550> right

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
really hard to adjust on the fly right

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.740 
really hard to adjust on the fly right
yeah<00:01:06.700> that's<00:01:06.850> great<00:01:07.120> I<00:01:07.210> love<00:01:07.480> the<00:01:07.570> belt<00:01:07.720> system

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
yeah that's great I love the belt system

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.280 
yeah that's great I love the belt system
how<00:01:10.750> you<00:01:10.840> doing

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
how you doing

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.920 
how you doing
so<00:01:11.650> I'm<00:01:11.740> talking<00:01:11.920> about<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.430> shooter<00:01:12.930> well

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
so I'm talking about the shooter well

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.200 
so I'm talking about the shooter well
basically<00:01:14.500> what<00:01:14.650> the<00:01:14.740> shooter<00:01:15.070> is<00:01:15.250> we<00:01:15.820> got<00:01:15.970> you

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
basically what the shooter is we got you

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.950 
basically what the shooter is we got you
know<00:01:16.330> a<00:01:16.360> basic<00:01:16.690> flywheel<00:01:17.290> here<00:01:17.560> we<00:01:18.250> have<00:01:18.430> a

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
know a basic flywheel here we have a

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.300 
know a basic flywheel here we have a
sensor<00:01:19.960> your<00:01:20.140> gear<00:01:20.380> chute<00:01:20.590> sensor<00:01:20.979> with<00:01:21.159> this

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
sensor your gear chute sensor with this

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.719 
sensor your gear chute sensor with this
steel<00:01:21.580> gear<00:01:21.790> that<00:01:21.970> we<00:01:22.060> made<00:01:22.270> so<00:01:22.870> with<00:01:23.740> the

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
steel gear that we made so with the

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.490 
steel gear that we made so with the
feedback<00:01:24.939> from<00:01:25.270> this<00:01:25.450> guy<00:01:25.689> as<00:01:25.930> well<00:01:25.960> as<00:01:26.320> our

feedback from this guy as well as our

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.249 
feedback from this guy as well as our
targeting<00:01:27.130> we<00:01:27.610> can<00:01:27.880> aim<00:01:28.270> this<00:01:28.780> turret

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
targeting we can aim this turret

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.289 
targeting we can aim this turret
anywhere<00:01:29.649> we<00:01:29.770> want<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:30.100> now<00:01:30.219> this<00:01:30.369> turret<00:01:30.700> can

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
anywhere we want to now this turret can

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.170 
anywhere we want to now this turret can
go<00:01:31.450> anywhere<00:01:31.780> because<00:01:31.990> of<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.530> pan<00:01:33.189> and<00:01:33.579> tilt

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
go anywhere because of the pan and tilt

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.440 
go anywhere because of the pan and tilt
which<00:01:34.540> you<00:01:34.780> see<00:01:34.960> with<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:35.259> cams<00:01:35.710> which<00:01:36.450> there

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
which you see with the cams which there

block are kind of tapered in crown to
keep<00:01:49.600> all<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.840> frisbees<00:01:50.200> where<00:01:50.530> they<00:01:50.619> ought

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
keep all the frisbees where they ought

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.550 
keep all the frisbees where they ought
to<00:01:50.740> be<00:01:50.890> that's<00:01:51.759> great<00:01:52.200> do<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:53.259> want<00:01:53.380> to<00:01:53.439> spin

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
to be that's great do you want to spin

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.779 
to be that's great do you want to spin

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
frisbees gonna come from the bottom down

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.150 
frisbees gonna come from the bottom down
here<00:02:16.960> and<00:02:17.200> what<00:02:17.710> we<00:02:17.800> have<00:02:17.950> are<00:02:17.980> two<00:02:18.720> kind<00:02:19.720> of

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
here and what we have are two kind of

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.530 
here and what we have are two kind of
activated<00:02:21.160> bars<00:02:21.610> if<00:02:22.000> you<00:02:22.090> want<00:02:22.240> to<00:02:22.300> think<00:02:22.480> of

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
activated bars if you want to think of

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.690 
activated bars if you want to think of
it<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:22.980> because<00:02:23.980> it's<00:02:24.130> got<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.370> go<00:02:24.460> up<00:02:24.490> this

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
it and because it's got to go up this

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.700 
it and because it's got to go up this
ramp<00:02:24.970> here<00:02:25.300> but<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.720> side<00:02:25.960> view<00:02:26.200> of<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.380> frisbee

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
ramp here but the side view of a frisbee

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.160 
ramp here but the side view of a frisbee
is<00:02:26.770> more<00:02:26.980> like<00:02:27.160> a<00:02:27.190> straight<00:02:27.580> edge<00:02:27.760> these<00:02:28.480> fit

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
is more like a straight edge these fit

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.950 
is more like a straight edge these fit
to<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.950> change<00:02:30.280> in<00:02:30.700> shape<00:02:31.390> as<00:02:31.630> the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
to the the change in shape as the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.230 
to the the change in shape as the
frisbee<00:02:32.260> goes<00:02:32.380> up<00:02:32.590> this<00:02:32.710> ramp<00:02:32.950> so<00:02:33.460> anywhere

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
frisbee goes up this ramp so anywhere

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.580 
frisbee goes up this ramp so anywhere
the<00:02:34.360> frisbee<00:02:34.690> is<00:02:34.810> in<00:02:34.960> this<00:02:35.140> it's<00:02:35.320> always

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
the frisbee is in this it's always

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.180 
the frisbee is in this it's always
getting<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:35.980> push<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:37.000> these<00:02:37.270> belts<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:38.290> this

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
getting the push of these belts so this

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.280 
getting the push of these belts so this
is<00:02:39.340> just<00:02:39.460> like<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:39.670> Pepsi<00:02:40.300> belt<00:02:40.660> like<00:02:41.080> in<00:02:41.200> a

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
is just like a Pepsi belt like in a

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.990 
is just like a Pepsi belt like in a
bottling<00:02:41.680> company<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.250> then<00:02:42.670> these<00:02:42.790> are<00:02:42.850> the

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
bottling company and then these are the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.150 
bottling company and then these are the
regular<00:02:43.510> vex<00:02:43.720> wheels<00:02:43.959> but<00:02:44.230> then<00:02:44.440> they're<00:02:45.040> up

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
regular vex wheels but then they're up

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.980 
regular vex wheels but then they're up
both<00:02:45.370> spring<00:02:45.850> loaded<00:02:46.060> as<00:02:46.300> you<00:02:46.420> can<00:02:46.570> see<00:02:46.780> and

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
both spring loaded as you can see and

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.070 
both spring loaded as you can see and
shoves<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.070> up<00:02:48.220> six<00:02:49.090> inches<00:02:49.360> of<00:02:49.510> space<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:49.990> goes

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
shoves it up six inches of space it goes

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.199 
shoves it up six inches of space it goes
from<00:02:50.320> horizontal<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:51.030> foot-and-a-half

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
from horizontal to foot-and-a-half

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.000 
from horizontal to foot-and-a-half
raised<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.690> up<00:02:52.810> back<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.230> horizontal<00:02:53.709> up<00:02:53.860> here

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
raised it up back to horizontal up here

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.100 
raised it up back to horizontal up here
just<00:02:54.130> by<00:02:54.280> jamming<00:02:54.700> it<00:02:54.790> into<00:02:54.910> this<00:02:55.120> guy<00:02:55.330> so

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
just by jamming it into this guy so

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.680 
just by jamming it into this guy so
that's<00:02:56.709> really<00:02:56.890> elegant<00:02:57.340> very<00:02:57.550> cool<00:02:57.820> so<00:02:58.600> you

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
that's really elegant very cool so you

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.580 
that's really elegant very cool so you
want<00:02:58.810> to<00:02:58.870> talk<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:58.990> little<00:02:59.170> bit<00:02:59.290> about<00:02:59.320> your

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
want to talk a little bit about your

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.199 
want to talk a little bit about your
your<00:02:59.950> hanger<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.490> then<00:03:00.640> we'll<00:03:00.850> talk<00:03:01.000> a<00:03:01.060> little

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
your hanger and then we'll talk a little

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.910 
your hanger and then we'll talk a little
bit<00:03:01.360> about<00:03:01.390> code<00:03:03.209> so<00:03:04.209> with<00:03:05.140> our<00:03:05.290> hanger<00:03:05.709> you

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
bit about code so with our hanger you

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.500 
bit about code so with our hanger you
got<00:03:06.100> piston<00:03:06.730> here<00:03:06.940> I'll<00:03:07.240> show<00:03:07.390> on<00:03:07.480> this<00:03:07.630> side

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
got piston here I'll show on this side

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.150 
got piston here I'll show on this side
so<00:03:10.510> right<00:03:10.750> now<00:03:10.959> it's<00:03:11.290> in<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.770> down<00:03:12.130> position

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
so right now it's in the down position

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.420 
so right now it's in the down position
and<00:03:12.970> he'll<00:03:13.180> stroke<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:14.050> out<00:03:14.170> I<00:03:14.200> think<00:03:14.380> so<00:03:15.130> you

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
and he'll stroke it out I think so you

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.520 
and he'll stroke it out I think so you
got<00:03:15.580> a<00:03:15.610> 30<00:03:15.970> pound<00:03:16.120> gas<00:03:16.390> shock<00:03:16.690> here<00:03:17.019> and<00:03:17.230> when

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
got a 30 pound gas shock here and when

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.680 
got a 30 pound gas shock here and when
we<00:03:17.650> activate<00:03:18.040> it<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:20.910> piston<00:03:21.910> here<00:03:22.150> shoots

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
we activate it the piston here shoots

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.710 
we activate it the piston here shoots
out<00:03:22.930> this<00:03:23.530> little<00:03:24.010> hook<00:03:24.580> that<00:03:24.940> latches<00:03:25.390> on<00:03:25.540> to

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
out this little hook that latches on to

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.479 
out this little hook that latches on to
the<00:03:25.840> bolt<00:03:26.019> right<00:03:26.170> here<00:03:26.230> comes<00:03:26.920> out<00:03:27.130> and<00:03:27.340> then

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
the bolt right here comes out and then

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.280 
the bolt right here comes out and then
the<00:03:27.519> 30<00:03:27.790> pound<00:03:28.000> gas<00:03:28.180> shock<00:03:28.420> can<00:03:28.690> extend<00:03:29.019> it<00:03:29.200> all

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
the 30 pound gas shock can extend it all

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.199 
the 30 pound gas shock can extend it all
the<00:03:29.320> way<00:03:29.470> up<00:03:29.500> and<00:03:29.650> also<00:03:30.100> when<00:03:30.760> we<00:03:30.790> drive<00:03:31.060> it

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
the way up and also when we drive it

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.860 
the way up and also when we drive it
into<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:32.489> pyramid<00:03:33.489> there<00:03:33.670> it's<00:03:34.300> on<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.600> shock

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
into the pyramid there it's on the shock

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.050 
into the pyramid there it's on the shock
so<00:03:35.260> we<00:03:35.620> can't<00:03:35.860> break<00:03:36.130> it<00:03:36.340> it'll<00:03:36.550> just<00:03:36.850> come

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
so we can't break it it'll just come

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.729 
so we can't break it it'll just come
back<00:03:37.300> and<00:03:37.570> then<00:03:37.690> it's<00:03:37.810> like<00:03:37.959> oh<00:03:38.110> we're<00:03:38.380> on<00:03:38.410> it

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
back and then it's like oh we're on it

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.830 
back and then it's like oh we're on it
activated<00:03:39.340> again<00:03:39.580> pulls<00:03:39.820> it<00:03:39.940> back<00:03:39.970> up<00:03:40.209> that's

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
activated again pulls it back up that's

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:49.559 
activated again pulls it back up that's
awesome<00:03:41.410> very<00:03:41.709> cool

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.240 

so<00:03:50.110> I'll<00:03:50.230> talk<00:03:50.379> a<00:03:50.439> little<00:03:50.620> bit<00:03:50.739> about<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:51.010> code

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
so I'll talk a little bit about the code

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.550 
so I'll talk a little bit about the code
that<00:03:51.489> went<00:03:51.670> into<00:03:51.790> this<00:03:52.780> very<00:03:53.409> impressive

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
that went into this very impressive

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.920 
that went into this very impressive
turret<00:03:54.069> yeah<00:03:54.609> so<00:03:54.939> when<00:03:55.120> we<00:03:55.269> have<00:03:55.450> what's

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
turret yeah so when we have what's

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.720 
turret yeah so when we have what's
called<00:03:56.019> proportional<00:03:56.349> control<00:03:57.040> on<00:03:57.310> both<00:03:57.519> our

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
called proportional control on both our

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.929 
called proportional control on both our
turret<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:58.269> our<00:03:58.599> tilt<00:03:59.079> motors<00:03:59.890> we're<00:04:00.819> also

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:00.939 
turret and our tilt motors we're also

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:04.080 
turret and our tilt motors we're also
using<00:04:01.560> portion<00:04:02.560> control<00:04:03.370> on<00:04:03.489> our<00:04:03.609> wheel<00:04:03.819> with

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
using portion control on our wheel with

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.940 
using portion control on our wheel with
a<00:04:04.120> Hall<00:04:04.329> effect<00:04:04.359> sensor<00:04:05.019> and<00:04:05.439> gets<00:04:05.590> feedback

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
a Hall effect sensor and gets feedback

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.289 
a Hall effect sensor and gets feedback
from<00:04:06.099> this<00:04:06.280> steel<00:04:06.579> gear<00:04:06.879> that<00:04:07.060> we've<00:04:07.150> mounted

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
from this steel gear that we've mounted

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:08.910 
from this steel gear that we've mounted
to<00:04:07.629> the<00:04:07.720> wheel

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
to the wheel

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.190 
to the wheel
we<00:04:09.189> have<00:04:09.370> camera<00:04:09.819> targeting<00:04:10.269> which<00:04:10.989> also

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
we have camera targeting which also

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.809 
we have camera targeting which also
works<00:04:11.590> in<00:04:11.859> line<00:04:12.069> with<00:04:12.250> our<00:04:12.400> point<00:04:12.640> click

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
works in line with our point click

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.670 
works in line with our point click
targeting<00:04:13.390> and<00:04:13.540> our<00:04:13.689> manual<00:04:14.049> targeting<00:04:14.230> so

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
targeting and our manual targeting so

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.210 
targeting and our manual targeting so
all<00:04:14.799> those<00:04:14.980> are<00:04:15.099> integrated<00:04:15.609> into<00:04:15.730> one<00:04:16.000> system

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
all those are integrated into one system

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.879 
all those are integrated into one system
we<00:04:18.220> have<00:04:18.430> an<00:04:18.639> encoder<00:04:19.509> based<00:04:19.840> brake<00:04:20.229> on<00:04:20.709> our

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
we have an encoder based brake on our

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.950 
we have an encoder based brake on our
drive<00:04:21.160> train<00:04:21.549> so<00:04:21.759> there's<00:04:21.940> no<00:04:22.120> physical<00:04:22.419> or

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
drive train so there's no physical or

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.200 
drive train so there's no physical or
pneumatics<00:04:23.470> stop<00:04:23.740> we<00:04:23.979> use<00:04:24.160> an<00:04:24.310> encoder<00:04:24.639> base

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
pneumatics stop we use an encoder base

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.430 
pneumatics stop we use an encoder base
up<00:04:25.740> and<00:04:26.759> are<00:04:27.759> targeting<00:04:28.240> I<00:04:28.330> can<00:04:28.449> show<00:04:28.599> you<00:04:28.660> yeah

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
up and are targeting I can show you yeah

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:47.570 
up and are targeting I can show you yeah
great<00:04:30.009> demonstration<00:04:30.520> be<00:04:30.610> great

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:05:03.310 

that<00:04:48.150> is<00:04:48.360> so<00:04:48.569> cool

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320
