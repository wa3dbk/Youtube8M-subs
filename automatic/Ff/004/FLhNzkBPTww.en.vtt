the States they call it the t3 let's

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.480 
the States they call it the t3 let's
take<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.570> look

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.859 

okay<00:00:22.490> so<00:00:22.550> this<00:00:22.789> was<00:00:23.000> actually<00:00:23.330> announced<00:00:23.570> back

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
okay so this was actually announced back

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.310 
okay so this was actually announced back
in<00:00:23.930> 2011<00:00:24.920> so<00:00:25.460> it's<00:00:25.490> by<00:00:26.060> no<00:00:26.090> means<00:00:26.270> new<00:00:26.810> and<00:00:27.050> even

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
in 2011 so it's by no means new and even

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.530 
in 2011 so it's by no means new and even
then<00:00:27.619> it<00:00:27.770> was<00:00:27.950> their<00:00:28.099> entry-level<00:00:28.490> body<00:00:28.970> so

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:29.540 
then it was their entry-level body so

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.600 
then it was their entry-level body so
not<00:00:29.750> surprising<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:30.770> specs<00:00:31.099> are<00:00:31.310> a<00:00:31.340> little

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
not surprising the specs are a little

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.570

DSLR photography have to remember that
not<00:00:55.280> everyone<00:00:55.820> has<00:00:56.089> years<00:00:56.420> of<00:00:56.510> experience<00:00:57.199> or

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
not everyone has years of experience or

not everyone has years of experience or
has<00:00:57.680> been<00:00:57.979> using<00:00:58.190> pro<00:00:58.820> gear<00:00:59.089> this<00:00:59.750> represents

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
has been using pro gear this represents

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.200 
has been using pro gear this represents
a<00:01:00.559> big<00:01:00.710> step<00:01:01.010> up<00:01:01.190> for<00:01:01.339> a<00:01:01.400> lot<00:01:01.519> of<00:01:01.580> people<00:01:01.970> and

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
a big step up for a lot of people and

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.420 
a big step up for a lot of people and
the<00:01:02.780> feature<00:01:03.049> set<00:01:03.409> I<00:01:03.440> think<00:01:03.559> is<00:01:03.920> well-rounded

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
the feature set I think is well-rounded

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.430 
the feature set I think is well-rounded
and<00:01:04.820> well<00:01:05.030> aimed<00:01:05.299> at<00:01:05.659> that<00:01:05.690> part<00:01:06.110> of<00:01:06.260> the

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.320 
and well aimed at that part of the
market<00:01:06.920> so<00:01:07.310> let's<00:01:07.490> actually<00:01:07.640> take<00:01:08.030> a<00:01:08.090> look

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
market so let's actually take a look

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.850 
market so let's actually take a look
through<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:08.900> different<00:01:09.290> features<00:01:09.470> on<00:01:09.770> the

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
through the different features on the

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.010 
through the different features on the
camera<00:01:10.220> whilst<00:01:10.460> we<00:01:10.640> talk<00:01:10.820> about<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.240> specs<00:01:11.540> so

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
camera whilst we talk about the specs so

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.469 
camera whilst we talk about the specs so
the<00:01:12.170> 1100<00:01:12.860> D<00:01:13.070> has<00:01:13.310> a<00:01:13.340> twelve<00:01:13.790> point<00:01:14.150> two

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
the 1100 D has a twelve point two

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.140 
the 1100 D has a twelve point two
megapixel<00:01:14.860> imaging<00:01:15.860> sensor<00:01:16.310> it's<00:01:16.490> their<00:01:16.760> DX

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
megapixel imaging sensor it's their DX

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.390 
megapixel imaging sensor it's their DX
with<00:01:17.450> a<00:01:17.479> one<00:01:17.780> point<00:01:18.140> six<00:01:18.500> time<00:01:18.770> crop<00:01:19.159> factor

with a one point six time crop factor
and<00:01:20.390> as<00:01:20.720> I<00:01:20.869> said<00:01:20.930> it's<00:01:21.350> their<00:01:21.530> basic

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
and as I said it's their basic

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.389

entry-level<00:01:22.490> model<00:01:23.180> as<00:01:23.530> with<00:01:24.530> all<00:01:24.680> the<00:01:24.799> dslr's

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
entry-level model as with all the dslr's

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.490 
entry-level model as with all the dslr's
it<00:01:25.609> does<00:01:25.789> have<00:01:26.090> a<00:01:26.119> decent<00:01:26.390> pop-up<00:01:26.990> flash<00:01:27.200> and

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
it does have a decent pop-up flash and

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.109 
it does have a decent pop-up flash and
you<00:01:27.560> can<00:01:27.710> see<00:01:27.859> for<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:28.100> small<00:01:28.369> camera<00:01:28.670> that<00:01:28.789> does

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
you can see for a small camera that does

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.240 
you can see for a small camera that does
actually<00:01:29.479> extend<00:01:29.840> a<00:01:29.960> fair<00:01:30.229> bit<00:01:30.439> away<00:01:30.710> from<00:01:30.740> the

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
actually extend a fair bit away from the

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.840 
actually extend a fair bit away from the
imaging<00:01:32.179> sensor<00:01:33.130> checking<00:01:34.130> out<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.399> rear<00:01:34.640> of

this one you can see it's got a 2.7 inch
TFT<00:01:38.060> screen<00:01:38.509> but<00:01:39.380> it's<00:01:39.530> only<00:01:40.060> 230,000<00:01:41.060> K<00:01:41.210> which

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
and it was quite entry-level even you

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.359 
and it was quite entry-level even you

know a year ago when this guy came out
now<00:01:49.369> whilst<00:01:49.609> this<00:01:49.789> is<00:01:49.850> relatively<00:01:50.509> light<00:01:51.020> it

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
now whilst this is relatively light it

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.380 
now whilst this is relatively light it
has<00:01:51.740> grown<00:01:52.009> in<00:01:52.249> size<00:01:52.280> from<00:01:52.880> previous

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
has grown in size from previous

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.380 
has grown in size from previous
generations<00:01:53.719> and<00:01:54.530> there<00:01:55.130> is<00:01:55.310> some<00:01:55.700> steel<00:01:56.060> in

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
generations and there is some steel in

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.969 
generations and there is some steel in
the<00:01:56.569> chassis<00:01:56.840> of<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:57.170> body<00:01:57.499> it's<00:01:57.710> not<00:01:57.799> a

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
the chassis of the body it's not a

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.679 
the chassis of the body it's not a
hundred<00:01:58.310> percent<00:01:58.429> plastic<00:01:59.090> which<00:01:59.240> is<00:01:59.420> a<00:01:59.450> good

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
hundred percent plastic which is a good

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.809 
hundred percent plastic which is a good
thing<00:01:59.899> taking<00:02:00.770> a<00:02:00.829> look<00:02:01.039> at<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.249> back<00:02:01.460> of<00:02:01.640> the

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
thing taking a look at the back of the

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.209 
thing taking a look at the back of the
feature<00:02:02.090> layout<00:02:02.630> I<00:02:02.869> do<00:02:03.200> really<00:02:03.799> like<00:02:04.159> the

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
feature layout I do really like the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.700 
feature layout I do really like the
buttons<00:02:04.850> they're<00:02:05.149> big<00:02:05.569> and<00:02:05.929> easy<00:02:06.200> to<00:02:06.439> find

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
buttons they're big and easy to find

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.370 
buttons they're big and easy to find
there's<00:02:07.369> a<00:02:07.460> several<00:02:08.149> buttons<00:02:08.630> there<00:02:08.869> that<00:02:09.170> you

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
there's a several buttons there that you

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.200 
there's a several buttons there that you
know<00:02:09.500> give<00:02:09.830> you<00:02:09.920> direct<00:02:10.280> access<00:02:10.460> to<00:02:10.789> menu

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
know give you direct access to menu

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.450 
know give you direct access to menu
items<00:02:11.600> which<00:02:11.840> are<00:02:12.170> great<00:02:12.710> to<00:02:12.890> have<00:02:12.920> on<00:02:13.160> all

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
items which are great to have on all

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.430 
items which are great to have on all
cameras<00:02:14.210> whether<00:02:14.420> they're<00:02:14.660> entry-level<00:02:15.050> or

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
cameras whether they're entry-level or

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.380 
cameras whether they're entry-level or
high-end<00:02:15.710> take<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.370> look<00:02:16.670> at<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:16.910> top<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:17.270> can

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
high-end take a look at the top you can

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.660 
high-end take a look at the top you can
see<00:02:17.510> it's<00:02:17.660> got<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.900> really<00:02:18.290> detailed<00:02:18.890> mode<00:02:19.310> dial

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
see it's got a really detailed mode dial

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.790 
see it's got a really detailed mode dial
there<00:02:20.000> it's<00:02:20.510> got<00:02:20.690> all<00:02:20.810> your<00:02:20.959> manual<00:02:21.380> settings

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
there it's got all your manual settings

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.170 
there it's got all your manual settings
but<00:02:22.010> then<00:02:22.130> it's<00:02:22.280> got<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.430> bunch<00:02:22.700> of<00:02:22.880> creative

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
but then it's got a bunch of creative

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.180 
but then it's got a bunch of creative
mode<00:02:23.690> options<00:02:24.170> that<00:02:24.380> you<00:02:24.560> expect<00:02:25.010> on

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
mode options that you expect on

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.370 
mode options that you expect on
lower-end<00:02:25.550> bodies<00:02:26.060> which<00:02:26.600> help<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:27.020> get<00:02:27.230> the

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
look at the side of this guy can see

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.630 
look at the side of this guy can see
it's<00:02:33.350> got<00:02:33.590> USB

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
it's got USB

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.600 
it's got USB

here this one has it in with the battery
like<00:02:48.800> you'd<00:02:49.160> expect<00:02:49.280> on<00:02:49.730> a<00:02:49.760> point-and-shoot

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330

one's only 860 milliamp hours which is

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.030 
one's only 860 milliamp hours which is
really<00:02:55.760> quite<00:02:56.510> low<00:02:56.750> for<00:02:57.080> a<00:02:57.110> DSLR<00:02:57.770> that

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
really quite low for a DSLR that

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.380 
really quite low for a DSLR that
translates<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.300> fewer<00:02:59.630> shots<00:02:59.959> per<00:03:00.560> charge<00:03:01.390> it

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
frames per second ok so as I say you get

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.370 
frames per second ok so as I say you get
what<00:03:30.800> you<00:03:30.920> pay<00:03:31.130> for<00:03:31.180> it<00:03:32.180> doesn't<00:03:32.630> have<00:03:32.780> full<00:03:32.989> HD

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
what you pay for it doesn't have full HD

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.590 
what you pay for it doesn't have full HD
video<00:03:33.680> it's<00:03:34.250> lacking<00:03:34.670> several<00:03:35.300> different

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
video it's lacking several different

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.320 
video it's lacking several different
controls<00:03:36.050> but<00:03:36.620> I<00:03:36.650> do<00:03:36.800> think<00:03:37.220> it<00:03:37.370> offers<00:03:37.970> a

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
controls but I do think it offers a

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.100 
controls but I do think it offers a
fantastic<00:03:39.310> stepping-stone<00:03:40.310> between<00:03:40.880> non<00:03:41.780> you
