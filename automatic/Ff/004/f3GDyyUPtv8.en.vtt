 straight to the kitchen after I got this 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.089
 at one point I go before a cup of tea 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.769
 put myself because without a cup of tea 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.430

 land can be tasty and it is nutritious and 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:12.280

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.750
 my secret to being the perfect oatmeal 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.340
 250 milliliters 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.039
 soy milk this case i don't like so much 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.039
 regular milk and 6 tablespoons oatmeal 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.579
 the second of simmering is just as tasty 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.579

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.780
 it is very tasty 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.940
 I make it all over makes another one 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.640

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.030
 back in and out of bike and blue 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.070
 pet looked through their time to it 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.700
 quietly to eat and my tea 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.140
 drink 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.940
 because I always try so quickly 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.530
 possible to prepare but I want 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.940

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.870
 have peace of mind to eat at least 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.060
 to eat 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.040
 I would agree on a good breakfast 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.170
 a most important meal of the day and 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.440

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.440
 look 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.350
 then I take a shower and 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.850
 therefore the horse products punished first 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.750

 shower gel from the body shop and for nothing 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.810

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.700
 conditioner that you also volume to you 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.700

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.590
 when I come out of the shower that side first 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.600
