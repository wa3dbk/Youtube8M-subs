for us to be able to swim with the
dolphins<00:01:01.680> today<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:03.000> would<00:01:03.480> say<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
dolphins today I would say that the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.190 
dolphins today I would say that the
chances<00:01:05.070> are<00:01:05.250> quite<00:01:06.090> big<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:06.930> will<00:01:07.049> see

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
chances are quite big that we will see

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.830 
chances are quite big that we will see
the<00:01:07.350> dolphins<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.159> if<00:01:08.580> we're<00:01:08.790> lucky<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.810> can

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
can even get them snorting I swim

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.660 
can even get them snorting I swim
together<00:01:15.390> with<00:01:15.720> them<00:01:16.100> yeah<00:01:17.130> there<00:01:17.520> will<00:01:17.640> be

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
together with them yeah there will be

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.789 
together with them yeah there will be
also<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.750> far<00:01:18.900> great<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.259> let's<00:01:19.439> keep<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
also so far great so let's keep the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.410 

so<00:01:42.530> when<00:01:43.010> we're<00:01:43.190> entering<00:01:43.520> a<00:01:43.640> dolphin<00:01:44.270> house

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
so when we're entering a dolphin house

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.719 
so when we're entering a dolphin house
now<00:01:44.659> it's<00:01:45.440> very<00:01:45.710> important<00:01:46.220> that<00:01:46.490> we<00:01:46.640> get

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
now it's very important that we get

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.040 
now it's very important that we get
slowly<00:01:47.119> into<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.600> water

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
slowly into the water

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.590 
slowly into the water
we<00:01:48.770> swim<00:01:49.070> slowly<00:01:49.550> towards<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:49.940> Dolphins<00:01:50.360> if

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
we swim slowly towards the Dolphins if

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.840 
we swim slowly towards the Dolphins if
they<00:01:51.020> want<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.260> play<00:01:51.440> they<00:01:52.100> will<00:01:52.280> turn<00:01:52.550> and
