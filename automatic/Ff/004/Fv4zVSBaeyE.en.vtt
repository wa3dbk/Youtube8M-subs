00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
the fact that they would use them but

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.679 
the fact that they would use them but
the<00:01:32.549> dragons<00:01:32.970> are<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.210> flying<00:01:33.390> right<00:01:33.659> over

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
the dragons are just flying right over

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.539 
the dragons are just flying right over
because<00:01:34.170> obviously<00:01:34.380> they<00:01:34.710> don't<00:01:34.799> jump<00:01:35.159> maybe

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
because obviously they don't jump maybe

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.039 
because obviously they don't jump maybe
they<00:01:35.820> were<00:01:35.880> walking<00:01:36.180> dragons<00:01:36.780> but<00:01:36.930> they're

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
they were walking dragons but they're

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.719 
they were walking dragons but they're
not<00:01:37.170> they're<00:01:37.350> flying<00:01:37.619> dragons<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.579> they're

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
not they're flying dragons so they're

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.039 
not they're flying dragons so they're
working<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.030> way<00:01:39.150> all<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.570> way<00:01:39.600> around<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
working the way all the way around the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.300 
working the way all the way around the
base<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.409> guy<00:01:40.590> actually<00:01:40.710> had<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> good<00:01:41.189> amount

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
base this guy actually had a good amount

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.219 
base this guy actually had a good amount
of<00:01:41.549> loop<00:01:41.729> for<00:01:41.909> us<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.180> steal<00:01:42.420> which<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.899> rare

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
of loop for us to steal which is rare

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.170 
of loop for us to steal which is rare
for<00:01:43.470> Rushka<00:01:43.799> crush<00:01:44.040> because<00:01:44.280> normally<00:01:44.670> we

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
for Rushka crush because normally we

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.789 
for Rushka crush because normally we
just<00:01:45.210> find<00:01:45.509> dead<00:01:45.750> basis<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.439> have<00:01:46.590> like

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
just find dead basis that have like

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.010 
just find dead basis that have like
level<00:01:47.220> one<00:01:47.340> mines<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.790> pumps<00:01:48.060> etc<00:01:48.149> etc<00:01:48.509> so

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
level one mines and pumps etc etc so

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.569 
level one mines and pumps etc etc so
this<00:01:49.470> was<00:01:49.649> actually<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:50.070> little<00:01:50.220> breath<00:01:50.460> of

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
this was actually a little breath of

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.980 
this was actually a little breath of
fresh<00:01:50.729> air<00:01:50.939> when<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.149> came<00:01:51.329> into<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.659> loot<00:01:51.840> on

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
fresh air when it came into the loot on

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.600 
fresh air when it came into the loot on
this<00:01:52.140> attack<00:01:52.470> obviously<00:01:52.979> didn't<00:01:53.280> give<00:01:53.490> us

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
this attack obviously didn't give us

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.969 
this attack obviously didn't give us
enough<00:01:53.700> elixir<00:01:54.119> for<00:01:54.479> all<00:01:54.630> these<00:01:54.840> max<00:01:55.140> dragons

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
enough elixir for all these max dragons

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.770 
enough elixir for all these max dragons
that<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.189> use<00:01:56.369> but<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:56.939> still<00:01:57.299> pretty<00:01:57.360> funny

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
that we use but it's still pretty funny

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.800 
that we use but it's still pretty funny
so<00:01:58.200> he<00:01:58.680> only<00:01:58.829> had<00:01:59.219> like<00:01:59.520> level<00:02:00.060> 1<00:02:00.329> wizard

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
