goodwill and i just found this flannel
um<00:06:18.110> and<00:06:19.110> it's<00:06:19.260> grey<00:06:19.620> with<00:06:20.160> black<00:06:20.370> and<00:06:20.580> white

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:20.730 
um and it's grey with black and white

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.130 
um and it's grey with black and white
stripes<00:06:21.419> and<00:06:21.630> i<00:06:21.660> thought<00:06:21.780> it'd<00:06:21.900> be<00:06:21.930> really

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
stripes and i thought it'd be really

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.310 
stripes and i thought it'd be really
good<00:06:22.410> for<00:06:22.680> tying<00:06:23.580> around<00:06:23.850> my<00:06:24.000> waist<00:06:24.200> because<00:06:25.200> i

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
good for tying around my waist because i

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.440 
good for tying around my waist because i
always<00:06:25.560> use<00:06:26.340> my<00:06:26.550> one<00:06:26.730> that's<00:06:26.910> black<00:06:27.090> and<00:06:27.270> white

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.450 
always use my one that's black and white

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.770 
always use my one that's black and white
so<00:06:27.990> I<00:06:28.020> thought<00:06:28.169> gray<00:06:28.560> and<00:06:28.830> black<00:06:29.010> and<00:06:29.250> white<00:06:29.780> be

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
so I thought gray and black and white be

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.700 
so I thought gray and black and white be
good

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
good

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.440
