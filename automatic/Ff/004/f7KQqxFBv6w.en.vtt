00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 Y 

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:09.389
 hello good today we are here with a video 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.130
 more than true hairstyle I hope that you 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.769
 I hope I serve you is very 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.950
 practical is very quick to do is this 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.020
 that is here that I am going to show you 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.670
 is this that I only made my doll look 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.090
 so is the back hope 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.550
 that the camera captures well now and looks 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.460
 for a side better said forgiveness for the 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.099
 back with the other side and by 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.440
 the opposite that that's how it is 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.960
 is very easy to do is very practical not 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.480
 we need a lot of things to be able to 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.390
 do it and I hope you like it 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.730
 I hope you can use this this hairstyle 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.890
 of this video and then remember in the 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.149
 part in the part down here and left 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.420
 All the information about the products 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.400
 that I use in this in this video for 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.450
 do this hairstyle and in the other videos 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.740
 I also do in the box 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.960
 information there is the information 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.970
 because then they left me questions and 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.140
 If I do not answer them there, it goes out to 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.939
 that you check it and then to 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.560
 remember the videos that we carry 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.450
 they are just suggestions are not 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.210
 an imposition so I would appreciate that 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.280
 they will take it and so the video is 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.470
 nail comb or whatever we do not 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.020
 simply and simply discard it 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.520
 but this is why they do not leave or where they insult 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.200
 not because it's really not necessary 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.010
 always only if something to me does not 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.900
 like 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.460
 the mind because I do not do it not because in 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.040
 Actually, my intention is not to offend 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.230
 the fate share something that you can and 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.780
 Well, I think that you can 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.040
 serve someone and well beware 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.100
 God bless you, God bless you 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.930

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.450
 to make them like that a part as well as that 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.670
 I speak and another part by recorded then 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.980
 so that they make us very long and very 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.130
 tedious leaves good because he thinks many 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.680

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.370
 first we brush the hair and we go to 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.229
 also take some pins and a spray 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.030
 that you have there I show you the 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.050
 that I'm going to occupy and I think I'm going to 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.330
 do good first I'm going to do a 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.490
 little crepe on top 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.750
 no it will not be very very exaggerated 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.480
 We need a little bit of it 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.190
 lifted our hair since already 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.200
 we have done this well let's go now 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.970
 let's brush it so that as you 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.250
 I say it gives a little fluff but 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.200
 not much because add only we are that 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.050
 is a little slight well I what I do 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.420
 I'm going to give you a lock as you will see and 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.110
 I'm going to spin it and spin it and 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.260
 turn ok and in the back I'm going to 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.720
 hold with one of the pins go to 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.940
 see right now 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.040
 and after we do that we already 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.410
 hold with a pin of preference 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.870
 of the color of your hair we are going to grab 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.870
 the other side and we're going to do the same 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.170
 let's turn a lock in front and 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.320
 let's join it with the other tuft quoted 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.640
 that is going to be fixed with him with the 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.640
 Tuft we made from the other side 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.540
 well I think we're going to do that 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.350
 in everything in all the hair trying 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.200
 to cover with the same hair the 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.290
 pins that we have put in the and 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.970
 we in the other tuft places that 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.710
 let's go grabbing elche is that I do not know 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.010
 notice that's why the importance 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.470
 also that they are the color of your 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.160
 hair so they miss what they are 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.160
 the pins 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.849
 we are going to do everything all everything 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.849
 all all the hair 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.620
 and seeing how it is very simple but 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.780
 true that in the end it looks very very cute 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.520
 well exactly this is what we 're going 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.660
 doing tuft by strand made by 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:04:00.650
 tuft until you get right now to the part 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:03.439
 below is going to see 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.909
 how are we going to do it, let's go 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.909
 down to down to down 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.380
 to know crossing crossing 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.880
 ah 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.790
 there he is seeing how more or less he will go 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.860
 leaving our hairstyle that is going to see 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.480
 nice you can put ornaments like me 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.280
 I'll put it in the end or what can 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.080
 leave as well as right now they will see that 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.060
 what is left if they are accommodating and 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.580
 they are accommodating so that it is seen 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.370
 nice put a little more spray 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.199
 so that it is fixed because our hairstyle does not 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.449
 There we last look and leaves 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:56.629
 living like this is how it ends you know very 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:59.210
 pretty and I saw with him the tones of 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:00.949
 pin your hair like that 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.530
 loses and good finally grabbed a 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.939
 pincer and I make some small remains of 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.449
 true in everything everything 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:09.949
 the lock that was left loose and then 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.689
 and I did all I'll do is 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.219
 release them a little bit because I do not want to 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:14.689

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:18.770
 you want it so you can do it 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:20.960
 true and good is the way it is 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.419
 in our hairstyle so they can leave it 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.039

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:29.599

 tuft quoted 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:37.749
