00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
been forced to use a wrench take these

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:56.420 
been forced to use a wrench take these
three<00:02:50.590> bolts<00:02:50.769> out<00:02:51.069> one<00:02:51.909> two<00:02:52.920> three<00:02:54.060> short<00:02:55.060> one

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
three bolts out one two three short one

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.690 
three bolts out one two three short one
goes<00:02:57.430> at<00:02:57.609> the<00:02:57.700> top<00:02:57.989> long<00:02:58.989> one<00:02:59.349> short<00:02:59.680> one<00:03:00.519> goes

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
goes at the top long one short one goes

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.899 
goes at the top long one short one goes
at<00:03:00.849> the<00:03:00.909> top<00:03:00.940> long<00:03:01.810> will<00:03:02.019> goes<00:03:02.170> in<00:03:02.349> the<00:03:02.409> middle

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
at the top long will goes in the middle

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.610 
at the top long will goes in the middle
this<00:03:03.909> other<00:03:04.239> short<00:03:04.629> one<00:03:04.870> but<00:03:05.200> it's<00:03:05.349> a<00:03:05.440> little

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
this other short one but it's a little

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.839 
this other short one but it's a little
longer<00:03:05.950> than<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.549> other<00:03:06.909> one<00:03:07.000> goes<00:03:07.959> here<00:03:08.409> so

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
longer than the other one goes here so

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:15.360 
longer than the other one goes here so
remember<00:03:09.849> that<00:03:10.829> so<00:03:11.829> it's<00:03:14.040> easier<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.069> do

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
remember that so it's easier to do

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.860 
remember that so it's easier to do
