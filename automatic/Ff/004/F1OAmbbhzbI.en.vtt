between<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.870> two<00:02:22.989> guitars<00:02:23.350> I<00:02:23.530> think<00:02:23.739> you're

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
between the two guitars I think you're

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.470 
between the two guitars I think you're
going<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:24.010> notice<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.459> very<00:02:24.670> pronounced<00:02:25.209> bass

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
going to notice a very pronounced bass

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.770 
going to notice a very pronounced bass
response<00:02:25.720> but<00:02:26.709> more<00:02:27.579> so<00:02:27.790> on<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.000> HD<00:02:28.299> 35

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
response but more so on the HD 35

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.620 
response but more so on the HD 35
because<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.350> top<00:02:29.560> is<00:02:29.590> lighter<00:02:30.070> braced<00:02:30.630> also

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
because the top is lighter braced also

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.539 
because the top is lighter braced also
what<00:02:31.780> I've<00:02:31.900> noticed<00:02:32.350> is<00:02:32.500> that<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.799> HD<00:02:32.950> 28

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
what I've noticed is that the HD 28

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.630 
what I've noticed is that the HD 28
reacts<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.180> heavier<00:02:34.570> hand<00:02:34.660> while<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.560> HD<00:02:36.070> 35

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
reacts to a heavier hand while the HD 35

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.790 
reacts to a heavier hand while the HD 35
is<00:02:37.060> quite<00:02:37.540> responsive<00:02:38.170> so<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.349> don't<00:02:38.500> have<00:02:38.650> to

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
is quite responsive so you don't have to

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.280 
is quite responsive so you don't have to
push<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.130> as<00:02:39.220> hard<00:02:39.510> overall<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.780> think<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:41.110> get

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
push it as hard overall I think you get

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.930 
push it as hard overall I think you get
really<00:02:41.500> great<00:02:41.680> clarity<00:02:42.160> out<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.430> HD

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
really great clarity out of the HD

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.180 
really great clarity out of the HD
35<00:02:43.240> and<00:02:43.510> a<00:02:43.780> super<00:02:44.140> pronounced<00:02:44.470> bass<00:02:44.800> because

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
35 and a super pronounced bass because

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.700 
35 and a super pronounced bass because
of<00:02:45.310> that<00:02:45.400> lighter<00:02:45.640> top<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.630> HD<00:02:46.900> 28<00:02:47.290> certainly

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
of that lighter top the HD 28 certainly

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.470 
of that lighter top the HD 28 certainly
gives<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.040> run<00:02:48.160> for<00:02:48.190> its<00:02:48.340> money<00:02:48.460> as<00:02:48.760> well<00:02:48.910> so

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
gives it a run for its money as well so

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.360 
gives it a run for its money as well so
we're<00:02:49.600> going<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:49.780> play<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.050> HD<00:02:50.410> 28<00:02:50.800> and<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.040> HD

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
we're going to play the HD 28 and the HD
