what's<00:02:00.280> nice<00:02:00.640> about<00:02:00.700> statcrunch<00:02:01.630> is<00:02:01.899> we<00:02:02.020> can

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
what's nice about statcrunch is we can

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.760 
what's nice about statcrunch is we can
label<00:02:02.380> our<00:02:02.649> axes<00:02:03.219> like<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.640> x-axis<00:02:04.539> is<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
label our axes like the x-axis is the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.990 
label our axes like the x-axis is the
interest<00:02:06.579> rate<00:02:06.759> yes<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:12.459> since<00:02:12.790> we're

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
interest rate yes and since we're

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.560 
interest rate yes and since we're
drawing<00:02:13.299> a<00:02:14.010> frequency<00:02:15.010> histogram<00:02:15.549> the<00:02:15.790> y-axis

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
drawing a frequency histogram the y-axis

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.860 
drawing a frequency histogram the y-axis
is<00:02:16.600> frequency<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.790> then<00:02:18.790> we<00:02:19.060> can<00:02:19.329> title<00:02:19.750> our

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
is frequency and then we can title our

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.490 
is frequency and then we can title our
graph<00:02:20.170> as<00:02:20.440> well<00:02:20.620> introductory<00:02:22.500> interest

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
like that right next layout create graph

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.009 
like that right next layout create graph
and<00:02:34.750> there<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:35.260> is<00:02:38.819> options<00:02:39.819> what<00:02:40.569> you<00:02:40.690> can<00:02:40.870> do

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
and there it is options what you can do

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.220 
and there it is options what you can do
here<00:02:41.319> is<00:02:41.500> export<00:02:42.190> this<00:02:42.400> copy<00:02:42.819> it<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:43.720> on<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.049> so

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
here is export this copy it so on and so

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.210 
here is export this copy it so on and so
forth<00:02:44.880> when<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:45.910> export<00:02:46.630> it<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:47.380> can<00:02:47.650> save<00:02:48.040> it

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
forth when you export it you can save it

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:56.729 
forth when you export it you can save it
as<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.370> GIF<00:02:48.760> file<00:02:53.400> ok<00:02:54.780> if<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:55.930> want<00:02:56.139> to<00:02:56.260> edit<00:02:56.590> it

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
as a GIF file ok if you want to edit it

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.129 
as a GIF file ok if you want to edit it
you<00:02:57.100> can<00:02:57.310> do<00:02:57.430> that<00:02:57.459> so<00:02:58.060> if<00:02:58.150> i<00:02:58.239> want<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.540> go<00:02:58.930> back

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
you can do that so if i want to go back

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.430 
you can do that so if i want to go back
and<00:02:59.470> try<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.280> different<00:03:00.760> bin<00:03:00.940> width<00:03:01.239> like<00:03:02.200> maybe

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
and try a different bin width like maybe

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.229 
and try a different bin width like maybe
I<00:03:02.530> want<00:03:02.739> to<00:03:02.799> bin<00:03:03.010> with<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.340> one<00:03:03.549> see<00:03:03.940> what<00:03:04.030> that

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
I want to bin with the one see what that

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.650 
I want to bin with the one see what that
looks<00:03:04.510> like

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660
