all<00:01:29.310> different<00:01:29.610> colors<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.590> think<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.710> for

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
all different colors I think that for

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:32.899 
all different colors I think that for
about<00:01:31.890> twenty<00:01:32.250> five<00:01:32.369> dollars<00:01:32.700> which<00:01:32.880> is

about twenty five dollars which is

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.819 
about twenty five dollars which is

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
probably most reasonable price I think

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.340
