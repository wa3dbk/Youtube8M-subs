00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.790

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.790
 I just put speed and this 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.720
 appear as pieces of tetris by 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.950
 girls you know you can send me 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.170

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.680
 in happy god 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.360
 union of my seen when suddenly I 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.619
 they slow down themselves and see me a 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.600
 precipice is that it seems to separate me 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.100
 I do not like my legs, well, let's go 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.800
 to go pa lante follow torches to see that 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.230
 involved similar here also ethics 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.640
 ready outside you follow the torches 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.260
 perfect and this reminds me a little 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.850
 escape the east maps beast of Tunisia 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.280
 we have to do it for tour in plan 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.750
 to lodge with danger inside great that 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.070
 there is nothing there that can fall on us 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.020
 mouth is worth this is the typical leap that 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.670
 I have to do like skirting to not 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.670
 eat nothing perfect vers 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.730
 and they gave me a lot because as in 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.920
 any course of the year 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.240
 in a moment I buy myself I 'm not with 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.430
 the great and if you ended up falling method 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.810
 victim routed from parkour good 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.340
 tell you that the map is short 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.020
 but no yes I hope you like what 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.640
 you are seeing by mental disposition both 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.620
 because and good guys I've also 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.940
 finished yarber without notice has been a 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.700
 of the series that I have enjoyed the most 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.500
 because they reminded me so much where 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.280
 joel aquino that very little boy follows the 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.280
 perfect way 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.360
 how I like these maps from having 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.990
 jumps scan I have the jump be 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.990
 increased 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.010
 although I have left the sea and it does not give me 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.709
 nor account that will dictate points out 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.420
 has to do ramsey versa and therefore 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.989
 what styles I do not know if you've seen in 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.610
 later or before a video says that it 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.170
 call week scope simulator if you do not 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.150
 you'll see later and I think it 's going to 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.360
 molar a lot because it is that it is one of 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.350
 those of the type of video that I most 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.640
 like at youtube level that in the 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.989
 I distribute the ass of kings and we 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.340
 recommended for youtube is so that 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.050
 see and because they really are great 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.110
 this test is the hardest of all 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.640
 are you going to handle a little oh my god 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.200
 I think this is for cool with several and 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.790
 what guys ready because gentlemen and 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.230
 to end up as half smoked drugged 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.850
 we go there these rapids of the 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.470
 segment all mario maximum correct 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.370
 to walk is worth this center with doing 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.370
 extremely jumping 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.820
 dizzy is going to be epic 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.820
 these 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.290
 and with filtered in plan I want to fall 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.030
 I want to do it professionally we are going to 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.569
 see this you can jump like this normal 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.569
 It's technical 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.000
 and also tell you that it's going to come out on the 12th 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.180
 September the naruto game I think 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.980
 that I fall to the final leap if I 've passed 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.109
 all this dizzy audio audio and 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.940
 stylistic I'm proud of the album and 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.590
 acts passed all this with everything with 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.880

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.330
 of naruto that has a desire or 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.100
