00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
second chance it bypasses the second

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.539 
second chance it bypasses the second
chance<00:01:20.759> perk<00:01:21.360> when<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.229> enemy<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.590> killed<00:01:22.770> so

two<00:01:57.960> missiles<00:01:58.320> with<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.649> thing<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.100> it's<00:01:59.219> a

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
two missiles with this thing and it's a

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.270 
two missiles with this thing and it's a
it<00:02:00.180> doesn't<00:02:00.719> lock<00:02:00.840> on<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.200> enemy<00:02:01.710> aircraft<00:02:02.070> but

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
it doesn't lock on to enemy aircraft but

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.940 
it doesn't lock on to enemy aircraft but
it's<00:02:02.700> basically<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.090> free<00:02:03.360> fire<00:02:03.770> launcher<00:02:04.770> that

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
it's basically a free fire launcher that

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.660 
it's basically a free fire launcher that
can<00:02:05.130> fight<00:02:05.340> towards<00:02:05.990> towards<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.140> enemy<00:02:07.350> team

can fight towards towards the enemy team

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.100 
can fight towards towards the enemy team
obviously<00:02:08.670> when<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.119> guy<00:02:09.539> gets<00:02:09.690> killed<00:02:09.959> by

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
obviously when a guy gets killed by

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.050 
obviously when a guy gets killed by
rocket-propelled<00:02:10.590> grenade<00:02:11.190> there's<00:02:11.459> no

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
rocket-propelled grenade there's no

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.990 
rocket-propelled grenade there's no
and<00:02:12.239> chances<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.900> if<00:02:13.200> on<00:02:13.410> smithereens<00:02:14.010> so

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
and chances is if on smithereens so

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.059 
and chances is if on smithereens so
let's<00:02:15.569> move<00:02:15.720> on<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:15.930> equipment<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.680> grenades

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
let's move on to equipment and grenades

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.240 
let's move on to equipment and grenades
now<00:02:17.819> we're<00:02:18.150> out<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.510> frag<00:02:18.900> in<00:02:19.050> semtex<00:02:19.290> there's

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
now we're out of frag in semtex there's

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.339 
now we're out of frag in semtex there's
probably<00:02:20.489> an<00:02:21.060> equal<00:02:21.360> choice<00:02:21.540> between<00:02:21.720> any<00:02:22.080> but

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349
