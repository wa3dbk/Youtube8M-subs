you<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.320> do<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.680> without<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.219> interface<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.760> a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
you can do it without the interface of a

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.459 
you can do it without the interface of a
mouse<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.570> do<00:00:51.750> object<00:00:52.110> recognition<00:00:54.110> how<00:00:55.110> about

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
tip and lead under the screen our

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.380 
tip and lead under the screen our
cameras<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.369> can<00:01:11.490> actually<00:01:11.880> see<00:01:12.180> what

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
cameras that can actually see what

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.670 
cameras that can actually see what
you're<00:01:12.570> touching<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.110> then<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> computer

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
you're touching and then the computer

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.210 
you're touching and then the computer
reacts<00:01:14.159> creating<00:01:14.850> an<00:01:14.970> image<00:01:15.350> there<00:01:16.350> we<00:01:16.439> go<00:01:16.590> and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
reacts creating an image there we go and

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.190 
reacts creating an image there we go and
again<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.909> just<00:01:18.060> put<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.270> down<00:01:18.299> here<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.750> it

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
again we just put it down here and it

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.590 
again we just put it down here and it
spills<00:01:19.470> out<00:01:19.590> photos<00:01:20.130> not<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.580> prompt<00:01:21.000> see<00:01:21.270> it's

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
spills out photos not a prompt see it's

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.359 
spills out photos not a prompt see it's
like<00:01:21.810> you're<00:01:22.020> magically<00:01:22.590> drawn<00:01:22.890> out<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.220> your

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
like you're magically drawn out of your

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.149 
like you're magically drawn out of your
digital<00:01:23.759> camera<00:01:23.820> into<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.720> box<00:01:25.159> wirelessly

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
digital camera into the box wirelessly

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.340 
digital camera into the box wirelessly
of<00:01:26.369> course<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.000> now<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.240> can<00:01:27.420> grab<00:01:27.570> photos<00:01:27.990> and

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
of course so now you can grab photos and

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.770 
of course so now you can grab photos and
I<00:01:28.439> grab<00:01:28.680> photos<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.189> we<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.460> bit<00:01:30.240> bigger<00:01:30.630> so

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
I grab photos and we can bit bigger so

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.350 
I grab photos and we can bit bigger so
it's<00:01:31.290> all<00:01:31.439> our<00:01:31.650> white<00:01:31.890> table<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.640> case<00:01:32.909> in

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
it's all our white table in this case in

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.240 
it's all our white table in this case in
this<00:01:33.570> case<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.530> we've<00:01:34.680> used<00:01:34.920> those

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
this case it is and so we've used those

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.710 
this case it is and so we've used those
different<00:01:35.610> attributes<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.299> surface

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720
