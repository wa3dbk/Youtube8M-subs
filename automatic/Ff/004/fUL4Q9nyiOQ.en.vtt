00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.090
 hello welcome saun as in the tutorial 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.180
 Today I will show you how to make a 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.779
 papyrus bat flexia 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.369
 we will need a paper size din a4 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:29.560
 we will take this end and we will take it 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.560
 here forming a triangle 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.440
 and this remaining rectangle what 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.440
 we will remember with scissors 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.829
 all 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.899
 we will open 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.630
 and now we will mark another triangle and 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.130
 advance down 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.130
 joining the two tips 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.210
 A) Yes 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.350
 now we will look at the triangle of this 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.390
 way and more 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.390
 we will enter the tips inwards 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:24.740
 making it stand out that protrude 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.860
 one part and we will mark it was as if it were 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.650
 a boat 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.150
 now we are interested in being born here 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:37.420
 mark this line 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.420
 and this line the mark of we will do so 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.260
 I have formulated 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:48.020
 bale 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.020
 and the same as doing that 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.520
 we already have these two lines and now 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.490
 we have two more lines but parallel 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.890
 one more than inside also more accident 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.399
 to more or less means that do not have in 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.399
 the routes 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.970
 we will check if we have been left 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.970
 very well marked 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.569
 we have defined here and now we are going 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.569
 to 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.010
 OK 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.760
 we have 4 lines 1 2 3 and 4 although we do not know 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.760
 see very well here 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.409
 we will talk 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.409
 for these two girls like this 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.209
 and I accepted 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.430
 at the evening we will look 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.970
 the two blue tips like that 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.950
 I dont know 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.060

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.060
