Harry<00:00:53.100> Potter<00:00:53.190> blu-ray<00:00:53.940> DVDs<00:00:55.730> but<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:57.000> one<00:00:57.239> I

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
Harry Potter blu-ray DVDs but this one I

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.770 
Harry Potter blu-ray DVDs but this one I
got<00:00:57.660> off<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.949> Warner<00:00:58.949> Brothers<00:00:59.309> which<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.480> it's

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
got off of Warner Brothers which is it's

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.820 
got off of Warner Brothers which is it's
actually<00:01:01.109> called<00:01:01.260> WB<00:01:01.949> shop<00:01:02.250> calm<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.530> I<00:01:04.530> think

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
actually called WB shop calm and I think

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.340 
actually called WB shop calm and I think
it<00:01:04.920> was<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> little<00:01:05.129> bit<00:01:05.309> more<00:01:05.430> expensive

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
it was a little bit more expensive

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.899 
it was a little bit more expensive
except<00:01:07.350> for<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.650> day<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.250> bought<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.790> I

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
except for the day that I bought it I

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.480 
except for the day that I bought it I
think<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.479> price<00:01:09.689> went<00:01:09.960> down<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.500> was

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
think the price went down and that was

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.109 
think the price went down and that was
when<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.640> bought<00:01:11.939> it

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
when I bought it

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.100 
when I bought it
and<00:01:13.189> this<00:01:14.189> didn't<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.850> was<00:01:15.060> shocked<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.869> did

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
and this didn't I was shocked this did

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.870 
and this didn't I was shocked this did
not<00:01:16.350> come<00:01:16.409> with<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.979> glass<00:01:17.220> case<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:19.640> which<00:01:20.640> i

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
not come with the glass case and which i

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.520 
not come with the glass case and which i
think<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.270> better<00:01:21.450> because<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:22.080> way<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.259> can

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
think is better because this way you can

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.320 
think is better because this way you can
get<00:01:22.770> real<00:01:22.950> close<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.430> without<00:01:23.610> being<00:01:23.820> you

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
get real close to it without being you

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.810 
get real close to it without being you
know<00:01:24.420> stopped<00:01:25.229> by<00:01:25.500> black<00:01:25.770> air<00:01:26.159> by<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> glass

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
know stopped by black air by a glass

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.600 
know stopped by black air by a glass
case<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:28.229> didn't<00:01:28.439> comes<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.829> DVDs<00:01:29.280> which

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
case and it didn't comes the DVDs which

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.179 
case and it didn't comes the DVDs which
I<00:01:29.850> already<00:01:29.939> have<00:01:30.240> them<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:31.140> think<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.040> your

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
I already have them so I think of your

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.770 
I already have them so I think of your
Harry<00:01:32.369> Potter<00:01:32.579> fan<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.000> already<00:01:33.360> have<00:01:33.570> them

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
Harry Potter fan you already have them

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.319 
Harry Potter fan you already have them
so<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.079> don't<00:01:34.229> need<00:01:34.549> the<00:01:35.549> blu-ray<00:01:35.880> DVDs

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
so you don't need the blu-ray DVDs

so you don't need the blu-ray DVDs

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
the glue right here the glue from where

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.600 
the glue right here the glue from where
they<00:03:00.000> stuck<00:03:00.270> this<00:03:00.480> into<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.780> ground<00:03:01.070> so<00:03:02.070> kind

they stuck this into the ground so kind

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.610 
they stuck this into the ground so kind
of<00:03:02.670> run<00:03:02.790> over<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.120> dried<00:03:03.390> but<00:03:03.810> at<00:03:04.110> least<00:03:04.350> it's

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
of run over and dried but at least it's

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.980 
of run over and dried but at least it's
clear<00:03:05.070> pretty<00:03:05.520> much<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:06.240> know<00:03:06.330> I'm<00:03:06.390> saying<00:03:06.630> at

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
clear pretty much you know I'm saying at

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.530 
clear pretty much you know I'm saying at
least<00:03:07.140> it's<00:03:07.500> not<00:03:07.560> black<00:03:08.460> glue<00:03:08.760> which<00:03:09.090> I<00:03:09.360> don't

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
least it's not black glue which I don't

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.510 
least it's not black glue which I don't
even<00:03:09.780> think<00:03:10.050> that's<00:03:10.140> possible<00:03:10.620> anyway<00:03:11.190> um

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
even think that's possible anyway um

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.210 
even think that's possible anyway um
there's<00:03:12.480> some<00:03:12.690> green<00:03:12.960> paint<00:03:13.320> on<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.710> sides<00:03:13.950> of

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
roof um think that oh wait over here on

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.540 
roof um think that oh wait over here on
the<00:03:23.400> Great<00:03:23.550> Hall<00:03:24.230> there's<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.320> I<00:03:25.710> guess<00:03:26.430> you

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
could call it a spike but anyway it's

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.960 
could call it a spike but anyway it's
broken<00:03:28.200> off<00:03:28.440> it's<00:03:28.890> missing<00:03:29.250> here<00:03:29.460> this<00:03:29.820> one

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
broken off it's missing here this one

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.990 
broken off it's missing here this one
right<00:03:30.060> here<00:03:30.240> and<00:03:31.280> it's<00:03:32.280> not<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.460> big<00:03:32.610> deal<00:03:32.790> and

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
right here and it's not a big deal and

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.720 
right here and it's not a big deal and
I'm<00:03:33.540> not<00:03:33.750> really<00:03:33.870> worried<00:03:34.170> about<00:03:34.200> it<00:03:34.730> that

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
I'm not really worried about it that

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.460
