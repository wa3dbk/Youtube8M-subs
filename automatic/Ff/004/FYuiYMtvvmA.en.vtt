so<00:06:04.810> when<00:06:04.960> we<00:06:05.020> place<00:06:05.230> the<00:06:05.410> shorts<00:06:05.770> here<00:06:05.950> we

always place items that can be worn or
mix-and-match<00:06:08.320> nearby<00:06:08.920> so<00:06:09.430> for<00:06:09.610> example<00:06:10.030> I

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
mix-and-match nearby so for example I

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.380
