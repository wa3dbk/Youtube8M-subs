then<00:01:44.330> we're<00:01:44.450> going<00:01:44.540> to<00:01:44.600> do<00:01:44.810> a<00:01:44.840> blintz<00:01:45.380> pace<00:01:45.680> by

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
then we're going to do a blintz pace by

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.800 
then we're going to do a blintz pace by
taking<00:01:46.340> each<00:01:46.520> of<00:01:46.700> these<00:01:46.850> four<00:01:47.210> points<00:01:47.689> and

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
taking each of these four points and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.230 
taking each of these four points and
folding<00:01:48.380> it<00:01:48.530> towards<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:48.979> center<00:01:49.159> go<00:01:50.030> around

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
folding it towards the center go around

00:01:50.240 --> 00:02:00.100 
folding it towards the center go around
and<00:01:50.360> do<00:01:50.479> all<00:01:50.689> four<00:01:51.110> sides

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.110 

once<00:02:00.800> you<00:02:00.890> get<00:02:01.010> all<00:02:01.160> four<00:02:01.370> sides<00:02:01.610> folded<00:02:02.030> to

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
once you get all four sides folded to

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.760 
once you get all four sides folded to
the<00:02:02.180> center<00:02:02.540> I'm<00:02:02.630> going<00:02:02.690> to<00:02:02.840> take<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.530> right

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
the center I'm going to take the right

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.370 
the center I'm going to take the right
side<00:02:04.280> here<00:02:04.760> roll<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:05.600> over<00:02:05.720> so<00:02:05.990> that<00:02:06.050> it<00:02:06.200> goes

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
side here roll it over so that it goes

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.080 
side here roll it over so that it goes
right<00:02:06.500> into<00:02:07.010> the<00:02:07.160> center<00:02:07.460> you<00:02:07.670> can<00:02:07.760> get<00:02:07.910> that

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
right into the center you can get that

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.999 
right into the center you can get that
edge<00:02:08.300> lined<00:02:08.869> up<00:02:09.050> with<00:02:09.200> those<00:02:09.380> points<00:02:09.740> there<00:02:09.920> in

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
edge lined up with those points there in

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.510 
edge lined up with those points there in
the<00:02:10.070> middle

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
the middle

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.360 
the middle
okay<00:02:10.940> good<00:02:11.180> crease<00:02:11.480> here<00:02:11.780> turn<00:02:12.770> it<00:02:12.860> around<00:02:12.950> and

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
okay good crease here turn it around and

okay good crease here turn it around and
do<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:13.580> same<00:02:13.790> thing<00:02:14.030> on<00:02:14.120> this<00:02:14.300> side<00:02:14.360> too<00:02:14.840> just

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
do the same thing on this side too just

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.930 
do the same thing on this side too just
make<00:02:15.380> sure<00:02:15.680> all<00:02:15.710> everything<00:02:16.160> folds<00:02:16.520> over<00:02:16.640> good

you don't get any funky creases open up
both<00:02:20.570> of<00:02:20.750> these<00:02:20.870> sides<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.710> should<00:02:21.740> get<00:02:21.950> these

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
both of these sides you should get these

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.070 
both of these sides you should get these
little<00:02:22.280> flaps<00:02:22.520> and<00:02:22.850> stick<00:02:23.090> up<00:02:23.240> take<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.780> hold<00:02:23.990> of

in these little flaps serve as the
bottom<00:03:04.700> part<00:03:04.940> at<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.120> inside<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.720> box<00:03:06.010> I'm

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
bottom part at the inside of the box I'm

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.620 
bottom part at the inside of the box I'm
just<00:03:07.220> gonna<00:03:07.310> push<00:03:07.670> down<00:03:07.700> everything<00:03:08.390> here<00:03:08.540> I'm

pushing<00:03:09.050> on<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.290> sides<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:09.769> lifting<00:03:10.220> up<00:03:10.370> from

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
pushing on the sides and lifting up from

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.850 
pushing on the sides and lifting up from
the<00:03:10.760> bottom<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:11.269> collapse<00:03:12.080> things<00:03:12.410> on<00:03:12.709> the

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
the bottom to collapse things on the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.199 
the bottom to collapse things on the
creases<00:03:13.250> they're<00:03:13.430> already<00:03:13.700> there

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
creases they're already there

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.150 
creases they're already there
and<00:03:14.600> you<00:03:14.810> can<00:03:14.959> just<00:03:15.080> tuck<00:03:15.380> this<00:03:15.590> down<00:03:15.650> to

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
and you can just tuck this down to

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.780 
and you can just tuck this down to
create<00:03:16.580> a<00:03:16.610> finished<00:03:17.269> edge<00:03:17.930> to<00:03:18.440> our<00:03:18.530> box<00:03:18.790> I'll

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
create a finished edge to our box I'll

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.100 
create a finished edge to our box I'll
do<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.030> same<00:03:20.209> thing<00:03:20.269> here<00:03:20.630> again<00:03:20.720> we're<00:03:20.959> just

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
do the same thing here again we're just

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.449 
do the same thing here again we're just
pushing<00:03:21.320> on<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:21.709> sides<00:03:21.980> because<00:03:22.190> there's

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
pushing on the sides because there's

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.520 
pushing on the sides because there's
already<00:03:22.610> a<00:03:22.790> crease<00:03:23.060> there<00:03:23.090> allowing<00:03:24.080> this<00:03:24.290> to

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
already a crease there allowing this to

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.830 
already a crease there allowing this to
fold<00:03:24.860> in<00:03:25.100> and<00:03:25.340> up<00:03:25.459> do<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.209> same<00:03:26.420> thing<00:03:26.600> on<00:03:26.720> this

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
fold in and up do the same thing on this
