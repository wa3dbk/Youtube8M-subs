00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.089
 Yes 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.269
 Let's take a look at the state laws that come out of 10cm. 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.440
 4 What you should pay attention to 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.660
 Giving it the rhythm gonna cut Tianshan so try holding the Meiji assembly 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:25.030
 I'll do it 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:31.890
 Yes a lie to me 2 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:31.890
 It's a bit early lead coming hageteupnida 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:41.390
 c # - m will do it for you 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:43.250
 De coming 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.930
 I'll come soon. 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:52.880
 Yes yes oo 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:55.430
 Let's study the two phrases and try to play the clause on it. 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:01:01.840
 Thank you. 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.840
 Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.900
 Next, Sean- 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:20.600
 The crew 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:23.600
 I will enter the connection technique at the part where the foreign wood is in one word. 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:28.690
 I'll make a drop slowly. 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.690
 Yes Yes Yes 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.180
 I'll come soon. 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.360
 Flying lead LE 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.360
 4 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:50.940
 4, the code word to the team using the end c7 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:53.000
 I'll try to connect it . Yes Yes 2 2 2 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.000
 Yes 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:07.970
 Next comes the part from the bridges that preceded the chorus 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.929
 Let's take a look at the law #-holding m's slowly 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:15.060
 I'll do it 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:18.599
 Yes Yes Yes Yes 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.749
 We will continue to ensure the following code f # code 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.749
 Yes 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:31.590
 Love code b major Shem 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:38.569
 Let's take a look at the state law that was used in the same secret law bullet book. 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.569
 In Example 5, 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:52.189
 Let's try connecting the code to the four bars. 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:52.189
 For example, in the dl 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.010
 Oh yeah 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:05.740
 Next, let me take the code from the cross section and slow it down. 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.340
 I'll do it 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:17.530
 I'm glad that you used it in the bulls section here. 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:22.140
 It is almost similar to ae2, 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.140
 By adding two more eighth notes 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:31.580
 222 so I will try it again like this application 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:35.620
 Slowly c # - I will plaster it 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.620
 Flying lead 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:48.320
 Let's take a look at the code f # 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:51.550
 Yes , I bought the following code b major. 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.550
 Oh yeah 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:04:01.380
 We will guarantee the Le Mousse Minor code. 

00:03:57.249 --> 00:04:06.260
 4 222 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.260
 Let me change the code and play it. 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.830
 Thank you. 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.840
 I will finish the state law explanation above
