00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.089
 marvin um ruby from the very best against 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.420

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.480
 remember the name that is coming 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.989
 often for the first time but again provides for 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.420
 a highlight 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.680
 who did not know marvin omu how 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.870

 the other side despite contact 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.890
 sent from a total of completed munich 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.260
 the first quarter better and plays 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.070
 A brief 19 14 guide to the end 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.600

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.580
 continue to play well for the audience 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.590
 in the second quarter, the ball becomes 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.610
 played and david kreiner joins in 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.600

 marvin ogunjimi for three bingo and 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.409
 seems to have found fun in it 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.020
 because right after that, the bell rings 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.470
 from the outside of the men on the other 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.909

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.290
 He was the topscorer of the game on Ulmer 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.070
 page with twelve points and eight 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.500
 rebounds 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.030
 but everything stays strong 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.100
 Beyschlag patiently plays the bag 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.720
 roll is waiting for the gap and with the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.930

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.369
 gets sent out of the way 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.640
 the second half starts almost like that 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.350
 First , a little less spectacular 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.329

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:04.290
 Nevertheless it was a bitter cup check as it was 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.810
 the name marvin offensive that should 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.729
 sometimes someone to say if bank 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.649

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.080
 concludes with contact he comes at the end 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.030
 at ten points and seven rebounds 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.890

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.569
