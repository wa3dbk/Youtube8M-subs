00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.760
 hello everyone today I bring you a trick in 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.790
 know ticos in the extinction mode 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.080
 it's just at the beginning of the map 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.820
 ok as you are seeing these are the 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.439
 stairs from the beginning there where 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.480
 we bought the first weapon let's say what 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.460
 what is there to buy is worth nothing else 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.980
 the first hive just after the start 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.840
 map you have some stairs and here is 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.900
 this railing here is worth as you see 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.840
 here I try to put myself but there I fall 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.489
 ok you have to put us here 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.320
 you drop a little but with a lot 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.570
 careful, there must be a 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.809
 sort of outgoing there on the ledge 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.580
 it's worth just here and when you 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.350
 stay here do not stay here if you 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.000
 you stay here the bugs will jump what 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.269
 you have to do is put the joystick to 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.040
 90 forward is worth when you put the 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.360
 joystick forward as if they walk 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.320
 socially and a little to the 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.610
 right vale 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.049
 little by little a little bit at a time 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.119
 so that not to fall because if not 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.130
 you want below and we have to get 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.780
 just behind the jerry can 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.790
 right here as you see has done with 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.920
 an apex of descent as if 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.540
 lowered some steps worth you can throw 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.400
 even a little bit more just in case 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.200
 worth anything to us from the 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.300
 bugs since according to how I put you like this 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.280
 they give you but if you get well 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.560
 none like I'm seeing the bugs 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.540
 they climb up here they stay out there 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.100
 they go back down they go up again and they 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.510
 create a loop there with the bugs not 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.340
 they stop going up and down all the time there 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.080
 As you can see, I just hit one. 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.310
 because it was not well placed but I 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.980
 I would have to put a little more to the 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.550
 right just a little bit better and good 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.960
 is a trick as I say simple but 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.670
 The same time is difficult because 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.740
 costs a bit different principle catch the 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.050
 point until you stand there in the 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.960
 site is worth it and then once you're here 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.640
 Well, what is normal 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.620
 always good as I said in the others 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.330
 above tricks do not let that 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.010
 accumulate the bugs that accumulate 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.140
 too much those who are in the background 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.260
 will rise just above that barrel 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.990
 and they will beat us, it's not like zombies 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.610
 you know that here if you do not stick the 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.290
 touches are not going to throw us but if not 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.330
 they stick a few yes they can us 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.120
 push and make us fall down is worth 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.190
 so well basically this is not there 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.860
 more than this in the trick is a kind 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.140
 of years processes with function as already 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.490
 I said in the previous video and good 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.960
 basically this is so I do not expect anything 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.310
 that you liked already liked to vote me 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.810
 like favorites and see you 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.810
 the next video greetings to all 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.739
 no no 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.020
 in the summer 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.770
