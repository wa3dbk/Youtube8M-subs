old-school Sheamus fan I know that
sounds<00:02:53.240> odd<00:02:54.280> considering<00:02:55.280> is<00:02:55.430> being<00:02:55.610> in<00:02:55.850> the

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
sounds odd considering is being in the

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.180 
sounds odd considering is being in the
WWE<00:02:56.690> year<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:56.959> a<00:02:56.990> half<00:02:57.110> but<00:02:57.230> if<00:02:57.350> you<00:02:57.440> are<00:02:57.590> you

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
WWE year and a half but if you are you

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.420 
WWE year and a half but if you are you
will<00:02:58.310> recognize<00:02:58.790> that<00:02:59.000> move<00:03:00.160> Sheamus<00:03:01.160> has<00:03:01.190> had

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
will recognize that move Sheamus has had

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.370 
will recognize that move Sheamus has had
a<00:03:01.459> real<00:03:01.730> quick<00:03:02.030> rise<00:03:02.270> to<00:03:02.510> fame<00:03:02.720> and<00:03:03.020> I<00:03:03.080> think<00:03:03.290> if

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
a real quick rise to fame and I think if

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.580 
a real quick rise to fame and I think if
he<00:03:04.240> kicks<00:03:05.240> Roddy<00:03:05.510> Piper's<00:03:05.870> ass<00:03:06.110> here<00:03:06.380> a<00:03:06.410> little

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
he kicks Roddy Piper's ass here a little

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.500 
he kicks Roddy Piper's ass here a little
bit<00:03:06.770> that<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:07.550> know<00:03:07.760> this<00:03:07.940> might<00:03:08.090> help<00:03:08.209> propel

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
bit that you know this might help propel

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.120 
bit that you know this might help propel
him<00:03:08.630> even<00:03:08.810> further<00:03:08.930> yeah<00:03:09.650> I<00:03:09.709> think<00:03:09.800> so

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
him even further yeah I think so

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.770 
him even further yeah I think so
although<00:03:10.400> that's<00:03:10.700> all<00:03:10.940> gonna<00:03:11.090> be<00:03:11.150> easier<00:03:11.510> said

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
although that's all gonna be easier said

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.810 
although that's all gonna be easier said
than<00:03:11.900> done<00:03:12.190> command<00:03:13.190> with<00:03:13.340> a<00:03:13.370> kilt<00:03:13.670> has

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
than done command with a kilt has

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.490 
than done command with a kilt has
nothing<00:03:14.120> to<00:03:14.209> lose<00:03:14.500> I<00:03:16.810> think<00:03:17.810> it's<00:03:18.200> really

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
nothing to lose I think it's really

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.990 
nothing to lose I think it's really
important<00:03:18.800> to<00:03:18.830> kind<00:03:19.010> of<00:03:19.160> reiterate<00:03:19.610> to<00:03:19.910> the
