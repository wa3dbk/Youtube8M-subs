testing<00:01:08.970> i'm<00:01:09.090> not<00:01:09.270> sure<00:01:09.420> what's<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
testing i'm not sure what's the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.929 
testing i'm not sure what's the
difference<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.320> feel<00:01:11.010> like<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.250> will<00:01:11.369> probably

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
difference I feel like it will probably

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.649 
difference I feel like it will probably
be<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.479> same<00:01:12.750> i'm<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.619> sure<00:01:13.700> but<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.479> I

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
be the same i'm not sure but this is I

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.210 
be the same i'm not sure but this is I
think<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.110> going<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.380> be<00:01:16.500> big<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.950> same

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
think this is going to be big the same

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.270 
think this is going to be big the same
testing<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.229> Timothy<00:01:19.229> Bradley<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.920> Juan

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
some drug drug testing issues that were

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.810 
some drug drug testing issues that were
Timothy<00:01:30.869> Bradley<00:01:31.079> wanted<00:01:31.799> vada<00:01:32.040> he<00:01:32.490> wanted

the voluntary anti-doping Association
while<00:01:36.740> Marquez<00:01:37.740> didn't<00:01:38.189> want<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.579> and

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
while Marquez didn't want that and

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.929 
while Marquez didn't want that and
instead<00:01:39.659> they<00:01:39.869> were<00:01:39.900> able<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.640> come<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.850> an

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
instead they were able to come to an

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.760 
instead they were able to come to an
agreement<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.780> Nevada<00:01:43.320> State<00:01:43.619> Athletic

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
agreement that the Nevada State Athletic

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.649 
agreement that the Nevada State Athletic

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.389 
Commission will do the drug testing for
that<00:01:45.899> fight<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.710> guess<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.159> same

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
that fight so I guess it's the same

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.340 
that fight so I guess it's the same
thing<00:01:47.430> here<00:01:47.880> i'm<00:01:48.119> not<00:01:48.270> sure<00:01:48.479> if<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.290> same

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
thing here i'm not sure if it's the same

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.749 
thing here i'm not sure if it's the same
thing<00:01:49.590> like<00:01:50.009> i<00:01:50.070> said<00:01:50.220> i'm<00:01:50.280> not<00:01:50.399> sure<00:01:50.520> if<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
thing like i said i'm not sure if the

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.030 
thing like i said i'm not sure if the
same<00:01:50.970> kind<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.329> drug<00:01:51.570> testing<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.170> vada<00:01:52.680> or

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
same kind of drug testing that vada or

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.830 
same kind of drug testing that vada or
you<00:01:53.250> set<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.490> performance<00:01:54.090> but<00:01:54.409> i<00:01:56.509> have<00:01:57.509> no<00:01:57.719> idea

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
you set a performance but i have no idea

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.959 
you set a performance but i have no idea
but<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.770> i<00:01:58.920> guess<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.250> do<00:01:59.369> i<00:01:59.399> guess<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.820> will<00:01:59.909> be

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
but it i guess it do i guess it will be

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.030 
but it i guess it do i guess it will be
somewhat<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:00.960> same<00:02:01.079> thing<00:02:01.560> that's<00:02:01.799> my

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
somewhat of the same thing that's my

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.609 
somewhat of the same thing that's my
best<00:02:02.250> guess<00:02:02.430> i'm<00:02:02.820> not<00:02:03.000> sure<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.450> i'm<00:02:04.259> not<00:02:04.409> i'm

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
best guess i'm not sure but i'm not i'm

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.020 
best guess i'm not sure but i'm not i'm
not<00:02:04.649> really<00:02:04.950> like<00:02:05.189> an<00:02:05.340> expert<00:02:05.759> when<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:05.939> comes

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
not really like an expert when it comes

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.570 
not really like an expert when it comes
to<00:02:06.329> drug<00:02:06.540> testing<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.110> all<00:02:07.170> her<00:02:07.320> stuff<00:02:07.649> but

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
to drug testing and all her stuff but

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.279 
to drug testing and all her stuff but
yeah<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.539> just<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.750> good<00:02:09.929> thing<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.259> know

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
yeah this is just a good thing to know

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.250 
yeah this is just a good thing to know
that<00:02:10.530> there<00:02:10.679> will<00:02:10.860> be<00:02:10.890> drug<00:02:11.280> testing<00:02:12.260> even

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
that there will be drug testing even

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.910
