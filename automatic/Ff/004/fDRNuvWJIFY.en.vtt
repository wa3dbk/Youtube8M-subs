00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:10.170
 hello again by ultrabook pictures 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.540
 youtube channel from ultrabook king.de 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.260
 Now in hands-on we have an asus tai 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:20.380
 chi so an ultrabook convertible 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.510
 this ultrabook convertible will do that 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.620
 concept followed by two screens 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:30.160
 that means in this device in this 11,6 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.570
 inch device are two screens each 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.199
 11 6 inches installed 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.329
 here on the inside so if we have it 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:40.469
 in normal ultrabook notebook clamping 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:44.079
 shell mode operate a matte display 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.899
 ips-panel full hd resolution but what 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.449
 So no touch functionality has here 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.850
 can i use my windows despite windows 8 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.829
 finger nix start but on the 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.449
 display nothing but me 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:02.800
 need the touchpad but it is synonymous 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:06.000
 yet another display installed and 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.610
 though on this page 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.520
 the display lid so to speak at the 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.110
 now two-sided and here is one 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.180
 Touchscreen course with one 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.180
 shiny finish as always 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.080
 as well ips ips panel and as well 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:30.550
 I can do full hd resolution here 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.020
 but actually right on the device 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.300
 what the beginning of the display with my finger 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.710
 however, nothing is happening right now 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.510
 have got the device today 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.760
 so still relatively fresh in dealing with it 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.270
 but so far it makes the appearance that 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.240
 the software switching from internal 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.930
 display on the outer dispo or from the 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.380
 Inner not on the outer display 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.050
 reliable resp 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.900
 not always reliable and a bit sluggish 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.110
 works to have the switch 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.520
 here we are a kind of function key 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.520
 but do not need the fn button 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.410
 press but here I am in a 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.480
 Extra in an extra software will do so 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.849
 started and then you have it here 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.440
 upper area as you know it when 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.820
 one under windows different 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.440
 monitor or if you have different 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.650
 Monitors connected has a beamer 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.390
 or so and then the external device go 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.470
 wants something similar here 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.050
 so there are the different 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.590
 Variations switched through each time 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.390
 to press 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.250
 all you have to under order 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.710
 we confirm once have the tablet 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.230
 mode then we have the mirror mode 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.440
 that means it's the same on both 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.510
 picture can be seen on both 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.460
 screens displays and we have the 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.530
 dual screen mode then becomes the whole 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.960
 that means we see on the 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.790
 inner something different than on the outside 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.230
 old fats like they are now with two 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.660
 monitors stand side by side 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.250
 Now we want the mirror mode 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.960
 so that we are the same on both 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.730
 Now we see the display 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:02.530
 black then the picture comes again 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.530
 and now let's see if we 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.930
 Here also what you see here, we too 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.980
 So what we can do it now in the tablet 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.880
 use mode 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.420
 on this page and can here now 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.820
 It also reacts accordingly 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.140
 the touch with the finger 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.030
 So we can now, for example, the 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.040
 make instant on witty 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:29.860
 we can start the internet explorer 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.830
 and if we are in the wlan on the internet 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.290
 surfing 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.520
 nevertheless, this still works 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.989
 screen of the interior matte screens 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.330
 yes what else is there to say 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.489
 This device we have here on the 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.100
 left side the on and off switch 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.730
 Here we have a micro hdmi very much 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.640
 small 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.510
 where in the scope of supply also no adapter 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.560
 is included 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:59.680
 then we have a usb 3.0 port and 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:03.310
 the connection for the power supply on this 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.830
 side we have a combo audio port 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.570
 So for a headset microphone or 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.910
 headphones or both are all 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.150
 here we have another 3.0 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.519
 connection here we have a mini vga 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.359
 So an analog output for 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:22.620
 terminals for display devices external 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:26.740
 display devices here a loud quiet 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.630
 switch loudly and here we can 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.930
 the display completes the outer display 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.460
 turn off that is one 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.270
 Sliding switch of the two positions 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.550
 can take 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.380
 and if I put this over here now 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.330
 then the outer displays will go 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:45.850
 permanently switched off 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:48.490
 Let's see if it works then 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:52.930
 is it out there since the device is now 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:55.210
 closed is now we see here 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.200
 Of course, nothing more, but the inner one 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.700
 still displays 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:02.280
 it will probably be like this 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:05.460
 that if we work this out yes 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.720
 even though now it comes from so 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.060
 apparently even when in the mirror mode 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:15.370
 is and that makes the lid then 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:21.340
 does the inner display go out then yes 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:24.570
 this has a battery of up to 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:29.470
 Allow 5 hours to run 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:33.370
 and brings 125 kilograms on the scales 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:36.880
 Here is a metal-So 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.820
 probably the warm one here is plastic 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.960
 new here is also clear we have just 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:46.800
 display glass and here again one 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.419
 distract good as much first off the table 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.940
 you will also find more information 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:55.590
 Ultrabooks where you have a link in the 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.590
 video description finds
