00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.049
 Well, hello everyone dear friends with 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.850
 You are a skeleton, and this is already the 128th edition. 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.439
 proudly in minecraft well just 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.689
 no update will be about the cinema 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.519
 In general, by the way, the update turned out 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.350
 small is it for 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.779
 due to lack of time that is not quite 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.029
 I have no time and I built 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.040
 in a quick way and here to give rise 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.140
 now see the number of lives and 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.230
 promised to tell you just a series already 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.960
 living 19 1704 i.e. will be soon 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.480
 20 and in honor of this I want to open the second 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.780
 subway line on the Soviet and street which 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.460
 will go and you can point and turn 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.489
 increase the bus and it is possible to build 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.910
 tram but I will see it in the future 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.360
 We learn closer to 130 series she's about 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.550
 will fly on you show cinema here 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.800
 and one new residential building more precisely added 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.589
 plaza residential building here on the estimate 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.600
 cinema and here we have a candle here 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.850
 then put a candle by the way here I am 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.159
 they say I don't have garages in the city 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.210
 and someone missed his release in 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.110
 principle yes garages 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.030
 here I surveyed somewhere I do not know maybe 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.250
 be the one hundred twenty fifth edition of the stupa 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.500
 the fourth 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.900
 actually i don't remember but i surveyed 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.850
 Here is our cinema principle 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.370
 It turned out that I built very quickly and 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.150
 it turned out like a watermelon 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:33.740
 Here's a green lime cap probably 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.350
 that's the principle let's all go inside and 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.380
 let's see what we have done there is great 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.300
 I do not really control 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.220
 did on the authorship a little time was well 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.950
 Now she has some Spit where you can 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.100
 order of course takes here's aunt 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.780
 standards here with this nose breathe look 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.090
 mini cafe where we can not know there 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.509
 popcorn and semi take and so on then what 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.490
 usually take a movie but here we go 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:03.619
 further that seeks us there is a fire 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:06.170
 not that there is all the dirt shaders off and 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.869
 anyway somehow 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.300
 skype take call ringing without even knowing 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.330
 It will be a long time well, well, so here 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.780
 all show us like that 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.970
 hall in principle we have us minutes 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.120
 the seat of course that is Peter 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.000
 such that for brown seats and 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.430
 here these mouths look for tropical this is where 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.350
 people must pass well that is 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.750
 we pass down let's say instead of 5 and so 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.880
 then just dina if we sit down 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.650
 here we have a huge screen 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:43.530
 here is this little projector and connection yes and 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.500
 poke the speakers in principle here but this 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.560
 there were all updates in my city given 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.230
 release will bring together a little like at all not very 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.760
