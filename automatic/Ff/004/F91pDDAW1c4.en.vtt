how<00:00:03.959> long<00:00:04.140> should<00:00:04.290> they<00:00:04.440> wait<00:00:06.470> whenever

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
how long should they wait whenever

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.410 
how long should they wait whenever
someone<00:00:07.529> asks<00:00:07.950> me<00:00:08.250> whenever<00:00:08.610> you<00:00:08.760> ask<00:00:08.970> these

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
someone asks me whenever you ask these

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.580 
someone asks me whenever you ask these
things<00:00:09.450> about<00:00:09.840> how<00:00:09.960> long<00:00:10.080> they<00:00:10.200> should<00:00:10.380> wait<00:00:10.559> I

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
things about how long they should wait I

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.230 
things about how long they should wait I
always<00:00:10.950> think<00:00:11.099> it's<00:00:11.219> about<00:00:11.460> like<00:00:11.700> swimming

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
always think it's about like swimming

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.720 
always think it's about like swimming
like<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:12.570> wait<00:00:12.750> 45<00:00:13.410> minutes<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.009> then<00:00:14.549> you

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
like you wait 45 minutes and then you

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.700 
like you wait 45 minutes and then you
can<00:00:14.910> do<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.240> but<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.139> prolly<00:00:16.320> doesn't<00:00:16.590> make

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
can do it but that prolly doesn't make

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.750 
can do it but that prolly doesn't make
sense<00:00:16.920> so<00:00:18.590> it<00:00:19.590> depends<00:00:19.949> was<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.550> will

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
sense so it depends was the will

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.970 
sense so it depends was the will
disseminated<00:00:21.720> like<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.260> guy<00:00:22.410> lose<00:00:22.710> all<00:00:22.859> his

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
disseminated like the guy lose all his

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.650 
disseminated like the guy lose all his
stuff<00:00:23.310> because<00:00:23.550> once<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.939> will<00:00:24.119> has<00:00:24.449> been

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
stuff because once the will has been

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.040 
stuff because once the will has been
executed<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.820> know<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.119> Robins<00:00:27.510> get<00:00:27.779> all

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
executed and you know the Robins get all

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.439 
executed and you know the Robins get all
the<00:00:28.320> Wayne<00:00:28.769> Manor<00:00:29.039> stuff<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.820> penny<00:00:30.060> and

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
the Wayne Manor stuff and the penny and

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.450 
the Wayne Manor stuff and the penny and
the<00:00:30.650> dinosaur<00:00:31.650> has<00:00:31.769> already<00:00:31.920> been<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.340> know

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
the dinosaur has already been you know

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.520 
the dinosaur has already been you know
cleaned<00:00:33.030> out<00:00:33.210> like<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.540> Batcave<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.110> empty

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
cleaned out like the Batcave is empty

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.770 
cleaned out like the Batcave is empty
and<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.309> should<00:00:35.489> probably<00:00:35.610> accept<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.630> he's

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
and you should probably accept that he's

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.660 
and you should probably accept that he's
dead

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
dead

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.360 
dead
I<00:00:38.899> think<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.140> think<00:00:40.589> they<00:00:40.710> all<00:00:40.829> know<00:00:41.070> they<00:00:41.309> were

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
I think I think they all know they were

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.740 
I think I think they all know they were
coming<00:00:41.399> back<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:42.000> not<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.120> big<00:00:42.300> deal<00:00:42.329> you

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
coming back it's not a big deal you

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.720 
coming back it's not a big deal you
gotta<00:00:42.989> like<00:00:43.140> you're<00:00:43.859> bummed<00:00:44.039> out<00:00:44.190> for<00:00:44.429> like<00:00:44.519> 10

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
gotta like you're bummed out for like 10

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.020 
gotta like you're bummed out for like 10
minutes<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.179> you<00:00:45.329> just<00:00:45.480> kind<00:00:45.659> of<00:00:45.690> wait<00:00:47.030> how

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
minutes and you just kind of wait how

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.729 
minutes and you just kind of wait how
long<00:00:48.089> should<00:00:48.449> a<00:00:48.539> family<00:00:48.960> way<00:00:49.109> to<00:00:49.170> accept<00:00:49.649> that

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
long should a family way to accept that

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.799 
long should a family way to accept that
a<00:00:49.800> hero<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.190> really<00:00:50.399> dead<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.809> fictional

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
a hero is really dead in fictional

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.479 
a hero is really dead in fictional
universe<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.769> can<00:00:52.920> just<00:00:53.100> wait<00:00:53.280> forever

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
universe you can just wait forever

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.490 
universe you can just wait forever
because<00:00:54.089> none<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.659> them<00:00:54.899> are<00:00:55.019> ever<00:00:55.199> really

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
because none of them are ever really

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.950 
because none of them are ever really
dead<00:00:55.680> right<00:00:55.920> except<00:00:56.909> except<00:00:57.420> Uncle<00:00:57.659> Ben<00:00:57.780> he's

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
dead right except except Uncle Ben he's

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:08.359 
dead right except except Uncle Ben he's
dead<00:01:02.420> probably<00:01:05.689> they<00:01:06.689> should<00:01:06.930> wait<00:01:07.229> until<00:01:07.649> his

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
dead probably they should wait until his

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.109
