enjoy high-end video cards is that this
is<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> little<00:00:43.410> bit<00:00:43.530> smaller<00:00:43.860> than<00:00:44.190> some<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
is a little bit smaller than some of the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.369 
is a little bit smaller than some of the
Mars<00:00:44.700> cards<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.450> past<00:00:45.660> particularly<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
Mars cards of the past particularly the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.139 
Mars cards of the past particularly the
most<00:00:46.530> recent<00:00:47.039> one<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.160> Mars<00:00:47.489> two<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:48.000> was

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
most recent one the Mars two that was

most recent one the Mars two that was
enormous

enormous

enormous
so<00:00:49.890> as<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.430> would<00:00:50.579> indicate<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.239> Mars<00:00:51.480> 760<00:00:52.199> is

so as it would indicate the Mars 760 is

obviously<00:01:09.479> lights<00:01:09.720> up<00:01:09.930> as<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.890> would<00:01:10.979> expect

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
obviously lights up as you would expect

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.250 
obviously lights up as you would expect
on<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:12.180> back<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.630> see<00:01:12.659> some<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.080> power

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
on the back you see some of the power

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.010 
on the back you see some of the power
delivery<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.090> actually<00:01:15.450> really<00:01:15.869> like

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
delivery and this I actually really like

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.120 
delivery and this I actually really like
it<00:01:16.170> when<00:01:16.259> they<00:01:16.350> have<00:01:16.470> these<00:01:16.590> kind<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.890> back

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
it when they have these kind of back

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.010 
it when they have these kind of back
plates<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.090> rear<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.420> these<00:01:18.509> cards<00:01:18.960> that

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
plates on the rear of these cards that

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.109 
plates on the rear of these cards that
both<00:01:19.200> adds<00:01:19.470> some<00:01:19.740> stability<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.490> some

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
both adds some stability and some

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.660 
both adds some stability and some
strength<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> PCB<00:01:22.770> itself<00:01:22.890> when

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
strength to the to the PCB itself when

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.130 
strength to the to the PCB itself when
the<00:01:23.700> heat<00:01:24.030> sinks<00:01:24.299> can<00:01:24.450> kind<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.689> get<00:01:24.840> kind<00:01:25.049> of

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the heat sinks can kind of get kind of

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.800 
the heat sinks can kind of get kind of
heavy<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.759> also<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.420> think<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.630> looks

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
heavy and it also I just think it looks

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.060 
heavy and it also I just think it looks
nice<00:01:27.990> because<00:01:28.229> if<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.619> have<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> window<00:01:29.009> in

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
nice because if you have a window in

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.280 
nice because if you have a window in
your<00:01:29.100> case<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.729> what's<00:01:29.939> actually<00:01:30.810> going

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
your case this is what's actually going

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.429 
your case this is what's actually going
to<00:01:31.439> be<00:01:31.560> showing<00:01:32.329> which<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> plus<00:01:33.780> if<00:01:34.380> you

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
to be showing which is a plus if you

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.410 
to be showing which is a plus if you
look<00:01:34.560> at<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.799> output<00:01:35.220> configuration<00:01:36.090> you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
look at the output configuration you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.039 
look at the output configuration you
have<00:01:36.450> three<00:01:37.229> DVI<00:01:37.530> outputs<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.310> one<00:01:38.549> mini

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
have three DVI outputs and one mini

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.100 
have three DVI outputs and one mini
DisplayPort<00:01:40.130> which<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.400> interesting<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.210> think

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
DisplayPort which is interesting I think

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.310 
DisplayPort which is interesting I think
this<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.320> probably<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> best<00:01:44.090> configuration

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
this is probably the best configuration

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.929 
this is probably the best configuration
considering<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.500> know<00:01:46.619> most<00:01:47.310> users<00:01:47.729> are

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
considering you know most users are

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.090 
considering you know most users are
going<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:49.290> know<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> most<00:01:49.619> most<00:01:49.860> users

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
going to be you know the most most users

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.280 
going to be you know the most most users
are<00:01:50.130> still<00:01:50.280> going<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.430> have<00:01:50.490> DVI<00:01:51.290> monitors

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
are still going to have DVI monitors

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.319 
are still going to have DVI monitors
display<00:01:53.070> ports<00:01:53.520> still<00:01:53.700> there<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.149> can

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
display ports still there so you can

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.630 
display ports still there so you can
support<00:01:54.810> stuff<00:01:55.409> like<00:01:55.530> g-sync<00:01:55.979> or<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.490> can

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
support stuff like g-sync or you can

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.899

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
GTX 780 is $500 and then the Radeon r9

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.229 
GTX 780 is $500 and then the Radeon r9
290x<00:03:56.430> is<00:03:57.019> 550<00:03:58.019> so<00:03:58.650> if<00:03:59.430> you're<00:03:59.579> compared<00:03:59.910> to<00:04:00.030> say

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
290x is 550 so if you're compared to say

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.780 
290x is 550 so if you're compared to say
the<00:04:00.359> GTX<00:04:00.780> 780<00:04:01.290> you're<00:04:01.620> talking<00:04:01.859> about<00:04:01.950> $130

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
the GTX 780 you're talking about $130

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.990 
the GTX 780 you're talking about $130
mark<00:04:03.329> up<00:04:03.540> $130<00:04:04.350> higher<00:04:04.530> price<00:04:04.859> you<00:04:05.489> definitely

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
mark up $130 higher price you definitely

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.349 
mark up $130 higher price you definitely
get<00:04:06.090> better<00:04:06.239> performance<00:04:06.840> than<00:04:06.900> it<00:04:07.370> but<00:04:08.370> is<00:04:08.579> it

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
get better performance than it but is it

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.629 
get better performance than it but is it
worth<00:04:09.750> it<00:04:09.959> do<00:04:10.139> you<00:04:10.230> think<00:04:10.440> maybe<00:04:10.560> saving<00:04:10.859> $130

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
worth it do you think maybe saving $130

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.309 
worth it do you think maybe saving $130
would<00:04:11.819> be<00:04:11.970> a<00:04:12.180> better<00:04:12.420> idea<00:04:12.480> considering

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
would be a better idea considering

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.610 
would be a better idea considering
you're<00:04:13.470> getting<00:04:13.680> single<00:04:13.889> GPU<00:04:15.530> you<00:04:16.530> know

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
you're getting single GPU you know

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.020 
you're getting single GPU you know
capability<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.250> if<00:04:17.310> you<00:04:17.400> want<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.729> expand

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
capability and if you want to expand

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.759 
capability and if you want to expand
that<00:04:18.120> later<00:04:18.329> you<00:04:18.479> can<00:04:18.660> do<00:04:18.750> that<00:04:18.900> as<00:04:19.079> well<00:04:19.229> the

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
that later you can do that as well the

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.630 
that later you can do that as well the
r9<00:04:19.979> 290x<00:04:20.579> is<00:04:20.970> $80<00:04:21.750> less<00:04:21.989> than<00:04:22.800> this<00:04:23.099> card<00:04:23.400> and

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
r9 290x is $80 less than this card and

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.850 
r9 290x is $80 less than this card and
then<00:04:23.729> seven<00:04:24.120> dollars<00:04:24.360> more<00:04:24.599> for<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:24.900> 780ti<00:04:25.440> I

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
then seven dollars more for the 780ti I

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.760 
then seven dollars more for the 780ti I
think

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
think

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.930 
think
all<00:04:27.770> these<00:04:27.950> cards<00:04:28.310> are<00:04:28.430> really<00:04:28.520> meant<00:04:28.790> for

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
all these cards are really meant for

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.120 
all these cards are really meant for
different<00:04:29.060> people<00:04:29.450> that<00:04:29.570> this<00:04:30.110> has<00:04:30.500> four<00:04:30.890> gigs

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
different people that this has four gigs

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.190 
different people that this has four gigs
of<00:04:31.280> memory<00:04:31.310> on<00:04:31.700> it<00:04:31.850> and<00:04:32.000> it<00:04:32.450> runs<00:04:32.690> at<00:04:32.930> a<00:04:32.960> clock

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
of memory on it and it runs at a clock

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.500 
of memory on it and it runs at a clock
speeds<00:04:33.620> base<00:04:34.340> clock<00:04:34.550> of<00:04:34.760> a<00:04:34.820> thousand<00:04:35.210> and<00:04:35.240> six

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
speeds base clock of a thousand and six

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.170 
speeds base clock of a thousand and six
megahertz<00:04:35.960> so<00:04:36.530> it's<00:04:36.650> actually<00:04:36.950> a<00:04:36.980> fairly<00:04:37.310> fast

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
megahertz so it's actually a fairly fast

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.820 
megahertz so it's actually a fairly fast
clock<00:04:38.540> speed<00:04:38.840> but<00:04:38.990> that<00:04:39.110> 2<00:04:39.260> gigs<00:04:39.470> of<00:04:39.620> frame

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
clock speed but that 2 gigs of frame

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.590 
clock speed but that 2 gigs of frame
buffer<00:04:40.130> 2<00:04:40.460> gigs<00:04:40.670> of<00:04:40.760> memory<00:04:40.820> is<00:04:41.090> kind<00:04:41.330> of<00:04:41.450> the

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
buffer 2 gigs of memory is kind of the

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.080 
buffer 2 gigs of memory is kind of the
limiting<00:04:42.020> factor<00:04:42.550> because<00:04:43.550> it's<00:04:43.760> only<00:04:43.850> two

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
limiting factor because it's only two

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.910 
limiting factor because it's only two
it's<00:04:44.390> four<00:04:44.630> gigs<00:04:44.870> total<00:04:45.260> but<00:04:45.410> it's<00:04:45.530> two<00:04:45.680> per

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
it's four gigs total but it's two per

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.860 
it's four gigs total but it's two per
GPU<00:04:46.130> so<00:04:46.640> when<00:04:46.760> you're<00:04:46.850> running<00:04:46.940> it<00:04:47.210> say<00:04:47.420> you

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
GPU so when you're running it say you

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.770 
GPU so when you're running it say you
know<00:04:47.960> 4k<00:04:48.700> resolutions<00:04:49.700> that<00:04:50.240> can<00:04:50.540> be<00:04:50.750> a

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
know 4k resolutions that can be a

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.450 
know 4k resolutions that can be a

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
bottleneck and we solve performance

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.110 
bottleneck and we solve performance
differences<00:04:52.850> between<00:04:53.060> it<00:04:53.480> and<00:04:53.660> the<00:04:53.920> 780ti<00:04:55.120> at

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
differences between it and the 780ti at

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.660 
differences between it and the 780ti at
4k<00:04:56.450> that<00:04:56.750> we<00:04:56.840> didn't<00:04:57.140> see<00:04:57.260> at<00:04:57.350> 25<00:04:57.740> by<00:04:57.950> 14<00:04:58.430> I

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
4k that we didn't see at 25 by 14 I

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.760 
4k that we didn't see at 25 by 14 I
think<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.360> the<00:04:59.600> best<00:04:59.810> target<00:05:00.260> for<00:05:00.470> a<00:05:00.500> card

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
think the the best target for a card

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.620 
think the the best target for a card
like<00:05:00.830> this<00:05:01.130> is<00:05:01.340> a<00:05:01.730> user<00:05:02.000> that's<00:05:02.150> gaming<00:05:02.510> on<00:05:02.600> a

like this is a user that's gaming on a

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.040 
like this is a user that's gaming on a
single<00:05:02.930> panel<00:05:03.400> 2560<00:05:04.400> by<00:05:04.520> 1440<00:05:04.910> or<00:05:05.270> 2560<00:05:05.930> by

single panel 2560 by 1440 or 2560 by
1600<00:05:07.450> and<00:05:08.450> you<00:05:08.990> know<00:05:09.110> you<00:05:09.170> don't<00:05:09.380> really<00:05:09.500> have

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
1600 and you know you don't really have

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.330 
1600 and you know you don't really have
an<00:05:10.610> itch<00:05:11.030> to<00:05:11.360> go<00:05:11.660> up<00:05:11.750> to<00:05:11.930> one<00:05:12.290> of<00:05:12.380> those<00:05:12.500> 2500<00:05:13.250> or

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
an itch to go up to one of those 2500 or

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.900 
an itch to go up to one of those 2500 or
3500<00:05:13.700> dollar<00:05:14.000> 4k<00:05:14.930> monitors<00:05:15.530> quite<00:05:15.920> yet<00:05:16.220> it's

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
3500 dollar 4k monitors quite yet it's

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.120 
3500 dollar 4k monitors quite yet it's
also<00:05:17.150> the<00:05:17.870> first<00:05:18.050> Mars<00:05:18.320> card<00:05:18.650> that's<00:05:18.890> not

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
also the first Mars card that's not

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.150 
also the first Mars card that's not
limited<00:05:19.970> edition<00:05:20.360> it's<00:05:21.230> not<00:05:21.500> you<00:05:21.920> know<00:05:22.010> the

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
limited edition it's not you know the

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.100 
limited edition it's not you know the
last<00:05:22.310> one<00:05:22.430> was<00:05:22.610> $1200<00:05:23.540> I<00:05:23.660> think<00:05:23.870> when<00:05:23.990> it<00:05:24.080> was

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
last one was $1200 I think when it was

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.900 
last one was $1200 I think when it was
released<00:05:24.500> so<00:05:24.800> this<00:05:25.190> is<00:05:25.340> the<00:05:25.430> kind<00:05:25.580> of<00:05:25.640> a<00:05:25.700> Mars

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
released so this is the kind of a Mars

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.180 
released so this is the kind of a Mars
card<00:05:26.180> that<00:05:26.300> they've<00:05:26.390> built<00:05:26.600> for<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.680> masses

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
card that they've built for the masses

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.360 
card that they've built for the masses
we'll<00:05:28.820> be<00:05:28.910> curious<00:05:29.120> to<00:05:29.270> see<00:05:29.300> if<00:05:29.950> ACS<00:05:30.950> continues

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
we'll be curious to see if ACS continues

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.940 
we'll be curious to see if ACS continues
down<00:05:31.550> that<00:05:31.760> realm<00:05:32.000> of<00:05:32.590> creating<00:05:33.590> these<00:05:33.710> kind
