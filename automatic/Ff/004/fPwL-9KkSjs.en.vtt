00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
all right this video is about how to

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.120 
all right this video is about how to
draw<00:00:05.009> things<00:00:05.250> on<00:00:05.730> your<00:00:06.540> calculator<00:00:07.140> first<00:00:07.890> off

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
draw things on your calculator first off

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.250 
draw things on your calculator first off
you<00:00:08.309> need<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.519> calculator<00:00:09.019> has<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.139> be<00:00:10.230> a

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
you need a calculator has to be a

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.290 
you need a calculator has to be a
graphing<00:00:10.710> calculator<00:00:11.269> ti-83<00:00:12.269> or<00:00:13.130> higher<00:00:14.130> um

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.300 

this<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.630> graph<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.619> start<00:00:19.859> off<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.189> need

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
this is the graph to start off you need

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.000 
this is the graph to start off you need
to<00:00:20.460> turn<00:00:20.670> off<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.970> axes<00:00:21.600> which<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.710> would<00:00:22.859> do

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
to turn off the axes which you would do

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.230 
to turn off the axes which you would do
by<00:00:23.490> going<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.939> second<00:00:24.420> zoom<00:00:25.199> which<00:00:25.830> is

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
by going to second zoom which is

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.980 
by going to second zoom which is
formatting<00:00:27.439> it<00:00:28.439> would<00:00:28.590> go<00:00:28.740> down<00:00:29.119> here<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.449> X

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
formatting it would go down here to X

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.940 
formatting it would go down here to X
ease<00:00:31.470> off<00:00:31.859> hit<00:00:32.640> enter<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.649> when<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.739> hit<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
ease off hit enter and when you hit the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.319 
ease off hit enter and when you hit the
graph<00:00:35.130> they're<00:00:35.730> gone<00:00:36.829> now<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.550> actually<00:00:39.000> draw

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.479 
graph they're gone now to actually draw
things<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:40.140> have<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.320> click<00:00:40.530> second<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.370> then

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
things you have to click second and then

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.220 
things you have to click second and then
program<00:00:42.059> which<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.660> right<00:00:42.840> here<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
program which is right here in the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.340 
program which is right here in the
middle<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:44.390> there's<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.539> big<00:00:45.780> list<00:00:46.079> of

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
middle and there's this big list of

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.500 
middle and there's this big list of
things<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.399> do<00:00:47.550> then

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
things you can do then

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.770 
things you can do then
I<00:00:48.539> never<00:00:49.230> use<00:00:49.530> down<00:00:50.430> at<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.640> bottom<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.239> pen

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
I never use down at the bottom is pen

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.750 
I never use down at the bottom is pen
and<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:52.440> at<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.680> very<00:00:52.710> bottom<00:00:52.980> or<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.610> just

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
and it's at the very bottom or you just

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.110 
and it's at the very bottom or you just
click<00:00:53.910> up<00:00:54.230> you<00:00:55.230> hit<00:00:55.379> enter<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.949> now<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.910> have

click up you hit enter and now you have

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.110 
click up you hit enter and now you have
a<00:00:57.149> little<00:00:57.480> cursor<00:00:57.809> thing<00:00:58.370> to<00:00:59.370> start<00:00:59.850> drawing

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
a little cursor thing to start drawing

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.110 
a little cursor thing to start drawing
you<00:01:00.210> hit<00:01:00.390> enter<00:01:00.920> just<00:01:01.920> hit<00:01:02.039> enter<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:03.000> you

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
you hit enter just hit enter and you

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.149 
you hit enter just hit enter and you
move<00:01:03.300> your<00:01:03.480> cursor<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:04.400> move<00:01:06.380> to<00:01:07.380> draw<00:01:07.890> things

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
move your cursor to move to draw things

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.260 
move your cursor to move to draw things
I<00:01:08.400> don't<00:01:08.460> know<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:09.840> have<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.110> pen<00:01:10.320> come<00:01:10.560> up<00:01:12.080> so

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
I don't know to have the pen come up so

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.620 
I don't know to have the pen come up so
you<00:01:15.270> can<00:01:15.450> just<00:01:15.630> draw<00:01:16.080> whatever<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.560> want

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
you can just draw whatever you want

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.760 
you can just draw whatever you want
hopefully<00:01:18.630> something<00:01:18.869> more<00:01:19.200> exciting<00:01:19.590> than

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
hopefully something more exciting than

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.550 
hopefully something more exciting than
that<00:01:20.750> um<00:01:21.979> if<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.220> want<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.299> pick<00:01:25.170> up<00:01:25.350> your

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
that um if you want to pick up your

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.320 
that um if you want to pick up your
cursor<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.130> start<00:01:26.610> dragging<00:01:26.790> somewhere<00:01:27.180> else

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
cursor and start dragging somewhere else

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.380 
cursor and start dragging somewhere else
hit<00:01:27.540> enter<00:01:27.810> again<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:29.180> discontinues<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
hit enter again that discontinues the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.740 
hit enter again that discontinues the
drawing<00:01:30.659> hit<00:01:31.290> enter<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.829> start<00:01:31.890> again<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.750> you

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
drawing hit enter to start again and you

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.960 
drawing hit enter to start again and you
can<00:01:33.900> draw<00:01:34.340> again<00:01:36.110> if<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.590> mess<00:01:37.770> up<00:01:37.799> if<00:01:38.340> you

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
can draw again if you mess up if you

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.149 
can draw again if you mess up if you
accidentally<00:01:39.509> put<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.470> dot<00:01:40.740> where<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.009> don't

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
accidentally put a dot where you don't

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.160 
accidentally put a dot where you don't
want<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:42.630> go<00:01:43.310> second<00:01:44.310> program<00:01:44.729> again

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
want it to you go second program again

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.370 
want it to you go second program again
same<00:01:46.170> menu<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:47.189> move<00:01:47.430> over<00:01:47.899> 1/2<00:01:48.899> thing<00:01:49.170> that

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
same menu you move over 1/2 thing that

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.819 
same menu you move over 1/2 thing that
says<00:01:49.530> points<00:01:50.009> go<00:01:50.340> down<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.820> point<00:01:51.090> off<00:01:51.829> it

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
says points go down to point off it

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.740 
says points go down to point off it
enter<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:54.439> then<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.950> move<00:01:56.189> your<00:01:56.750> little

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
enter and then you move your little

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.620 
enter and then you move your little
cursor<00:01:58.320> over<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.280> place<00:01:59.490> where<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.180> want<00:02:00.420> to

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
cursor over the place where you want to

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.810 
cursor over the place where you want to
erase<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.409> each<00:02:01.799> time<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.250> hit<00:02:02.369> enter<00:02:02.670> it

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
erase and each time you hit enter it

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.109 
erase and each time you hit enter it
erases<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.600> dot<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.829> it's<00:02:04.979> directly<00:02:05.460> over

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.130 

so<00:02:08.239> it<00:02:09.200> would<00:02:09.379> have<00:02:09.470> raised<00:02:09.769> it<00:02:10.519> would<00:02:10.759> have

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
so it would have raised it would have

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.800 
so it would have raised it would have
erased<00:02:12.140> those<00:02:12.379> dots<00:02:12.620> right<00:02:12.860> there<00:02:13.099> and<00:02:13.810> you

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
erased those dots right there and you

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.289 
erased those dots right there and you
can<00:02:14.870> erase<00:02:15.200> as<00:02:15.590> much<00:02:16.159> as<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.400> want<00:02:16.610> but<00:02:16.909> it's

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
can erase as much as you want but it's

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.119 
can erase as much as you want but it's
not<00:02:17.420> very<00:02:17.690> efficient<00:02:18.200> it's<00:02:18.590> only<00:02:18.799> if<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:18.980> make

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
not very efficient it's only if you make

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.030 
not very efficient it's only if you make
little<00:02:19.430> mistakes<00:02:19.519> if<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:21.379> make<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.620> big

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
little mistakes if you make a big

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.680 
little mistakes if you make a big
mistake<00:02:22.069> and<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:22.700> want<00:02:22.879> to<00:02:22.940> completely<00:02:23.299> start

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
mistake and you want to completely start

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.339 
mistake and you want to completely start
over<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:24.140> go<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.349> second<00:02:25.159> program<00:02:25.610> again<00:02:26.090> and

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
over you go to second program again and

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.380 
over you go to second program again and
you<00:02:27.349> just<00:02:27.379> click<00:02:27.739> clear<00:02:28.069> draw<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:29.180> will

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
you just click clear draw and that will
