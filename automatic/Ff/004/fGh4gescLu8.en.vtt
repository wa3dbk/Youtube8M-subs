than<00:00:57.810> anything<00:00:58.200> I've<00:00:58.470> ever<00:00:58.500> heard<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.920> see<00:00:59.100> I

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
than anything I've ever heard of see I

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.520 
than anything I've ever heard of see I
was<00:00:59.820> always<00:00:59.970> taught<00:01:00.270> it's<00:01:00.630> got<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.110> have<00:01:01.290> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
was always taught it's got to have the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.850 
was always taught it's got to have the
tea<00:01:01.770> it's<00:01:02.489> got<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.970> be<00:01:03.059> made<00:01:03.300> with<00:01:04.050> tea<00:01:04.619> which

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
tea it's got to be made with tea which

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.609 
tea it's got to be made with tea which
is<00:01:05.509> camellia<00:01:06.509> sinensis<00:01:07.430> so<00:01:09.229> that's<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.380> Latin

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
is camellia sinensis so that's the Latin

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.900 
is camellia sinensis so that's the Latin
name<00:01:10.710> for<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.979> tea<00:01:11.130> leaf<00:01:11.340> right<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:11.820> they

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
name for the tea leaf right and so they

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.490 
name for the tea leaf right and so they
always<00:01:12.090> make<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.570> with<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:12.810> teas<00:01:13.020> sometimes

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
wild food so not only are the plants

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.040 
wild food so not only are the plants
that<00:02:04.170> serve<00:02:04.500> as<00:02:04.709> the<00:02:04.890> tea<00:02:05.130> leaves<00:02:05.390> wild<00:02:06.390> but<00:02:06.810> so

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
that serve as the tea leaves wild but so

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.510 
that serve as the tea leaves wild but so
is<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.410> sugar<00:02:07.649> because<00:02:07.920> we've<00:02:08.160> been<00:02:08.340> using

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
is the sugar because we've been using

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.130 
is the sugar because we've been using
maple<00:02:08.789> syrup<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.450> having<00:02:09.750> great<00:02:09.929> success

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
maple syrup and having great success

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.620 
maple syrup and having great success
with<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.580> main<00:02:11.760> sugar<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.390> people

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
with it and the the main sugar so people

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.089 
with it and the the main sugar so people
know<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.900> saccharide<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.680> course<00:02:13.890> there's

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
know the saccharide of course there's

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.500 
know the saccharide of course there's
many<00:02:14.280> different<00:02:14.430> saccharides<00:02:14.970> so<00:02:15.180> in<00:02:15.330> in

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
many different saccharides so in in

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.900 
many different saccharides so in in
honey<00:02:16.050> we've<00:02:16.260> got<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.410> lot<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.680> glucose<00:02:17.069> in<00:02:17.310> in

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
honey we've got a lot of glucose in in

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.030 
honey we've got a lot of glucose in in
fruit<00:02:18.209> we<00:02:18.300> have<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.450> lot<00:02:18.569> of<00:02:18.599> fructose<00:02:19.040> what's

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
fruit we have a lot of fructose what's

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.800 
fruit we have a lot of fructose what's
the<00:02:20.190> main<00:02:20.370> sugar<00:02:20.670> component<00:02:21.120> of<00:02:21.209> maple<00:02:21.510> syrup

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
the main sugar component of maple syrup

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.870 
the main sugar component of maple syrup
it's<00:02:22.020> sucrose<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.099> it's<00:02:23.250> basically<00:02:23.370> white

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
it's sucrose and so it's basically white

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.940 
it's sucrose and so it's basically white
sugar<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.510> has<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:25.140> lot<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.710> same

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
sugar it has a lot of the same

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.930 
sugar it has a lot of the same
properties<00:02:26.730> except<00:02:27.690> that

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
properties except that

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.360 
properties except that
has<00:02:28.240> a<00:02:28.270> lot<00:02:28.540> more<00:02:28.750> nutrients<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:30.070> get<00:02:30.250> to

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
has a lot more nutrients and you get to

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.070 
has a lot more nutrients and you get to
gather<00:02:30.580> it<00:02:30.820> yourself<00:02:31.180> right<00:02:31.330> yeah<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.870> comes

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
gather it yourself right yeah it comes

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.960 
gather it yourself right yeah it comes
from<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.290> wild<00:02:32.620> food<00:02:32.860> source<00:02:33.160> essentially<00:02:33.640> so

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
from a wild food source essentially so

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.580 
from a wild food source essentially so
and<00:02:34.270> that's<00:02:34.570> why<00:02:34.660> we<00:02:34.780> can<00:02:34.930> see<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.110> crystallized

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
and that's why we can see a crystallized

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.710 
and that's why we can see a crystallized
just<00:02:35.830> like<00:02:35.950> white<00:02:36.160> sugar<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.910> so<00:02:37.510> you've

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
just like white sugar and so you've

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.140 
just like white sugar and so you've
instead<00:02:38.290> of<00:02:38.440> using<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:39.190> white<00:02:39.430> table<00:02:39.880> sugar

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
instead of using the white table sugar

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.850 
instead of using the white table sugar
like<00:02:40.300> most<00:02:40.630> even<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.020> best<00:02:41.200> kombucha<00:02:41.620> brewers

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
like most even the best kombucha brewers

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.530 
like most even the best kombucha brewers
are<00:02:41.950> using<00:02:42.280> you're<00:02:42.640> using<00:02:42.820> maple<00:02:43.060> syrup<00:02:43.450> and

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
are using you're using maple syrup and

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.090 
are using you're using maple syrup and
now<00:02:43.600> you're<00:02:43.780> just<00:02:43.960> feeding<00:02:44.170> it<00:02:44.410> straight<00:02:44.800> in

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
now you're just feeding it straight in

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.830 
now you're just feeding it straight in
as<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.370> syrup<00:02:46.000> are<00:02:46.150> you<00:02:46.270> reducing<00:02:46.420> it

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
as a syrup are you reducing it

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.310 
as a syrup are you reducing it
essentially<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:47.950> same<00:02:48.280> amount<00:02:48.760> of<00:02:49.090> syrup<00:02:49.990> in

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
essentially the same amount of syrup in

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.730 
essentially the same amount of syrup in
by<00:02:50.770> volume<00:02:51.400> as<00:02:51.610> as<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.180> was<00:02:52.390> told<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:53.080> use<00:02:53.290> for

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
by volume as as I was told to use for

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.090 
by volume as as I was told to use for
you<00:02:54.130> know<00:02:54.250> for<00:02:54.490> white<00:02:54.670> sugar<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.890> like<00:02:56.890> I<00:02:57.040> said

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
you know for white sugar and like I said

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.890 
you know for white sugar and like I said
we're<00:02:57.460> getting<00:02:57.550> good<00:02:57.880> results<00:02:58.030> with<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:58.690> it

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
we're getting good results with it it

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.050 
we're getting good results with it it
operat<00:02:59.440> it<00:02:59.590> goes<00:02:59.770> along<00:02:59.980> perhaps<00:03:00.610> a<00:03:00.820> little

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
operat it goes along perhaps a little

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.790 
operat it goes along perhaps a little
bit<00:03:01.180> more<00:03:01.360> slowly<00:03:01.570> and<00:03:02.020> needs<00:03:02.170> an<00:03:02.320> extra<00:03:02.650> day

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
bit more slowly and needs an extra day

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.350 
bit more slowly and needs an extra day
or<00:03:02.980> two<00:03:03.040> but<00:03:03.340> that's<00:03:03.460> okay<00:03:03.820> right

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
or two but that's okay right

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.510 
or two but that's okay right
and<00:03:04.690> then<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:05.200> instead<00:03:05.770> of<00:03:05.800> using<00:03:06.070> the<00:03:06.340> tea

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
and then the instead of using the tea

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.800 
and then the instead of using the tea
leaves<00:03:06.700> which<00:03:06.910> I<00:03:07.060> was<00:03:07.180> understood<00:03:07.570> where<00:03:07.690> for

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
leaves which I was understood where for

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.630 
leaves which I was understood where for
the<00:03:07.870> caffeine<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.410> tannins<00:03:08.860> you've<00:03:09.370> used

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
the caffeine and the tannins you've used

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.310 
the caffeine and the tannins you've used
a<00:03:09.790> wild<00:03:10.180> plant<00:03:10.420> here<00:03:10.660> now<00:03:10.780> when<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.020> told<00:03:11.200> me

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
a wild plant here now when you told me

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.870 
a wild plant here now when you told me
there<00:03:11.470> was<00:03:11.590> herb<00:03:11.830> Zin<00:03:12.040> this<00:03:12.190> wild<00:03:12.520> herbs<00:03:12.730> I

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
there was herb Zin this wild herbs I

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.310 
there was herb Zin this wild herbs I
thought<00:03:13.090> maybe<00:03:13.270> you'd<00:03:13.450> put<00:03:13.660> them<00:03:13.780> in<00:03:13.900> after<00:03:14.290> a

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
thought maybe you'd put them in after a

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.810 
thought maybe you'd put them in after a
lot<00:03:14.500> of<00:03:14.590> people<00:03:14.830> do<00:03:14.980> that<00:03:15.130> steep<00:03:15.550> in<00:03:15.700> there

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
lot of people do that steep in there

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.550 
lot of people do that steep in there
herbs<00:03:15.970> but<00:03:16.450> you're<00:03:16.600> actually<00:03:16.780> brewing<00:03:17.320> on<00:03:17.500> the

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
herbs but you're actually brewing on the

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.470 
herbs but you're actually brewing on the
wild<00:03:18.190> herb<00:03:18.310> right<00:03:18.640> right<00:03:18.940> from<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.330> beginning

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
wild herb right right from the beginning

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.420 
wild herb right right from the beginning
there<00:03:19.930> are<00:03:19.960> no<00:03:20.140> tea<00:03:20.380> leaves<00:03:20.590> put<00:03:20.950> in<00:03:21.100> you<00:03:21.370> know

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
there are no tea leaves put in you know

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.800 
there are no tea leaves put in you know
the<00:03:21.580> one<00:03:21.760> that<00:03:21.880> we're<00:03:22.090> drinking<00:03:22.480> here<00:03:22.690> is

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
the one that we're drinking here is

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.100 
the one that we're drinking here is
common<00:03:23.200> st.<00:03:23.440> John's<00:03:23.680> were<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:25.120> that<00:03:25.660> was<00:03:25.720> the

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
common st. John's were and that was the

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.970 
common st. John's were and that was the
actual<00:03:26.680> leaves<00:03:27.520> that<00:03:27.970> this<00:03:28.210> thing<00:03:28.530> used<00:03:29.530> for

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
actual leaves that this thing used for

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.740 
actual leaves that this thing used for
the<00:03:30.070> food<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:30.700> so<00:03:30.850> right<00:03:31.060> here<00:03:31.390> is<00:03:31.480> that<00:03:31.630> is

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
the food and so right here is that is

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.440 
the food and so right here is that is
some<00:03:31.930> of<00:03:32.020> your<00:03:32.080> wild<00:03:32.410> harvested<00:03:33.000> right<00:03:34.000> there

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
some of your wild harvested right there

which<00:04:41.669> it<00:04:41.939> works<00:04:42.330> is<00:04:42.599> still<00:04:42.809> pretty<00:04:43.050> hotly

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:43.409 
which it works is still pretty hotly

of<00:04:50.099> laboratory<00:04:50.370> work<00:04:50.849> I've<00:04:51.270> actually<00:04:51.479> settled

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
of laboratory work I've actually settled

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.110 
of laboratory work I've actually settled
on<00:04:52.349> a<00:04:52.379> mechanism<00:04:52.949> by<00:04:53.129> how<00:04:53.370> it<00:04:53.520> happens<00:04:53.909> yet

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
on a mechanism by how it happens yet

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.299 
on a mechanism by how it happens yet
right<00:04:54.629> and<00:04:54.870> for<00:04:55.110> burns<00:04:55.409> now<00:04:55.770> that<00:04:56.039> that<00:04:56.159> would

00:04:56.299 --> 00:04:56.309 
right and for burns now that that would

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:58.010 
right and for burns now that that would
be<00:04:56.400> extracted<00:04:56.969> in<00:04:57.029> a<00:04:57.089> different<00:04:57.449> way<00:04:57.569> than<00:04:57.779> say

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
be extracted in a different way than say

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.809 
be extracted in a different way than say
a<00:04:58.050> tea<00:04:58.349> right<00:04:58.650> how<00:04:58.889> is<00:04:59.009> that<00:04:59.159> going<00:04:59.370> to<00:04:59.490> be<00:04:59.550> used

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819 
a tea right how is that going to be used

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.029 
a tea right how is that going to be used
like<00:05:00.089> a<00:05:00.120> like<00:05:00.659> an<00:05:00.779> oil-based<00:05:01.080> extraction

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
like a like an oil-based extraction

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.489 
like a like an oil-based extraction
right<00:05:02.460> so<00:05:02.789> you'd<00:05:02.939> put<00:05:03.120> it<00:05:03.210> into<00:05:03.419> oil<00:05:03.499> exactly

00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:04.499 
right so you'd put it into oil exactly

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:05.809 
right so you'd put it into oil exactly
and<00:05:04.650> one<00:05:04.860> of<00:05:04.949> the<00:05:05.009> things<00:05:05.189> you<00:05:05.339> showed<00:05:05.550> me<00:05:05.699> this

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819 
and one of the things you showed me this

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:08.839 
and one of the things you showed me this
year<00:05:06.120> a<00:05:06.150> great<00:05:06.599> identify<00:05:07.610> identification<00:05:08.610> tip

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
year a great identify identification tip

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:10.700 
year a great identify identification tip
is<00:05:09.059> that<00:05:09.240> when<00:05:09.360> we<00:05:09.449> squeeze<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:09.900> blossoms<00:05:10.620> of

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
is that when we squeeze the blossoms of

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.439 
is that when we squeeze the blossoms of
it<00:05:10.860> those<00:05:10.979> bright<00:05:11.460> yellow<00:05:11.729> blossoms<00:05:12.330> they

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
it those bright yellow blossoms they

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:14.389 
it those bright yellow blossoms they
kind<00:05:12.659> of<00:05:12.689> exude<00:05:13.050> like<00:05:13.229> a<00:05:13.259> purple<00:05:13.830> color<00:05:14.039> right

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:14.399 
kind of exude like a purple color right

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:16.100

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:18.029 
through hold that up to the light I want

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:19.399 
through hold that up to the light I want
people<00:05:18.149> to<00:05:18.300> be<00:05:18.389> able<00:05:18.449> to<00:05:18.569> see<00:05:18.779> how<00:05:18.960> beautiful

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:19.409 
people to be able to see how beautiful

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:21.290 
people to be able to see how beautiful
the<00:05:19.499> color<00:05:19.710> is<00:05:19.889> so<00:05:20.339> some<00:05:20.550> of<00:05:20.580> that<00:05:20.729> color<00:05:20.969> it's

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
the color is so some of that color it's

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.079 
the color is so some of that color it's
it's<00:05:21.629> a<00:05:21.779> bit<00:05:22.080> of<00:05:22.169> a<00:05:22.259> golden<00:05:22.800> kind<00:05:23.129> of<00:05:23.279> color<00:05:23.879> but

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:24.089 
it's a bit of a golden kind of color but

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:25.999 
it's a bit of a golden kind of color but
there's<00:05:24.300> a<00:05:24.360> purple<00:05:24.899> undertone<00:05:25.499> to<00:05:25.529> it<00:05:25.770> which

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
there's a purple undertone to it which

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:27.559 
there's a purple undertone to it which
is<00:05:26.159> really<00:05:26.309> distinctive<00:05:26.909> and<00:05:27.059> the<00:05:27.120> flavors

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:27.569 
is really distinctive and the flavors

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:29.629 
is really distinctive and the flavors
amazing<00:05:28.050> as<00:05:28.169> well<00:05:28.319> so<00:05:28.919> what<00:05:29.069> we've<00:05:29.219> got<00:05:29.430> there

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
amazing as well so what we've got there

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.610 
amazing as well so what we've got there
is<00:05:29.669> then<00:05:29.939> your<00:05:30.149> yeasts<00:05:30.629> and<00:05:30.719> bacteria<00:05:30.809> who

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
is then your yeasts and bacteria who

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.559 
is then your yeasts and bacteria who
formed<00:05:31.979> that<00:05:32.069> colony<00:05:32.580> and<00:05:32.729> then<00:05:33.149> they're<00:05:33.389> in

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:33.569 
formed that colony and then they're in

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:36.769 
formed that colony and then they're in
wild<00:05:34.050> plants<00:05:34.529> with<00:05:34.770> wild<00:05:35.309> sugars<00:05:36.089> which<00:05:36.629> is

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:36.779 
wild plants with wild sugars which is

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:38.929 
wild plants with wild sugars which is
what<00:05:37.020> I<00:05:37.050> love<00:05:37.379> so<00:05:37.620> much<00:05:37.680> about<00:05:38.069> it<00:05:38.309> because<00:05:38.550> not

00:05:38.929 --> 00:05:38.939 
what I love so much about it because not

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:40.639 
what I love so much about it because not
only<00:05:38.999> to<00:05:39.270> get<00:05:39.449> all<00:05:39.629> the<00:05:39.809> benefits<00:05:39.990> of<00:05:40.529> the

these<00:05:54.810> any<00:05:55.409> thoughts<00:05:55.889> about<00:05:56.099> how<00:05:56.789> the<00:05:56.849> scoby

00:05:58.179 --> 00:05:58.189 
these any thoughts about how the scoby

these any thoughts about how the scoby
changes<00:05:59.189> or<00:05:59.399> potentiates<00:06:00.300> or<00:06:00.659> do<00:06:00.930> you<00:06:00.990> have

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
changes or potentiates or do you have

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.420 
changes or potentiates or do you have
any<00:06:01.229> experience<00:06:01.680> with<00:06:01.709> that<00:06:02.009> the<00:06:02.279> if<00:06:02.399> the

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
any experience with that the if the

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.999 
any experience with that the if the
effects<00:06:02.939> of<00:06:03.029> fermentation<00:06:03.779> on<00:06:03.930> a<00:06:03.990> I<00:06:04.319> guess<00:06:04.830> I

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:05.009 
effects of fermentation on a I guess I

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:06.649 
effects of fermentation on a I guess I
guess<00:06:05.219> we<00:06:05.399> know<00:06:05.580> a<00:06:05.610> lot<00:06:05.879> about<00:06:05.909> making<00:06:06.419> teas

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:06.659 
guess we know a lot about making teas

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:09.019 
guess we know a lot about making teas
and<00:06:06.990> decoctions<00:06:07.589> and<00:06:07.770> tinctures<00:06:08.249> which<00:06:08.849> are

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:09.029 
and decoctions and tinctures which are

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:11.480 
and decoctions and tinctures which are
crude<00:06:09.360> extracts<00:06:10.080> I<00:06:10.349> guess<00:06:10.529> but<00:06:11.189> then<00:06:11.339> the

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
crude extracts I guess but then the

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.969 
crude extracts I guess but then the
fermentation<00:06:11.909> is<00:06:12.330> a<00:06:12.389> living<00:06:12.899> biotic<00:06:13.409> process

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 
fermentation is a living biotic process

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:15.260 
fermentation is a living biotic process
if<00:06:14.219> you<00:06:14.309> have<00:06:14.430> any<00:06:14.580> experience<00:06:14.729> or<00:06:15.059> you<00:06:15.149> want

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
if you have any experience or you want

if you have any experience or you want
to<00:06:15.330> comment<00:06:15.539> on<00:06:15.689> that<00:06:15.749> well<00:06:16.080> I<00:06:16.110> was<00:06:16.620> wondering

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 
to comment on that well I was wondering

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:19.850 
to comment on that well I was wondering
when<00:06:17.520> I<00:06:17.550> first<00:06:17.999> started<00:06:18.509> making<00:06:18.749> these<00:06:19.199> if

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
when I first started making these if

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.579 
when I first started making these if
they<00:06:20.580> actual<00:06:21.029> the<00:06:21.120> properties<00:06:21.839> of<00:06:21.870> the<00:06:22.139> plants

00:06:22.579 --> 00:06:22.589 
they actual the properties of the plants

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:25.779 
they actual the properties of the plants
would<00:06:22.770> come<00:06:23.099> through<00:06:23.430> in<00:06:23.849> the<00:06:24.479> kombucha

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:25.789 
would come through in the kombucha

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:27.980 
would come through in the kombucha
worried<00:06:26.789> that<00:06:26.969> perhaps<00:06:27.360> they<00:06:27.779> would<00:06:27.959> be

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
worried that perhaps they would be

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.260 
worried that perhaps they would be
broken<00:06:28.379> down<00:06:28.740> but<00:06:29.339> in<00:06:29.459> fact<00:06:29.639> at<00:06:29.849> least<00:06:29.879> was

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
broken down but in fact at least was

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.059 
broken down but in fact at least was
some<00:06:30.509> of<00:06:30.659> the<00:06:30.749> plants<00:06:31.259> I've<00:06:31.409> been<00:06:31.589> able<00:06:31.709> to

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:32.069 
some of the plants I've been able to

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:34.249 
some of the plants I've been able to
actually<00:06:32.279> use<00:06:32.759> myself<00:06:33.029> as<00:06:33.449> a<00:06:33.479> guinea<00:06:33.719> pig<00:06:33.870> and

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:34.259 
actually use myself as a guinea pig and

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:36.980 
actually use myself as a guinea pig and
can<00:06:35.009> be<00:06:35.219> quite<00:06:35.969> confident<00:06:36.569> that<00:06:36.719> the

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
can be quite confident that the

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.199 
can be quite confident that the
properties<00:06:37.469> of<00:06:37.499> the<00:06:37.740> plants<00:06:38.099> are<00:06:38.249> preserved

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:39.209 
properties of the plants are preserved

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:43.339 
properties of the plants are preserved
at<00:06:39.509> least<00:06:39.719> in<00:06:39.930> part<00:06:40.199> in<00:06:40.559> the<00:06:40.589> kombucha
