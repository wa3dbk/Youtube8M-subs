with is I learned something from it I

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.399 
with is I learned something from it I
learned<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.390> couple<00:01:39.540> things<00:01:39.689> from<00:01:39.990> actually

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
learned a couple things from actually

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.350 
learned a couple things from actually
it's<00:01:40.560> actually<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.890> pretty<00:01:41.100> cool<00:01:41.189> well<00:01:42.030> thought

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
it's actually a pretty cool well thought

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.359 
it's actually a pretty cool well thought
out<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.810> every<00:01:43.590> one<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.829> her<00:01:43.920> lessons<00:01:44.280> are

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
out and every one of her lessons are

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.590 
out and every one of her lessons are
well<00:01:44.490> thought<00:01:44.670> out<00:01:44.729> there<00:01:45.000> only<00:01:45.119> about<00:01:45.299> 40

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
well thought out there only about 40

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.999 
well thought out there only about 40
minutes<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.899> 50<00:01:46.140> minutes<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.470> an<00:01:46.560> hour<00:01:46.619> long

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
minutes to 50 minutes to an hour long

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.370 
minutes to 50 minutes to an hour long
for<00:01:47.250> each<00:01:47.280> lesson<00:01:47.810> you<00:01:48.810> know<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.049> think<00:01:49.200> it's

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
for each lesson you know so I think it's

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.690 
for each lesson you know so I think it's
a<00:01:49.439> whole<00:01:49.590> things<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.890> might<00:01:49.979> be<00:01:50.070> 12<00:01:50.490> hours

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
a whole things that might be 12 hours

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.389 
a whole things that might be 12 hours
long<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.450> it's<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.810> pretty<00:01:52.020> pretty<00:01:52.320> decent<00:01:52.860> you

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
long so it's a pretty pretty decent you

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.030 
long so it's a pretty pretty decent you
know<00:01:53.520> sighs<00:01:53.880> course<00:01:54.210> but<00:01:54.509> her<00:01:55.409> course<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:55.890> so

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
know sighs course but her course is so

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.480 
know sighs course but her course is so
compacted<00:01:57.320> it<00:01:58.320> might<00:01:58.590> some<00:01:59.040> might<00:01:59.189> even<00:01:59.219> think

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
compacted it might some might even think

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.609 
compacted it might some might even think
it<00:01:59.640> goes<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> little<00:01:59.939> bit<00:02:00.090> too<00:02:00.299> fast<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:01.500> maybe

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
it goes a little bit too fast that maybe

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.780 
it goes a little bit too fast that maybe
she<00:02:01.710> should<00:02:01.950> slow<00:02:02.100> down<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.310> little<00:02:02.490> bit<00:02:02.640> and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
she should slow down a little bit and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.459 
she should slow down a little bit and
take<00:02:03.210> more<00:02:03.420> time<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.659> explain<00:02:04.079> something<00:02:04.409> a

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
take more time to explain something a

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.109 
take more time to explain something a
bit<00:02:04.590> further<00:02:04.829> but<00:02:05.430> she<00:02:05.549> explains<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.060> very

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
bit further but she explains it very

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.359 
bit further but she explains it very
well<00:02:06.479> it's<00:02:07.110> right<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.590> point<00:02:07.799> though<00:02:08.039> so

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
well it's right to the point though so

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.529 
well it's right to the point though so
that<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.640> might<00:02:08.759> want<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.060> watch<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.239> more

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
that you might want to watch it more

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.150 
that you might want to watch it more
than<00:02:09.660> one<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.020> we<00:02:10.110> might<00:02:10.259> want<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.500> rewind

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
than one so we might want to rewind

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.589 
than one so we might want to rewind
certain<00:02:11.550> parts<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.030> kind<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.300> flew<00:02:12.450> over

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
certain parts that kind of flew over

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.670 
certain parts that kind of flew over
your<00:02:12.690> head<00:02:12.870> like<00:02:13.080> well<00:02:13.470> that

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
your head like well that

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.990 
your head like well that
and<00:02:13.739> by<00:02:13.829> kind<00:02:14.040> of<00:02:14.099> fast<00:02:14.159> what<00:02:14.519> just<00:02:14.670> happened

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
and by kind of fast what just happened

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.099 
and by kind of fast what just happened
you<00:02:15.120> know<00:02:15.209> how<00:02:15.299> sometimes<00:02:15.510> you're<00:02:15.810> reading<00:02:16.049> a

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:16.109 
you know how sometimes you're reading a

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:17.809 
you know how sometimes you're reading a
book<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.980> read<00:02:17.129> a<00:02:17.159> whole<00:02:17.310> page<00:02:17.579> you're

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
book and you read a whole page you're

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.520 
book and you read a whole page you're
like<00:02:18.030> whoa<00:02:18.209> what<00:02:18.420> did<00:02:18.510> i<00:02:18.599> just<00:02:18.629> read<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.349> you

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
like whoa what did i just read and you

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.750 
like whoa what did i just read and you
have<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.709> go<00:02:19.799> back<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.010> rewind<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.549> read<00:02:20.700> the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
have to go back and rewind and read the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.880 
have to go back and rewind and read the
page<00:02:20.909> again<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:22.170> might<00:02:22.319> find<00:02:22.469> yourself<00:02:22.620> doing

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
page again you might find yourself doing

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.440 
page again you might find yourself doing
that<00:02:22.980> with<00:02:23.129> this<00:02:23.219> course<00:02:23.489> rewinding<00:02:24.269> watch

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
that with this course rewinding watch

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.330 
that with this course rewinding watch
again<00:02:24.780> but<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.560> think<00:02:25.829> it's<00:02:25.950> well<00:02:26.099> worth<00:02:26.310> the

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
again but I think it's well worth the

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.270 
again but I think it's well worth the
price<00:02:26.640> if<00:02:27.540> anything<00:02:27.959> just<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.650> check<00:02:28.859> out<00:02:29.040> at

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
price if anything just to check out at

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.129 
price if anything just to check out at

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
I figured hey if I learned something

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.250 
I figured hey if I learned something
from<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.909> it's<00:02:36.090> worth<00:02:36.269> sharing<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.870> that's

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
from it it's worth sharing and that's

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.349 
from it it's worth sharing and that's
what<00:02:37.409> I<00:02:37.439> do<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:37.799> you<00:02:38.099> know<00:02:38.189> I<00:02:38.430> make<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.150> lot<00:02:39.299> of

on my site I guess that can be kind of

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:50.839 
on my site I guess that can be kind of
considered<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.069> course<00:02:50.310> but<00:02:50.459> none<00:02:50.579> of<00:02:50.609> them<00:02:50.700> are

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849
