00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.600 
it's pretty cool on that I'm sure you
could<00:02:18.200> do<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.380> with<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.620> n85<00:02:19.040> as<00:02:19.280> well<00:02:19.460> and

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
could do that with the n85 as well and

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.320 
could do that with the n85 as well and
one<00:02:22.610> feature<00:02:22.940> that<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.770> n85<00:02:24.770> has<00:02:25.069> is<00:02:25.700> an<00:02:25.910> FM

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
one feature that the n85 has is an FM

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.420 
one feature that the n85 has is an FM
transmitter<00:02:26.680> what<00:02:27.680> this<00:02:27.800> allows<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.160> do

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
transmitter what this allows you to do

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.850 
transmitter what this allows you to do
is<00:02:28.610> -<00:02:28.880> it<00:02:29.630> allows<00:02:29.810> you<00:02:29.959> to<00:02:30.050> transmit<00:02:30.590> all<00:02:30.709> your

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
is - it allows you to transmit all your

almost<00:02:35.150> what<00:02:35.630> like<00:02:35.780> an<00:02:35.930> iPod<00:02:36.230> does<00:02:36.610> it's

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
almost what like an iPod does it's

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.430 
almost what like an iPod does it's
actually<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:37.940> pretty<00:02:38.570> cool<00:02:38.840> feature<00:02:39.170> and

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
actually a pretty cool feature and

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.729 
actually a pretty cool feature and
another<00:02:40.400> feature<00:02:40.610> is<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:45.140> nav<00:02:45.380> wheel<00:02:45.620> the

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
another feature is the the nav wheel the

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.040 
another feature is the the nav wheel the
touch<00:02:45.950> sensitive<00:02:46.220> nav<00:02:47.000> wheel<00:02:47.270> for<00:02:47.930> your

both<00:02:52.580> both<00:02:53.090> devices<00:02:53.540> do<00:02:53.690> have<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:54.430> stereo

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
both both devices do have a stereo

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.740 
both both devices do have a stereo
speakers<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:55.940> sound<00:02:56.150> is<00:02:56.300> pretty<00:02:56.420> good<00:02:56.630> the

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
speakers the sound is pretty good the

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.930 
speakers the sound is pretty good the
sound<00:02:56.959> is<00:02:57.110> still<00:02:57.830> a<00:02:58.010> little<00:02:58.340> bit<00:02:58.459> better<00:02:58.670> on

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
sound is still a little bit better on

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.630 
sound is still a little bit better on
the<00:02:59.480> on<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.410> n95<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:01.070> think<00:03:02.650> but<00:03:03.650> both<00:03:04.220> both

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
the on the n95 I think but both both

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.300 
the on the n95 I think but both both
play<00:03:05.030> sound<00:03:05.780> pretty<00:03:06.019> well<00:03:06.230> in<00:03:06.470> terms<00:03:07.070> of

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
play sound pretty well in terms of

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.490 
play sound pretty well in terms of
battery<00:03:07.850> there's<00:03:08.810> not<00:03:09.019> that<00:03:09.140> much<00:03:09.260> of<00:03:09.320> a

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
battery there's not that much of a

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.060 
battery there's not that much of a
difference<00:03:09.620> like<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.340> end<00:03:11.140> ne5<00:03:12.140> does<00:03:12.680> have<00:03:13.040> a

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
difference like the end ne5 does have a

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.970 
difference like the end ne5 does have a
little<00:03:13.370> bit<00:03:13.580> longer<00:03:14.090> battery<00:03:14.420> life<00:03:14.630> than<00:03:14.989> the

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
little bit longer battery life than the

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.570 
little bit longer battery life than the
n95<00:03:16.340> 8<00:03:16.670> gigabyte<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:18.290> can<00:03:18.410> see<00:03:18.560> we<00:03:18.709> have<00:03:18.800> a<00:03:18.830> BL

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
n95 8 gigabyte you can see we have a BL

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.979 
n95 8 gigabyte you can see we have a BL
5k<00:03:20.239> on<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.870> N<00:03:20.959> 85<00:03:21.320> and<00:03:21.590> a<00:03:21.620> BL<00:03:21.920> 6f<00:03:22.400> on<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:23.000> n95<00:03:23.660> 8

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
5k on the N 85 and a BL 6f on the n95 8

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.560 
5k on the N 85 and a BL 6f on the n95 8
gig<00:03:25.299> overall<00:03:26.299> I<00:03:26.600> think<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:27.910> n95<00:03:28.910> 8<00:03:29.209> gig<00:03:29.420> is

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
gig overall I think the n95 8 gig is

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.610 
gig overall I think the n95 8 gig is
still<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:30.019> better<00:03:30.739> phone<00:03:31.130> than<00:03:31.310> an<00:03:31.489> 85<00:03:32.530> but<00:03:33.530> the

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
still a better phone than an 85 but the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.610 
still a better phone than an 85 but the
n<00:03:33.739> 85<00:03:34.160> is<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:34.400> great<00:03:34.700> upgrade<00:03:34.850> for<00:03:35.500> let's<00:03:36.500> say

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620
