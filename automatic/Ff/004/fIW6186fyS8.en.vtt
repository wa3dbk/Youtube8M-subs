 that is a guitar for 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.589
 really the smallest beginner's 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.029
 then somehow can really start 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:32.190
 to learn the guitar correctly 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.300
 this is not a toy anymore but you 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.290

 what i like to write in this 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.840
 want to make video is simply the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.100

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.390
 already that is a very nice sounding 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.550
 Of course not as voluminous as done 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.360
 a bigger instrument that's clear 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.910
 but when you're a little kid 4 56 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.910
 years old begins to play guitar is 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.330
