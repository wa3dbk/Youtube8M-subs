00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.030
 so also best perform 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.659
 it does not really matter 

00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:11.389
 or Ten before what Matzenbach 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.319
 Bahrein they tell from the example of Eutin too small mistakes 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.830
 that's not just what the games are all about 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.830
 Woori Finance Automotive 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.009
 it should be 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.009
 what happens there I say 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:29.890
 that's so great when you call one 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.479
 and vehicle 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:34.590
 the ride shoots a left turn 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.720
 The driver years so rightly I have learned that Haltern 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.960
 it made 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.900
 Toronto right 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.600
 it is he is driving all the time 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.700
 targeted 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.710
 after here 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.790
 wanted to look around here 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:55.890
 a little less 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.050
 Board given 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.220
 Salt dissolved the feathers left so that draws range agree 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.520
 a lot of people thinks you have to put on the right one so that it stays in place 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.070
 medium 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.070
 Kock immediately in the middle jumps in this target group 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.440
 this is how this axis moves 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.450
 the pilot five percent 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.380
 so jumping back in the same area thats not so it can 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.020
 be a bit lazy 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.800
 it's OK 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.150
 that is, this vehicle here concludes to moderate this broadcast 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.150
 to Munich 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.170
 solve this Missy a bit 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.240
 if you have a goal very hard 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.620
 goes in from above screws in and 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.630
 the mistakes of the opponents of Greul 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.520
 and not only in the team bus Dür Wüst the Danes left that is 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.940
 anyway it is like that 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.070
 forms at the percent springs and she tells 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.070
 puts him in motion 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.490
 down here, the telecom unfolded the springs 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.830
 that allowed Klopp gave so disgusted 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.320
 So it is so far in Sheen's conclusion peppered in Tbilisi where you shown 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.240
 have 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.269
 Misik just heard the record 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.949
 that's the first fundamental of course it's like that 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:11.910
 around 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.709
 if you have an enrichment 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.009
 Berlin 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:17.249
 stand by it 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:19.209
 Kita makes you 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.409
 is such an old vehicle 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.339
 around 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:25.869
 a little bit 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.869
 the multi-racer of the rear axle has 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.139
 also has disadvantages 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:32.419
 namely not at all 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.419
 if you have your harassment it means 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.939
 Renault Zoe outstretched hand 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.239
 Berthold mustard 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:53.009
 thats why 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:55.909
 or you have her after six she goes off 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:56.849
 around 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.849
 not going the ride from this site 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:01.729
 in the vehicle 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:05.189
 kick-off for the premiere 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.189
 At first, Trichet Schloss applies it 

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:10.369
 out here 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:13.929
 Here, in the aftermath, there is rain on this side out 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.599
 and everyone is so pure Stosur out 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.000
 Companions were he steers up to 28 back 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.879
 Klenk back to the right to test drive it off 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:32.479
 and then into the gate 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:34.559
 because ever Asus is too slow 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:36.079
 then it is possible 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.709
 that lies here 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.249
 Ralf Kumpf 

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:42.929
 will be missing today 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:44.099
 these feathers 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.269
 or to the central bank Tietze the mission toughness 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.499
 thus the vehicle can estimate 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:52.659
 because Jackson's name is 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:55.329
 witness reports 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.109
 quickly implement it is fast 12 CNY with position 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.680
 and beautiful on the side of Israel after that is over 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.999
 can do it faster 

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:05.399
 First I dodge the ethics march 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:08.809
 it crackles extremely slow for that really the time is easy though 

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:09.989
 to drive 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.079
 nicely comfortable UniCredit goes, he says 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.169
 but in the first place 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:18.169
 Federer also had a coach Halle 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:19.999
 in hall drives 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:22.039
 but the very hard skull 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.400
 There were plenty of 11 in the Haller carpet mostly 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.280
 and so that it can learn a lot also in many many acquisitions 

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:34.259
 fast access acted Palestine is not so great strengths 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.110
 makes the offender has an approx 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.319
 that was even more dangerous 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:43.710
 feathers 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.099
 harder 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:48.500
 Velyky is missing or more for the front Vieri must 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.120
 more a month 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.029
 that is a 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:55.029
 gives the basis and 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.599
 If that was the Corniche, so to speak, he made the mistake 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:03.599
 gets with the fast load changes 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:11.900
 Zeitel Goos 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.999
 that is to be combined here clubs usually it is z 

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:17.719
 Thum with the separation 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:19.289
 below has errors 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.559
 that could make the bottle long 

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:23.559
 for which the balance was achieved 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:26.719
 Picture Uni has the warriors combining the cold 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:28.360
 anyway not like that 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.490
 around 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.900
 I am here there is always a power 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.200
 the cauldrons at 8 or the Christvesper Machnik Juks 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:39.800
 happens the more weight 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.180
 a formal one at Honda Insight 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.180
 you have more traction in front 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:53.759
 concerns similar structure 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:55.379
 his roommate 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:58.379
 he could be such a kid by RM Trelle 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:02.879
 Thick smoke moved 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:07.020
 it's a game 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.340
 a country you can even do what i have done wrong though 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.340
 Residents in Schwerin have 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:18.199
 But the question is whether that is still the official party line Rosso this 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:21.959
 Access roads this fiction says he has come to this plate fact Chen 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.499
 the carbon fiber parts and these two plates make up below 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:28.909
 not too much asked coach 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:32.979
 Zett that she is always so it drives for Nico they made the vehicles 

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:36.050
 I find left-hand bend form 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.849
 besides here 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:41.849
 that Enel Art hits off 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.360
 the dear-out in the hand CDU so 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:56.169
 show that we finally have off again 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.999
 and now around 

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:00.849
 how do we do that? 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:03.770
 it is clear if now around 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.139
 Douglas himself 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:07.149
 also the fewer controls 

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:10.559
 Good kicked more as it were especially when turning 

00:07:10.559 --> 00:07:13.449
 especially Stadler 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:16.520
 entrained turn entrance could have done 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.520
 often happens he said percent out of the group 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.559
 then he did not want to 

00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:24.710
 fourth increased 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.710
 Dekker make the Katzenberger 

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:31.669
 it is opposite 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:34.339
 Although the culprit has been like that 

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:37.740
 outside the family asked Federico is wide 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.789
 kg Tel 

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:43.999
 make the new series 

00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:45.909
 this spring tension 

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:48.909
 percent less gas has bumps and so on 

00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:51.439
 the Reiss Profile Wellmann 

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:54.460
 the bumps are mainly intercepted 

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.539
 of these, Trier 

00:07:56.539 --> 00:07:59.539
 with his car before the mistakes or 

00:08:00.569 --> 00:08:02.999
 in the bumps had roadway 

00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:04.939
 they have less too long plus
