00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.130
 we stay in the international field but his head of 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.230
 discipline 18 clubs this foreign nation and nearly 200 participants 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.990
 for its tenth edition the Ensival Arts Gymnastics Tournament 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.169
 region verviétoise but once again welcome a nice parterre of 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.550
 talent among them a Canadian team this year attract the 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.340
 looks must be said that in this team you find a skin more 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.779
 local tonic of the stage if we hold the reins as a coach 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.840
 national as a spectator the television cameras and who announced in 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.840
 head so these are a closer look at this delegation 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.840
 % var 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.360
 in three years I left the house of chimpanzees not yet started but I 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.540
 am still not too bad even though the national coaching staff 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.490
 the different culture of the Anglo-Saxon side 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.650
 enemy certainly played in belgium but certainly not a sexual game 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.640
 disappointed by the Belgian gymnastics federation 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.520
 he augustéenne preferred three years ago to leave his country and the commune 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.150
 nancy will forget it in order to try his luck in canada 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.550
 out there on the demands side this professional gym teacher is getting 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.670
 made a name thanks to his very demanding work methods today at 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.890
 41 years old he knows that he will then practice his passion on the lands of his childhood 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.360
 gymnast is doing gymnastics globally everybody except in any case 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.530
 in this version all my work pretty much the same way it's always 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.940
 always ready the same principle bodybuilding to get basics 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.120
 but the big difference the hold of the federation 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.990
 I think yes on the Belgian roads of the CIA not care at all structured 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.710
 is a professional at all 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.080
 police that there is a great price although there are not many words 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.940
 but it's a bigger country with a lot more money 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.110
 cit that culminates in a structure at the level of the federation that is when 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.560
 even distinctly superior almost professional 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.119
 if Belgium is not one of the great nations of gymnastics 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.340
 canada is making every effort to facilitate 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.190
 the emergence of this longest level the Argentine does not do it all the 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.069
 Canadian culture is also behind these results 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.240
 canada the child-king world is the main thing is to have fun with each other 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.060
 we can climb high enough in the training the parents are always 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.410
 there for you that children 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.469
 extremism 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:26.699
 because rafa same as that there really politics the bar in order to 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:30.139
 know above all the pleasure that he does not have this spirit in Belgium a little bit 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.129
 less age did not act alone good we still because at the beginning the 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.180
 children I think at the start the kids when they come to do the 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.419
 gymnastics it's first for fun cooking all have detected and 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:42.299
 because they have talent and then we start to push to the pleasure and 110 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.049
 I thought paris there went smiled anyway you I do not see them 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.219
 smiles in belgium as i see it on the used canada background 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:51.750
 the big brothers with his pupils at certain times 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.209
 uncompromising to others 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.480
 it's worth it later he does not leave indifferent some time ago in 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.819
 vain without cars where she met the Belgian coach who died 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.670
 German language immersion tons today that yesterday has become his 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.689
 mentor 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.189
 his mother 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:08.539
 even canadians 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:10.239
 I do not know why 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.069
 ok ln 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.029
 302 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:14.439
 learning that is different from others 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.449
 and he knows what he's doing 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:17.899
 best example 

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:20.899
 the rally on the training to c 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:23.959
 if it's not going to please, but you still have to find a buyer 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:26.380
 it's free 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.259
 because to see 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:31.259
 do it + 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:34.069
 we can see true 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.599
 Canadian coaches are very strict but there is still a lot 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.479
 more 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:42.909
 by dint of work it's worth more than Nicolas Sarkozy is at the lowest 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:45.929
 in any case not afraid 

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:48.119
 to live his art 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:51.119
 especially for our young people 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:56.719
 by way of conclusion I submit to you the traditional little thought of the 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:57.639
 week 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.379
 my only gymnastics is going to the funerals of my friends who were doing 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.679
 gymnastics to stay healthy 

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:07.259
 it's signed georges feydeau we recognize there the claw of the master 

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:10.919
 Burlesque theater not really famous for its sports activities 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:15.209
 but more like this little sentence for his acerbic replies we 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.630
 finish so I'm a smile 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.820
 in a smile that you will undoubtedly keep tomorrow because the profession does not 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.210
 extends tonight
