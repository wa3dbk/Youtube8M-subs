 hi friends from youtube I'm all windows 7 and today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.520
 uninstall any antivirus without leaving a trace of it with an application 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.660
 totally free I leave this video because 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.210
 usually this problem is presented by the norton antivirus of any 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.910
 version 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.770
 the problem of antivirus is that they do not completely run their PC files 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.729
 and an uninstall will be executed 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:34.839
 the application that we are going to download is called bore move 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.500
 this program works specifically to uninstall antivirus from 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.290
 our pc and it's totally free 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.500
 and sure the program weighs 5 megawatts and work very cloudy xp 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.780
 view and 7 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.040
 The first thing we are going to do is go to the link that left them in the description 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.040
 of the video is the official page of the program 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.710
 there open the page we give where it says doug load nou 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.580
 we wait for you to download the program 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.740
 Once the download is complete, we install it 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.579
 for that we give right click and select execute as 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.190
 we select administrator preferences we see the window of 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.860
 installation 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.660
 we give max 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.660
 we select remoce kibrit and application 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.030
 we give max 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.230
 in these moments the program will scan our pc looking for all the antivirus 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.960
 who has installed our pc 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.380
 we give max 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.100
 and we see the list of all the antivirus that are installed 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.890
 we select the one that we want to uninstall and I have installed in eset 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.659
 nod32 and the horror search and destroy will even appear the norton although 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.259
 been uninstalled from the pc 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.449
 we follow 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.239
 we give max 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.519
 appears the window of the antivirus specifications that we are going 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.940
 to uninstall and we give max 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.940
 then start to uninstall our application 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.609
 we wait a little 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:46.409
 I took the opportunity to thank all those who subscribed to my channel and 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.839
 those who have doubts with the first video of the system uninstall 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:55.439
 operative I will be answering soon and those who want a response 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:00.279
 If you have any doubt about the video, send me a message, either personal or 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:05.019
 in the channel that I will answer as soon as possible in video may 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.019
 the program does not respond at times 

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:27.869
 and we get out of the program and voila the program completely eliminated our 

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:33.029
 windows 7 antivirus and no need to install sinks without charger so 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:37.869
