this first lesson we're going to be

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.190 
this first lesson we're going to be
learning<00:00:07.560> about<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:08.099> base<00:00:08.280> flange<00:00:08.960> but<00:00:09.960> first

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
learning about the base flange but first

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.410 
learning about the base flange but first
of<00:00:10.380> all<00:00:10.469> what<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.740> sheetmetal<00:00:11.190> you<00:00:11.969> can<00:00:12.179> think

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
of all what is sheetmetal you can think

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.629 
of all what is sheetmetal you can think
of<00:00:12.570> sheetmetal<00:00:12.900> as<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.440> thin<00:00:13.889> solid<00:00:14.280> with<00:00:14.610> a

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
can also access the sheet metal toolset

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.340 
can also access the sheet metal toolset
via<00:00:27.260> the<00:00:27.440> insert<00:00:27.950> command<00:00:28.160> sheet<00:00:28.880> metal<00:00:29.350> here

via the insert command sheet metal here

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.409 
via the insert command sheet metal here
we<00:00:30.470> have<00:00:30.619> a<00:00:30.650> number<00:00:30.920> of<00:00:31.220> tools<00:00:31.460> base<00:00:31.850> flange<00:00:32.210> is

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
we have a number of tools base flange is

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.870 
we have a number of tools base flange is
the<00:00:32.570> only<00:00:32.750> one<00:00:33.050> active<00:00:33.470> currently<00:00:33.950> the<00:00:34.670> base

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
the only one active currently the base

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.120 
the only one active currently the base
flange<00:00:35.300> is<00:00:35.600> a<00:00:35.630> sketch<00:00:36.050> based<00:00:36.290> feature<00:00:36.739> so

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
flange is a sketch based feature so

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.520 
flange is a sketch based feature so
we'll<00:00:37.340> need<00:00:37.489> to<00:00:37.550> create<00:00:37.820> a<00:00:38.030> sketch<00:00:38.420> first<00:00:38.809> let

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
we'll need to create a sketch first let

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.290 
we'll need to create a sketch first let
me<00:00:39.650> right<00:00:39.920> click<00:00:39.950> on<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:40.489> front<00:00:40.760> plane<00:00:40.940> and

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
we're going to be looking at all of

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.410 
we're going to be looking at all of
these<00:02:08.680> options<00:02:08.950> in<00:02:09.400> more<00:02:09.610> detail<00:02:10.120> in

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.900 
these options in more detail in
subsequent<00:02:10.960> lessons<00:02:11.320> for<00:02:12.160> now<00:02:12.310> I'm<00:02:12.520> going<00:02:12.790> to

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
subsequent lessons for now I'm going to

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.390 
subsequent lessons for now I'm going to
use<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.360> k-factor<00:02:13.870> method<00:02:14.470> with<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.680> value<00:02:15.190> of

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
use the k-factor method with a value of

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.440 
use the k-factor method with a value of
0.5

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
0.5

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.020 
0.5
we'll<00:02:16.930> also<00:02:17.170> be<00:02:17.350> exploring<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.220> use<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.460> the<00:02:18.820> K

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
we'll also be exploring the use of the K

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
lessons in this course let's take a look

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.400 
lessons in this course let's take a look
at<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.280> next<00:02:24.580> section<00:02:24.730> Auto<00:02:25.180> relief<00:02:25.750> this

at the next section Auto relief this

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.730 
at the next section Auto relief this
used<00:02:26.710> to<00:02:26.800> be<00:02:26.980> known<00:02:27.220> as<00:02:27.460> Ben<00:02:27.850> relief<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:29.530> is

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
used to be known as Ben relief this is

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.100 
used to be known as Ben relief this is
basically<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.310> small<00:02:30.790> cut<00:02:31.150> in<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.420> body<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:31.870> the

basically a small cut in the body of the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.780 
basically a small cut in the body of the

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.830 
sheet metal that allows it to bend
correctly<00:02:35.010> we're<00:02:36.010> able<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.520> use<00:02:36.760> one<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.330> three

different auto relief methods the first

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.690 
different auto relief methods the first
one<00:02:41.140> is<00:02:41.350> rectangular<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.370> that's

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
one is rectangular and that's

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.840 
one is rectangular and that's
