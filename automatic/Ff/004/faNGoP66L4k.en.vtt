play list because grappling is a lot of

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.109 
play list because grappling is a lot of
fun<00:00:26.330> it's<00:00:27.330> it's<00:00:27.599> not<00:00:27.750> necessarily<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.320> most

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
fun it's it's not necessarily the most

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.310 
fun it's it's not necessarily the most
though<00:00:30.119> it's<00:00:30.300> not<00:00:30.420> as<00:00:30.599> well<00:00:30.900> come<00:00:31.050> on<00:00:31.140> come<00:00:31.260> on

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
though it's not as well come on come on

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.990 
though it's not as well come on come on
come<00:00:31.500> on<00:00:31.590> yeah<00:00:32.160> it's<00:00:32.369> got<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.520> triple<00:00:32.730> feed

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
and managed to get out there alive but

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.729 
and managed to get out there alive but
what<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.700> was<00:00:35.850> saying<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.120> grappling<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:37.559> not

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
what I was saying is grappling is not

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.500 
what I was saying is grappling is not
necessarily<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.309> most<00:00:38.550> viable<00:00:38.940> thing<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.390> do

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
necessarily the most viable thing to do

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.160 
necessarily the most viable thing to do
and<00:00:39.660> Call<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.379> Duty<00:00:40.710> but<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.129> lot<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.489> fun

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
and Call of Duty but it is a lot of fun

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.330 
and Call of Duty but it is a lot of fun
because<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.320> not<00:00:43.440> something<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:43.980> see<00:00:44.129> every

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
because it's not something you see every

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.910 
because it's not something you see every
day<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:45.480> it's<00:00:45.809> definitely<00:00:45.870> different

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.560
