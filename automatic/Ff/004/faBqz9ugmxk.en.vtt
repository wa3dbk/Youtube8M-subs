00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.830
 boys you rasci in the bin of course 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.110
 another new complete here on my 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.699
 canal race on the aftertaste 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.850
 depression natural nice hardpoint 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:22.220
 jar on the mat express the mmc came with 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.930
 I finally got fast mixer at last 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.250
 another normal heart for the game there 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.570
 for you 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.610
 the reason why I almost never get the 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.900
 hardpoint upload is of course the first 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.859
 and only 500 people spray this one 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.120
 games well that will cunt and second 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:38.030
 everyone has stopped playing this 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.590
 game becomes 200 points hardpoint 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.569
 secure 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.249
 that is the problem of the hardpoint 

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:44.359
 blackops two 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:47.300
 hardpoint grain of course too 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:49.850
 come back in the vest for fm but here 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.960
 comes the but you also go 200 points again 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.850
 to get 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.929
 and you may now think well 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.319
 the people who should ever have a heart 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:56.629
 played 

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:59.420
 why is it a problem jan it is 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.100
 a problem because it makes you very sorry 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.389
 may i get your score fries 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.519
 I spray to that hardpoint I just have 

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:05.900
 already half of my evie within me 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.610
 get off hardpoint and come soon 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.409
 then on again and I just have my UWV 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.970
 inside without making eh kill and that is 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.260
 the problem of hardpoint it goes too 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.940
 come back in this way to the fans 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.290
 bar for I am not so happy with it 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.450
 I hope that maybe still goes 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.560
 be changed to update so you have 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.820
 no more those while getting the points 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.980
 if your heart becomes offering a maybe 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.320
 Get 100 points and get 50 points 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.520
 because the 200 is just too much for you 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.370
 score on it 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.660
 very very easy market we will 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.610
 naturally seen as etf and 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.560
 zwarver is coming out safe is waiting 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.560
 but eh i just hope for a good one 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.700
 how it will look 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.310
 and that it is also in a good way 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.690
 answer made that hardpoint game ever 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.010
 because of course it will come back 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.110
 come to capelle shitty hardpoint 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.550
 games and I am very happy with that 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.320
 I think that heart will come back to me anyway 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.890
 as a because this time what is 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.330
 just like one i do n't know her in itself 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.150
 Hardboard was introduced in a tin or tin 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.500
 two and I just have it so much now 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.150
 played and it's just really mine 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.770
 favorite game ever and discover this 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.420
 which can form points like now again 100 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.130
 gets points through that hard 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.680
 grab points just because this is normal 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.450
 also a fun game ever around the corner 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.610
 to find you really just have to go 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.230
 think where tensioners where do I need 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.390
 walk to where should I stand 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.069
 so that we have good spans how much 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.599
 point we can stand for corner points 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.099
 are still a walk etcetera etcetera 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.650
 when should I go to the next heart 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.599
 could you why 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.489
 at this heart point how to defend 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.450
 about the hardpoint et cetera 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.129
 qua 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.409
 the jar inside and in terms of the objects 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.269
 I really enjoy playing hardpoint 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:32.040
 but really great time, quite a good one 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.560
 fucking glad you come back and fans 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.849
 Landmines week we did have to go 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.170
 about stupid people 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.250
 and what I mean by stupid people is 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.200
 not stupid people came low but what 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:48.120
 I mean by being human is saying things 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.370
 where you have not thought and that 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.500
 are very many things 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.519
 you don't have to worry about everything 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.950
 think before you take it out of your mouth 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.239
 come now make this video and i think 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.250
 of course after what I am going to say 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.849
 but I see myself out of my mouth 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:06.079
 comes in terms of vocabulary but if you do something 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:08.430
 and that has a pretty big one 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.750
 impression as it were just like that 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.000
 to say 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.299
 then you should have thought about 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.950
 if you say he found in the video 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:21.090
 you say your rasci is the booze 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.709
 you probably really have that now 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.359
 considered whether this nature intended as one 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.069
 joke but meant as serious 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.799
 we have now really thought about what 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:33.269
 then what will happen to me then 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:35.519
 video of course what I'm about it 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.470
 starts thinking and 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.750
 I would like many more other examples 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.970
 you just have an example like you 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.549
 for example that is not on youtube that 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:48.030
 for example, he is going to plan the cheese 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:51.510
 and you really have something to invent how you do it 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.310
 the cheese goes gaffer and you see that you have the 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.739
 cheese slicer wrong about old you turn it 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.540
 and someone says at that moment you 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.040
 got that cheese slicer wrong to troy and 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.030
 so had turned around 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.949
 I just want a stupid one 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.900
 comment and I irritate me sometimes and let 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.199
 immeasurably someone like my room 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.319
 within 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:09.329
 I get up at full with a say-it or the 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.099
 I get up and see that light is therefore me 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.709
 that an hour is really such a kind is already one 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:16.049
 hour and I someone serious 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.659
 30 seconds later from jesus you stand 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.280
 now beware it's an hour and i was that 

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.750
 I just said 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.510
 yet where should this say again and 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.789
 there anyway irritate me hard without 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.200
 it is that she finds such comments 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.900
 me and my just really really bad 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.190
 stupid and it happens very often and 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.530
 You also look very often and too 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.020
 actually i could have some comments 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.710
 Laughing at those are just real 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.870
 Mongolian so to speak 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.100
 but some comments annoy me so much 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.259
 hard on i do n't know why i got that 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.070
 but that's just something i really do 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:49.770
 have a very long time and yes I don't know 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.900
 don't know if when i say something 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.550
 evil so kind of things so what 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.440
 really just makes no sense 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.169
 then usually think about after some 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.250
 People also ask for example there is one 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.850
 TV program 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.039
 and then the question is what falls faster 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.650
 and 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:10.350
 and feathers or a brick both in the 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.990
 space fit this as expected and when you get over 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.090
 makes you think then you know what one 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.830
 faster from 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.220
 But what people do then is before them 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:23.970
 have thought about the question 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:26.039
 I will have no idea 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.680
 if you think about the freight and for a moment 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:30.120
 you just know the answer right away and 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.830
 that 's just tired of it 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.090
 small little second of this you leave 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.830
 brain work think about the answer 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.599
 after a pan you have answer it is not 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.460
 only with that kind of science question 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:42.120
 but that me everything that just really me 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.370
 everything you can swim praise bubbles 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.289
 Well itself and then start thinking about 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.030
 is it from well maybe it can 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.250
 maybe maybe you can have one 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.990
 swim as you think further 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.210
 bubbles that means the air 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.280
 of course from below the water to 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.349
 goes above the water and the water becomes 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.820
 and also spit to the side 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:00.990
 That means you probably too 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.680
 to the site that is played as 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.729
 called 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.289
 bubbles are pondering because some 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:09.870
 People then do is you get that question 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:11.639
 is think of i know now i am you now 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.590
 do you know from maybe an i of yes me 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:15.930
 know that I have thought about it and that 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.280
 we think about it we also say whole 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.470
 often than to the people who are such a stupid one 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.030
 makes a comment say I think if 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.040
 think and then just put sirius on 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.080
 energy in an eye there is one here 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.020
 a head and would be thought and then 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:31.110
 then they arrive if I can't 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:34.140
 and think of me applause for you boy 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.400
 it is probably not possible indeed 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.930
 and go look at the answer or watch 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.860
 how much that series do I know for what is the 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.120
 where it is at 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.830
 And then you actually see it 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.940
 maybe not maybe maybe me too 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.950
 have no idea 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.870
 but of course that is just m6 smart 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.700
 I want to think about that today 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.600
 always think a nice kemperman no 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:53.190
 just always as fast as you like that 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.980
 get questions don't immediately think of it 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.270
 I am now I upload idea because then 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.980
 you can never find out what 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.660
 actual answer is so try 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.040
 think logically 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.300
 I myself am a person who rather t breed 

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.590
 sometimes I just go for a moment together 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.480
 smile like a real person 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.880
 makes a ridiculously stupid comment 

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.650
 and you too youtubers i happy there now 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.940
 very very often with real life 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.500
 I come across a few times every day 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.760
 If you have to watch Mars , you just have to 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.560
 if someone has to ask you something stupid 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.540
 I think just as well ask why you 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.310
 that and your back will come because that 

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.200
 just thought down in boxes and 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.240
 logical thinking smart thinking and just for a moment 

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.500
 think before you say something is whole 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.240
 very important 

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:31.590
 which also makes you janie in the per after that 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:33.060
 so you don't get anyone 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.410
 get angry with you or make you not 

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.400
 someone I think gets smarter 

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.690
 then you are while you just have 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.190
 thought 

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.260
