00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.760
 our first animal and the first 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:27.060
 the animal is generally a centipede 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:29.640
 type so on it's a grasshopper they have by the way 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:40.469
 everyone has special sounds especially 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:43.110
 there are them wrong this is butterflies they 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.879
 so far one color well, I hope with 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:51.950
 updating this mod will be their 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.950
 much more following tor its probably 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:07.850
 make something like infinite 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.670
 source and zaspavnen fish here now 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.490

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:18.920
 such fish we can find and kill 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:22.130
 with one stroke unfortunately yes oh not even 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.180

 from fish what do you think and if you are on 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:37.899
 in fact the fish fell out to 1 well 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:44.000
 Well guys go further on with us 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:50.960
 such a mob as an angel is not why an angel 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.729
 it seems to be also a fish income which would 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.580
 swim in the water and she 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:02:03.170
 toothy in the course means that she 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:06.409
 not peaceful well, if she cut down 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.709

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:13.760
 peaceful so on man man ray is me 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:18.320
 no you don't understand what it is who is like 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.930
 This is why it is not easy and I understand further 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.350
 we still have a marine creature 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:28.120
 Seal Fur Seal yes it's such a 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.120
 huge lend 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.200
 Spaniards its some kind of small 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:37.510
 cells what type of such 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.459
 because it just sees ugly and 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:45.260

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:49.130

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.350
 of course the snake is such a language and here 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.980
 such a glinka only she for some reason did not 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:58.819
 period and by the way falls I never found out 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.859
 so nothing falls that if under a 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:05.090
 poor fur seal of you two 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:09.919
