00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:12.830
 hello everyone today we are going to do 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.430
 a kind of instrument cymbals 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.259
 for children to have fun 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.580
 Well, what I've done is take two 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.580
 two glass can lids 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.870
 two strips I will tell you if you want the 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.360
 measure 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.770
 but this you have to measure with the 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.250
 hands of your children or that does not go to 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.250
 use it 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:39.130
 those centimeter leads and this more 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.620
 or less is the size of how you see 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.240
 of the lid and I have done this 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.030
 size because my daughter's hand more or 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.710
 less occupies a little more than this and I 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.210
 I wanted it so good for what we will 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.510
 to do is take the covers and put them 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.300
 hit them a block in here as you see 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.239
 I have stuck a carton I made a circle 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.850
 what is expected in here because this 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.670
 let's paste here 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.190
 so that it does not sink much 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:11.290
 we stick the cardboard good 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.909
 Well what we are going to do first 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.909
 is to paste 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.249
 the strips are like this leaving a little bit 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.110
 hollow so that the hand of the girl or the 

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:23.800
 child say that 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.540
 would come in like this we're going to take the 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.110
 gun 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.110
 i 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.760
 on the other side if to you more or 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.840
 least two fingers enter us for a child 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.840
 of two years worth 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.180
 and we will do the same in this other 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.870
 yes 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.760
 I calculated it like that by sticking my hand 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.980
 Well now the only thing we have 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.680
 what to do is paste this 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.530
 in the tapas here not where we have 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.150
 put the cardboard we put glue 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.150
 hot also with the gun 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.550
 I have not taken off to be this with 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:01.220
 glue 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.220
 looser has taken off 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.239
 but nothing happens we throw him glue 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.239
 hot 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.840
 and we solve 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.840
 and this would be the same 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.299
 we do not have glue 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.379
 and it would be of these instruments in what 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.150
 therefore it is that the children 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:32.939
 can put some hands 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.150
 and for this Christmas for example for 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:38.819
 New Year's Eve or for a party where 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.370
 makes more noise than normal 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:44.560
 well go with your super instrument 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.360
 to play castanets or cymbals 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.760
 whatever you want to call it, I hope that 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.799
 I liked you let me like a 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.099
 comment and see you in the next 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.099
