00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:12.150
 well I cdh engines as you see 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.519
 sports already from the entrance door sill 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.550
 with the inscription 190 horses background 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.150
 carbon keyless key with the button 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.949
 Ignition qua lit 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.529
 we turn on as you see on the date the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.630
 change we have the indication 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.180
 of the sample this is 0 0 0 ma 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.260
 will be 250 for Italy 190 horses but 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.200
 the interesting thing is the system of 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.300
 fashions that we have below the system of 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.790
 surfing what it does 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.660
 basically the mapping changes us 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:51.480
 engine and steering as you see 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.750
 we have the three options 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.970
 and next to each option comes 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.310
 combined with an indication on normal 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.340
 we have the power supplied to the engine up 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.750
 sport we have the boost of the round because 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.550
 the 1600 turbo engine then we'll go to 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.260
 see it on here we have the level of 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.330
 ecology really how much they crush 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.460
 the accelerator or to the right the setup of the 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.229
 display driving information from 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.610
 how long we are driving i 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.180
 kilometers made the average speed 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.920
 as well as an accelerometer on its two 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.759
 axes therefore lateral acceleration e 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.190
 braking acceleration and information 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.340
 here is eco means how much we have 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.920
 consumed during the week 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.130
 from the start or a manual reset 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.259
 very nice the possibility of a double 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.850
 function of all buttons 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.800
 indeed pressing the button 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.080
 air conditioning 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.240
 the bridge is transformed and we can here 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.090
 completely control the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.160
 air conditioning that with the push of 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.229
 this button goes into mode 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.840
 automatic possibility to adjust the 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.550
 a.moro temperature therefore not 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.100
 there is the company to divide right side 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.720
 and part and left side 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.300
 as for the other equipment 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.430
 standard of this version obviously i 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.580
 heated seats and then I'm a little bit 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.630
 uncomfortable switching on and off but 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.390
 very functional heating 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.850
 we have the upholstery completely in 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.640
 very beautiful skin 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.160
 beautiful stitching red stitching but 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.090
 now I'd go down to show the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.739
 for this purpose I open the engine by pressing 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.299
 the lever of course to release 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.970
 the car made three big whys 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.790
 having the keyless and revenge in my pocket 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.360
 warned me that I left the engine 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:52.840
 1000 centuries we are before is a is a turbo 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.360
 at 190 horses 250 newtonmetri 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.620
 of couple to a noise indeed 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.140
 particularly it looks like a video game 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.730
 Japanese is perhaps a little noise 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.099
 what this juke is missing because the 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.890
 speed power from 0 to 100 in 8 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.019
 absolutely seconds there 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.720
 beautiful low beam headlights 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:14.319
 this is this mushroom this raised lighthouse 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.470
 with position lights and arrows for 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:20.709
 as for the circles, they are up 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:24.700
 this version 17-inch blacks 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:27.390
 tires 215 55 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:32.069
 of shoulder electric mirrors 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:34.480
 automatically heated and foldable 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.599
 the last thing I wanted to show the 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.120
 dashboard if luca manages to frame 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:42.340
 Apple tree 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.440
 here he gives us practically all the 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.180
 information we need inconveniently i 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.090
 buttons for adjusting brightness and for 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.519
 change the info on average consumption on 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.160
 driving time on partial kilometers and 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:57.160
 on the total kilometers, however, we say that 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.180
 the indication the indication is x hd 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.180
