switches it on I'll show you how all
works<00:03:46.980> once<00:03:47.280> it's<00:03:47.430> all<00:03:47.520> connected

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.680 

wuntch<00:04:00.510> everything<00:04:01.080> connected<00:04:02.360> you'll<00:04:03.360> want

wuntch everything connected you'll want
to<00:04:03.780> make<00:04:04.280> sure<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.670> sub<00:04:06.630> three<00:04:06.870> outs<00:04:07.020> are

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
to make sure the sub three outs are

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.550 
to make sure the sub three outs are
activated<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:08.390> like<00:04:09.390> all<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:10.020> settings<00:04:10.350> are

activated and like all the settings are

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.370 
activated and like all the settings are
right<00:04:10.760> so<00:04:11.760> you<00:04:11.820> get<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.030> best<00:04:12.180> space<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:13.140> all

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
right so you get the best space and all

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:21.080 
right so you get the best space and all

to the rear speakers and then I'll

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.660 
to the rear speakers and then I'll
subwoofers<00:04:45.540> see<00:04:46.670> rear<00:04:47.670> speakers<00:04:48.150> sobs<00:04:48.930> I<00:04:49.670> just

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
subwoofers see rear speakers sobs I just

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:57.500 
subwoofers see rear speakers sobs I just
leave<00:04:50.790> on<00:04:50.910> some<00:04:53.030> and<00:04:55.550> make<00:04:56.550> sure<00:04:56.730> you<00:04:56.850> demo<00:04:57.120> is

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510

your<00:06:14.310> wiring<00:06:14.640> kit<00:06:15.229> you<00:06:16.229> would<00:06:16.410> it<00:06:17.280> would<00:06:17.430> it's

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
your wiring kit you would it would it's

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.090 
your wiring kit you would it would it's
recommended<00:06:18.570> that<00:06:18.630> you<00:06:18.750> keep<00:06:19.020> your<00:06:19.100> power

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
recommended that you keep your power

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.070 
recommended that you keep your power
cables<00:06:20.610> separated<00:06:21.210> so<00:06:21.570> you<00:06:21.720> might<00:06:21.870> want<00:06:22.050> to

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
cables separated so you might want to

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.330 
cables separated so you might want to
have<00:06:22.169> it<00:06:22.289> on<00:06:22.500> one<00:06:23.250> side<00:06:23.750> and<00:06:24.750> has<00:06:25.410> RCA<00:06:25.680> cables

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
have it on one side and has RCA cables

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.159 
have it on one side and has RCA cables
on<00:06:26.460> the<00:06:26.550> other<00:06:26.700> side<00:06:27.000> cuz<00:06:27.479> I'm<00:06:28.340> with<00:06:29.340> the<00:06:30.169> child

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
on the other side cuz I'm with the child

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.210 
on the other side cuz I'm with the child
that<00:06:31.410> the<00:06:33.050> wiring<00:06:34.050> kit<00:06:34.320> gives<00:06:34.530> out<00:06:34.800> it<00:06:35.070> can

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 
that the wiring kit gives out it can

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.730 
that the wiring kit gives out it can
also<00:06:35.400> distort<00:06:35.970> the<00:06:36.150> RCA<00:06:36.900> cables<00:06:37.289> so<00:06:37.470> you<00:06:37.560> might

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
also distort the RCA cables so you might

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.180 
also distort the RCA cables so you might
get<00:06:37.860> distortion<00:06:38.960> so<00:06:39.960> so<00:06:40.470> it's<00:06:40.620> a<00:06:40.680> good<00:06:40.890> idea<00:06:40.979> to

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
get distortion so so it's a good idea to

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.960 
get distortion so so it's a good idea to
have<00:06:41.400> like<00:06:42.380> have<00:06:43.380> one<00:06:43.740> on<00:06:44.160> the<00:06:44.370> side<00:06:44.550> panels

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:44.970 
have like have one on the side panels

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.960 
have like have one on the side panels
with<00:06:45.510> dog<00:06:45.750> eyes<00:06:45.960> and<00:06:46.740> have<00:06:46.950> the<00:06:47.100> the<00:06:47.700> other

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970 
with dog eyes and have the the other

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.010 
with dog eyes and have the the other
cables<00:06:48.419> and<00:06:48.510> other<00:06:48.630> side<00:06:49.010> yeah
