00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
hey guys kale appear from Team hacks and

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.789 
hey guys kale appear from Team hacks and
I<00:00:03.149> got<00:00:03.300> a<00:00:03.330> lot<00:00:03.570> of<00:00:03.600> good<00:00:03.870> comments<00:00:04.140> saying<00:00:04.589> you

guys wanted me to make this video series
so<00:00:07.170> I'm<00:00:07.589> gonna<00:00:07.830> start<00:00:08.429> it<00:00:08.519> off<00:00:08.639> with<00:00:08.880> probably

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
so I'm gonna start it off with probably

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.270 
so I'm gonna start it off with probably
one<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.960> most<00:00:10.080> useful<00:00:10.410> things<00:00:10.889> in<00:00:11.130> bug

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
one of the most useful things in bug

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.980 
one of the most useful things in bug
abuse<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.820> that's<00:00:12.000> going<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.240> be<00:00:12.330> interfaces

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
abuse and that's going to be interfaces

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.010 
abuse and that's going to be interfaces
so<00:00:13.500> let's<00:00:13.679> jump<00:00:14.009> right<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.540> the<00:00:15.540> best<00:00:15.780> way<00:00:15.960> to

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
so let's jump right in the best way to

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.540 
so let's jump right in the best way to
explain<00:00:16.350> what<00:00:16.590> an<00:00:16.680> interface<00:00:17.010> can<00:00:17.190> do<00:00:17.340> is

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
explain what an interface can do is

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.790 
explain what an interface can do is
basically<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.750> can<00:00:18.930> delay<00:00:19.230> commands<00:00:19.650> from

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
basically it can delay commands from

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.349 
basically it can delay commands from
being<00:00:20.100> placed<00:00:20.340> on<00:00:20.520> your<00:00:20.670> character<00:00:21.090> while

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
being placed on your character while

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.070 
being placed on your character while
it's<00:00:21.600> open<00:00:22.050> whether<00:00:22.949> or<00:00:23.160> not<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.519> being

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
it's open whether or not this is being

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.750 
it's open whether or not this is being
forced<00:00:25.080> teleported<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.859> certain<00:00:26.220> area<00:00:26.580> or

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
forced teleported to a certain area or

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.849 
forced teleported to a certain area or
keeping<00:00:27.510> items<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.019> your<00:00:28.050> inventory<00:00:28.289> where

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
keeping items in your inventory where

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.740 
keeping items in your inventory where
you're<00:00:28.980> not<00:00:29.099> supposed<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.580> have<00:00:29.760> them<00:00:29.970> okay

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
you're not supposed to have them okay

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.910 
you're not supposed to have them okay
guys<00:00:30.960> now<00:00:30.990> I'm<00:00:31.349> going<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.560> show<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.740> some

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
guys now I'm going to show you some

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.350 
guys now I'm going to show you some
interfaces<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.430> are<00:00:32.579> really<00:00:32.850> easy<00:00:33.120> to

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
interfaces that are really easy to

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.120 
interfaces that are really easy to
access<00:00:33.840> I'm<00:00:34.350> going<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.559> start<00:00:34.770> off<00:00:34.860> with<00:00:34.980> my

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
access I'm going to start off with my

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.580 
access I'm going to start off with my
very<00:00:35.370> favorite<00:00:35.820> one<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.960> one<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.559> can

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
very favorite one this one you can

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.920 
very favorite one this one you can
pretty<00:00:37.890> much<00:00:37.980> access<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.640> anywhere<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.420> it

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
pretty much access it anywhere and it

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.200 
pretty much access it anywhere and it
actually<00:00:40.110> comes<00:00:40.800> up<00:00:41.010> through<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.430> stall<00:00:41.910> and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
actually comes up through a stall and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.950 
actually comes up through a stall and
that's<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.960> report<00:00:43.350> abuse<00:00:43.649> one<00:00:44.960> another

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
that's the report abuse one another

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.229 
that's the report abuse one another
really<00:00:46.260> good<00:00:46.469> one<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.070> hotel<00:00:47.460> for<00:00:47.640> one<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
really good one is the hotel for one the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.000 
really good one is the hotel for one the
load<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.629> network<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.200> also<00:00:49.379> comes<00:00:49.710> up<00:00:49.860> to

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
load so network it also comes up to

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.240 
load so network it also comes up to
darkness<00:00:50.730> hall<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.350> also<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.469> clan<00:00:52.770> settings

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
darkness hall and also the clan settings

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.860 
darkness hall and also the clan settings
once<00:00:53.579> will<00:00:53.789> also<00:00:54.149> come<00:00:54.329> up<00:00:54.480> you're<00:00:54.629> installing

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
once will also come up you're installing

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.250 
once will also come up you're installing
you<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.199> access<00:00:55.469> those<00:00:55.680> spot<00:00:56.129> anywhere<00:00:56.660> a<00:00:57.660> few

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
you can access those spot anywhere a few

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.020 
you can access those spot anywhere a few
interfaces<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:58.890> don't<00:00:59.190> come<00:00:59.340> up<00:00:59.489> up<00:00:59.699> their

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
interfaces that don't come up up their

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.389 
interfaces that don't come up up their
installs<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.750> but<00:01:01.050> they're<00:01:01.920> still<00:01:02.070> really

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
installs the but they're still really

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.060 
installs the but they're still really
useful<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:02.969> some<00:01:03.180> situations<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.589> actually

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
useful in some situations is actually

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.250 
useful in some situations is actually
like<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> French<00:01:05.519> at<00:01:05.760> setting<00:01:06.119> or<00:01:06.270> maybe<00:01:07.049> your

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
like a French at setting or maybe your

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.899 
like a French at setting or maybe your
money<00:01:07.470> pouch

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.910 

to<00:01:11.329> get<00:01:11.479> a<00:01:11.509> better<00:01:11.600> understanding<00:01:12.499> of<00:01:12.649> how<00:01:12.799> it

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
to get a better understanding of how it

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.039 
to get a better understanding of how it
interfaces<00:01:13.130> work<00:01:13.640> watch<00:01:14.210> this<00:01:14.450> clip<00:01:14.719> of<00:01:14.899> me

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
interfaces work watch this clip of me

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:16.989 
interfaces work watch this clip of me
going<00:01:15.229> into<00:01:15.439> vine<00:01:15.679> sweeper<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:16.310> teleporting

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:16.999 
going into vine sweeper and teleporting

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:18.300 
going into vine sweeper and teleporting
out<00:01:17.090> with<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:17.359> roots<00:01:17.539> of<00:01:17.719> my<00:01:17.840> inventory

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
out with the roots of my inventory

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.859 
out with the roots of my inventory
normally<00:01:19.310> if<00:01:19.429> you<00:01:19.520> were<00:01:19.640> to<00:01:19.759> teleport<00:01:20.179> out<00:01:20.329> the

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
normally if you were to teleport out the

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.450 
normally if you were to teleport out the
roots<00:01:21.079> would<00:01:21.259> immediately<00:01:21.590> disappear<00:01:22.369> from

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
roots would immediately disappear from

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.550 
roots would immediately disappear from
your<00:01:22.549> inventory<00:01:22.819> but<00:01:23.569> as<00:01:23.689> you<00:01:23.840> can<00:01:24.020> see<00:01:24.259> when<00:01:24.530> i

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
your inventory but as you can see when i

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.679 
your inventory but as you can see when i
teleported<00:01:25.130> out<00:01:25.250> i<00:01:25.310> did<00:01:25.819> open<00:01:26.299> up<00:01:26.390> it<00:01:26.539> in<00:01:26.630> her

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
teleported out i did open up it in her

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.599 
teleported out i did open up it in her
face<00:01:26.899> and<00:01:27.200> I<00:01:27.439> was<00:01:27.590> able<00:01:27.709> to<00:01:27.829> keep<00:01:28.009> them<00:01:28.219> in<00:01:28.399> my

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:28.609 
face and I was able to keep them in my

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:30.429 
face and I was able to keep them in my
inventory<00:01:28.909> until<00:01:29.329> the<00:01:29.630> interface<00:01:29.929> was<00:01:30.140> closed

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
inventory until the interface was closed

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.709 
inventory until the interface was closed
this<00:01:31.310> shows<00:01:31.579> how<00:01:31.789> you<00:01:31.849> can<00:01:31.969> delay<00:01:32.689> the

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
this shows how you can delay the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.630 
this shows how you can delay the
commands<00:01:33.469> from<00:01:33.649> being<00:01:33.950> forced<00:01:34.369> on<00:01:34.459> your

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
commands from being forced on your

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.789 
commands from being forced on your
player<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.119> in<00:01:35.299> this<00:01:35.899> case<00:01:36.109> the<00:01:36.319> command<00:01:36.619> was

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
player and in this case the command was

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.870 
player and in this case the command was
to<00:01:37.069> remove<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.789> roots<00:01:38.000> from<00:01:38.179> my<00:01:38.390> inventory

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
to remove the roots from my inventory

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.949 
to remove the roots from my inventory
now<00:01:40.880> i'm<00:01:41.060> going<00:01:41.240> to<00:01:41.299> show<00:01:41.509> you<00:01:41.539> an<00:01:41.810> old

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:41.959 
now i'm going to show you an old

interface and this clip is actually from

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.639 
interface and this clip is actually from

so<00:02:28.060> guys<00:02:28.240> what<00:02:28.540> we've<00:02:28.720> learned<00:02:28.990> in<00:02:29.200> this<00:02:29.350> video

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
so guys what we've learned in this video

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.760 
so guys what we've learned in this video
is<00:02:29.920> interfaces<00:02:30.730> are<00:02:30.990> key<00:02:31.990> essential<00:02:32.470> part<00:02:32.709> of

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
is interfaces are key essential part of

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.160 
is interfaces are key essential part of
bug<00:02:33.010> abuse<00:02:33.340> they<00:02:33.970> stack<00:02:34.360> commands<00:02:34.720> behind

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
bug abuse they stack commands behind

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.290 
bug abuse they stack commands behind
them<00:02:35.319> and<00:02:35.470> they<00:02:35.920> prevent<00:02:36.280> effects<00:02:36.790> from<00:02:37.030> being

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
them and they prevent effects from being

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.850 
them and they prevent effects from being
applied<00:02:37.569> on<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.810> character<00:02:38.230> being<00:02:38.470> taken

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
applied on the character being taken

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.860 
applied on the character being taken
away<00:02:38.950> but<00:02:39.819> there<00:02:39.970> are<00:02:40.060> some<00:02:40.270> things<00:02:40.510> that

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
away but there are some things that

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.890 
away but there are some things that
interface<00:02:41.770> cannot<00:02:42.370> delay<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.360> for<00:02:43.750> that

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
interface cannot delay and for that

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.880 
interface cannot delay and for that
