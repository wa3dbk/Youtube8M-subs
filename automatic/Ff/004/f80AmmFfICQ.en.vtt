hey guys doing gun tutorial for you this
one's<00:00:03.689> going<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:03.899> be<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.230> point<00:00:04.440> of<00:00:04.529> it<00:00:04.680> all<00:00:04.770> by

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
one's going to be the point of it all by

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.070 
one's going to be the point of it all by
Anthony<00:00:05.460> Hamilton<00:00:05.640> I'm<00:00:06.540> going<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:06.810> play

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
Anthony Hamilton I'm going to play

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.930 
Anthony Hamilton I'm going to play
through<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.470> first<00:00:08.099> chord<00:00:08.370> so<00:00:08.550> you<00:00:08.639> can<00:00:08.790> see

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
through the first chord so you can see

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:22.460 
through the first chord so you can see
what<00:00:09.059> it<00:00:09.150> sounds<00:00:09.450> like<00:00:21.109> so<00:00:22.109> those<00:00:22.289> are<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
what it sounds like so those are the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.080 
what it sounds like so those are the
chords<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:22.949> are<00:00:23.010> used<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.430> verse<00:00:23.640> we're

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
chords that are used in the verse we're

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:31.540 
chords that are used in the verse we're
going<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.300> start<00:00:24.510> on<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> G<00:00:25.019> major<00:00:25.230> 7

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.210 

and<00:00:32.240> we're<00:00:32.810> bouncing<00:00:33.170> back<00:00:33.380> between<00:00:33.740> that<00:00:34.040> and

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
and we're bouncing back between that and

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:41.819 
and we're bouncing back between that and
the<00:00:34.760> C<00:00:35.240> major<00:00:35.480> nine

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:48.710 

or<00:00:42.340> you<00:00:42.430> could<00:00:42.579> play<00:00:42.700> the<00:00:43.059> C<00:00:43.390> major<00:00:43.570> second

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.670 

your<00:00:49.720> preference<00:00:50.200> and<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:51.670> do<00:00:51.820> that<00:00:51.970> about

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
your preference and you do that about

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:06.270 
your preference and you do that about
take<00:00:53.680> three<00:00:53.920> times<00:01:04.860> then<00:01:05.860> you<00:01:05.920> get<00:01:06.070> to<00:01:06.190> the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
take three times then you get to the

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:16.580 
take three times then you get to the
start<00:01:06.580> time<00:01:13.020> then<00:01:14.020> when<00:01:14.140> you<00:01:14.229> end<00:01:14.470> you<00:01:15.160> go<00:01:15.340> to

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
start time then when you end you go to

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.260 
start time then when you end you go to
its<00:01:18.120> be<00:01:19.120> seven<00:01:19.600> sharp<00:01:19.840> nine<00:01:20.470> I<00:01:20.920> believe

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.160 

you<00:01:25.270> know

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
you know

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.170 
you know
then<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.290> get<00:01:28.410> to<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.710> point<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.790> all<00:01:29.910> apart

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
then we get to the point of it all apart

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:38.550 
then we get to the point of it all apart
and<00:01:31.220> just<00:01:32.220> go<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.460> an<00:01:33.030> F<00:01:33.330> major<00:01:34.080> 7

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.170 

to<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.430> minor<00:01:39.760> 7

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.310 

and<00:01:45.270> end<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:47.040> D<00:01:47.340> major<00:01:47.640> 11

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.740 

so<00:01:51.190> let's<00:01:51.340> do<00:01:51.520> that<00:01:51.550> last<00:01:52.270> part<00:01:52.660> of<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:52.810> verse

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
so let's do that last part of the verse

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:06.390 
so let's do that last part of the verse
third<00:01:55.750> time<00:02:04.080> and<00:02:05.080> then<00:02:05.230> we<00:02:05.320> start<00:02:05.620> the<00:02:05.830> course

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
third time and then we start the course

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.930 
third time and then we start the course
which<00:02:07.120> is<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.960> same<00:02:08.440> as<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:08.979> verse<00:02:09.190> pretty

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
which is the same as the verse pretty

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.980 
which is the same as the verse pretty
much<00:02:14.100> so<00:02:15.100> that's<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.700> verse<00:02:16.120> chords<00:02:16.660> and

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
much so that's the verse chords and

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.580 
much so that's the verse chords and
course<00:02:17.320> chords<00:02:19.440> yeah<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:22.720> getting<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.260> the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
course chords yeah so getting to the

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.900 
course chords yeah so getting to the
bridge<00:02:24.490> when<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.480> get<00:02:25.660> back<00:02:26.850> after<00:02:27.850> you

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
bridge when you get back after you

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.830 
bridge when you get back after you
finish<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:29.020> course

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
take a look at my cover to get the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.360 
take a look at my cover to get the
timing<00:02:43.690> for<00:02:43.959> all<00:02:44.049> this<00:02:44.200> stuff<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:45.040> where<00:02:45.220> it's

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
timing for all this stuff and where it's

00:02:45.370 --> 00:03:02.750 
timing for all this stuff and where it's
at

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.080

settlement<00:03:30.350> so<00:03:31.350> again<00:03:31.650> just<00:03:31.680> check<00:03:32.010> out<00:03:32.400> my

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
settlement so again just check out my

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.850 
settlement so again just check out my
cover<00:03:33.410> to<00:03:35.210> get<00:03:36.210> the<00:03:36.360> timing<00:03:36.600> for<00:03:36.840> all<00:03:36.990> that<00:03:37.320> but

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
cover to get the timing for all that but

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:57.080 
cover to get the timing for all that but
that's<00:03:38.040> what<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:55.520> that's<00:03:56.520> what<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.850> bridge

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
that's what the that's what the bridge

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:06.380 
that's what the that's what the bridge
does<00:04:03.530> and<00:04:04.530> then<00:04:05.220> at<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:05.730> very<00:04:05.760> end<00:04:06.000> when<00:04:06.300> you

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
does and then at the very end when you

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.800 
does and then at the very end when you
come<00:04:06.570> out<00:04:06.600> of<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:07.020> it's<00:04:07.260> just<00:04:07.740> the<00:04:08.030> D<00:04:09.030> major<00:04:09.270> 11

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
come out of it it's just the D major 11

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.680 
come out of it it's just the D major 11
again<00:04:10.050> that<00:04:10.890> we<00:04:11.010> already<00:04:11.280> know<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:12.510> then<00:04:12.630> we

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
again that we already know and then we

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.860 
again that we already know and then we
go<00:04:12.840> back<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:13.740> course<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:15.510> only<00:04:15.630> thing

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
go back to the course and the only thing

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.850 
go back to the course and the only thing
that's<00:04:16.080> different<00:04:16.170> is<00:04:16.680> we're<00:04:17.550> adding<00:04:17.910> that<00:04:18.860> b7

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:19.860 
that's different is we're adding that b7

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:30.650 
that's different is we're adding that b7
sharp<00:04:20.610> 9<00:04:20.850> in<00:04:21.120> there<00:04:27.710> right<00:04:28.710> before<00:04:29.190> we<00:04:29.660> change

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
sharp 9 in there right before we change

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.890 
sharp 9 in there right before we change
to<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.020> C<00:04:31.410> major<00:04:31.620> 9
