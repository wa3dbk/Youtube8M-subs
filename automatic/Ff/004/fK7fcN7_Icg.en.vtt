they're putting their hair through a

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.790 
they're putting their hair through a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
process that does just that very thing

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.250 
process that does just that very thing
over<00:00:38.730> time<00:00:39.030> someone<00:00:39.510> who<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.719> locking<00:00:40.079> their

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
over time someone who is locking their

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.530 
over time someone who is locking their
hair<00:00:40.530> want<00:00:41.070> their<00:00:41.280> hairs<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.910> become<00:00:42.300> so

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
hair want their hairs to become so

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.470 
hair want their hairs to become so
interlocked<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.620> they<00:00:43.950> turn<00:00:44.370> into<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:45.059> lock

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
interlocked that they turn into a lock

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.779 
interlocked that they turn into a lock
so<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.350> when<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.620> actually<00:00:46.800> wash<00:00:47.309> your<00:00:47.579> hair

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789

so that when you actually wash your hair
or<00:00:47.969> style<00:00:48.300> your<00:00:48.570> hair<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.289> style<00:00:49.559> doesn't<00:00:50.160> get

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
loose or the hair doesn't become

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.830 
loose or the hair doesn't become
untangled<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.760> could<00:00:54.120> take<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.570> long

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
untangled and this could take a long

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.110 
untangled and this could take a long
time<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:55.440> someone<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.829> lock<00:00:56.129> their<00:00:56.370> hair<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
time for someone to lock their hair the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.420 
time for someone to lock their hair the
amount<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.660> times<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.350> between<00:00:58.500> how<00:00:59.070> long<00:00:59.309> it

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
amount of times in between how long it

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.400 
amount of times in between how long it
actually<00:00:59.460> takes<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.180> lot<00:01:00.359> depends<00:01:01.109> from<00:01:01.320> person

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
actually takes a lot depends from person

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.429 
actually takes a lot depends from person
to<00:01:01.949> person<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.609> even<00:01:02.910> hair<00:01:03.210> type<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:04.140> hair

type
so<00:01:05.489> people<00:01:05.790> who<00:01:06.060> lock<00:01:06.360> their<00:01:06.630> hair<00:01:06.869> obviously

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
so people who lock their hair obviously

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.800 
so people who lock their hair obviously
have<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.830> go<00:01:07.979> through<00:01:08.250> just<00:01:08.640> as<00:01:08.820> much<00:01:09.090> patience

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
have to go through just as much patience

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.140 
have to go through just as much patience
and<00:01:09.960> time<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.830> finally<00:01:11.310> get<00:01:11.490> their<00:01:11.729> hair<00:01:11.939> to

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
and time to finally get their hair to

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.289 
and time to finally get their hair to
where<00:01:12.330> they<00:01:12.510> want<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.990> but<00:01:13.799> people<00:01:14.520> feel<00:01:15.000> like

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
where they want it but people feel like

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.630 
where they want it but people feel like
those<00:01:15.780> who<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.320> locks<00:01:16.680> actually<00:01:17.280> grow<00:01:17.460> their

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
those who have locks actually grow their

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.330 
those who have locks actually grow their
hair<00:01:17.670> faster<00:01:18.509> or<00:01:18.720> longer<00:01:19.200> than<00:01:19.710> someone<00:01:20.159> who

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
hair faster or longer than someone who

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.149 
hair faster or longer than someone who
doesn't<00:01:20.640> have<00:01:20.820> locks<00:01:21.240> because<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.560> can<00:01:22.830> see

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
doesn't have locks because you can see

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.010 
doesn't have locks because you can see
the<00:01:23.430> difference<00:01:23.909> between<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.479> links<00:01:24.900> and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the difference between the links and

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.780 
the difference between the links and
sometimes<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.979> look<00:01:26.100> at<00:01:26.250> someone<00:01:26.610> who's

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
sometimes you look at someone who's

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.969 
sometimes you look at someone who's
starting<00:01:27.060> with<00:01:27.360> locks<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.900> then<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.380> year<00:01:28.680> now

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
starting with locks and then a year now

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.160 
starting with locks and then a year now
or<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> year<00:01:29.490> later<00:01:29.759> than<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.540> they<00:01:30.840> seem<00:01:31.049> to

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
or a year later than that they seem to

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.120 
or a year later than that they seem to
have<00:01:31.320> really<00:01:31.740> long<00:01:32.159> hair<00:01:32.659> so<00:01:33.659> my<00:01:34.259> take<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
have really long hair so my take on the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.789 
have really long hair so my take on the
whole<00:01:35.369> locking<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.540> dreadlocks<00:01:37.170> however<00:01:37.590> you

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
whole locking and dreadlocks however you

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.670 
whole locking and dreadlocks however you
want<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.159> call<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.579> my<00:01:39.119> take<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.689> locking<00:01:40.409> is

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
want to call it my take on locking is

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.330 
want to call it my take on locking is
that<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.280> feel<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.060> my<00:01:42.299> opinion<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.140> appears<00:01:44.009> to

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
that I feel in my opinion it appears to

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.060 
that I feel in my opinion it appears to
be<00:01:44.549> as<00:01:44.759> lock<00:01:45.149> hair<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.600> growing<00:01:45.930> faster<00:01:46.829> than

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
be as lock hair is growing faster than

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.710 
be as lock hair is growing faster than
hair<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.820> it's<00:01:48.000> not<00:01:48.210> locked

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
hair that it's not locked

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.280 
hair that it's not locked
so<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.979> may<00:01:50.220> say<00:01:50.579> okay

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
so you may say okay

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.320 
so you may say okay
you're<00:01:51.530> silly<00:01:51.830> because<00:01:52.130> when<00:01:52.550> I<00:01:52.580> look<00:01:52.880> at<00:01:53.060> lots

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
you're silly because when I look at lots

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.780 
you're silly because when I look at lots
they<00:01:53.900> look<00:01:54.200> longer<00:01:54.680> than<00:01:55.160> someone<00:01:55.550> who's

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
they look longer than someone who's

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.670 
they look longer than someone who's
trying<00:01:56.120> to<00:01:56.240> grow<00:01:56.540> their<00:01:56.720> hair<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:57.230> it's<00:01:57.470> just

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
not working so there's a couple of

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.300 
not working so there's a couple of
things<00:01:59.870> you<00:02:00.080> just<00:02:00.110> have<00:02:00.350> to<00:02:00.620> really<00:02:00.950> keep<00:02:01.130> in

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
things you just have to really keep in

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.850 
things you just have to really keep in
mind<00:02:01.550> about<00:02:01.880> hair<00:02:02.150> in<00:02:02.270> general<00:02:02.860> everybody's

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
mind about hair in general everybody's

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.340 
mind about hair in general everybody's
hair<00:02:04.100> grows<00:02:04.490> at<00:02:04.790> a<00:02:04.820> constant<00:02:05.360> rate<00:02:05.570> give<00:02:06.200> or

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
hair grows at a constant rate give or

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.130 
hair grows at a constant rate give or
take<00:02:06.560> a<00:02:06.800> little<00:02:07.070> bit<00:02:07.310> off<00:02:07.550> of<00:02:07.580> a<00:02:07.910> percentage<00:02:08.420> so

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
take a little bit off of a percentage so

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.810 
take a little bit off of a percentage so
realistically<00:02:10.130> speaking

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
realistically speaking

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.760 
realistically speaking
just<00:02:11.300> because<00:02:11.630> someone<00:02:11.990> locks<00:02:12.260> their<00:02:12.500> hair

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
just because someone locks their hair

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.160 
just because someone locks their hair
doesn't<00:02:13.310> mean<00:02:13.520> that<00:02:13.940> it<00:02:14.180> makes<00:02:14.600> their<00:02:14.900> hair

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
doesn't mean that it makes their hair

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.190 
doesn't mean that it makes their hair
grow<00:02:15.410> faster<00:02:16.060> everyone<00:02:17.060> has<00:02:17.300> a<00:02:17.330> constant<00:02:17.960> hair

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
grow faster everyone has a constant hair

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.310 
grow faster everyone has a constant hair
growth<00:02:18.470> rate<00:02:18.860> so<00:02:19.820> why<00:02:20.300> does<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.720> seem<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:20.960> be

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
growth rate so why does it seem to be

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.410 
growth rate so why does it seem to be
that<00:02:21.650> locked<00:02:22.040> hair<00:02:22.340> is<00:02:22.520> longer<00:02:22.970> than<00:02:23.090> someone

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
that locked hair is longer than someone

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.250 
that locked hair is longer than someone

than a person who does it the reason why

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.090 
than a person who does it the reason why
is<00:02:44.090> because<00:02:44.120> every<00:02:44.989> bit<00:02:45.200> of<00:02:45.230> hair<00:02:45.590> that's<00:02:45.890> on

is because every bit of hair that's on

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.070 
is because every bit of hair that's on
that<00:02:46.280> person<00:02:46.700> said<00:02:46.910> that's<00:02:47.180> being<00:02:47.480> locked<00:02:47.780> is

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
that person said that's being locked is

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.040 
that person said that's being locked is
being<00:02:48.650> contained<00:02:49.190> within<00:02:49.430> itself<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.600> any

being contained within itself so any

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.680 
being contained within itself so any
shed<00:02:51.440> hairs<00:02:51.739> are<00:02:51.980> built<00:02:52.250> up<00:02:52.459> into<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:53.060> you

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
shed hairs are built up into it you

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.720 
shed hairs are built up into it you
don't<00:02:53.989> have<00:02:54.080> to<00:02:54.230> comb<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.980> bottom<00:02:55.430> or<00:02:55.670> the

don't have to comb the bottom or the

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.240 
don't have to comb the bottom or the
ends<00:02:56.269> of<00:02:56.360> locks<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:56.900> it<00:02:57.050> stays<00:02:57.290> preserved<00:02:57.769> so

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
ends of locks so it stays preserved so

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.060 
ends of locks so it stays preserved so
it's<00:02:58.430> easier<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.780> retain<00:02:59.959> the<00:03:00.440> length<00:03:00.680> of<00:03:00.890> the

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
it's easier to retain the length of the

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.860 
it's easier to retain the length of the
hair<00:03:01.310> if<00:03:01.489> you're<00:03:01.670> just<00:03:01.880> locking<00:03:02.180> everything

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870

their<00:03:11.269> ends<00:03:11.630> as<00:03:11.750> they<00:03:11.930> deal<00:03:12.140> with<00:03:12.170> breakage<00:03:12.799> so

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
their ends as they deal with breakage so

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.550 
their ends as they deal with breakage so
in<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:13.790> sense<00:03:14.120> they're<00:03:14.360> trying<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.810> chase<00:03:15.290> after

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
in a sense they're trying to chase after

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.890 
in a sense they're trying to chase after
the<00:03:16.070> length<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.580> they<00:03:16.850> constantly<00:03:17.420> have<00:03:17.720> to

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
the length and they constantly have to

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.930 
the length and they constantly have to
combat<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.590> issues<00:03:18.950> that<00:03:18.980> happens<00:03:19.640> to<00:03:19.820> the

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
combat the issues that happens to the

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.110 
combat the issues that happens to the
ends<00:03:20.299> of<00:03:20.420> their<00:03:20.690> hair<00:03:20.959> so<00:03:21.709> in<00:03:21.950> my<00:03:22.190> opinion<00:03:22.459> I<00:03:23.030> do

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
ends of their hair so in my opinion I do

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.300 
ends of their hair so in my opinion I do
not<00:03:23.540> think<00:03:23.870> that<00:03:24.019> people<00:03:24.650> who<00:03:24.739> lock<00:03:25.040> their

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
not think that people who lock their

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.640 
not think that people who lock their
hair<00:03:25.580> actually<00:03:26.000> have<00:03:26.480> faster<00:03:26.930> hair<00:03:27.170> growth<00:03:27.200> I

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
hair actually have faster hair growth I

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.890 
hair actually have faster hair growth I
just<00:03:28.370> think<00:03:28.610> that<00:03:28.760> they're<00:03:28.970> able<00:03:29.269> to<00:03:29.510> reach

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
just think that they're able to reach

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.259 
just think that they're able to reach
longer<00:03:30.380> lengths<00:03:31.040> because<00:03:31.430> they're<00:03:31.850> keeping

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
longer lengths because they're keeping

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.810 
longer lengths because they're keeping
all<00:03:32.450> of<00:03:32.870> their<00:03:33.290> hair<00:03:33.530> together<00:03:34.070> it's<00:03:34.700> not

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
all of their hair together it's not

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.940 
all of their hair together it's not
necessary<00:03:35.570> to<00:03:35.660> trim<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.320> damaged<00:03:36.620> ends

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
necessary to trim the damaged ends

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.370 
necessary to trim the damaged ends
because<00:03:37.070> it's<00:03:37.459> all<00:03:37.790> a<00:03:37.820> lock<00:03:38.330> but<00:03:39.019> if<00:03:39.200> you're

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
because it's all a lock but if you're

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.900 
because it's all a lock but if you're
not<00:03:39.590> liking<00:03:40.040> your<00:03:40.220> hair<00:03:40.430> you<00:03:40.580> have<00:03:40.760> to

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
not liking your hair you have to

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.240 
not liking your hair you have to
constantly<00:03:41.299> combat<00:03:42.110> issues<00:03:42.560> with<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:42.920> ends

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
constantly combat issues with the ends
