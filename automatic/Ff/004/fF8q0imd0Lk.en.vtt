okay<00:00:01.319> in<00:00:01.439> this<00:00:01.530> video<00:00:01.709> we're<00:00:02.100> going<00:00:02.250> to<00:00:02.370> do<00:00:02.610> an

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
okay in this video we're going to do an

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.300 
okay in this video we're going to do an
unboxing<00:00:03.270> or<00:00:03.840> in<00:00:03.959> this<00:00:04.049> case<00:00:04.259> an<00:00:04.500> unbagging<00:00:05.160> of

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
unboxing or in this case an unbagging of

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.200 
unboxing or in this case an unbagging of
a<00:00:05.790> harddrive<00:00:06.270> power<00:00:07.140> switch<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:08.099> this<00:00:08.790> device

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
a harddrive power switch and this device

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.060 
a harddrive power switch and this device
is<00:00:09.389> actually<00:00:09.599> going<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:10.110> allow<00:00:10.260> you<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.740> switch

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
is actually going to allow you to switch

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.520 
is actually going to allow you to switch
between<00:00:11.240> hard<00:00:12.240> drives<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.230> can<00:00:13.380> have

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
between hard drives so you can have

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.680 
between hard drives so you can have
different<00:00:13.799> operating<00:00:14.490> systems<00:00:15.000> on<00:00:15.210> different

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
different operating systems on different

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.290 
different operating systems on different
hard<00:00:15.990> drives<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.650> your<00:00:16.890> computer<00:00:17.400> so<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.150> can

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
hard drives in your computer so you can

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.660 
hard drives in your computer so you can
shut<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.720> power<00:00:18.869> off<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.320> all<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.160> other<00:00:20.340> hard

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
shut the power off to all the other hard

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.670 
shut the power off to all the other hard
drives<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.240> just<00:00:21.390> have<00:00:21.570> power<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.170> one<00:00:22.410> hard

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
drives and just have power to one hard

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.140 
drives and just have power to one hard
drive<00:00:22.890> where<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.670> have<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> specific

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
drive where you have a specific

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.509 
drive where you have a specific
operating<00:00:24.900> system<00:00:25.320> on<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:26.039> I'm<00:00:26.160> going<00:00:26.400> to

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
operating system on so I'm going to

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.849 
operating system on so I'm going to
actually<00:00:26.760> use<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:27.900> device<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.529> have<00:00:28.830> a

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
actually use this device to have a

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.400 
actually use this device to have a
triple<00:00:29.460> boot<00:00:30.000> machine<00:00:30.330> because<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.050> have<00:00:31.170> three

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
triple boot machine because I have three

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.170 
triple boot machine because I have three
hard<00:00:31.619> drives<00:00:31.800> but<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.640> device<00:00:32.969> will

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
hard drives but this device will

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.660 
hard drives but this device will
actually<00:00:33.329> allow<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.110> do<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.649> quad<00:00:35.040> boot<00:00:35.399> so

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
actually allow you to do a quad boot so

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.040 
actually allow you to do a quad boot so
you<00:00:35.700> could<00:00:35.880> actually<00:00:36.000> use<00:00:36.300> four<00:00:36.690> hard<00:00:36.989> drives

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
you could actually use four hard drives

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.770 
you could actually use four hard drives
with<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.010> device<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:39.000> actually<00:00:39.120> fits<00:00:39.570> in

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
with this device and it actually fits in

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.440 
with this device and it actually fits in
a<00:00:39.989> three<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.500> half<00:00:40.649> inch<00:00:40.950> drive<00:00:41.280> bay<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.420> I

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
a three and a half inch drive bay so I

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.139 
a three and a half inch drive bay so I
have<00:00:42.690> my<00:00:42.809> trusty<00:00:43.020> cutter<00:00:43.469> here<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.120> a

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
have my trusty cutter here and I have a

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.459 
have my trusty cutter here and I have a
pair<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.450> scissors<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.989> we're<00:00:46.110> going<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.260> see

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
pair of scissors so we're going to see

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.810 
pair of scissors so we're going to see
what<00:00:46.649> we're<00:00:46.800> going<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.980> need<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.520> get<00:00:47.610> this

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
what we're going to need to get this

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.549 
what we're going to need to get this
thing<00:00:47.879> open<00:00:48.300> I'm<00:00:48.719> going<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.050> try<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.469> actually

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
thing open I'm going to try and actually

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.709 
thing open I'm going to try and actually
get<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:49.980> open<00:00:50.280> just<00:00:50.550> with<00:00:50.820> my<00:00:50.969> hands<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.660> that

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
get it open just with my hands and that

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.439 
get it open just with my hands and that
might<00:00:52.050> not<00:00:52.230> work<00:00:52.550> because<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.820> ISA<00:00:54.120> Vaughn

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
might not work because the ISA Vaughn

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.110 
might not work because the ISA Vaughn
this<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.840> pretty<00:00:55.079> strong<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:57.980> let's<00:00:58.980> see<00:00:59.340> let

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
this is pretty strong so let's see let

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.880 
this is pretty strong so let's see let
me<00:01:00.180> grab<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> scissors<00:01:00.780> first<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.590> these<00:01:01.710> are

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
me grab the scissors first and these are

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.709 
me grab the scissors first and these are
busted<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.670> hopefully<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.030> can<00:01:03.120> actually<00:01:03.329> use

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
busted so hopefully I can actually use

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.120 
busted so hopefully I can actually use
them<00:01:03.960> properly<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:06.170> get<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.350> thing<00:01:07.650> open

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
device and then power it now remember

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.800 
device and then power it now remember
like<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.380> said<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:49.890> thing<00:02:50.220> works<00:02:50.970> off<00:02:51.390> of

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
like I said this thing works off of

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.880 
like I said this thing works off of
cutting<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.410> power<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:53.040> drives<00:02:53.400> so<00:02:54.709> it<00:02:55.709> will

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
cutting the power to drives so it will

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.320 
cutting the power to drives so it will
only<00:02:56.100> have<00:02:56.489> one<00:02:56.850> of<00:02:57.120> your<00:02:57.510> up<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.019> four<00:02:58.680> drives

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
only have one of your up to four drives

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.180 
only have one of your up to four drives
powered<00:03:00.330> up<00:03:00.450> at<00:03:00.570> a<00:03:00.660> time<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.290> that's<00:03:01.680> how<00:03:01.980> it's

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
powered up at a time and that's how it's

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.770 
powered up at a time and that's how it's
going<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.519> start<00:03:02.910> your<00:03:03.090> system<00:03:03.330> up<00:03:04.880> and<00:03:05.880> here

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
going to start your system up and here

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.699

then number three is going to be my test

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.140 
then number three is going to be my test
drive<00:04:31.800> so<00:04:32.250> I'm<00:04:32.520> going<00:04:32.669> to<00:04:32.700> use<00:04:32.910> different
