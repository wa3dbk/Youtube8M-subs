00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 and what happened here again we're 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.340
 in minecraft dps and then I'm going to get a 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.070
 tutorial for those who do not know about 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.509
 mind the peace and well let's make a 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.650
 tutorial on how to register in a 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.449
 non-premium server 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.720
 this time it's good to see if we go up 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.890
 down 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.009
 I'm going to join a server 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.009
 1 point 6.4 that I found in a group of 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.949
 minecraft I asked the comrade's permission 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.900
 truck that could let me record and 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.270
 He told me if he will not leave the description 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.140
 on the good server this is the server 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.970
 of the whole herd up in the 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.260
 look, let's go into the band 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.760
 the first thing we have to do before 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.489
 is to do a good mini command I do not know 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.870
 how to say yes I think it 's command the 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.820
 joke is that they have to put the same 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.790
 that I'm going to put me obviously with his 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.250
 different password let's give it 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.340
 and then we unite there is no down tells us 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.920
 registering means that registers as 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.830
 we do there look and tell us just 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.990
 we give the chat 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.050
 We make the bar as I say and 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.410
 we put register 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:15.020
 we make this the password in this case 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:19.700
 I'm going to put 1 2 3 4 5 and again 1 2 3 4 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:22.190
 5 ready you registered as well 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.110
 good as they saw band what we had 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.110
 what to do was simply register 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.510
 the part there is only easy 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.180
 they have to put as I'm going to put it 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.770
 Hey 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.450
 the practical first we put a little bit 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.450
 we put record 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.840
 and put the password that you like 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.490
 in this case I put 1 2 3 4 5 not 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.940
 they reconfirm 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.990
 1 2 3 4 5 and they give you enter 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.320
 since they are here, nothing else this 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.300
 they can free themselves from what is 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.820
 server not this server is from a friend 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.640
 he had never entered that's why he's the 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.229
 tutorial here this obviously grabs 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.950
 in my account and put it in passwords 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.900
 they're going to be able to get in there 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.910
 my password on the servers is not 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.700
 so do not try to mess with me 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.650
 band account porfa we are a server 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.840
 no premium this is for non premium 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.480
 true for obviously for those who are 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.560
 Awards do not need to register 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.050
 this is for those who do not know 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.120
 register or know how to enter the 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.170
 non-premium servers is the only thing that 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.599
 they have to do and now band that's going 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.150
 to happen when we leave 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.560
 we disconnect we re-unite and 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.959
 when we rejoin we are going to 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.100
 ask to guide us or there are some who 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.610
 as 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.770
 and you signed up for now and tell me 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.110
 are you the one who registers this stuff 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.760
 well not for that we're going to do this 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.410
 we're going to give and we're going to do almost the 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.040
 same command but instead of registering 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.069
 we will login or login 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.739
 well let's give it 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.659
 what does login and password say to me? 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.849
 password that we had put we are going to 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.799
 give the bar is important band 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:17.200
 the bar is important we place 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.200
 slugging and the password that we put 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.460
 ready I joined the fire 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.300
 that's all the band tutorial itself is 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.340
 everything we have in the tutorial 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.760
 it does not change anything good we do not have to 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.950
 do absolutely nothing more than put 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.480
 your password, I would like you 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.570
 you put your own password 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:43.150
 as you can see we are on a server not 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.970
 premium in the description I leave you the 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.130
 now yes what 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.940

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.560

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.570
