00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.060 

Firebird<00:00:08.790> shadows<00:00:09.180> it's<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.540> little<00:00:09.840> windy<00:00:10.070> so

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
Firebird shadows it's a little windy so

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.039 
Firebird shadows it's a little windy so
flying<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.520> gonna<00:00:11.670> be<00:00:11.820> pretty<00:00:12.059> tough<00:00:12.389> but<00:00:12.719> I

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
flying is gonna be pretty tough but I

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.799 
flying is gonna be pretty tough but I
just<00:00:13.710> want<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.950> show<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.219> how<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.179> land<00:00:15.570> the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
just want to show you how to land the

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.650 
just want to show you how to land the
fibers<00:00:16.200> better<00:00:16.520> because<00:00:17.520> virtual<00:00:18.029> instructor

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
fibers better because virtual instructor

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.230 
fibers better because virtual instructor
when<00:00:18.900> it's<00:00:19.020> fun<00:00:19.369> when<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.460> go<00:00:20.640> for<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.939> landing

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
when it's fun when you go for a landing

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.980 
when it's fun when you go for a landing
it<00:00:21.390> tries<00:00:21.599> to<00:00:21.630> compensate<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.680> landing

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
it tries to compensate the landing

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.269 
it tries to compensate the landing
basically<00:00:24.990> if<00:00:25.109> there's<00:00:25.289> any<00:00:25.440> wind<00:00:25.800> it's<00:00:26.070> gonna

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
basically if there's any wind it's gonna

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.519 
basically if there's any wind it's gonna
turn<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.330> left<00:00:27.539> propeller<00:00:27.930> or<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.320> right

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
turn the left propeller or the right

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.920 
turn the left propeller or the right
propeller<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.189> try<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.640> stabilize<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.689> plane

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
propeller and try to stabilize the plane

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.900 
propeller and try to stabilize the plane
so<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.140> doesn't<00:00:31.410> crack<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:32.460> I'm<00:00:32.550> going<00:00:32.699> to<00:00:32.760> try

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
so it doesn't crack so I'm going to try

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.210 
so it doesn't crack so I'm going to try
to<00:00:32.970> do<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.210> quick<00:00:34.170> little<00:00:34.350> landing<00:00:34.769> over<00:00:35.010> here

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
to do a quick little landing over here

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.640 
to do a quick little landing over here
alright<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.239> when<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.629> go<00:00:36.840> for<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> landing

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
alright so when you go for a landing

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.350 
alright so when you go for a landing
you're<00:00:38.370> gonna<00:00:38.460> want<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.790> bring<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.059> throttle

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
you're gonna want to bring the throttle

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.490 
you're gonna want to bring the throttle
down<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> little<00:00:40.050> bit

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
down a little bit

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.700 
down a little bit
so<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.610> doesn't<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:42.750> too<00:00:42.870> much<00:00:42.989> speed<00:00:43.380> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
so that doesn't have too much speed and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.950 
so that doesn't have too much speed and
then<00:00:44.219> basically<00:00:44.520> once<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.360> get<00:00:45.510> low<00:00:45.719> enough

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
then basically once you get low enough

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.560 
then basically once you get low enough
let<00:00:46.350> go<00:00:46.559> over<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> throttle<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:48.329> pull

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
let go over the throttle and just pull

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.750 
let go over the throttle and just pull
up<00:00:48.809> on<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.140> elevator<00:00:49.290> give<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.309> little<00:00:50.520> bit

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
up on the elevator give it a little bit

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.569 
up on the elevator give it a little bit
of<00:00:50.879> throttle<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.840> then<00:00:51.989> just<00:00:52.500> do<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.890> pretty

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
of throttle and then just do that pretty

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:02.850 
of throttle and then just do that pretty
simple

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.680 

Wynn's<00:01:03.460> basically<00:01:04.059> taking<00:01:04.479> it

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.570 

I<00:01:06.780> think<00:01:07.470> we<00:01:07.530> got<00:01:07.650> 10<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.040> 15<00:01:08.370> mile-per-hour

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
I think we got 10 to 15 mile-per-hour

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:55.120 
I think we got 10 to 15 mile-per-hour
winds<00:01:09.270> right<00:01:09.420> now

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.520 

and<00:01:56.130> that's<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.460> breakaway<00:01:56.880> wings<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:58.380> won't

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
and that's the breakaway wings you won't

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.620 
and that's the breakaway wings you won't
ever<00:01:58.649> break<00:01:58.920> your<00:01:59.069> Firebird<00:01:59.789> shadows<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.569> he

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
ever break your Firebird shadows and he

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:18.940 
ever break your Firebird shadows and he
gets<00:02:00.780> put<00:02:00.960> back<00:02:00.990> together<00:02:01.319> just<00:02:01.740> like<00:02:01.890> that

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.400 

okay<00:02:21.040> try<00:02:22.040> this<00:02:22.099> again<00:02:22.930> you're<00:02:23.930> at<00:02:24.019> a<00:02:24.050> park

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
okay try this again you're at a park

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.150 
okay try this again you're at a park
flying<00:02:24.830> on<00:02:25.010> grass<00:02:26.560> all<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:27.709> really<00:02:27.950> need<00:02:28.069> to

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
flying on grass all you really need to

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.380 
flying on grass all you really need to
do<00:02:28.280> is<00:02:28.400> just<00:02:28.519> take<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.849> landing<00:02:29.180> gear<00:02:29.360> off

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
do is just take the landing gear off

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.080 
do is just take the landing gear off
throw<00:02:30.379> the<00:02:30.560> plane<00:02:30.769> up<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.250> then<00:02:31.760> when<00:02:31.879> you<00:02:31.970> go

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
throw the plane up and then when you go

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.390 
throw the plane up and then when you go
for<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.390> landing<00:02:32.860> let<00:02:33.860> go<00:02:34.040> of<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.250> throttle

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
for the landing let go of the throttle

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:51.009 
for the landing let go of the throttle
when<00:02:34.790> you're<00:02:35.349> close<00:02:36.349> to<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.620> ground<00:02:49.930> so<00:02:50.930> on

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
when you're close to the ground so on

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.289 
when you're close to the ground so on
that<00:02:51.170> last<00:02:51.380> landing<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:52.010> nose<00:02:52.220> hit<00:02:53.150> the

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
that last landing the nose hit the

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.449 
that last landing the nose hit the
ground<00:02:53.599> and<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:54.200> kind<00:02:54.470> of<00:02:54.530> broke<00:02:54.739> this<00:02:55.250> can

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
ground and it kind of broke this can

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.670 
ground and it kind of broke this can
easily<00:02:55.730> be<00:02:55.940> fixed<00:02:56.299> with<00:02:56.599> gorilla<00:02:57.260> glue<00:02:57.530> that's

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
easily be fixed with gorilla glue that's

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.850 
easily be fixed with gorilla glue that's
what<00:02:58.130> I<00:02:58.160> use<00:02:58.400> all<00:02:58.579> the<00:02:58.610> time<00:02:58.880> you<00:02:59.060> can<00:02:59.180> see<00:02:59.360> it

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
what I use all the time you can see it

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.370 
what I use all the time you can see it
exploding<00:03:00.860> out<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.130> sides<00:03:01.340> here<00:03:01.750> but<00:03:02.750> yeah

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
exploding out the sides here but yeah

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:16.430 
exploding out the sides here but yeah
I'll<00:03:03.470> do<00:03:03.650> that<00:03:03.680> when<00:03:03.890> I<00:03:03.950> get<00:03:04.040> home<00:03:04.280> later

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.280 

today<00:03:17.440> is<00:03:17.650> a<00:03:18.010> very<00:03:18.819> windy<00:03:19.150> day<00:03:19.270> you<00:03:19.930> don't<00:03:20.110> want

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
today is a very windy day you don't want

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.500 
today is a very windy day you don't want
to<00:03:20.350> fly<00:03:20.470> this<00:03:20.590> plane<00:03:20.980> on<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.190> windy<00:03:21.430> day<00:03:21.580> so<00:03:22.450> I

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
to fly this plane on the windy day so I

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.150 
to fly this plane on the windy day so I
just<00:03:22.750> minimal<00:03:23.319> throttle<00:03:23.709> right<00:03:23.830> now<00:03:24.010> I'm

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
just minimal throttle right now I'm

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.430 
just minimal throttle right now I'm
pulling<00:03:24.760> up<00:03:24.880> and<00:03:25.450> it's<00:03:25.690> basically<00:03:26.260> that

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
pulling up and it's basically that

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:59.030 
pulling up and it's basically that
simple

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.069 

Oh
