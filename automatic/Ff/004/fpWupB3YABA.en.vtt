00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.020
 the extensive system is adopted in bodies 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.720
 of large water 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.460
 which generally do not have systems 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.040
 drainage and slopes 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.170
 which makes it difficult to 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.000
 fish 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.680
 in these circumstances the density of 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.900
 cultivation should be low 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.900
 one fish for every 10 square meters 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.500
 this is justified because in most 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.680
 In cases where food is natural, it is 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.019
 basically of plankton insects and fruits 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.000
 that fall into the body of water and the 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.670
 city â€‹â€‹is necessary for the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.860
 fish to reach a slaughter weight in 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.830
 In some cases fertilization can be done 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.930
 with cattle manure or 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.699
 other animals to increase production 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.129
 of natural tank food 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.500
 the species recommended for this 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.570
 system must have structures that 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.640
 allow to feed on plankton 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.700
 besides insects and fruits that 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.450
 occasionally falls into the water 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.159
 the tambacu and especially the tambaqui 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.800
 fit into this description and when 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.930
 cultured in this system reach 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.180
 productivity of up to two tonnes and 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.850
 per hectare per year 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.370
 this system is not recommended for those who 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.620
 want to produce pacus tambaquis for 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.990
 supply the market because it would require 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.010
 and tables for a production only 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.500
 reasonable 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.410
 quality control. 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.110
 especially for water and more 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.210
 difficult and laborious 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.180
 in some reservoirs to facilitate the 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.820
 are mounted corrals like this one. 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.000
 the provision of effective ration 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.460
 surrounded place so fish accustom 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.680
 to come and feed on him 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.380
 on the occasion of the expenditure, the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.610
 surrounded and the fish can be caught 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.610
 by dragging 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.770
 In this case the creation would 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.080
 extensive system for a semi system 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.569
 intensive 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.940
 another more rational alternative use 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.560
 of these reservoirs would be the creation of 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.390
 fish in tanks-net 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.730
 taking advantage of the best feature 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.900
 of these bodies of water a great quantity 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.740
 of oxygen 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.150
 in this case the subject of a reservoir 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.650
 cease to be used for the creation of 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.930
 extensive and 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.930
 would pass the super intensive creation
