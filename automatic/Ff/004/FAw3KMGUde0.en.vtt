00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:09.929
 tagil while I'm so wet 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:14.070
 good reason to talk about the way 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:17.039
 shirts i recommend exactly shirt with 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.330
 long sleeves they t-shirt and on this 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.240
 there are several reasons 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.990
 reasons 1 shirt is biting through 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.859
 mosquitoes cause second in shirt 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:35.040
 collar that protects the neck from mosquitoes 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:37.620
 and sun cause 3 shirts have a pocket and 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.200
 I often have a salewa shirt 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.020
 but in principle any tight 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.120
 shirt specifically in this shirt of my 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.730
 from Lviv I like what was 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.309
 label on which was crossed out 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.649
 mosquito and from this label me immediately 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.190
 as it is easier on the soul the phrase seems that 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.980
 mosquitoes and and will not bite skip well 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.129
 in fact this is of course some myth 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.850
 after several full even immediately 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.400
 mosquitoes such a powerful fight they popped but not 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.220
 so evil as a shirt that's only in 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.170
 adjacent places further there is such here 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.170
 functional 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:19.080
 roll sleeves and special ribbon 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.000
 them on the buttons to fasten somewhere here 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.040
 ribbon g n. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.290
 Yes, in general, God bless her with this ribbon 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.960
 I still don't use it almost a 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.479
 here it is a ribbon 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.220
 scare my cheek to catch 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.290
 I almost always use my sleeves 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.650
 omitted because but the main function 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.320
 just shirts you protect hands in that 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.200
 number from the sun from mosquitoes from the branches 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.670
 like the fact that it is tight to me 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.880
 clings to the branches 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.750
 squiggles and well, so good enough 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.490
 protects against these factors again she 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.560
 in my opinion more resistant to 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.829
 abrasion compared to t-shirt 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.259
 pockets here are two velcro pockets well on 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.259
 Velcro on buttons without a difference of science 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.370
 Often there is money there are little things 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.940
 notebook in general 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.730
 in a campaign I use them it is not business 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.050
 costume here such that there is no etiquette 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.750
 pockets sewn up 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.450
 and there even handkerchiefs can not be folded 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.880
 I use pockets for full and third 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.700
 moment here's a t-shirt oh such a shirt by 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.160
 versus cotton t-shirt 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.120
 dries much better so everyone 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.620
 I recommend exactly running clothes 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.710
 consisting of light pants not here 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.970
 like my shirt bought 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:41.830
 recently a new company jack wolfskin too 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.350
 where was drawn and crossed out 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.790
 mosquito but for now she is so beautiful and me 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.700
 and even squeezed a little 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.390
 sorry to take the fact is I still have a 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.730
 for colder conditions Nala 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.990
 touring shirt is also excellent 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.270
 zipper pocket 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.000
 it is better than velcro from them nothing 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.670
 does not fall out but it is just hotter and 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.610
 for Turkey is not very suitable I will go 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.830
 quickly take off alexa he dive there 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.830
 get ready rushed
