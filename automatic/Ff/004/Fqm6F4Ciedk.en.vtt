 What are we going to do? 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.859
 the technique used to increase the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.140
 speed is called virtual memory is in the 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.929
 jail that memory was our 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.899
 computer it will be increased and soon 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.260
 It's good, it's the first way I go. 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:43.079

 in system here 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.000
 advanced system settings such as 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.330
 will you give by clicking here

 the configuration of reaching the system does not 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.900
 is to open this water is another way of 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:17.180
 face your country how you can start 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:23.180
 my computer here will be taking care of 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:24.979
 here the system is already 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.460
 opening here also settings 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.430
 Advanced system here as a 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.280
 little faster is what I prefer is 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.830
 entering here system property 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.340
 we go is the line that performance 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:45.110
 would be advanced here in this area of 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.509
 search advanced here and 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.930
 performance that has performed here with 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:56.930
 we are of performance configurations 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:02:01.160
 This is the first and 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.470
 first settings by applying the 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.310
 people will clean here in visual effects 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:11.030

 on the left of the 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:21.500
 processor and low memory 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.990
 that is technical is that we will 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.690
 to be using people will put here 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:35.470
 change right change 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:37.810
 this is where it's probably going to be 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.940
 in this option size and managed by 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.490

 here above we can go back limit 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:20.350
 whatever you want to the point that 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:23.950
 does not affect your HD much in the case as a

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.750
 recommended quantity that the maximum 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.540
 would be double at this initial moment here 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.080
 double the initial size 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.080
