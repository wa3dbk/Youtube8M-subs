00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 why is it useful to mix the 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.940
 different plants different plants 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.820
 vegetables in the vegetable garden so that they 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.970
 rub shoulders with or mixed with 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.970
 vegetables 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.730
 let's start with the association the most 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.040
 known between carrots and 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.990
 leeks the smell of the carrot moves away 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.730
 the leek athens and the smell of 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.240
 leek and noah are the fly of the 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.910
 carrot 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.920
 it's the same with chives and 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.140
 parsley a nice vegetable garden 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.699
 absolutely associate the flowers let's take 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.160
 the example of nasturtiums nasturtiums 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.750
 which attracts aphids for as long as 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.360
 Aphids are on nasturtiums 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.309
 they will not go on the associated sprouts 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.129
 say why not lavender and fill 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.629
 here lavender and nasturtiums since 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.790
 lavender keeps away aphids 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.290
 there is none on nasturtiums you 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.299
 can also combine eyelets 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.839
 of india or roses of india at the foot of 

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:53.030
 tomatoes 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.620
 the carnation of India will distance the 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.210
 methods of small nematodes 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.040
 critters that gnaws at you and the roots 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.350
 tomatoes tomatoes that will remain 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.930
 puny it is true also with the worries 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.030
 which will drive nematodes away more 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.200
 of flowers in a garden less there is 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.880
 chances of having parasites 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.380
 we just mentioned lavender lavender 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.420
 that keeps away aphids but attracts 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.490
 also honey insects such as 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.350
 bees the bees that will fertilize 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.540
 more your tomato feet you will have 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.640
 more fruits from layers of 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.230
 melon zucchini thanks to this 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.330
 the front but not only the lava in 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.950
 attracts insects but differ but 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.780
 borage also for example and all 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.400
 these country flowers that you go 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.900
 sow in your vegetable garden by what is 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.510
 interesting in a kitchen garden is 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.920
 to optimize the ground there are vegetables 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.970
 which are a little bit slower pushed 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.530
 this is the case of tomatoes 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.110
 so why not plant a few 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.780
 feet of salad at the foot it's true too 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.760
 with lettuce and carrots 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.890
 lettuce will be good before the carrots 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.480
 we sow some lettuce inside 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.730
 carrots when you eat 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.500
 shutter you carrots are loose 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.350
 of course it's true also with 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.760
 radish the mixture radishes salads and then 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.200
 so we can do something 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.120
 interesting enough if you have a 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.900
 pleasure garden and wanted to install 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.570
 a vegetable garden 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.570
 but why not fill your garden 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.269
 of approval with costs despite full costs 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.450
 medium it will be decorative and useful to the 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.450
 time
