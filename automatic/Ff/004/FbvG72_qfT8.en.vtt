00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.589
 hi to all the boys and well found 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.830
 in a new video to make me a simulator 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:21.680
 2013 today I am here to introduce you to others 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.960
 new fashions always of the cup because I have 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.510
 decided to complete the package la 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.540
 last last video of the 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.290
 home we had seen the Russian you are 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.640
 seeing more now the two caterpillers e 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.400
 so I decided why not put it 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.640
 also some marie some tractor 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.220
 simulated then now I have hung like this 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:48.079
 a little right to learn something for 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:50.600
 a cart a barrel and a right plow 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.750
 I have something for smart meters 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.550
 try they go pretty well there would be 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.550
 something to fix 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.079
 somewhere but in fact for the rest 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.149
 they work pretty well 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.670
 so I would say starting from precisely 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.180
 what looks like a tractor more 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.180
 normal 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.690
 so this is the 600 mt cat 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.700
 detachment of 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.270
 dear with the knife 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.270
 go around 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.590
 it works very well we cleaned it 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.140
 almost all light up 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.790
 the lights 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.270
 we have very good steering 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.990
 flashing strobe mode you have 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.750
 noticed you see that 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.200
 close up near a half seas 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.079
 you can see better looks 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.880
 unfortunately, here in here is a bit 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:51.690
 poor though we say as details 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.900
 in other words, however 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:59.180
 it is only fit that someone just 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.180
 he likes worse than good 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:08.390
 well then we move on to the part precisely with 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.390
 accusations of with the caterpillar tracks 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:20.159
 here we have the cup challenger 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:22.080
 765 b has a nice smoke from the exhaust that 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:25.620
 I really like that it would be from 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.769
 bring this to other tractors too 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.010
 works really well as a steering wheel 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:38.670
 it's other than his brother 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:42.780
 the greater it would be, the more it runs there 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.590
 we say inside we have more 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.590
 details 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.710
 or little I had at all indeed 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.710
 pretty well 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.660
 even in the details maybe it is here caterpillar tracks 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.490
 a little inadequate, however, I see 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.710
 that goes and goes just fine with the button 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:13.240
 with iii f we turn on which ones in front ce 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:15.250
 we have it all here 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.910
 however, let's look at 4 what 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.900
 should be the lights behind instead 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.620
 found because being the senate 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:28.680
 the plow we already have the lights themselves 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.680
 front and yesterday's lights 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.860
 so it works everything works well 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.810
 it is also not quite good then 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.970
 we are just buying here that 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.400
 practically already larger already more 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.440
 nice would be by me is from 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:52.780
 change the given density a bit 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:58.810
 the measurements we have just the cup 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:01.569
 challenger mt 875 be then for 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:05.799
 the ignition must press enter or 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:10.900
 precisely one of the keys to make it 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:13.030
 go on to a nice flashing that 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.519
 they should have the original creators 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.519
 farming when in the final hills 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.700
 Then we have with the 29 we give a little 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.700
 camera behind 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.620
 intrigue nothing a pattern 5 we have the 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:41.099
 lights back 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.529
 the interior is behind and also well detailed 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:45.180
 not much would be to fix precisely 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:47.490
 little something 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.979
 the only thing as you can see are i 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.639
 tracked vehicles that don't go so well 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:55.860
 because we have these feints practically 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.949
 closed the field wheels and then we have 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:02.449
 this means a tape that moves 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:05.400
 also unlike the wheels 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:08.129
 to fix it would be to point to him 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:12.389
 the euro tracks if anyone wants 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:17.789
 recover in hand to rebuild belts 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:20.279
 mega and indeed good work 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:24.629
 I told him I'd close some density 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:28.259
 because seeing the summer i 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:30.629
 I would use it in the xxl pack but it fails 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:34.969
 to hold up Arabs and things because 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:34.969
 those are so really powerful 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:42.199
 so I would also say for these simple 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:44.990
 He does so precisely consisted of these three 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:47.089
 tractors very simple even if it remains 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:52.399
 so I don't consume mass 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:52.759
 diesel point this simple pack of 

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:56.059
 cat 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:58.249
 let's say it ends here there will be new bugs 

00:05:56.059 --> 00:06:00.339
 in fact I'm finding new fashions and the 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:03.139
 I'm testing etcetera 

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:05.179
 so get ready for new packs 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:07.159
 continue to register by putting in 

00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:08.869
 square and share tv so that 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:11.599
 your friends can see them too 

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:13.309
 protruding a little, maybe some 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:15.949
 mica need some tutorial on 

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:20.059
 farming I'm also doing the series in 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:23.059
 this period and after this I would say it is 

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:26.259
 everything and from marco 95 everything hello to all 

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:26.259
 next time bye bye
