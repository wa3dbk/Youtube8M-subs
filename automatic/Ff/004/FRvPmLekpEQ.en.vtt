spot I mean it's kind of it's it's a
pretty<00:02:24.840> simple<00:02:25.140> analysis<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.040> can<00:02:26.069> figure<00:02:26.430> it

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
pretty simple analysis you can figure it

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.270 
pretty simple analysis you can figure it
