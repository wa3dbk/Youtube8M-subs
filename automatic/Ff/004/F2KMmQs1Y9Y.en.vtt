00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
a bit of an idea really in terms of the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
a bit of an idea really in terms of the

condition kind of layout might help as

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.170 
condition kind of layout might help as
well<00:00:31.320> but<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.830> just<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.520> show<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.000> type

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
well but and just to show you the type

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.520 
well but and just to show you the type
of<00:00:33.210> things<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.660> kind<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:33.930> can<00:00:34.110> be<00:00:34.140> found

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
of things that kind of can be found

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.680 
of things that kind of can be found
using<00:00:35.370> some<00:00:35.670> very<00:00:35.880> simple<00:00:36.120> techniques<00:00:36.360> that

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
using some very simple techniques that

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.959 
using some very simple techniques that
we<00:00:36.840> cover<00:00:37.050> kind<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.620> training<00:00:38.010> for<00:00:38.760> you

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
we cover kind of in the training for you

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.680 
we cover kind of in the training for you
so<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.710> three-bedroom<00:00:41.670> flat<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:42.540> was

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
so this is a three-bedroom flat it was

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.979 
so this is a three-bedroom flat it was
actually<00:00:43.020> left<00:00:43.290> fully<00:00:44.100> furnished<00:00:44.840> which<00:00:45.840> was

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
actually left fully furnished which was

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.600 
actually left fully furnished which was
unusual<00:00:46.140> but<00:00:46.710> it's<00:00:46.890> great<00:00:47.070> for<00:00:47.219> us<00:00:47.280> that

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
unusual but it's great for us that

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.360 
unusual but it's great for us that
obviously<00:00:48.090> helps<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.920> even<00:00:49.920> if<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.129> don't

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
obviously helps and even if we don't

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.770 
obviously helps and even if we don't
kind<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.640> keep<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> stuff<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.329> there<00:00:51.539> from<00:00:51.660> a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
kind of keep the stuff in there from a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.360 
kind of keep the stuff in there from a
rental<00:00:51.930> perspective<00:00:52.559> because<00:00:52.800> generally

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
rental perspective because generally

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.850 
rental perspective because generally
properties<00:00:54.360> are<00:00:54.539> provided<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.110> furnished<00:00:55.590> and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
properties are provided on furnished and

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.500 
properties are provided on furnished and
we<00:00:56.399> can<00:00:56.640> use<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.969> furniture<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.420> stuff

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
we can use the furniture and stuff

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.240 
we can use the furniture and stuff
elsewhere<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:58.680> it's<00:00:59.190> not

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
elsewhere so it's not it's not

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.310 
elsewhere so it's not it's not
necessarily<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> bad<00:00:59.910> thing<00:01:00.020> as<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.109> can<00:01:01.230> see

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
necessarily a bad thing as you can see

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.039 
necessarily a bad thing as you can see
it's<00:01:01.590> kind<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.879> small<00:01:02.879> utility<00:01:03.420> room<00:01:03.629> or<00:01:03.870> area

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
can be a very quick kind of insight in

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.499 
can be a very quick kind of insight in
terms<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.420> what<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.869> looks<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.290> downstairs

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
so this is the you can see it's very

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.640 
so this is the you can see it's very
good<00:01:22.530> condition<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.600> it's<00:01:24.600> got<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> small<00:01:25.439> kind
