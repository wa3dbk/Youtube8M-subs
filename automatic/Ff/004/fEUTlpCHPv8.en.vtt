point you turn it a quarter turn and

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.949 
point you turn it a quarter turn and
it'll<00:02:44.299> pop<00:02:44.510> open

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
it'll pop open

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.800 
it'll pop open
you<00:02:45.620> take<00:02:45.829> the<00:02:45.980> adductor<00:02:46.400> muscle<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:47.720> you

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
you take the adductor muscle and you

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.780 
you take the adductor muscle and you
give<00:02:48.049> it<00:02:48.140> a<00:02:48.200> good<00:02:48.319> pry<00:02:48.590> what<00:02:49.400> you're<00:02:49.519> trying<00:02:49.700> to

give it a good pry what you're trying to
see<00:02:49.940> is<00:02:50.209> where<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.599> adductor<00:02:50.989> muscle<00:02:51.290> is

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
see is where the adductor muscle is

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.559 
see is where the adductor muscle is
attached<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.920> top<00:02:52.099> shelf<00:02:52.430> you<00:02:52.670> scrape

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
attached to the top shelf you scrape

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.280 
attached to the top shelf you scrape
that<00:02:53.750> away<00:02:54.069> can<00:02:55.069> you<00:02:55.160> turn<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.610> oyster<00:02:56.170> so<00:02:57.170> the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
that away can you turn the oyster so the

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.839 
that away can you turn the oyster so the
adductor<00:02:57.769> muscle<00:02:58.069> which<00:02:58.190> is<00:02:58.220> right<00:02:58.489> here<00:02:58.519> is

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
adductor muscle which is right here is

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.690 
adductor muscle which is right here is
closer<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.299> myself<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.049> you<00:03:00.170> scrape<00:03:00.500> away

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
closer to myself and you scrape away

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.009 
closer to myself and you scrape away
that's<00:03:01.700> all<00:03:01.880> you<00:03:02.000> want<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.209> do<00:03:02.360> leave<00:03:02.870> it<00:03:02.959> a

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
little bit attached at the back so it

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.849 
little bit attached at the back so it
doesn't<00:03:05.180> slip<00:03:05.329> out<00:03:05.510> or<00:03:05.959> you<00:03:06.139> can<00:03:06.290> loosen<00:03:06.709> it
