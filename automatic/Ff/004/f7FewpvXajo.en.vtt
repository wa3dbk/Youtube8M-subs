00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.300 
it will pop up the flesh you can push
this<00:04:13.040> unless<00:04:13.790> this<00:04:14.330> one<00:04:14.569> you<00:04:14.720> have<00:04:14.870> to<00:04:15.310> press

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
this unless this one you have to press

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.229 
this unless this one you have to press
the<00:04:16.700> button<00:04:17.410> press<00:04:18.410> an<00:04:18.620> element<00:04:19.310> and<00:04:19.880> it

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
the button press an element and it

so here it is the best thing about the
camera<00:04:29.540> itself<00:04:29.889> manual<00:04:30.889> focus<00:04:31.400> i<00:04:36.729> think<00:04:37.729> i'll

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
camera itself manual focus i think i'll

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.460 
camera itself manual focus i think i'll
be<00:04:37.940> using<00:04:38.180> this<00:04:38.450> a<00:04:38.510> lot<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:38.990> ring<00:04:39.169> feature

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
be using this a lot the ring feature

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.040 
be using this a lot the ring feature
because<00:04:39.919> it<00:04:40.490> is<00:04:40.669> fun<00:04:40.940> you<00:04:41.630> can<00:04:41.810> change

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
because it is fun you can change

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:48.520 
because it is fun you can change

it's not the touch screen like the
panasonic<00:05:12.639> overall<00:05:13.639> um<00:05:13.910> i<00:05:14.860> think<00:05:15.860> i'm<00:05:16.310> going

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
panasonic overall um i think i'm going

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.330 
panasonic overall um i think i'm going
to<00:05:16.700> compare<00:05:17.030> the<00:05:17.150> size<00:05:17.389> with<00:05:17.660> the<00:05:17.840> FX<00:05:18.260> 528<00:05:19.039> by

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
to compare the size with the FX 528 by

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.490 
to compare the size with the FX 528 by
panasonic<00:05:21.280> overall<00:05:22.280> the<00:05:22.490> the<00:05:23.270> thickness<00:05:23.840> is

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
panasonic overall the the thickness is

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.879 
panasonic overall the the thickness is
that<00:05:25.060> the<00:05:26.060> it<00:05:26.450> has<00:05:26.600> the<00:05:26.750> same<00:05:27.020> thickness<00:05:27.350> only

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
that the it has the same thickness only

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.719 
that the it has the same thickness only
the<00:05:28.190> s95<00:05:28.850> is<00:05:29.330> a<00:05:29.360> bit<00:05:29.690> thicker<00:05:29.990> on<00:05:30.260> the<00:05:30.729> ring

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
the s95 is a bit thicker on the ring

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:38.890 
the s95 is a bit thicker on the ring
here<00:05:32.300> so<00:05:33.229> we<00:05:33.350> turn<00:05:33.620> the<00:05:33.770> song<00:05:35.200> yep<00:05:37.660> this<00:05:38.660> one<00:05:38.810> is
