00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 These are the first bales of our harvest 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.450
 this year in the white ball is 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.759
 Glass packs that get our horses 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.040
 to eat when in winter nothing more 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.980
 grows 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:20.430
 but how come the grass in the bales 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:23.029
 I'll show you that now 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.920
 angelika must deselect the grass 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.400
 for that she hangs on her trek once 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.400
 path 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.710
 only just wipe off the grass 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.729
 and now a round one 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.479
 you see the meadow is mowed and that 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:25.149
 whole grass lies flat 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.600
 now angelika works the mower and 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.600
 go home 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.210
 Next, the grass must be turned 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.880
 become 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.370
 So always nice and easy on the floor 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.790
 it will be distributed faster 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.470
 then dries bjÃ¶rn as well 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.670
 his little old porsche trecker 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.290
 help but that took much too long 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.690
 angelika's new lindner tracker is here 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.119
 faster, of course 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.550
 Here you see how angelika with the 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.610
 Wendler behind the trek the fresh 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:10.500
 mowed grass beautifully evenly distributed 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.500
 so it dries faster 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.430
 because sometime comes again 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:17.430
 rain and then we have to be ready 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:23.590
 Here you can see really nice 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.959
 how the turn works if that is today 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.859
 it is dry on a row 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.420
 pushed 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:33.579
 one says to it started 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.730
 here you can see how angelika like that 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:41.409
 a row turns around with it, too 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:45.030
 really the last grass is drying and 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.030
 ask again at the steepest 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.030
 And now it comes to neighborly jochen 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.330
 a great machine behind his 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.209
 trecker the machine is called the press 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.459
 because she presses to hay and hay 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.489
 then immediately wrapped in again 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.379
 a white foil you have to go 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.660
 look at 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:11.780
 jochen drives over the row of houses his 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:16.959
 Machine pulls the grass in press 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.959
 Together it turns into a ball 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.390
 It will then be wrapped in the back 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.290
 you here are a finished and will be 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:30.349
 Spit out block from the front part 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.660
 of the train like klaas from the same a new one 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:37.000
 finished ball to the back and will 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.000
 rewound during the ride 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:21.139
 600 kilos weighs as much as a ball 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.139
 20 ma or 20 leopold 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.010
 and now angelika still has the 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.390
 Bring finished bales from the meadow and 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.030
 to the lagerplatz was 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:55.480
 there calle wallen with the 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:59.880
 Wheel loader in a row and the beautiful 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.880
 first vun's winter fodder ready 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:35.179
 you see the wheel loader with the grasping forceps 

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:37.229
 back there 

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:39.659
 Of course, we are far from it 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:41.879
 finished because the grass is growing in the summer 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:44.729
 again and we still have 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:48.059
 more meadows and if nice again 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:51.839
 weather is all over again but 

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:56.059
 This 930 track we have to winter 

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:56.059
 are there then more than 200 bales u
