00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.230
 hello everyone with you cuirassier and we 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.059
 continue to play mbr and games and not 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.809
 forget the guys like 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.020
 I'm playing archer class now 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.289
 one of four classes which are given 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:23.400
 the very beginning. 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.590
 we take edits something there is no wig also here 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.279
 but here are some chests I donâ€™t even know 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.460
 I did not see chests nearby when I flew 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:36.480
 let's go over probably the main thing 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.250
 those nifiga yourself there chests I'll go 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.120
 Likely to that one chests let 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:46.500
 this guy goes to this let's see what 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:52.440
 can we have Kentucky? 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.059
 once again you are perfectly dishonest eo did not think 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.090
 in fact, what will first be 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.629
 sell for the first time in my opinion 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.780
 when to start exporting oval before no 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:06.740
 give me some substances here so 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.369
 30 seconds before the start let's probably 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.619
 I will cut a tree hey card edge he did not give 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.100
 I even cut down a tree for 20 seconds 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.140
 left 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:28.040
 not enough time for 12 arrows can 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:32.689
 help me kill to you so it will have time 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.689
 now helen neto pressed 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:48.560
 how does it get on 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:54.320
 cool love such shots so what 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:58.880
 fell wooden sword let's probably 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.360
 that guy kill there standing there something 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.180
 does 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.180
 can try ox 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:16.820
 it was sad a little bit at first so 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:21.620
 it is a pity that the arrows can be a little bit 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:24.709
 no fruit yet and lit on 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:29.330
 infinity in my opinion that its arrows 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:34.610
 can pick up crossed bows on 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.239
 infinity is life canter pearl of 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.410
 gold 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:45.910
 let's power your bow always 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:48.130
 power why not give something 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:54.980
 infinity 2 you nifiga yourself 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:57.019
 there is a little shock for evenings as well 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.070
 small ordinary table just there he is 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:04.820
 called something like a portable table 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:08.450
 disappointed when this item still things 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.299
 nifiga myself I just spoils someone eat 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:15.970
 and by the way 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:21.070
 workbenches there let's probably short 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:26.920
 shoes so often need a hat 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.920
 make no one goes like that baby 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:34.269
 Well , I would also like something 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:40.830
 so good I do not have enough 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:44.200
 pants and ax ax and better leave 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:47.890
 to chop down found a tree now for us 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.299
 so it made a little wood here 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.560
 from here it would be cool if 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:59.650
 ax loggers gave such an opportunity 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:01.200
 kill that tree right away so 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:07.410
 fine wood there 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:11.650
 who still leave it to me 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:16.950
 cast somewhere far away where there are no people 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:20.070
 alive let's go on a compass 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:25.139
 singing who are not five players left 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:30.150
 ok so it seems to me 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:34.410
 when here was up to exactly the same place about 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:40.530
 vanka watch someone builds up 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:43.530
 how a little bit didn't get about got where 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.530
 gone 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:52.990
 well, ah, tyzh, I'm just a sniper, well, not 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:58.020
 vain chose a class 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:02.229
 archer so we have more arrows here 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:05.860
 1 very good thing is that here we fly 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:11.979
 pants and no one came some that 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:14.590
 we have that it was a boom and Cyril 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:18.909
 it's always good so let's check 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:23.349
 where who is far so you can 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:27.460
 Generally now use this 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:31.659
 such an opportunity and make yourself pants 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:37.389
 for example there was not even not yet 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:40.150
 bib can be made gold I'll drop 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:45.789
 so before, too, there is no bone meal nafig 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:50.650
 these are all I don't need either though 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:54.849
 strings I would take for melee itself 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:58.000
 this is so ender pearl and u probably too 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:02.919
 I will expose sometime here like this 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.099
 Excellent good layouts seem time 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:11.169
 check how it is there again 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:14.500
 still far now possible already 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:16.289
 It will sell well not be anything to me 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:21.250
 anyway here 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:24.699
 enchant that we go somewhere along 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:27.570
 compass go well, or you can diamond 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:30.190
 pick a little bit 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:36.940
 everyone just needs to find the potion 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:42.460
 there is no regeneration here 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:47.290
 I will take away the cobweb so 80 blocks already 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:49.410
 pretty close two left 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:07:01.889
 players 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:07:01.889
 one somewhere merged at all near where he 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:15.070
 here he is the current dude enchanted him there 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:16.660
 dangerous i too spellbound hope 

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.150
 it's not that guy forever 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:24.760
 arrows 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:33.490
 it will be bad for me Khilok 

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:39.539
 there is no way so better probably tried here 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:39.539
 so I think this is a great option 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:49.360
 that's all that's what i understand quality 

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:52.000
 clear play just hope guys on your 

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:56.919
 Like to make such series much 

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.960
 I really liked that more 

00:07:56.919 --> 00:08:00.570
 I will try to play it thoughtfully 

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:06.160
 so that's how I did now 

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:07.990
 but but generally okay add more 

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.270
 nothing not for don't forget to go to the group 

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:14.610
 VKontakte see what's new on 

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:14.610
 that's all good luck and bye
