guys<00:01:52.450> two<00:01:52.810> ways<00:01:52.990> of<00:01:53.170> routing<00:01:53.409> it<00:01:53.640> without<00:01:54.640> PC

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
guys two ways of routing it without PC

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.630 
guys two ways of routing it without PC
there<00:01:55.930> is<00:01:56.200> sometimes<00:01:56.649> maybe<00:01:57.130> a<00:01:57.219> glitch<00:01:57.490> with

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
there is sometimes maybe a glitch with

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.700 
there is sometimes maybe a glitch with
it<00:01:57.789> it<00:01:58.780> seems<00:01:59.049> like<00:01:59.170> it<00:01:59.289> does<00:01:59.500> like<00:01:59.649> a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
it it seems like it does like a

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.230 
it it seems like it does like a
temporary<00:02:00.039> route<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:00.579> the<00:02:00.640> route<00:02:00.820> goes<00:02:00.939> away

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
temporary route and the route goes away

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.230 
temporary route and the route goes away
and<00:02:01.509> sometimes<00:02:02.229> you<00:02:02.350> press<00:02:02.590> you<00:02:02.799> with<00:02:03.610> it<00:02:03.820> kind

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
and sometimes you press you with it kind

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.609 
and sometimes you press you with it kind
of<00:02:04.360> messes<00:02:04.570> up<00:02:04.750> because<00:02:05.170> I<00:02:05.259> did<00:02:05.409> have<00:02:05.439> that

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
of messes up because I did have that

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.020 
of messes up because I did have that
problem<00:02:05.979> just<00:02:06.009> a<00:02:06.189> while<00:02:06.310> ago

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
problem just a while ago

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.630 
problem just a while ago
but<00:02:07.750> for<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:07.929> most<00:02:08.080> part<00:02:08.200> without<00:02:09.039> PC<00:02:09.459> it

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
but for the most part without PC it

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.520 
but for the most part without PC it
should<00:02:09.849> work<00:02:10.030> okay<00:02:10.599> sometimes<00:02:11.260> you'll<00:02:11.410> just

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
should work okay sometimes you'll just

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.140 
should work okay sometimes you'll just
have<00:02:11.650> that<00:02:11.800> glitch<00:02:12.040> where<00:02:12.910> it's<00:02:13.030> like<00:02:13.120> a

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
have that glitch where it's like a

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.910 
have that glitch where it's like a
temporary<00:02:13.569> route<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.110> if<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.349> happens<00:02:14.769> just

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
temporary route and if that happens just

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.040 
temporary route and if that happens just
do<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.400> full-on<00:02:15.819> route<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.860> redo<00:02:17.860> again<00:02:19.050> but

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
do a full-on route and redo again but

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.570 
do a full-on route and redo again but
for<00:02:20.230> me<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:21.010> PC<00:02:21.519> version<00:02:21.910> is<00:02:22.170> more<00:02:23.170> reliable

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
for me the PC version is more reliable

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.850 
for me the PC version is more reliable
sorry<00:02:24.580> about<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.819> fake<00:02:24.970> guys<00:02:25.410> but<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.560> PC

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
sorry about the fake guys but the PC

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.380 
sorry about the fake guys but the PC
version<00:02:27.190> is<00:02:27.220> more<00:02:27.370> reliable<00:02:27.849> so<00:02:28.060> they<00:02:28.180> get<00:02:28.269> it

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
version is more reliable so they get it

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.839 
version is more reliable so they get it
done<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:29.620> automatically<00:02:30.310> puts<00:02:30.700> in

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
done and it automatically puts in

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.970 
done and it automatically puts in
supersu<00:02:31.299> from<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.989> get-go<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.500> doesn't<00:02:32.799> use

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
supersu from the get-go it doesn't use

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.789 
supersu from the get-go it doesn't use
that<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.940> kingroot<00:02:34.510> app<00:02:34.750> which<00:02:35.500> is<00:02:35.530> also

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
that that kingroot app which is also

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:45.400 
that that kingroot app which is also
another<00:02:36.160> root<00:02:36.730> source<00:02:37.030> or<00:02:37.239> whatever

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.360 

so<00:02:46.010> there<00:02:46.160> you<00:02:46.190> go<00:02:46.580> route<00:02:47.410> succeeded<00:02:48.410> and<00:02:48.680> you

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
so there you go route succeeded and you

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.690 
so there you go route succeeded and you
know<00:02:49.430> if<00:02:49.520> I<00:02:49.640> should<00:02:49.880> start<00:02:50.090> rebooting<00:02:51.520> once<00:02:52.520> my

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
know if I should start rebooting once my

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.090 
know if I should start rebooting once my
device<00:02:53.150> reboots<00:02:53.450> then<00:02:54.350> we'll<00:02:54.590> go<00:02:54.680> back<00:02:54.890> to

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
device reboots then we'll go back to

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.190 
device reboots then we'll go back to
root<00:02:55.280> checker<00:02:55.520> and<00:02:55.910> we'll<00:02:56.600> see<00:02:56.750> what<00:02:56.930> we<00:02:57.020> got

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
root checker and we'll see what we got

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.670 
root checker and we'll see what we got
ok<00:02:58.480> I'm<00:02:59.480> going<00:02:59.570> to<00:02:59.660> disconnect<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.170> USB<00:03:00.200> cable

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
ok I'm going to disconnect the USB cable

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:11.020 
ok I'm going to disconnect the USB cable

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
and Android is upgrading so let that go

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.280 
and Android is upgrading so let that go
through<00:03:16.760> it's<00:03:16.910> not<00:03:16.970> actually<00:03:17.390> updating

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
through it's not actually updating

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
just another Apple is installed so it's

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.550 
just another Apple is installed so it's
kind<00:03:22.970> of<00:03:23.000> like<00:03:23.180> updating<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:23.990> system<00:03:24.140> to

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
kind of like updating the system to

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.480 
kind of like updating the system to
include<00:03:24.890> that<00:03:24.980> app<00:03:29.620> there's<00:03:30.620> supersu<00:03:31.130> down

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
include that app there's supersu down

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.660 
include that app there's supersu down
there<00:03:32.050> okay<00:03:33.050> so<00:03:33.140> let's<00:03:33.440> go<00:03:34.400> in<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:34.520> root

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
there okay so let's go in the root

User permissions and they close out the

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.590 
User permissions and they close out the
app<00:04:10.450> and<00:04:11.020> let's<00:04:11.440> do<00:04:11.560> it<00:04:11.680> one<00:04:11.800> more<00:04:11.830> time<00:04:12.600> and

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
app and let's do it one more time and

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.770 
app and let's do it one more time and
you<00:04:13.690> guys<00:04:13.840> will<00:04:14.020> see<00:04:14.050> that<00:04:15.040> it<00:04:15.160> does<00:04:15.310> have<00:04:15.340> root

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
you guys will see that it does have root

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.150
