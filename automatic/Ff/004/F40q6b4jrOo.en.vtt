00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
battery died and i lost the power supply

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.180 
battery died and i lost the power supply
so<00:02:44.050> i<00:02:44.080> just<00:02:44.260> put<00:02:44.440> some<00:02:44.620> tape<00:02:44.650> in<00:02:44.950> there<00:02:45.100> to

so i just put some tape in there to

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.640 
so i just put some tape in there to
cover<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.550> up<00:02:45.640> but<00:02:46.630> this<00:02:46.750> is<00:02:46.810> something<00:02:47.170> i<00:02:47.380> take

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
cover it up but this is something i take

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.550 
cover it up but this is something i take
with<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.250> bug<00:02:48.400> out<00:02:48.519> bag<00:02:48.790> radio<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:50.230> if<00:02:50.319> it<00:02:50.440> gets

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
with the bug out bag radio so if it gets

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.840 
with the bug out bag radio so if it gets
broken<00:02:50.830> then<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.160> could<00:02:51.310> be<00:02:51.400> heartbroken

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
broken then that could be heartbroken

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.850 
broken then that could be heartbroken
over<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.209> but<00:02:53.049> I<00:02:53.140> can't<00:02:53.380> get<00:02:53.500> a<00:02:53.560> replacement

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
over it but I can't get a replacement

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.460 
over it but I can't get a replacement
battery<00:02:54.459> and<00:02:54.610> I<00:02:54.640> lost<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.090> AC<00:02:55.299> cord<00:02:55.870> for

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
battery and I lost the AC cord for

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.170 
battery and I lost the AC cord for
running<00:02:56.709> it<00:02:56.860> so<00:02:57.459> this<00:02:57.580> is<00:02:57.640> a<00:02:57.790> perfect<00:02:58.120> example

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
running it so this is a perfect example

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.360 
running it so this is a perfect example
of<00:02:58.630> to<00:02:59.049> demonstrate<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.650> flexibility<00:03:00.340> of

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
of to demonstrate the flexibility of
