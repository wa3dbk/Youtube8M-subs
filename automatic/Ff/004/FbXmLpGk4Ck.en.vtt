00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.130
 andy schleck lost a place 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.900
 he lost the yellow jersey yesterday and he 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.750

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.550

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.390

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.400
 a good time 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.920
 he finished 18th in this time and 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:52.270
 therefore back to 9th place overall 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.700
 4 minutes 18.2 alberto contador reigns 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.160
 taramae and 10th now to 4 21 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.140
 John Gadret who did a very bad 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.190
 times were sixth they were 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.700
 replace 11th at 4.34 the van den organs 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.729
 broeck is 12th at 4.38 and 13th places for 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.800
 ryder old dallas 4 43 or very bad 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.050
 chrono for rodriguez and bettencourt 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.890
 bettencourt which is now 14th 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.410
 at 5.25 and rodriguez is 15th at 5.27 at 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.310
 rate a good location of cadel evans 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.350
 sixth with his good time 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.800
 in any case we see each other we really see 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.470
 only between 8th and 13th place 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.140
 there are really few things 44 seconds 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.269
 it's by a lot of runners six 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.610
 Runners exactly mean they 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.840
 are six to be able to claim lem 7th 8 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.340
 go there are they going to be pretty good at 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.380
 able to claim that top 10 finally 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.900
 otherwise at the mountain level it's 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.240
 always andy schleck breaks the shirt 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.120
 in front of john gadret rain taaramae 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:00.920
 at the level of the points still nacer 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.110
 bouhanni with 35 points of progress on 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.340
 peter sagan 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.320
 Cavendish is a little further we see 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.640
 a very very close closer to chichan 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.310
 van garden who is more than one 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.980
 minute of thibaut pinot three minutes 12 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.300
 for bettencourt it seems a little bit 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.320
 a lot but bettencourt was very 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.960
 strong in the mountain 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:24.110
 queen ka na hey you to 4 47 hectares in this 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.870
 which is a very very good too far 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.240
 the level of the best teams 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.440
 team is sky in front of radioshack ag2r 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.960
 the world and not what there is a 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.030
 beautiful fourth place game frankly I 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:39.980
 Excuse me again for this big bug 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.840
 on one side it suits me that it will fall 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.130
 rather on an attack like that a bug 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.660
 only on a mountain stage 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.400
 but really I 'm sorry for this 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.410
 problem I hope you will not be 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.530
 too disappointed even though there will still be a 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:58.280
 a little bit of disappointment comes here 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.390
 a lot of my snack really disappointed that 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.520
 it's not rope 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.480
 in any case we do not get too bad 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.620
 finishes 52nd of those in this chrono on guard 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.630
 our fourth place for a small 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.580
 second on sanchez we 'll see how that 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.290
 will happen after in the Alps in all 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.340
 case there will be some flat steps 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:19.160
 before attacking go before we will say 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.280
 before attacking the alps 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.320
 tomorrow the 12th stage will be between ferns 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.840
 and turn a long step of 214 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.870
 kilometers a step almost everything 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.570
 plane that should end in the sprint 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.310
 as the table 13 in any case I 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.350
 am really sorry again 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.520
 I am as disappointed as you I think 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.440
 even more 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.370
 and so we'll meet again tomorrow for a 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.500
 fairly long stage of 115 km that will be 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.430
 between ferns and tower till tomorrow and 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.740
 sorry again 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.950
 so here it is again sir 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.290
 is my manager so today 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.840
 as you will judge seeing a big 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.920
 problem at the level of fraps and so I 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.050
 wanted to do a little bit 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.640
 a small gesture to apologize because 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.870
 you are really very numerous 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:09.450
 follow to animate this series that makes me 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.520
 really fun too that makes a little 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:15.120
 way to thank the most of 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:18.510
 100 subscribers so to apologize I'm going 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.190
 save 1 56 years a subscriber 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.340
 so 56 years it will allow you to buy 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.600
 packs of runners in the mode 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.710
 armada so that's it's really a 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.720
 gesture that I make to apologize and that 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.130
 it still makes you happy 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.200
 you are still happy with 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.030
 continue to follow the series so I 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.270
 do it really because I'm really 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.410
 very disappointed as much as you or even 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.730
 more than you that there is no 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.460
 gameplay so I really wanted to do 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:47.940
 this gesture so down to excuse me and that 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:50.010
 still you did not lose your 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.070
 your time watching my video so 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.140
 so that's the only way for the only way 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:59.070
 thing to do to participate is to 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:01.500
 put I participate and in here two or 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:04.470
 three days I will do the draw 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.910
 with random.org I will be the draw at 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:09.210
 go out to find out who it is that he will have it 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.740
 and so I see there I will spend his 56 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.510
 years a person so 5 years 10 years 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.230
 it will allow me to have a gold pack and 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.330
 silver easter so that's it 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.920
 thank you for being so many to follow 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:22.030
 this 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.800
 this series thanks for sharing it 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.540
 thanks for communicating it's really 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.770
 pretty interactive videos with 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.660
 a lot of comments and a lot of 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.250
 I like it makes me really happy and 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.250
 so I hope it's not too disappointed 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.110
 again I repeat myself but here we go 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.320
 so I hope this gesture will make you 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:41.990
 pleasure and he will forgive me for 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.670
 you from this little technical problem 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.610
 plus it's a shame because pinault 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.840
 had made a pretty good time trial 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.600
 by not spending too much time on 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:53.810
 favorites to stay fourth so I'll have 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.280
 really do you like to show you the 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.840
 gameplay but hey there is a problem with 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.040
 fraps it happens 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.450
 better than it happens on a counter 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.620
 the watch only on a mountain stage 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.390
 that's what I have to say now I 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.250
 will be really very vigilant 

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.590
 and I hope this small little gesture 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.180
 you will be happy anyway so here you go 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.500
 we'll meet tomorrow for the race 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.780
 will be from the 12th stage of this round of 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.770
 la France 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.150
 I hope you can do without 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.640
 happy holidays where you work well 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.290

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.010
