00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.990
 there are opportunities for the Boulogne team because we have done everything 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.939
 to mark so 

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:10.429
 % 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.869
 especially in the field in the last match 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:16.829
 the last twenty minutes 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:18.089
 three years 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:19.949
 trying to score percent 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.569
 but this goal is inevitably 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:25.789
 the cds passed 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.789
 the governor will soon hit it they were 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.270
 twenty fast death us hearts 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.550
 who according to m 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.550
 are eager to the exciting it's ugly 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.530
 of course it could have been worse and it could have been better 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.330
 in the face at 5 00 pm show 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.570
 in August 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.570
 online 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.380
 we will see if this point 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.420
 this point contract the hungry% and I think manca men possession the ball 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.210
 but French mandate 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.370
 we were above them 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.130
 the average of the habit 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.930
 Well here we missed the little thing for to mark unlock 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.370
 the situation I think that 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.710
 the first twenty minutes we do not have what we did not succeed because my son 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.420
 got stuck 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.520
 and we have inevitably conflict team that plays last week 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.570
 no, it gives a fitted and the Elysee have evolved the rest of the 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.570
 match m 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.240
 the worry is deteriorating day to day behind 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.899
 the spaces summer and on the sides we used them I think this first 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.110
 match since the beginning of season center time 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.110
 % he missed the most 6% millimeters 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.930
 percent either in the center or the arrival no here but good as they 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.930
 were numerous in the surface was complicated 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.500
 in e 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.500
 this is nothing in our quality of play ours 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.650
 our 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.610
 our competitiveness 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.110
 it is a point of taking one continues to advance 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.580
 not only this calendar at 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.199
 we do not stop 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.479
 we'll see in the end if it's positive but 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:14.479
 we continue to advance 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.879
 but it's going well 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:36.739
 m in the first leg against Boulogne we scored twice on kick 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:37.739
 stopped 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.329
 Stern 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.659
 bensalah style it's still complicated but hey everyone at each team defends 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.209
 his 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.829
 his name to muscular way against May 10 and in eurasia 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.609
 maybe we have more trouble against teams playing 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:53.749
 Saint Nazaire 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:55.169
 but percent 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:57.319
 good here is the reality 2 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.439
 some matches we have to try to find the flaws so it's under the 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:02.909
 kicks stopped often 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.089
 to unlock situations and especially I think it's 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:08.809
 in this kind of confrontation be human 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:10.739
 the first half hour is important 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.090
 to open the score is for them try to play the the to manage 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.090
 differently there the rest of the match 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:26.109
 ben e 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.509
 he may find himself in situations 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:30.859
 we will arrive in a period where the matches will be more and more 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.819
 complicated more and more closed because each team is going to need to 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:34.619
 you 

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:37.389
 two points 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:38.879
 but I hope that m 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.719
 that our cultures were years old with finding them but that would be a strength 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:45.719
 extra for the end of the season 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.939
 yeah except it's not the same competition you need a replacement 

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:02.979
 so it will be another 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:05.979
 our match management 

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:10.199
 the main thing is to qualify
