00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
so let's say I wanted to where's where's

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:36.229 
so let's say I wanted to where's where's
where's<00:03:32.940> where's<00:03:33.650> swiftness<00:03:34.650> watch<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.340> start

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
where's where's swiftness watch it start

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.420 
where's where's swiftness watch it start
to<00:03:36.450> take<00:03:36.720> away<00:03:37.019> my<00:03:37.230> swiftness<00:03:37.709> so<00:03:38.160> if<00:03:38.280> I

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
to take away my swiftness so if I

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.099 
to take away my swiftness so if I
stretch<00:03:38.669> pitches<00:03:39.090> down<00:03:39.269> I'm<00:03:39.540> running<00:03:39.930> running

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
stretch pitches down I'm running running

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:40.650 
stretch pitches down I'm running running
running

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
running

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.510 
running
running<00:03:41.110> oh<00:03:41.640> they<00:03:42.640> have<00:03:42.790> it<00:03:42.910> on<00:03:43.030> both<00:03:43.360> sides
