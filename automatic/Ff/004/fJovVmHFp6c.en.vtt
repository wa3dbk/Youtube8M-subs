00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:18.200
 and you have something purely experiential is 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.450
 the ability of man to lend 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.700
 attention to the present moment of a 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:27.230
 special shape and without judging 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.230
 that is mindfulness 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:34.509
 is based on observation and 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.509
 attention what you see 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.050
 is one of the techniques that the 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.390
 Dr. John Cava Cinema at the University 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.430

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.969
 third-generation medicine and without the 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.969
 of mind-body 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.860
 eight - week program which 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:55.329
 can measure its impact by clearing day to 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.780
 day the content of it and assuming 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.780
 all right 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.930
 the program is designed for 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.950
 stress reduction anxiety crisis 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.950
 depression panic 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.860
 Well, I already knew about this because of issues 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.780
 work and had read but never what 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.090
 I had experienced in myself that is 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.740
 the part that I was missing and I'm leaving 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.740
 extremely satisfied with the experience 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.450
 oriental meditation cantinflas 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.990
 practices of more than 2,500 years based 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.990
 in zen 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.430
 I already knew mindfulness and 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.740
 mindfulness and then I was interested 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.260
 especially for acquiring one more practice 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.700
 regular and by sharing it in a group 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.940
 because I think you learn a lot 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.400
 doing it in group every session has 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.740
 about two and a half hours long there 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.320
 a theoretical part and a plastic part 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.050
 more leafy and little that I will authorize and 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.390
 a lot that practices a way to 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.530
 understand the life of controlling your 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:06.650
 feelings to know at every moment that 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.600
 is happening the best is the 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.310
 Alejandro's ability to handle the 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.310
 group and to contact us with the days 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.680
 to give that way of thinking and that way of 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.950
 be taking it out of any context 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.410
 spiritual and apply it to us here 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.800
 in this society so advanced between 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.800
 quotation marks 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.240
 is very well we have learned a lot and I 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.370
 the truth that I take many things that 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.730
 I would recommend to anyone the 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.090
 general population try that all 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.940
 let's be a little better and that 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.180
 society be a little more compassionate and 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.180
 plus
