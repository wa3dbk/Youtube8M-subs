throw the net at them and you have a

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.080 
throw the net at them and you have a
decent<00:02:34.740> chance<00:02:34.920> around<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.520> thirty<00:02:35.760> percent

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090

chance<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.900> actually<00:02:37.080> capture<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:38.190> monster

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
chance to actually capture the monster

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.210

and<00:02:38.880> turn<00:02:39.390> him<00:02:39.540> into<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.870> battle<00:02:40.260> pet<00:02:40.470> if<00:02:40.710> you

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
and turn him into a battle pet if you

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.050 
and turn him into a battle pet if you
fail<00:02:41.550> just<00:02:42.210> throw<00:02:42.450> another<00:02:42.870> net<00:02:43.230> at<00:02:43.440> him<00:02:43.830> and

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
fail just throw another net at him and

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.790 
fail just throw another net at him and
the<00:02:45.060> net<00:02:45.270> has<00:02:45.480> about<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.780> one-minute<00:02:46.470> reused

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800

the net has about a one-minute reused
time<00:02:47.130> so<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.730> can<00:02:47.880> still<00:02:48.300> do<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:48.900> you

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
time so you can still do that and you

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.870 
time so you can still do that and you
