00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:12.080
 Haie It is very much Hello Good evening or dsa this time 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:18.050
 8 I would like to introduce the decks used by this Sushi . 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.860
 Addressed to the number heart of the door with a machine that uses a er number God theory is that'm nicely in the last video 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.599
 By 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.950
 Well I introduced it, but it is a deck introduction based on that kind of thing, this is everyone 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.850
 Is relatively at hand 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:33.760
 Easy to Bakka card Nandei Heck Well Kure shop 8th Dan deep-rooted that enters the hand 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:38.890
 As long because it contains three I think relatively easy to make this guy 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.359
 I think I can probably make it if there is one more card with this guy, but the introduction is immediately introduced 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.489
 I want to go 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:47.570
 In this guy it Is abilities 8 charge impact generated by the fact that the aqueous imposing of spirit 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:52.070
 When my charge impact 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.820
 Your part of the round by pressing the same shape still charge impact speed been 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.680
 The guard is 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.180
 It is 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:01.100
 The faster you get up, the better the effect will be. 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:05.089
 It It is a card Te card is the capability over 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.780
 Why the enemy's charge impact speed is faster and faster 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:13.040
 This means that this will be strengthened Yes 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.610
 So let's introduce the members immediately 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.630
 It is named by the jar crew di kid 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:23.640
 It is better to name it, so there are 3 steps of Kurisei reduced, so this is Kusumi deck 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.640
 It may be better to have you capture it 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:32.690
 In the first place, members are pilaf machines and Mars thin nonons that appeared in the last video 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:38.480
 Because 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:43.550
 The two three or three of the Well at Well let N the charge bag speed faster 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:47.159
 RyuShin theory of super layer of eight stages of the jerk Dragon mission of cards are as one 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:51.730
 It is a person worth say ah number of God I Otohime state 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:56.080
 If this wins charge impact speed and wins archer clothing and 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:02:01.450
 Well forced early is because that was the berth to increase the charge impact of enemy 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:05.020
 Instead of letting them have their own ability to accelerate charge impact , different house charge impact 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.569
 It is bought whether and makes charge of the other party faster 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.659
 Why do not think that there is no complaint even if I use this I think the partner 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:15.560
 I don't think it 's always a shame to be selfishly fast 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:18.470
 After all Nde becomes about Is the losing yourself in charge 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.760
 Well I think it can not be helped 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.019
 Then there is the ability 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:30.720
 Well members after it is that resonance to the negative energy can be understood Could see what 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:33.720
 I think I can use this unit to make a decision bar, but my team's enemy and 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.740
 By replacing the team spirit 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.630
 Land uses the whole energy 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.470
 Is 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:47.300
 It is thin 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.470
 Because it has a Doradaku dragon giving away gone by rubbing so it would shave that also recorded all 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.990
 Because it will 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:55.520
 In enemy extraction force With this record conversion unit to the next round Kasukasude of here 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.510
 The record is manta 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.819
 Well in the case of a computer 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:08.280
 Why is this deck so interesting? 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:10.560
 In Well This thinner has the ability of resonance to the negative energy 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.790
 Ryushin theory etc. 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:19.670
 It is usable together well, and the race car also has a fixed fighting power. 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.670
 Since I do not know whether to go one made but not used yet this resonance 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.440
 Have in 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.760
 Well that the effect is up Well, in the dark dragon of lightning strike 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.690
 Well 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.460
 Of reducing 50% of the damage, such as mortal yesterday Te 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.270
 The I power is 50 percent down 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:40.870
 What 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:46.750
 It is quite good for the purpose that the firepower comes out 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:50.870
 It is easy to use It is guarding high here if the opportunity goes to the person who is cool by this 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:54.710
 But my partner is 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.270
 Oh and mortal is also 50% down 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:02.430
 Since the on hold is not 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:04.620
 Well, the rest yes it is No, also been used since the Tycho is hate it this pure competition is pilaf 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.420
 This rice adolescence with machines etc 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.420
 Oh did I say the future or future Gohan but 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:15.300
 This is because we have a shield break well 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:21.380
 Because the power of this sucking scene is over 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:27.580
 Very Well I think it 's such a door you can expect that damage 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:34.050
 The integrated continent with this strength is about 19000 yen 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:39.229
 And maybe because the ability is forced to estrus when used in the super Monst Kavos 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.229
 You 're a rebel to despair 8 hd your own at the end of the round 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.760
 If your spp is lower than your own constituency lasts 5,000 yen 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:52.590
 It means that 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:55.540
 Nde Nde persistence of a one sound it is that there is much 5000 guy 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.710
 Yeah yeah 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:03.340
 Why all the way may leave the 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:07.780
 Well, I can keep 5000, so I am charged 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:10.199
 Well early another good reason why the seams are so fast What's the same as Hayatsu comes 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.199
 I think 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.520
 The truth is that 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:24.389
 I thought it would be better to go to the Jackie family of my wife hero 's place in rice . 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:30.089
 In When the idea that Nagarekokoro are'm already referred to as the type in the speed break as 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:30.899
 So that the most the last to become a hero So four is elite Finally gone wide area 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:34.270
 Good 

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:39.160
 Oh it hear think Ikan'na ingredients 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:44.660
 I now Koren rice have Well this guy Naraemaa shield break 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:48.520
 Because I can take advantage of the handwritten bite I can cover Seaman h can cover the bite 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:52.539
 I think it's very good 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:55.569
 Maybe now Well then people and wood speed open because the speed break is faster 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:06:00.639
 The promotion theory is further strengthened 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:06:03.479
 In addition, the pilaf machine will attack the enemy with an early charge impact, so this is very 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.479
 That deck is 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.420
 Hey 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:11.270
 It's a great thing 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:17.210
 I have balanced and now I can not get my bios 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:18.380
 To come flying in it and I that fast or should I say Nante that eventually 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:24.310
 Say that 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:24.310
 I'm worried so I have to win the kick charge, but all 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.900
 In addition the following three Landmaker's Rondo first opponent of Kiryoku is here in Kasukasu a full tank 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.740
 It is a state 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:42.169
 Tea masters if that enemy comes to energy recovery 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:44.340
 Why 23 Miko absolutely Well because the state there is a fertility spawning a little to Kirukon 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:50.540
 The third round is 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:50.540
 I use it with the staff l Change and save a little 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:59.430
 Why's in the can is not is that energy recovery if you use Toka Well party not 's two times 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:02.610
 What's so nice not keep in land Neun 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:05.060
 h Insect bite is is it is good even if the continent is up 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.060
 Randoa to 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:11.139
 That's what it feels like the energy is also a factory , so that 's a child like that in a different house in the studio 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.910
 It is quiet 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:17.350
 It was definitely not hungry 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:22.150
 Because I think that it will be accumulated to learn how to spend one energy 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:23.230
 Sometimes it accumulates and easy to accumulate in that very Since Regohan also initiative Lumpur is 5000 up 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:28.090
 Kana I think I 

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:29.910
 The mansion that scene Toetto pilaf machine say that rice is not struck by if I Oh I Energy 

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:33.150
 I can hit it with 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:38.580
 I have to eat at least seven 

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:40.540
 Since the use following land unit facts, such as the Uni-five Why that 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:45.320
 very 

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:49.160
 It feels like it's a bit tough without energy 

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:50.070
 I would like to end the better of this deck featured in Yes Well more 

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:54.890
 Hey 

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:54.890
 This deck is more favorite than this deck 

00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:01.810
 After a little use I want it Well and poor try to take that Prue video somewhere that on weekdays 

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:05.410
 May go 

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:09.130
 Please deliberate another if you are good 

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:11.850
 Well earth Thank you that I think you So what you watch and want to end on this side 

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.850
 We will
