that I was expecting a camcorder for
Christmas<00:03:28.170> when<00:03:28.319> I<00:03:28.379> got<00:03:28.680> one<00:03:28.890> and<00:03:29.129> now<00:03:29.430> I'm<00:03:29.640> my

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:50.400 

just<00:03:40.349> start

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:04:01.070 

yes<00:03:50.980> you<00:03:51.160> could

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:11.130 

fiberglass<00:04:05.280> inside<00:04:06.280> that<00:04:06.520> wall

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.259 

this<00:04:11.800> cutaway<00:04:12.160> is<00:04:12.280> just<00:04:12.670> a<00:04:13.200> demonstration<00:04:15.269> of

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
this cutaway is just a demonstration of

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.410 
this cutaway is just a demonstration of
what<00:04:16.510> that<00:04:16.690> fiberglass<00:04:17.049> looks<00:04:17.530> like<00:04:18.420> in

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
what that fiberglass looks like in

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.740 
what that fiberglass looks like in
actuality<00:04:20.230> it<00:04:20.410> gets<00:04:21.390> adhered<00:04:22.390> to<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.720> inside

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
actuality it gets adhered to the inside

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.150 
actuality it gets adhered to the inside
wall<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:24.750> that's<00:04:25.750> what<00:04:26.050> brings<00:04:26.350> the<00:04:26.650> fuel<00:04:26.950> up

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
wall and that's what brings the fuel up

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.640 
wall and that's what brings the fuel up
via<00:04:28.150> capillary<00:04:28.419> action<00:04:30.150> up<00:04:31.150> to<00:04:31.510> the<00:04:31.930> top<00:04:32.169> and

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
via capillary action up to the top and

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.180 
via capillary action up to the top and
that's<00:04:33.610> what<00:04:34.710> is<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:35.950> reason<00:04:36.310> for<00:04:36.340> a<00:04:37.169> quick

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
that's what is the reason for a quick

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.780
