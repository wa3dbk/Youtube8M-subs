did<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:23.459> cable<00:02:23.819> tension<00:02:23.970> monitor<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:26.010> can

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
did to the cable tension monitor it can

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.149 
did to the cable tension monitor it can
be<00:02:26.610> overridden<00:02:27.180> with<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.870> resistor<00:02:28.349> that's

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
be overridden with the resistor that's

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.229 
be overridden with the resistor that's
all<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.340> had<00:02:29.489> to<00:02:29.549> do<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.640> shove<00:02:29.909> a<00:02:30.000> little

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
all I had to do a shove a little

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.570 
all I had to do a shove a little
resistor<00:02:30.720> down<00:02:30.870> in<00:02:31.049> there<00:02:31.340> because<00:02:32.340> if<00:02:32.459> you

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
resistor down in there because if you

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.949 
resistor down in there because if you
look<00:02:32.790> at<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.090> inside<00:02:33.360> of<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.540> cable<00:02:33.810> tension

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
look at the inside of the cable tension

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.320 
look at the inside of the cable tension
monitor<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:35.430> will<00:02:35.549> see<00:02:35.790> there's<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.120> little

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
monitor you will see there's a little

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.920 
monitor you will see there's a little
resistor<00:02:36.840> with<00:02:37.019> a<00:02:37.049> switch<00:02:37.349> and<00:02:38.750> what<00:02:39.750> that

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
resistor with a switch and what that

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.030 
resistor with a switch and what that
switch<00:02:40.200> does<00:02:40.470> is<00:02:40.650> opens<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.370> circuit<00:02:41.790> if<00:02:42.239> the

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
switch does is opens the circuit if the

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.229 
switch does is opens the circuit if the
tension<00:02:44.040> monitor<00:02:44.549> if<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:44.879> triggers<00:02:46.579> but<00:02:47.579> while

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
tension monitor if it triggers but while

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.390 
tension monitor if it triggers but while
that<00:02:48.480> circuit<00:02:49.110> is<00:02:49.230> closed<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.010> switches

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
that circuit is closed and the switches

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.229 
that circuit is closed and the switches
off<00:02:50.690> that<00:02:51.690> resistor<00:02:52.319> is<00:02:52.440> active<00:02:52.829> and<00:02:53.209> all<00:02:54.209> I

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
off that resistor is active and all I

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.759 
off that resistor is active and all I
had<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.480> do<00:02:54.599> is<00:02:54.720> just<00:02:54.870> shove<00:02:55.079> a<00:02:55.109> resistor<00:02:55.590> down

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
had to do is just shove a resistor down

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.920 
had to do is just shove a resistor down
in<00:02:55.920> here<00:02:56.099> and<00:02:56.340> they<00:02:57.090> had<00:02:57.180> eliminated<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.750> need

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
in here and they had eliminated the need

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.960 
in here and they had eliminated the need
for<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.290> cable<00:02:58.560> tension<00:02:58.709> monitor<00:02:59.129> does<00:02:59.790> not

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
for the cable tension monitor does not

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.630 
for the cable tension monitor does not
work<00:03:00.150> with<00:03:00.329> the<00:03:00.420> eyes<00:03:00.540> though<00:03:00.780> unfortunately

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
work with the eyes though unfortunately

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.849 
work with the eyes though unfortunately
this<00:03:02.640> door<00:03:02.910> probably<00:03:03.329> it<00:03:03.930> probably<00:03:04.109> a<00:03:04.620> blow

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
this door probably it probably a blow

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.410 
this door probably it probably a blow
cables<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.459> don't<00:03:05.640> know<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:05.730> guess<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.090> could<00:03:06.239> find

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
cables I don't know I guess I could find

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.509 
cables I don't know I guess I could find
out<00:03:06.680> let's<00:03:07.680> get<00:03:07.829> we<00:03:07.920> can<00:03:08.010> blow<00:03:08.129> the<00:03:08.190> cables

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
out let's get we can blow the cables

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.610 
out let's get we can blow the cables
here<00:03:08.660> put<00:03:09.660> my<00:03:09.690> hand<00:03:09.959> up<00:03:10.109> and<00:03:10.260> stop<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:12.440> it<00:03:13.440> did

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
here put my hand up and stop it it did

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.520 
here put my hand up and stop it it did
go<00:03:13.739> back<00:03:13.920> up<00:03:14.099> though<00:03:14.310> so<00:03:14.609> that<00:03:14.790> is<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.090> thing

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
go back up though so that is the thing

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.009 
go back up though so that is the thing

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
both cables you know I can fix it in two

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.479 
both cables you know I can fix it in two
minutes<00:03:22.190> but<00:03:23.569> anyway<00:03:24.569> there<00:03:24.750> we<00:03:24.840> are

well<00:03:33.750> good<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.910> see<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.060> old<00:03:36.150> 14<00:03:37.049> 1<00:03:37.169> by<00:03:37.290> sevens

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
well good to see the old 14 1 by sevens

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.280 
well good to see the old 14 1 by sevens
back<00:03:37.769> there<00:03:38.010> got<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.280> couple<00:03:38.459> craftsmen's

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
back there got a couple craftsmen's

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
back there got a couple craftsmen's
nothing<00:03:40.290> that<00:03:40.440> hasn't<00:03:40.620> been<00:03:40.829> shown<00:03:41.099> though

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
nothing that hasn't been shown though

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.800 
nothing that hasn't been shown though
yet<00:03:41.579> I<00:03:41.790> did<00:03:42.090> look<00:03:42.239> through<00:03:42.419> that<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.660> other

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
yet I did look through that the other

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.050 
yet I did look through that the other
day<00:03:42.930> if<00:03:43.200> there's<00:03:43.319> anything<00:03:43.500> I<00:03:43.620> missed<00:03:44.060> nothing

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
day if there's anything I missed nothing

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.110 
day if there's anything I missed nothing
that<00:03:45.359> hasn't<00:03:45.569> been<00:03:45.780> shown<00:03:46.019> so<00:03:46.880> there's<00:03:47.880> my

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
that hasn't been shown so there's my

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.860 
that hasn't been shown so there's my
overhead<00:03:48.870> SF<00:03:49.410> ldz<00:03:49.829> -<00:03:50.220> two<00:03:50.430> five<00:03:50.639> one<00:03:50.819> I<00:03:51.060> used<00:03:51.780> to

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
overhead SF ldz - two five one I used to

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.210 
overhead SF ldz - two five one I used to
have<00:03:51.989> those<00:03:52.139> trick<00:03:52.349> drives<00:03:52.650> that<00:03:52.799> I<00:03:52.889> do<00:03:52.950> want

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
have those trick drives that I do want

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.900 
have those trick drives that I do want
to<00:03:53.280> film<00:03:53.459> someday<00:03:55.280> but<00:03:56.280> other<00:03:56.430> than<00:03:56.519> that<00:03:56.669> yeah

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
to film someday but other than that yeah

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.300 
to film someday but other than that yeah
I<00:03:57.150> guess<00:03:58.019> tomorrow<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:58.470> found<00:03:58.919> like<00:03:59.069> I'm<00:03:59.220> gonna

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
I guess tomorrow I found like I'm gonna

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.860 
I guess tomorrow I found like I'm gonna
be<00:03:59.400> pulling<00:03:59.579> on<00:03:59.730> a<00:03:59.760> craftsman<00:04:00.299> so<00:04:00.540> we'll<00:04:00.720> see

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
be pulling on a craftsman so we'll see

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.659 
be pulling on a craftsman so we'll see
what<00:04:00.989> that<00:04:01.019> kind<00:04:01.980> of<00:04:02.010> old<00:04:02.160> from<00:04:02.340> that<00:04:02.519> is

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
what that kind of old from that is

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.460 
what that kind of old from that is
that's<00:04:02.970> any<00:04:03.120> good<00:04:03.329> I'll<00:04:03.989> go<00:04:04.139> ahead<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:04.349> run

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
that's any good I'll go ahead and run
