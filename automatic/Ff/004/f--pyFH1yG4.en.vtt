00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.159
 2nd place 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:14.050
 re 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:14.050
 Hello emo best is here to introduce today 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.030
 Separate and 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.200
 spx art series 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:28.900
 The gold treating physician I was making here 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.510
 To the Tteyuu by Kincheru is 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.010
 I agree 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.420
 It's easy to see the original document on the screen of the computer display 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.510
 It is very useful around the desk to be 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:47.470
 Become a lens 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:50.160
 It is very comfortable and easy to use for those who do computer for a long time 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:54.000
 Well then 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.150
 Let's look at the eyes we can 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.480
 It is what I saw from the side of this side 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.329
 Lens shape is also slightly urban and cool 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.449
 It is a government 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.600
 That up until now 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:12.870
 Minimal art 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.080
 In this titanium ne part part of that bridge in the middle Netto is the metal that is in comparison with the 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.280
 it's finished 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:24.200
 The side part uses spx material too 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:30.170
 I used to use that titanium before , but it looks like it 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:32.790
 Just a little more refined, just a bit late 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.490
 You will feel like it is shaped up 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.310
 When viewed from the front 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.550
 Well then 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.810
 It's a bunch of lens shapes, but both are great 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.340
 There is a heat 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.810
 It is seen from the person who these guys were already angry 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.470
 Bending and bridge in Kure side 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:58.340
 It is a part on the floor of the floor , but this bridge too 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:01.910
 Really confided is beautiful it was polish 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:06.770
 So here 's where the lens stops 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:15.250
 Formerly short time colors If it is this 2 mm a 2 point 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:15.250
 I had to stop to open a hole here now type that keep open two 1.4 hole 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.090
 To here 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.319
 It is the feature of this spx art 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.660
 It is next to the if there is this sense of transparency this to it 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.940
 It has entered pattern school 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.440
 It becomes a form 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.180
 The woman with the commander can generally say that frame overall 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:43.250
 For example yeah 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:48.050
 I strongly conscious of the color of the part according to my skin, not the color of the part I put 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.200
 Well I think as Tteyuu are designed in the state when applying its kana major feature 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.200
 I will 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.490
 This is also a fine hinge but it is very # 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:02.850
 It is printed sour 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:04.720
 Here also I'm is written I titanium I'd This inner It is a place of that ear 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.010
 This is to 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.010
 Because it is a dissertation 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.390
 In this way 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.630
 It was so clear 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.740
 a 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.990
 It has become a frame 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:25.680
 Little interest and Dezaki ball side is I'd like Reimu lens shape 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:30.420
 I wondered if there was a minute and I thought this was a bit 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:37.080
 That foma that is the source of the lens shape 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:38.190
 I used to say that it was hard before, but here we make the shape of the lens 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.330
 You go 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:47.800
 And this is the form of the main art series, but that up to now 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:52.360
 Well why glasses are all but I have seen variously 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:57.530
 That really good to put something I'm a little has changed among the lens shape 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:02.630
 There are many shapes, such as these 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:06.890
 It's after this I'm going to paint this now is the direction of the flower 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:10.840
 It is a city Please make to this kind of feeling 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:14.470
 It also has various alignment example 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.480
 You can also make it if you say various bookkeeping department 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.549
 Yeah 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:25.800
 I think that you can consult If you would like to introduce color fun glasses again 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:28.610
 Also thank you very much This show is a drag of this summer offering 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.610
 It was slowly
