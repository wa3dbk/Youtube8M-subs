00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
was to get you thing I've got quite a

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.219 
was to get you thing I've got quite a
few<00:01:07.890> players<00:01:08.369> i<00:01:08.549> see<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.939> miles<00:01:09.210> anderson<00:01:09.869> it

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229

few players i see that miles anderson it
i<00:01:10.350> do<00:01:10.409> think<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.070> was<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> blackburn<00:01:11.909> kit<00:01:12.180> on

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.060 
i do think that was a blackburn kit on
him<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.840> they<00:01:12.930> may<00:01:13.080> have<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.260> bit<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.409> talent<00:01:13.710> as

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
him so they may have a bit of talent as

only<00:04:51.659> around<00:04:51.930> a<00:04:52.050> 51<00:04:52.650> rate<00:04:52.860> so<00:04:53.099> that<00:04:53.129> was<00:04:53.340> really

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
only around a 51 rate so that was really

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.490 
only around a 51 rate so that was really
surprising<00:04:54.000> he<00:04:54.449> has<00:04:54.599> got<00:04:54.720> decent<00:04:54.960> peers<00:04:55.319> so

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.570 
surprising he has got decent peers so
that's<00:04:55.680> why<00:04:55.800> I've<00:04:55.919> put<00:04:56.129> them<00:04:56.220> in<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:56.370> team
