sorry<00:00:02.070> they<00:00:02.190> got<00:00:02.310> a<00:00:02.340> temporary<00:00:02.700> wired<00:00:03.149> up<00:00:03.449> I

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
sorry they got a temporary wired up I

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.369 
sorry they got a temporary wired up I
didn't<00:00:04.049> put<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.259> water<00:00:04.470> pump<00:00:04.799> or<00:00:05.009> anything<00:00:05.190> in

00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:06.379 
didn't put the water pump or anything in

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:08.480 
didn't put the water pump or anything in
so<00:00:07.379> I<00:00:07.440> don't<00:00:07.529> know<00:00:07.649> how<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.890> lie<00:00:08.010> you<00:00:08.069> could<00:00:08.250> see

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
so I don't know how to lie you could see

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.120 
so I don't know how to lie you could see
it<00:00:08.610> but<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:08.940> got<00:00:09.090> everything<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.920> needs<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.070> be

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
it but I got everything that needs to be

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.730 
it but I got everything that needs to be
on<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.519> seize<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.849> out<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.150> spark<00:00:12.450> fires<00:00:12.750> is

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
on to seize the out the spark fires is

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.269 
on to seize the out the spark fires is
on<00:00:14.210> so<00:00:15.210> we're<00:00:15.389> good<00:00:15.540> there<00:00:15.809> when<00:00:16.020> their<00:00:16.279> mass

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
on so we're good there when their mass

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.200 
on so we're good there when their mass
airflow<00:00:17.990> paddle<00:00:18.990> position<00:00:19.640> what<00:00:20.640> else

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
airflow paddle position what else

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.920 
airflow paddle position what else
I<00:00:22.100> didn't<00:00:23.100> plug<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.789> plugged<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
I didn't plug that I plugged in the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.700 
I didn't plug that I plugged in the
water<00:00:25.199> pump<00:00:27.109> which<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.260> don't<00:00:28.439> think<00:00:28.590> that

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
water pump which I don't think that

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.830 
water pump which I don't think that
sensor<00:00:29.130> reads<00:00:29.340> air<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.640> only<00:00:29.730> reads<00:00:29.970> liquid<00:00:30.510> so

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
sensor reads air it only reads liquid so

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.720 
sensor reads air it only reads liquid so
I<00:00:31.109> don't<00:00:31.500> think<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.769> has<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.040> be<00:00:32.219> done<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:32.669> I

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
I don't think that has to be done but I

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.290 
I don't think that has to be done but I
just<00:00:32.940> did<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.210> for<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.390> whole<00:00:33.570> lit<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.440> no

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
just did it for a whole lit so no

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.370 
just did it for a whole lit so no
batteries<00:00:36.300> hooked<00:00:36.420> up<00:00:36.690> let's<00:00:36.930> see<00:00:37.110> if<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
batteries hooked up let's see if the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:01:09.660 
batteries hooked up let's see if the
fires<00:00:40.910> ready<00:00:41.910> yeah

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.740 

all<00:01:10.180> right<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:12.970> still<00:01:13.090> having<00:01:13.360> trouble

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
all right it's still having trouble

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.109 
all right it's still having trouble
Optus<00:01:14.500> mark<00:01:14.770> still<00:01:15.310> coding<00:01:15.580> out<00:01:15.820> codes<00:01:16.200> 16

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
Optus mark still coding out codes 16

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.080 
Optus mark still coding out codes 16
let's<00:01:19.119> see<00:01:19.450> I<00:01:19.750> got<00:01:20.050> my<00:01:20.200> voltmeter<00:01:20.619> here<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
let's see I got my voltmeter here the

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.510 
let's see I got my voltmeter here the
black<00:01:22.330> and<00:01:22.570> red<00:01:22.600> wire<00:01:23.159> suppose<00:01:24.159> get<00:01:24.310> four

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
black and red wire suppose get four

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.830 
black and red wire suppose get four
point<00:01:24.760> eight<00:01:24.880> six<00:01:25.180> or<00:01:25.420> something<00:01:25.540> like<00:01:25.780> that

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
point eight six or something like that

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.060 
point eight six or something like that
volts<00:01:26.380> we're<00:01:26.560> getting<00:01:26.860> that<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:28.830> that's<00:01:29.830> this

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
volts we're getting that so that's this

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:40.399 
volts we're getting that so that's this
one<00:01:32.640> who<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:34.300> ground<00:01:34.570> is<00:01:34.780> good<00:01:35.050> on<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:35.770> coil

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.609 

so<00:01:41.409> we're<00:01:41.619> good<00:01:41.800> there<00:01:42.899> there's<00:01:43.899> no<00:01:44.110> rips<00:01:44.410> or

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
so we're good there there's no rips or

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.999 
so we're good there there's no rips or
tears<00:01:44.860> in<00:01:45.130> any<00:01:45.280> of<00:01:45.430> these<00:01:45.520> wires<00:01:46.770> follow<00:01:47.770> it

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
tears in any of these wires follow it

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.180 
tears in any of these wires follow it
all<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.160> way<00:01:48.399> back<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.649> computer

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
all the way back to the computer

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.950 
all the way back to the computer
I<00:01:51.810> got<00:01:52.810> nothing<00:01:53.200> there<00:01:54.810> everything's<00:01:55.810> hooked

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
I got nothing there everything's hooked

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.870 
I got nothing there everything's hooked
up<00:01:56.229> and<00:01:56.500> I'm<00:01:56.560> still<00:01:56.800> getting<00:01:56.950> code<00:01:57.280> sixteen

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
up and I'm still getting code sixteen

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:24.520 
up and I'm still getting code sixteen
what<00:01:58.210> else<00:01:58.450> can<00:01:58.750> cause<00:01:59.020> this<00:02:04.770> yeah

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.710 

let's<00:02:25.160> see<00:02:25.490> it<00:02:25.940> was<00:02:26.090> still<00:02:26.270> getting<00:02:26.360> that<00:02:26.540> one

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
let's see it was still getting that one

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.720 
let's see it was still getting that one
