anything<00:02:02.330> but<00:02:02.690> the<00:02:03.410> back<00:02:03.650> will<00:02:04.010> scratch<00:02:04.370> drop

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
anything but the back will scratch drop

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.180 
anything but the back will scratch drop
but<00:02:04.940> if<00:02:05.150> it<00:02:05.960> doesn't<00:02:06.170> have<00:02:06.260> a<00:02:06.290> plastic<00:02:06.530> fill

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
but if it doesn't have a plastic fill

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.030 
but if it doesn't have a plastic fill
but<00:02:07.400> it<00:02:07.460> has<00:02:07.550> a<00:02:07.580> smooth<00:02:07.910> feeling<00:02:08.210> on<00:02:08.930> it<00:02:09.110> but<00:02:09.890> my

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
but it has a smooth feeling on it but my

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.520 
but it has a smooth feeling on it but my
favorite<00:02:10.369> thing<00:02:10.399> though<00:02:10.729> is<00:02:11.000> that<00:02:11.060> is<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:12.410> way

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
favorite thing though is that is the way

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.230 
favorite thing though is that is the way
tells<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:12.890> time<00:02:13.100> has<00:02:13.580> everything<00:02:13.940> on<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.330> and

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
tells the time has everything on it and

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.640 
tells the time has everything on it and
