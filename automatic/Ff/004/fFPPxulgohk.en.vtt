00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
fingers and you're going to take the

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.660 
fingers and you're going to take the
cocoon<00:01:28.060> curl<00:01:28.360> and<00:01:28.630> wrap<00:01:28.930> it<00:01:29.170> around<00:01:29.350> as<00:01:30.340> you<00:01:30.550> do

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
cocoon curl and wrap it around as you do

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.090 
cocoon curl and wrap it around as you do
a<00:01:30.700> bantu<00:01:31.180> knot<00:01:31.420> going<00:01:31.780> underneath<00:01:32.170> each<00:01:32.590> twirl

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
a bantu knot going underneath each twirl

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.820 
a bantu knot going underneath each twirl
and<00:01:33.810> then<00:01:34.810> when<00:01:35.050> you're<00:01:35.170> getting<00:01:35.410> to<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.560> end

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
and then when you're getting to the end

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.290 
and then when you're getting to the end
you're<00:01:36.130> going<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:36.340> take<00:01:36.580> that<00:01:36.820> end<00:01:37.120> right

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
you're going to take that end right

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.810 
you're going to take that end right
there<00:01:37.330> and<00:01:38.310> you're<00:01:39.310> going<00:01:39.490> to<00:01:39.520> pull<00:01:39.790> it

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
there and you're going to pull it

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.730 
there and you're going to pull it
through<00:01:39.970> the<00:01:40.330> loop<00:01:40.570> but<00:01:40.930> not<00:01:41.110> all<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:41.500> way<00:01:41.680> so

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
through the loop but not all the way so

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.760 
through the loop but not all the way so
you<00:01:42.040> have<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.280> little<00:01:42.840> tip<00:01:43.840> of<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.470> hair

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
you have a little tip of the hair

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.020 
you have a little tip of the hair
exposed<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:47.290> you<00:01:47.590> have<00:01:47.890> that<00:01:48.460> little<00:01:48.700> piece

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
exposed so you have that little piece

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.969 
exposed so you have that little piece
right<00:01:49.270> there<00:01:49.330> and<00:01:49.869> plus<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.170> little<00:01:50.530> loop<00:01:50.800> at

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
right there and plus a little loop at

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.260 
right there and plus a little loop at
the<00:01:51.010> end<00:01:52.920> I'm<00:01:53.920> gonna<00:01:54.160> twist<00:01:54.490> my<00:01:54.760> hair<00:01:55.030> some

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270
