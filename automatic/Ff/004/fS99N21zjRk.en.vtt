 or play but in general it is life was not intended for the 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.449
 entertainment 

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:10.279
 rudel 

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:16.070
 I spent 14 hours a day in my bi vocabulary playing with 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.149
 the computer as young people to this day in 1985 aleksei pass the time 

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:24.759
 as an employee of the computer science team at the Russian Academy of 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:30.099
 but that was not what really interested me. 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.210
 bet on the same eleven all kinds of crime and in games amusements and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.290
 jigsaw puzzle he gave an idea that was of a purely 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.720
 mathematical 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.440
 to think of all the different ways of 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.270
 blocks and then fit them with the puzzle that was not 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.270
 two-dimensional but with moving parts falling 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.860
 I talked about imagining people falling 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.290
 you could rotate motionlessly to the other to choose where it goes 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.290
 playing this was the basic idea tute 3 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.520
 it was a way of thinking 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.219
 in real time unlike anything else because there is a part of the brain that 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.359
 it is usually not decisive in real time the other video clips why the 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:17.540
 wrong idea 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.970
 it was so cool 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.970
 the team needed a good look for sale 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.260
 around 1986 versions of the game for pc cross an iron curtain 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.650
 but in addition he had signed the contract yielding the rights of the game for 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.540
 three years 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.810
 taking advantage of the fact that in the afternoon the Soviet Union 20 yesterday 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.720
 4 million with the dry law edition 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.250
 and this happened with 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.250
 people did not have the right 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.439
 to produce a fragile 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.439
 everything is taken away 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.300
 I did not want to fight for 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.300
 or would rather see the game won 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.460
 Elias Beaches 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.030
 despite the pose of the world superpowers in the cold war 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.159
 the tetris was immediately welcomed in the homes of everyone 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:13.839
 world 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.370
 if you play enough playing as I played nothing stressed the features were 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.009
 guaranteed 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:26.829
 I have but I have no eye the landscape is show it can fit 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.609
 if you start to mount a large balcony of pps that does not belong to 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.790
 culture just think that's why it spread around the world 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.699
 It's not about resting, you have to have talent. 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:44.589
 It's a song that did not leave our capital 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.469
 on the one hand because what could jeopardize the activities of the industry 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.409
 of information 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.269
 But I managed to leave this moment. 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.609
 computation first ef so fun that no one can get three points 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.639
 Since returning to class 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.639
 sertÃ£ozinho sp 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.369
 in 1989 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:11.010
 few years later 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.010
 the soviet union 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:20.199
 the Cold War conflict that had released the video games was over 

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:26.869
 usc moved to the united states in 1991 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:32.699
 in 1996 the rights of the tetris returned to its creator now I live from 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:37.619
 speed from time to time invented a game with my friends 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:44.169
 after the rest of the time Diogo read books on the subject 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:47.169
 d 

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:52.649
 so 3 during the first games of the video game emerged in the midst of the Cold War 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:59.509
 the foundations of an industry to meet a basic need for 

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:01.119
 human being 

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:05.549
 one thing in these terms, victories descended and transcended borders 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.040
 national 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.549
 fortunately 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.759
 fundamental of the imagination 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:15.309
 all the human curiosity and the search for pleasure that is so fundamental to 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:17.889
 the nature of the human being 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.829
 this technology changes 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.180
 tragically but the human intellect remains the same 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.200
 so something that facilitated the 30 years will still arouse interest 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.400
 that the best games will survive forever 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.449
 with the end of the golden age of video games with a new cycle was about to be 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:37.529
 initiated 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:42.040
 Robinho positioned by a plumber godinho our industry is alive 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.040
 passed the front 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:49.749
 pepper's are Brazilian stand
