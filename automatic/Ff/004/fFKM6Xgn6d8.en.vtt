00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hi italian brothers i am a husband who 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.950
 in this video I will explain you which ones 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.809
 tools in daily use you can 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.540
 use as personal defense weapons 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.630
 in cases of extreme necessity 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.270
 now it is important to clarify that it is in 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.910
 italy that in canada where i live is 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.850
 extremely 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.760
 carry an object with the purpose 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.920
 to use it for functional defense though 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.330
 if you have a good reason to have not 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:35.350
 out an object and you happen to have it 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:38.290
 with you the moment you are in 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.120
 need to defend yourself is perfectly 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.820
 adequate to use that object for 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:49.040
 defend them for example I like to have 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:53.540
 always women a zippo lighter are that 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:56.059
 the food is notorious for staying short 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.750
 of fuel at any moment 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:02.059
 therefore to supply them zico is 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.059
 perfectly adequate the more you bring me 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.789
 below a bottle at auction or 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.130
 petrol they can use in type e 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:11.530
 if I'm in an extreme situation 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.030
 necessity would be perfectly 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:18.140
 appropriate to remind you of this 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.920
 bottle in the pocket quickly open it e 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.660
 check it out in baku's face which 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.330
 would inhibit extremely fast 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.840
 any 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.190
 will this individual continue 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.310
 his assault 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.250
 counterpoint the important thing is that there is not 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.950
 bring in the bottle high up around 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.490
 only for personal defense of the course 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.460
 because you are gentlemen 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.320
 I like having the many pocket agency 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.480
 people will immediately think of 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.940
 cortelli and I really like i 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.910
 knives or three I'm wearing right now 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.950
 it's generally just that personally 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.650
 I would never use a knife for 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.350
 defend me because of the presence in the 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.000
 icy and since you are gentlemen 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.000
 as we have already said it is perfectly 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.310
 adequate to carry me around for example a 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.810
 razor 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:17.200
 the brushes from a brush and 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.840
 spray deodorant or tel 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.000
 after shave if I ever went with the parma 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.019
 in the eyes always exactly of what 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.920
 what am i talking about 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.390
 and the spray deodorant also towards 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.940
 obviously these things would take me 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.540
 below to do the double thigh 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.180
 personal and not to defend sign if 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.280
 you happen to find a situation there 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.480
 necessity and having in these things a 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.430
 max range to see you remember that 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.159
 whenever however after more barbarians 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.370

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:54.530
 extremely illegal to own both in 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.989

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.560
 shopping

 and while I go to the grocery store 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.080
 find yourself in an extreme situation 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.850
 need to stop 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.770
 would be perfectly adequate 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.420
 remind you that to go for the 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.850
 expense you brought one of these 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.000
 giant carabiners and serve not 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.580
 offend the phalanges when they wear themselves 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.830
 than these of heavy expenditure e 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.840
 it would be perfectly adequate to use 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.840

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:45.200
 rain may be that you enjoy playing 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:48.709
 to golf and practice your long children 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.260
 with a wood number one in this case 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.750

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:00.170

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:13.239
 golf to defend you from someone who 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.239
 is assaulting you in your vehicle 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.419
 same thing applies if you are anglers 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.680

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.230

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.340
