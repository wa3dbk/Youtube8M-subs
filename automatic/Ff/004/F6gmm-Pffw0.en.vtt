 going to technologies is also bringing 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.289
 the satellite decoders we are going to 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.310
 present the model that we have brought 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:20.640

 this product is already updated 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:39.320
 I just had to put his antenna 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.780
 satellite and be able to modify and have

 it tells you many people is the model is 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.520
 the s 810 bill of the brand acet america

 comes a usb or can it be also hdmi 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.390
 an audio video output an input and 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.960
 rf output and an entry in this 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.910
 case the rg6 coaxial cables for the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.220
 satellite antenna is simple to 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.810
 configure it would only need a 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.220
 double that I bought them them for 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.520
 separated that is approximately between 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.060

 internet more than 200 up to 250 channels 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.820
 that satellites can receive 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.670
 you can search much more but they are in 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.780
 other languages ​​that would be of little use 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.600
 then we will remain involved in the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.760
 decoder has its power is 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.440
 completely new and with the guarantee of 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.850
