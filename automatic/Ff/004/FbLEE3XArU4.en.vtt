hardest<00:00:54.129> part<00:00:54.220> of<00:00:54.550> starting<00:00:55.270> this<00:00:55.360> whole

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
hardest part of starting this whole

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.570 
hardest part of starting this whole
project<00:00:55.809> was<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.470> beginning<00:00:56.860> obviously

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
project was the beginning obviously

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.830 
project was the beginning obviously
because<00:00:57.700> you<00:00:57.850> had<00:00:57.970> so<00:00:58.150> much<00:00:58.270> dirt<00:00:58.510> in<00:00:58.600> here<00:00:58.690> and

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
because you had so much dirt in here and

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.090 
because you had so much dirt in here and
so<00:00:58.960> much<00:00:59.110> of<00:00:59.260> a<00:00:59.320> mess<00:00:59.440> it<00:00:59.620> was<00:00:59.710> really<00:00:59.890> hard<00:01:00.040> to

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
so much of a mess it was really hard to

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.220 
so much of a mess it was really hard to
imagine<00:01:00.340> what<00:01:00.670> this<00:01:00.850> has<00:01:01.000> become<00:01:01.230> Paul

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230
