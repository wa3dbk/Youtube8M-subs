00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.519
 a printer is a peripheral of when 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.830
 connected to the computer has the function 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.660
 output device and printing texts 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.660
 graphs or any other result of 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.270
 an application of machine technology 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.420
 to write the printers suffered 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.270
 drastic changes over time to 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.719
 first printer appeared in 1938 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.370
 created by Chester cause and 1953 was 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.680
 the first high-end printer 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.530
 speed for this printer 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.390
 used in the universe to make the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.120
 representation of images by means of 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.879
 impact soon the picture was not very 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.890
 sharp 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.619
 only in the 1970s were the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.750
 first type printers one type 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.189
 impact printer whose head is 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.740
 composed of one or more lines 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.900
 needle when colliding with the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.330
 tape impregnated with ink similar to 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.170
 chemical paper venture point by 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.150
 needle 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.590
 the first inkjet printer 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.479
 emerged in 1964 intensive use began 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.610
 in the 80's 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.530
 inkjet printers use 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.570
 systems with a head of 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.329
 the print head with hundreds of 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.100
 buildings that pour thousands of 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.530
 ink droplets per second 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.299
 caused by a problem that determines 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.700
 how many drops and where should they be 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:46.950
 the droplets and the mixtures of 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.119
 in 1983 the company hp in partnership 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.490
 with which he did not create the first 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.610
 laser printers that are part of the 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.729
 non-impact category 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.320
 see how the laser printer works 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.979
 the printer processes the submitted image 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.219
 computer and a cylinder receives 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.229
 positive electric charge 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:09.209
 the laser discharges certain parts of the 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.160
 books forming an electrical image of the 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.240
 print 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.050
 the tournament comes into contact with cylinder 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.480
 passing paint in the discharged spaces 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.610
 the printer pulls paper which receives 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.880
 negative charges as soon as you enter 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.770
 the paper runs under the 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.820
 receiving the image that will be 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.940
 printed 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.280
 the image is formed by a little bit 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.420
 which will be fixed on the paper with the heat 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.820
 used in 1984 charles rowell made the 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.040
 first 3d printer that instead of 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.360
 paint on paper build objects layer 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.580
 camata 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.390
 but in recent years it has evolved 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.370
 and the revolution began to 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.010
 printers 3d says can print 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.460
 any object like shards weapons clothes 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.320
 bones prostheses human organs food and 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.390
 even houses 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.840
 as can be seen in this field of 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.180
 printers 3 10 the sky is the limit 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.330
 What can we expect for the next 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.240
 50 60 70 years 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.880
 to try to answer these questions 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.700
 we consult technology specialists 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.520
 of information and also non-specialists 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.130
 I think we will have 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.240
 printers because first and today 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.370
 generation and 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.980
 she is a generation accustomed to 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:35.410
 to use much more a digital hug 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.310
 the future I would like to have this 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.620
 the sheet itself 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:45.370
 have the same printer there 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.130
 that when touching the leaf left to the letters the 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.130
 drawing in the cities of joÃ£o pessoa 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.590
 I already imagine a geographical printer 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.060
 things like that is you work with 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.840
 That kind of thing, huh? 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.760
 it could be that even all 50 years 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.680
 It did not exist in fact the paper 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.660
 things are all really digital so 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.450
 printer leaves the time this utility 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.060
 that we met today 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.560
 nilton of the event the development 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.640
 is perfect 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.690
 the orange is the vote and pushed use of 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:24.780
 feel the controversy must have when neither 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:28.919
 15h or give link to oj in bold rafah 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.410
 to reach this boot also emerson 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.560
 in my opinion there will not be a printer 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:38.310
 You're going to have one like it. 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.910
 a tablet something glass is not 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.580
 when you needed some 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:49.290
 information that that your device 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:52.169
 The guide is to illustrate it as if it were a photo. 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.979
 of the document or the document is 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.650
 exist 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.650
 only it will not have to be anymore 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.650
 printed 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.900
 the guys
