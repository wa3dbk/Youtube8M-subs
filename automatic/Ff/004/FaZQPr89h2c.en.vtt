00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.700
 with buyster the mobile is used to pay 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.189
 register now on 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.900
 buyster point fr and bought on the internet 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.840
 in all serenity 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.279
 here is the techno channel here in london tim 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.689
 cook the announced a few minutes ago to 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.020
 hardly and well here we have it already in 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:29.660
 so here's on the techno channel the 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.680
 new iphone 5 look at it then the 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.660
 first thing they appear 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.370
 obviously the size of the screen we pass 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.110
 from 3 inches and a half to four and a half to 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.540
 four forgiveness and that's in length in 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.950
 this screen gets bigger which 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.770
 actually allows to have a rows 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.300
 additional icons and it allows by 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.460
 example also to have more surface 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.810
 on the web etc for the game for the 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.750
 movies too since you will be able 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.680
 watch movies in 16 9th like this 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.810
 what else too that change well 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.329
 obviously the look of this iphone that is 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.420
 much lighter than the previous 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.640
 finer also it is seen to the touch to 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.230
 touch who is really different from the 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.290
 previous iphone 4 and iphone 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.670
 4s already we feel the lightness the back 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.450
 also a little different he is a 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.770
 little bit softer to the touch very 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.510
 nice we also see that there are two 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.150
 kinds of textures one that is more 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:21.290
 brilliant up and down we'll say 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.090
 more rough in the center then the big 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.140
 novelty too that's it that's the 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.520
 connector that changes 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.350
 here we go a connector a lot 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.820
 smaller actually it's going to be the new 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.000
 connector probably from all 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.240
 ios products so the iphone inaugurates with 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.930
 ipods too what else and then 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.540
 obviously and to the 6 ie6 that brings 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.950
 also plan but in a new way 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.950
 since now it's no longer google 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.570
 but it's a real plan signed apple 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.700
 the 4g arrives but not in France 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.700
 obviously anyway this iphone 5 does not 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.860
 will not be 4g compatible but in any case 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.970
 3.75 and this allows us to make 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.680
 allow us to have crimes that 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.270
 will be very very high that's what we 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.659
 could say so regarding this iphone 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.939
 5 coming out on the 21st of September in 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.409
 France will have the opportunity tomorrow on 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.820
 the techno chain to talk about more 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.720
 long with a better video 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.150
 quality but there it was for you 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.120
 just show the first feelings of 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.920
 this phone so that happens in 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.050
 few days in France 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.490
 what we could say and we end up 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.830
 tomorrow for a more complete video with 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.830
 a deeper analysis tomorrow
