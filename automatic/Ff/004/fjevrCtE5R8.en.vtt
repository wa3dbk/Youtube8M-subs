the lighting you see in here is dynamic
and<00:04:07.510> that<00:04:08.049> is<00:04:08.169> really<00:04:08.530> really<00:04:08.620> cool<00:04:09.069> I<00:04:09.129> think

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
and that is really really cool I think

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.119 
and that is really really cool I think
and<00:04:09.669> it's<00:04:10.510> house<00:04:10.900> park<00:04:11.319> is<00:04:11.500> able<00:04:11.739> to<00:04:11.859> deliver

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
and it's house park is able to deliver

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:13.920 
and it's house park is able to deliver
these<00:04:12.370> are<00:04:12.639> complex<00:04:13.030> lighting<00:04:13.510> scenes<00:04:13.720> like

so<00:04:56.039> really<00:04:56.550> we<00:04:56.639> never<00:04:56.820> even<00:04:56.970> got<00:04:57.090> to<00:04:57.180> touch

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
so really we never even got to touch

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.050 
so really we never even got to touch
these<00:04:57.630> bases<00:04:58.080> there<00:04:58.259> and<00:04:58.440> they<00:04:59.070> full<00:04:59.789> health

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
these bases there and they full health

in<00:05:04.889> that<00:05:05.070> base<00:05:05.250> is<00:05:05.460> probably<00:05:05.729> two<00:05:06.000> infantry

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
in that base is probably two infantry

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.469

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.560 
our asses handed to us comprehensively
probably<00:05:23.310> due<00:05:23.400> to<00:05:23.430> my<00:05:23.580> commanding<00:05:24.060> but<00:05:24.449> also

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
probably due to my commanding but also

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:25.939 
probably due to my commanding but also
due<00:05:24.900> to<00:05:24.930> the<00:05:25.080> fact<00:05:25.169> that<00:05:25.289> I<00:05:25.380> think<00:05:25.590> rock<00:05:25.770> down

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949

note<00:05:37.530> about<00:05:37.560> this<00:05:37.800> dynamic<00:05:38.190> lighting<00:05:38.370> system

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
note about this dynamic lighting system

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.430 
note about this dynamic lighting system
is<00:05:38.849> the<00:05:39.000> frame<00:05:39.240> rate<00:05:39.449> just<00:05:39.630> does<00:05:39.930> not<00:05:40.169> drop

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
is the frame rate just does not drop

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.620 
is the frame rate just does not drop
when<00:05:40.979> lighting<00:05:41.699> these<00:05:41.910> scenes<00:05:42.240> like<00:05:42.449> this

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
when lighting these scenes like this

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.240 
when lighting these scenes like this
come<00:05:42.870> up<00:05:42.990> they<00:05:43.139> do<00:05:43.199> it<00:05:43.440> does<00:05:43.710> not<00:05:43.830> drop<00:05:44.010> it<00:05:44.159> all

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
come up they do it does not drop it all

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.890 
come up they do it does not drop it all
because<00:05:44.880> the<00:05:45.000> whole<00:05:45.120> place<00:05:45.300> is<00:05:45.479> dynamically

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
because the whole place is dynamically

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.629 
because the whole place is dynamically
bit<00:05:46.110> so<00:05:46.260> it<00:05:46.320> doesn't<00:05:46.500> really<00:05:46.560> matter<00:05:46.860> what

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
bit so it doesn't really matter what

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.310 
bit so it doesn't really matter what
what<00:05:48.180> you<00:05:48.270> do<00:05:48.389> to<00:05:48.510> change<00:05:48.690> the<00:05:48.900> lighting<00:05:49.080> there

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
what you do to change the lighting there

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.870 
what you do to change the lighting there
is<00:05:49.440> the<00:05:49.560> hive<00:05:49.740> that<00:05:49.979> is<00:05:50.099> if<00:05:50.250> that's<00:05:50.490> a<00:05:50.669> good
