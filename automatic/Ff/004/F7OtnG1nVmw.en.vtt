commentate over I'm probably just gonna

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.099 
commentate over I'm probably just gonna
do<00:00:29.160> some<00:00:29.369> cool<00:00:29.609> music<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.420> basically<00:00:30.840> we're

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
do some cool music the basically we're

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.049 
do some cool music the basically we're
gonna<00:00:31.170> spawn<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.619> five<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.070> each<00:00:32.399> mutant

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
gonna spawn a five of each mutant

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.910 
gonna spawn a five of each mutant
creature<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.719> then<00:00:34.170> we're<00:00:34.380> just<00:00:34.410> gonna<00:00:34.649> see

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
creature and then we're just gonna see

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.810 
creature and then we're just gonna see
what<00:00:35.070> happens<00:00:35.160> okay<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.770> I<00:00:37.770> guess<00:00:38.399> we<00:00:38.610> should

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
what happens okay so I guess we should

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.440 
what happens okay so I guess we should
get<00:00:38.969> going

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
get going

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.540 
get going
