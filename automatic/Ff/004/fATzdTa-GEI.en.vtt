00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.109 
the exterior design is a lot better than
last<00:01:46.140> year<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:47.070> has<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> sleeker<00:01:47.729> look<00:01:47.939> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
last year it has a sleeker look and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.730 
last year it has a sleeker look and
there's<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.329> smaller<00:01:48.630> footprint<00:01:49.200> although

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
there's a smaller footprint although

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.440 
there's a smaller footprint although
it's<00:01:49.890> still<00:01:49.979> much<00:01:50.430> larger<00:01:50.670> compared<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.329> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
it's still much larger compared to the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.770 
it's still much larger compared to the
Roku<00:01:51.899> 2<00:01:52.140> or<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.680> Apple<00:01:52.979> TV<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:54.180> upside<00:01:54.509> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
Roku 2 or the Apple TV on the upside the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.780 
Roku 2 or the Apple TV on the upside the
larger<00:01:55.140> size<00:01:55.350> allows<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.979> include<00:01:56.189> older

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
larger size allows it to include older

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.999 
larger size allows it to include older
analog<00:01:57.329> video<00:01:57.509> connections<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.920> will

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
analog video connections so it will

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.620 
analog video connections so it will
still<00:01:59.280> work<00:01:59.430> with<00:01:59.670> older<00:01:59.969> TVs

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
still work with older TVs
