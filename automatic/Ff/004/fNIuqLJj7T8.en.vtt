bench press set up lots of confusion

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.020 
bench press set up lots of confusion
with<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.740> bench<00:00:07.890> press<00:00:08.010> set<00:00:08.280> up<00:00:08.309> quite

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
with the bench press set up quite

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.430 
with the bench press set up quite
frankly<00:00:09.360> there's<00:00:09.570> many<00:00:09.780> ways<00:00:09.870> you<00:00:10.200> can<00:00:10.230> get

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
set up for the bench press I don't know

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.030 
set up for the bench press I don't know
if<00:00:12.509> one<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.750> better<00:00:13.170> than<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.469> other<00:00:13.590> what<00:00:13.980> I'm

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
if one is better than the other what I'm

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.110 
if one is better than the other what I'm
gonna<00:00:14.130> show<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.340> today<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.730> bench<00:00:14.969> press

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
gonna show you today is the bench press

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.180 
gonna show you today is the bench press
set<00:00:15.299> up<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.570> use<00:00:15.780> personally<00:00:16.049> taking<00:00:16.590> over<00:00:16.740> 900

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
set up I use personally taking over 900

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.310 
set up I use personally taking over 900
pounds<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:18.000> bench<00:00:18.180> press<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:19.109> it

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
pounds in the bench press and so it

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.080 
pounds in the bench press and so it
works<00:00:19.470> pretty<00:00:19.680> good<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:20.189> actually<00:00:20.580> learned<00:00:21.000> it

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
works pretty good I actually learned it

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.269 
works pretty good I actually learned it
from<00:00:21.240> another<00:00:21.720> world<00:00:21.960> record<00:00:22.109> holder<00:00:22.590> before

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
from another world record holder before

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.700 
from another world record holder before
and<00:00:23.820> many<00:00:24.240> people<00:00:24.600> use<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.170> bench<00:00:25.470> press

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
and many people use it and bench press

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.380 
and many people use it and bench press
you<00:00:25.740> know<00:00:25.920> big<00:00:26.160> weights<00:00:26.340> with<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:26.820> again

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
you know big weights with it so again

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.700 
you know big weights with it so again
what<00:00:27.570> I'm<00:00:27.660> talking<00:00:27.900> about<00:00:28.019> here<00:00:28.260> today<00:00:28.380> with

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
what I'm talking about here today with

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.919 
what I'm talking about here today with
the<00:00:28.800> setup<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.250> really<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.760> pressing<00:00:30.449> maximal

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
the setup is really for pressing maximal

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.630 
the setup is really for pressing maximal
weights<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.289> for<00:00:31.529> getting<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.399> most

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
weights it's for getting the most

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.970 
weights it's for getting the most
lifting<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> most<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.899> possibly<00:00:34.350> can<00:00:34.620> okay

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
lifting the most you possibly can okay

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.250 
lifting the most you possibly can okay
so<00:00:35.399> now<00:00:36.000> some<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.510> may<00:00:36.630> have<00:00:36.780> questions

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
so now some of you may have questions

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.569 
so now some of you may have questions
about<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.620> know<00:00:37.649> where<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.370> best

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
about you know where is this the best

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.549 
about you know where is this the best
position<00:00:39.090> for<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.780> know<00:00:39.899> safety<00:00:40.440> or

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
position for you know safety or

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.360 
position for you know safety or
something<00:00:40.860> like<00:00:40.950> that

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
something like that

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.799 
something like that
bear<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.790> mind<00:00:41.820> with<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.239> again<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.660> talked

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
bear in mind with this again we talked

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.569 
bear in mind with this again we talked
about<00:00:42.930> moving<00:00:43.230> maximum<00:00:43.890> poundage<00:00:44.219> --iz<00:00:44.399> and

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
about moving maximum poundage --iz and

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.540 
about moving maximum poundage --iz and
so<00:00:45.149> we're<00:00:45.690> as<00:00:45.840> safe<00:00:46.079> as<00:00:46.289> we<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.590> be<00:00:46.829> we're

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
so we're as safe as we can be we're

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.850 
so we're as safe as we can be we're
never<00:00:47.700> encouraging<00:00:48.329> injuries<00:00:48.690> but<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.770> know

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
never encouraging injuries but you know

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.619 
never encouraging injuries but you know
some<00:00:50.039> people<00:00:50.160> will<00:00:50.940> say<00:00:51.090> other<00:00:51.360> ways<00:00:51.600> are

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
some people will say other ways are

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.450 
some people will say other ways are
safer<00:00:52.110> no<00:00:52.440> problem<00:00:52.770> with<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:52.890> do<00:00:53.309> what

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
safer no problem with that do what

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.860 
safer no problem with that do what
you're<00:00:53.579> comfortable<00:00:53.610> with<00:00:54.120> but<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.539> wanted<00:00:54.809> to

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
you're comfortable with but I wanted to

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.869 
you're comfortable with but I wanted to
show<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.140> what<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.559> do<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.489> can<00:00:56.670> see

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
show you what I do so that you can see

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.819 
show you what I do so that you can see
exactly<00:00:57.059> kind<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.719> what<00:00:58.199> I've<00:00:58.350> done<00:00:58.379> and

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
exactly kind of what I've done and

exactly kind of what I've done and
hopefully<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.520> can<00:00:59.699> kind<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.000> take<00:01:00.180> from<00:01:00.390> it

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
hopefully you can kind of take from it

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.479 
hopefully you can kind of take from it
and<00:01:00.719> adapt<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.649> use<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.949> for<00:01:01.980> yourselves

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
and adapt it and use it for yourselves

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.070 
and adapt it and use it for yourselves
okay<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.359> first<00:01:03.600> thing<00:01:03.780> we're<00:01:03.899> going<00:01:03.989> to

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
okay so the first thing we're going to

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.020 
okay so the first thing we're going to
talk<00:01:04.199> about<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.769> your<00:01:05.070> feet<00:01:05.280> okay<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.790> really

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
talk about is your feet okay you really

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.179 
talk about is your feet okay you really
want<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.330> solid<00:01:06.659> base<00:01:07.020> when<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.350> bench<00:01:07.650> press<00:01:07.740> a

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
want a solid base when you bench press a

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.649 
want a solid base when you bench press a
lot<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.580> people<00:01:08.850> when<00:01:08.970> they<00:01:09.060> bench<00:01:09.240> press<00:01:09.510> they

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
lot of people when they bench press they

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.670 
lot of people when they bench press they
don't<00:01:09.810> have<00:01:09.900> their<00:01:10.049> feet<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.409> good<00:01:10.530> position

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
don't have their feet in a good position

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.920 
don't have their feet in a good position
and<00:01:11.220> quite<00:01:11.790> frankly<00:01:11.939> they<00:01:12.240> don't<00:01:12.360> aid<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
and quite frankly they don't aid in the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.570 
and quite frankly they don't aid in the
lift<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.500> if<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.040> do<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> bench<00:01:14.490> press

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
lift and so if you do the bench press

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.789 
lift and so if you do the bench press
correctly<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.810> almost<00:01:16.020> like<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.229> push<00:01:16.500> press

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
correctly it's almost like a push press

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.289 
correctly it's almost like a push press
if<00:01:17.280> you've<00:01:17.430> gone<00:01:17.610> overhead<00:01:18.030> where<00:01:18.180> you're

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
if you've gone overhead where you're

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.630 
if you've gone overhead where you're
using<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.020> legs<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.710> accelerate<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.400> off<00:01:20.490> your

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
using the legs to accelerate it off your

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.130 
using the legs to accelerate it off your
chest<00:01:20.700> all<00:01:21.090> right<00:01:21.180> but<00:01:21.420> be<00:01:21.509> able<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.689> do<00:01:21.930> that

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
chest all right but be able to do that

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.780 
chest all right but be able to do that

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
get set up correctly and you'll see that

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.620 
get set up correctly and you'll see that
position<00:02:45.100> coming<00:02:45.310> out<00:02:45.519> but<00:02:45.880> basically<00:02:46.300> the

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
position coming out but basically the

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.780 
position coming out but basically the
arches<00:02:47.019> of<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.170> upper<00:02:47.709> back<00:02:47.890> alright<00:02:48.190> so<00:02:48.250> what

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
arches of the upper back alright so what

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.490 
arches of the upper back alright so what
you<00:02:48.880> want<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.209> do<00:02:49.360> is<00:02:49.690> you<00:02:49.870> want<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.140> squeeze

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
you want to do is you want to squeeze

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.500 
you want to do is you want to squeeze
those<00:02:50.709> shoulder<00:02:51.069> blades<00:02:51.100> together<00:02:51.550> okay<00:02:52.239> and

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
those shoulder blades together okay and

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.240 
those shoulder blades together okay and
this<00:02:52.720> is<00:02:52.780> what<00:02:53.019> most<00:02:53.200> people<00:02:53.319> do<00:02:53.650> but<00:02:54.040> what

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
this is what most people do but what

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.070 
this is what most people do but what
they<00:02:54.280> miss<00:02:54.700> is<00:02:55.030> pulling<00:02:55.540> those<00:02:55.690> shoulders

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
they miss is pulling those shoulders

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.570 
they miss is pulling those shoulders
down<00:02:56.110> with<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.530> Lapps<00:02:56.709> shoulder<00:02:57.370> blades

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
down with the Lapps shoulder blades

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.090 
down with the Lapps shoulder blades
together<00:02:57.880> creating<00:02:58.690> a<00:02:58.750> nice<00:02:58.930> high<00:02:59.260> arch<00:02:59.560> which

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
together creating a nice high arch which

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.470 
together creating a nice high arch which
in<00:03:00.280> turn<00:03:00.430> gives<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.790> shorter<00:03:01.150> range<00:03:01.300> of

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
in turn gives you a shorter range of

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.150 
in turn gives you a shorter range of
motion<00:03:01.900> that<00:03:02.290> you<00:03:02.500> would<00:03:02.800> meaning<00:03:03.069> you

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
motion that you would meaning you

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.070 
motion that you would meaning you
compress<00:03:03.519> more<00:03:03.760> next<00:03:04.180> up<00:03:04.300> is<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.600> grip<00:03:04.780> and

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
compress more next up is the grip and

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.449 
compress more next up is the grip and
obviously<00:03:05.470> this<00:03:05.709> is<00:03:05.920> important<00:03:06.340> because

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
obviously this is important because

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.210 
obviously this is important because
where<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.239> barbell<00:03:07.630> is<00:03:07.660> in<00:03:07.900> our<00:03:08.019> hand<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:08.440> the

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
where the barbell is in our hand and the

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.620 
where the barbell is in our hand and the
first<00:03:09.790> thing<00:03:09.940> we<00:03:10.030> need<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.209> do<00:03:10.329> is<00:03:10.450> make<00:03:10.600> sure

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
first thing we need to do is make sure

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.360 
first thing we need to do is make sure
that<00:03:10.900> it's<00:03:11.049> sitting<00:03:11.230> low<00:03:11.620> in<00:03:11.799> the<00:03:11.920> hand<00:03:12.130> if<00:03:12.280> we

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
that it's sitting low in the hand if we

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.770 
that it's sitting low in the hand if we
have<00:03:12.549> it<00:03:12.670> too<00:03:12.820> high<00:03:13.030> what's<00:03:13.299> going<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.450> happen

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
have it too high what's going to happen

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.150 
have it too high what's going to happen
is<00:03:13.900> it's<00:03:14.200> going<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.350> be<00:03:14.470> in<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.620> fingertips

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
is it's going to be in the fingertips

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.100 
is it's going to be in the fingertips
and<00:03:15.549> that<00:03:15.700> leads<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.239> wrist<00:03:16.450> being<00:03:16.870> bent

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
and that leads to the wrist being bent

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.170 
and that leads to the wrist being bent
back<00:03:17.290> like<00:03:17.530> this<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:17.950> so<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.549> wrists<00:03:18.820> we<00:03:18.970> want

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
back like this and so the wrists we want

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.180 
back like this and so the wrists we want
the<00:03:19.329> wrist<00:03:19.540> straight<00:03:20.049> so<00:03:20.650> that<00:03:20.799> way<00:03:20.920> when<00:03:21.100> we

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
the wrist straight so that way when we

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.860 
the wrist straight so that way when we
drive<00:03:21.459> through<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.820> barbell<00:03:22.180> no<00:03:22.329> force<00:03:22.690> or

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
drive through the barbell no force or

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.990 
drive through the barbell no force or
power<00:03:23.140> is<00:03:23.440> lost<00:03:23.709> if<00:03:24.130> I<00:03:24.280> risk<00:03:24.519> this<00:03:24.640> like<00:03:24.820> this

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
power is lost if I risk this like this

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.819 
power is lost if I risk this like this
the<00:03:25.150> bar<00:03:25.329> is<00:03:25.480> sitting<00:03:25.840> in<00:03:25.989> the<00:03:26.350> fingertips

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
the bar is sitting in the fingertips

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.080 
the bar is sitting in the fingertips
when<00:03:27.010> we<00:03:27.100> drive<00:03:27.310> through<00:03:27.610> a<00:03:27.640> lot<00:03:27.820> of<00:03:27.850> power

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
when we drive through a lot of power

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.970 
when we drive through a lot of power
comes<00:03:28.450> out<00:03:28.600> the<00:03:28.780> wrist<00:03:28.989> doesn't<00:03:29.560> transfer

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
comes out the wrist doesn't transfer

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.500 
comes out the wrist doesn't transfer
through<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.310> bar<00:03:30.579> so<00:03:30.970> you<00:03:31.000> want<00:03:31.299> to<00:03:31.390> make

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510

needs<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:33.880> sit<00:03:34.120> lower<00:03:34.329> in<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.600> hands<00:03:34.959> all

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
needs to sit lower in the hands all

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.199 
needs to sit lower in the hands all
right<00:03:35.530> that<00:03:36.010> leads<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.579> forearm

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209

keep that forearm perpendicular to the
ground<00:03:51.940> that<00:03:52.480> way<00:03:52.660> when<00:03:52.840> you<00:03:52.930> drive<00:03:53.230> through

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
ground that way when you drive through

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.620 
ground that way when you drive through
the<00:03:53.829> elbows<00:03:54.370> under<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:54.700> bar<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.150> wrist<00:03:55.359> is<00:03:55.510> on

the elbows under the bar the wrist is on
the<00:03:55.720> bar<00:03:55.959> goes<00:03:56.170> straight<00:03:56.470> through<00:03:56.769> all<00:03:57.100> of

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
the bar goes straight through all of

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.740 
the bar goes straight through all of
that<00:03:57.430> power<00:03:57.670> is<00:03:57.910> transferred<00:03:58.180> in<00:03:58.510> you<00:03:58.570> lock

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
that power is transferred in you lock

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.660 
that power is transferred in you lock
out<00:03:58.959> obviously<00:03:59.950> if<00:04:00.130> we're<00:04:00.310> using<00:04:00.459> a

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
out obviously if we're using a

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.979 
out obviously if we're using a
benchpress<00:04:00.970> shirt<00:04:01.390> or<00:04:01.570> something<00:04:01.840> like<00:04:01.930> that

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
benchpress shirt or something like that

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.020 
benchpress shirt or something like that
our<00:04:02.440> grip<00:04:02.859> may<00:04:03.070> change<00:04:03.430> because<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.850> shirt

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
our grip may change because the shirt

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.750 
our grip may change because the shirt
allows<00:04:04.329> us<00:04:04.570> to<00:04:04.720> do<00:04:04.870> that<00:04:05.019> but<00:04:05.530> optimally<00:04:06.280> the

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
allows us to do that but optimally the

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.190 
allows us to do that but optimally the
forearm<00:04:07.239> is<00:04:07.299> going<00:04:07.450> to<00:04:07.540> be<00:04:07.600> perpendicular<00:04:07.900> to

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
forearm is going to be perpendicular to

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.509 
forearm is going to be perpendicular to
the<00:04:08.350> ground<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.829> wrist<00:04:09.040> is<00:04:09.220> going<00:04:09.340> to<00:04:09.400> be

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
the ground the wrist is going to be

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.290 
the ground the wrist is going to be
straight<00:04:09.910> barbell<00:04:10.660> sitting

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
straight barbell sitting

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.940 
straight barbell sitting
in<00:04:11.360> that<00:04:11.630> palm<00:04:11.930> and<00:04:12.200> we<00:04:12.260> punch<00:04:12.560> through<00:04:12.860> as

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
in that palm and we punch through as

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.740 
in that palm and we punch through as
high<00:04:13.100> as<00:04:13.250> we<00:04:13.340> can<00:04:13.640> once<00:04:14.120> we've<00:04:14.300> touched<00:04:14.510> our

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
high as we can once we've touched our

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.420 
high as we can once we've touched our
chest<00:04:15.050> so<00:04:15.530> that's<00:04:15.710> really<00:04:15.920> where<00:04:16.130> the<00:04:16.250> grip

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
chest so that's really where the grip

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.650 
chest so that's really where the grip
comes<00:04:16.700> into<00:04:16.940> play<00:04:17.120> all<00:04:17.270> right<00:04:17.330> so<00:04:17.540> the<00:04:17.630> last

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
comes into play all right so the last

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.540 
comes into play all right so the last
thing<00:04:18.020> is<00:04:18.170> the<00:04:18.290> head<00:04:18.470> and<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:19.130> reason<00:04:19.370> why<00:04:19.459> I

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:19.550 
thing is the head and the reason why I

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:20.650 
thing is the head and the reason why I
mention<00:04:19.670> this<00:04:19.910> is<00:04:20.060> I<00:04:20.150> see<00:04:20.300> a<00:04:20.330> lot<00:04:20.480> of<00:04:20.510> people

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
mention this is I see a lot of people

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.930 
mention this is I see a lot of people
raising<00:04:21.050> their<00:04:21.290> head<00:04:21.590> like<00:04:21.800> up<00:04:22.280> towards<00:04:22.820> their

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
raising their head like up towards their

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.610 
raising their head like up towards their
chest<00:04:23.240> when<00:04:23.660> watching<00:04:24.020> that<00:04:24.170> bar<00:04:24.350> as<00:04:24.500> they

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
chest when watching that bar as they

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.290 
chest when watching that bar as they
come<00:04:24.830> down<00:04:24.980> you<00:04:25.490> want<00:04:25.520> to<00:04:25.700> do<00:04:25.790> the<00:04:25.880> opposite<00:04:26.240> to

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
come down you want to do the opposite to

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.520 
come down you want to do the opposite to
that<00:04:26.480> what<00:04:26.630> you<00:04:26.690> want<00:04:26.870> to<00:04:26.930> do<00:04:27.020> is<00:04:27.110> drive<00:04:27.350> your

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
that what you want to do is drive your

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.660 
that what you want to do is drive your
head<00:04:27.680> into<00:04:27.950> that<00:04:28.100> benchpress

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
head into that benchpress

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.000 
head into that benchpress
and<00:04:28.850> so<00:04:29.330> you<00:04:29.390> keep<00:04:29.660> it<00:04:29.870> flat<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.530> whole<00:04:30.710> time

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
and so you keep it flat the whole time

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.860 
and so you keep it flat the whole time
okay<00:04:31.340> when<00:04:31.700> we<00:04:31.790> raise<00:04:32.000> it<00:04:32.210> up<00:04:32.300> what<00:04:32.510> we<00:04:32.600> do<00:04:32.750> is

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
okay when we raise it up what we do is

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.570 
okay when we raise it up what we do is
we<00:04:33.020> actually<00:04:33.110> lose<00:04:33.590> tightness<00:04:34.190> and<00:04:34.370> when<00:04:34.490> we

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
we actually lose tightness and when we

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.120 
we actually lose tightness and when we
reach<00:04:34.790> lightness<00:04:35.390> we<00:04:35.900> lose<00:04:36.080> power<00:04:36.350> okay<00:04:36.980> and

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
reach lightness we lose power okay and

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.010 
reach lightness we lose power okay and
so<00:04:37.520> you'll<00:04:37.670> see<00:04:37.700> professionals<00:04:38.660> doing<00:04:38.810> that

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
so you'll see professionals doing that

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.690 
so you'll see professionals doing that
you<00:04:39.140> see<00:04:39.290> guys<00:04:39.440> doing<00:04:39.830> that<00:04:39.980> and<00:04:40.310> a<00:04:40.370> lot<00:04:40.550> of

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
you see guys doing that and a lot of

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.340 
you see guys doing that and a lot of
times<00:04:40.910> that<00:04:41.030> is<00:04:41.090> -<00:04:41.330> because<00:04:41.810> they<00:04:41.930> are<00:04:42.080> so

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
times that is - because they are so

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.140 
times that is - because they are so
tight<00:04:42.620> in<00:04:42.800> the<00:04:42.890> thoracic<00:04:43.040> but<00:04:43.760> they<00:04:43.880> need<00:04:44.030> to

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
tight in the thoracic but they need to

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.540 
tight in the thoracic but they need to
give<00:04:44.300> themselves<00:04:44.510> extra<00:04:44.900> range<00:04:45.260> they<00:04:46.190> simply

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
give themselves extra range they simply

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.520 
give themselves extra range they simply
can't<00:04:46.760> touch<00:04:46.970> without<00:04:47.180> doing<00:04:47.570> it<00:04:47.690> the<00:04:48.200> goal<00:04:48.380> is

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
can't touch without doing it the goal is

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.780 
can't touch without doing it the goal is
to<00:04:48.560> be<00:04:48.680> able<00:04:48.740> to<00:04:48.830> keep<00:04:48.980> the<00:04:49.100> head<00:04:49.220> on<00:04:49.340> sit<00:04:49.550> onto

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
to be able to keep the head on sit onto

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.000 
to be able to keep the head on sit onto
the<00:04:50.030> bench<00:04:50.210> and<00:04:50.510> you<00:04:51.200> know<00:04:51.320> when<00:04:51.440> we<00:04:51.560> press<00:04:51.830> the

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
the bench and you know when we press the

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.290 
the bench and you know when we press the
barbell<00:04:52.190> what<00:04:52.520> we<00:04:52.610> do<00:04:52.700> is<00:04:52.820> you<00:04:52.910> drive<00:04:53.150> the

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
barbell what we do is you drive the

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.360 
barbell what we do is you drive the
entire<00:04:53.420> body<00:04:53.870> away<00:04:54.170> from<00:04:54.470> from<00:04:54.890> the<00:04:55.040> bar<00:04:55.220> as

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
entire body away from from the bar as

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.590 
entire body away from from the bar as
well<00:04:55.520> as<00:04:55.640> pressing<00:04:56.000> through<00:04:56.150> we<00:04:56.270> don't<00:04:56.420> go

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
well as pressing through we don't go

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.390 
well as pressing through we don't go
with<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:56.960> bar<00:04:57.140> so<00:04:57.530> that<00:04:57.680> head<00:04:57.860> on<00:04:57.890> that<00:04:58.040> bench

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
with the bar so that head on that bench

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.160 
with the bar so that head on that bench
is<00:04:58.730> going<00:04:58.940> to<00:04:59.000> give<00:04:59.120> us<00:04:59.150> that<00:04:59.360> firm<00:04:59.660> base<00:04:59.930> so

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
is going to give us that firm base so

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.140 
is going to give us that firm base so
when<00:05:00.290> we<00:05:00.410> drive<00:05:00.680> all<00:05:01.250> that<00:05:01.520> force<00:05:01.820> all<00:05:01.970> that

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
when we drive all that force all that

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.180 
when we drive all that force all that
power<00:05:02.420> goes<00:05:02.660> right<00:05:02.900> through<00:05:02.930> to<00:05:03.200> lock<00:05:03.380> out<00:05:03.590> so

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
power goes right through to lock out so

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.500 
power goes right through to lock out so
now<00:05:04.370> I'm<00:05:04.640> going<00:05:04.730> to<00:05:04.790> go<00:05:04.910> through<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:05.270> setup

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
now I'm going to go through the setup

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.170 
now I'm going to go through the setup
like<00:05:06.080> just<00:05:06.380> now<00:05:06.530> in<00:05:06.680> real<00:05:07.190> time<00:05:07.460> so<00:05:07.940> you<00:05:07.970> guys
