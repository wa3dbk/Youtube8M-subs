simple<00:00:50.670> song<00:00:51.469> it<00:00:52.469> most<00:00:52.679> difficult<00:00:53.039> part<00:00:53.249> I

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
simple song it most difficult part I

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.479 
simple song it most difficult part I
would<00:00:53.869> assume<00:00:54.869> would<00:00:55.079> be<00:00:55.139> down<00:00:55.949> tuning<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
would assume would be down tuning the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.469 
would assume would be down tuning the
guitar<00:00:56.519> because<00:00:56.909> you've<00:00:57.059> got<00:00:57.149> good<00:00:57.239> down

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:57.479 
guitar because you've got good down

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:03.420 
guitar because you've got good down
tuned<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.199> opens<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.279> the<00:00:59.519> sixth<00:00:59.850> string

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.830 

so<00:01:04.430> you<00:01:04.519> need<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.699> down<00:01:04.879> tune<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:05.420> six<00:01:05.659> string

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
so you need to down tune the six string

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.109 
so you need to down tune the six string
to<00:01:05.960> a<00:01:06.020> denote<00:01:06.440> and<00:01:07.010> so<00:01:07.190> it's<00:01:07.310> just<00:01:07.340> drop<00:01:07.670> D<00:01:07.880> on

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
to a denote and so it's just drop D on

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:16.090 
to a denote and so it's just drop D on
that<00:01:08.300> string<00:01:08.600> so<00:01:13.510> yeah<00:01:14.560> once<00:01:15.560> you've<00:01:15.770> got<00:01:15.920> that

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
that string so yeah once you've got that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.330 
that string so yeah once you've got that
and<00:01:16.430> basically<00:01:17.060> just<00:01:17.270> tuned<00:01:17.600> to<00:01:17.780> your<00:01:17.810> opens

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
and basically just tuned to your opens

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.800 
and basically just tuned to your opens
fourth<00:01:19.340> string<00:01:19.610> it's<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.300> same<00:01:20.570> note<00:01:20.780> but

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
fourth string it's the same note but

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.380 
fourth string it's the same note but

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.530 

or<00:01:24.870> just<00:01:25.290> use<00:01:25.470> your<00:01:25.650> guitar<00:01:26.160> tuner<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.850> you

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
can get mobile apps and stuff these days

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.460 
can get mobile apps and stuff these days
