00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
 Hello, ladies and gentlemen. 

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.995
 Welcome to another episode of "Be a Creation God" 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.880
 I am cold dragon 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.175
 If you missed the previous episode, you can click here to see 喔

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:10.395
 Then go to the topic now. 

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:14.960
 Have you ever wondered why there are desert temples and jungle temples on the map? 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.195
 Are they doing it? 

00:00:16.195 --> 00:00:17.689
 Who built these buildings? 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.774
 In order to find out the truth behind these temples 

00:00:20.774 --> 00:00:24.334
 I went to Wikipedia and looked for the definition of the temple. 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.880
 He said: The temple is a building used for faith or spiritual activity. 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.860
 For example: pray or sacrifice 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.534
 That means the Desert Temple and the Jungle Temple are about faith. 

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:40.063
 But everyone knows that there are many traps in the temple. 

00:00:40.063 --> 00:00:44.575
 Why is a temple to destroy visitors? 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.980
 In addition, the box in the temple 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.180
 Have the same problem as the previous episode 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.500
 Who put it in the temple? 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.535
 But there is another more interesting question here. 

00:00:54.535 --> 00:00:57.520
 There are many treasures in these boxes. 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.600
 For example: diamonds and emeralds 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.280
 The strangest thing is: bones and carrion? 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.234
 And they have the highest chance of appearing in the box. 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.040
 If I tell you, there is such a box with bones, carrion and many treasures. 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.980
 What do you think this box is? 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.040
 Does the word "coffin" appear in your mind? 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.820
 I only think of this. 

00:01:22.954 --> 00:01:27.034
 and many more! Remember Wikipedia's definition of the temple? 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.980
 The temple is a building used for faith or spiritual activity, such as prayer and sacrifice. 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.300
 sacrifice! I think you have guessed what I am thinking about? 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.734
 The theory is as follows, ladies and gentlemen 

00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:41.454
 The temple is a place for sacrifice 

00:01:41.454 --> 00:01:45.780
 A long time ago, a large group of people had some kind of faith. 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.300
 Believe that sacrifice can help them survive, for example, better harvest 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.674
 You have to know that this is "Be a Creation God" 

00:01:52.674 --> 00:01:54.775
 So far, everything is simple 

00:01:54.775 --> 00:01:56.380
 Let's improve the difficulty. 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.720
 What about the deep sea remains? 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.054
 Is it exactly the same? 

00:01:59.054 --> 00:02:04.100
 It is a pity that the deep sea remains are very different from the desert and the jungle temple. 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.215
 First, there are no boxes in the deep sea remains. 

00:02:07.215 --> 00:02:10.275
 Second, the deep sea remains are located in the deep sea. 

00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:14.195
 Also, deep sea remains are much larger than other shrines. 

00:02:14.195 --> 00:02:17.875
 Finally, the other shrines are not guarded. 

00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:22.094
 Because it’s too big 

00:02:22.094 --> 00:02:26.460
 So the same theory cannot explain the deep sea remains. 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.695
 Then let's take a look at the information on the deep sea remains. 

00:02:29.695 --> 00:02:33.440
 The most special things in the deep sea remains are those deep sea guards. 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.080
 I went looking for information and let me find something very interesting. 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.374
 Look at these dropped items, there is a weird here. 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.460
 fish? 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.000
 And various fish 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.300
 Because I can't find the chance of falling fish 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.600
 So I did an experiment in "Be a Creation God" 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.340
 The probability is about 35% 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.420
 The probability is at least the second highest 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.376
 Why do I say at least because I can't find sea phosphorus fragments? 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.540
 Sometimes it will fall off two pieces of sea phosphorus 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.854
 Based on the above results, I very much doubt that the deep sea guards were originally fish. 

00:03:08.854 --> 00:03:11.500
 Because of the power of deep sea remains 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.735
 The fish becomes a deep sea guard or an ancient deep sea guard 

00:03:14.735 --> 00:03:18.160
 In other words, the deep sea guards will only be born next to the deep sea remains. 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.375
 It is likely that the deep sea remains are not ordinary buildings. 

00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:24.460
 But it contains some mysterious power 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.335
 Ability to combine sea phosphorus and fish into deep sea guards 

00:03:28.335 --> 00:03:32.380
 This made me think of the beacon tower, but it was a bit off topic. 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.080
 Also mention the water in or near the deep sea remains. 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.234
 It is actually part of the deep sea remains. 

00:03:38.234 --> 00:03:41.540
 If you build a deep sea temple in a flat world 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.580
 Will become like this 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.840
 That means the temple is producing water! 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.660
 Finally, the second largest building in the whole game is located in the deep sea. 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.355
 It’s hard to imagine how people built it 

00:03:54.355 --> 00:03:58.380
 All the things I mentioned about the deep sea ruins seem to tell us 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.198
 This building is impossible to build by humans, based on difficulty and its power 

00:04:04.198 --> 00:04:10.880
 But of course, there are also many buildings in reality that even today’s technology can’t explain 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.280
 Or this mystery is handed over to you because most of you are smarter than me. 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.200
 How is it, this is just a theory 

00:04:18.273 --> 00:04:21.793
 Not a serious discussion or conspiracy theory 

00:04:21.793 --> 00:04:26.554
 Killing the ancient deep sea guard will drop the sponge does not mean it was originally a sponge baby 

00:04:26.563 --> 00:04:30.163
 The last thing is about the previous episode 

00:04:30.163 --> 00:04:33.434
 Click here to see 

00:04:33.434 --> 00:04:35.949
 You are really smart and creative. 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:41.415
 A viewer reminded me that there is a difference in the ratio of the main world to hell. 

00:04:41.415 --> 00:04:45.114
 A grid in hell is like eight squares in the main world. 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.640
 Another audience said 

00:04:47.934 --> 00:04:51.774
 This can be explained by parallel universe theory 

00:04:51.774 --> 00:04:54.600
 Above is the plane's main world, below is hell 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.660
 When the player launches the portal, the space of the two worlds will be distorted. 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.380
 Then connect to each other 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.583
 This theory can explain why there is a proportional difference and the principle of the portal 

00:05:05.583 --> 00:05:10.124
 Also, when lightning hits the pig, the pig turns into a zombie pig. 

00:05:10.124 --> 00:05:15.495
 The catastrophe I mentioned before is likely to be related to lightning. 

00:05:15.495 --> 00:05:20.080
 Ok, ladies and gentlemen, this episode is almost here. 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.260
