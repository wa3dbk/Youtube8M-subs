with a disc so I'll put a blank DVD in
there<00:04:25.190> it's<00:04:26.150> just<00:04:26.210> checking<00:04:27.050> to<00:04:27.200> make<00:04:27.320> sure

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
there it's just checking to make sure

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.840 
there it's just checking to make sure
that<00:04:27.920> it's<00:04:28.070> going<00:04:28.730> to<00:04:28.850> be<00:04:29.060> working<00:04:29.420> all<00:04:29.570> right

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
that it's going to be working all right

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:38.070 
that it's going to be working all right
it<00:04:31.850> just<00:04:32.480> whirls<00:04:32.720> around<00:04:32.930> of<00:04:33.200> it<00:04:33.290> for<00:04:33.530> a<00:04:33.560> while

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.060 

and<00:04:39.370> when<00:04:40.370> that's<00:04:40.700> all<00:04:40.850> finished<00:04:41.740> then<00:04:42.740> it'll

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
and when that's all finished then it'll

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.570 
and when that's all finished then it'll
stop<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.430> visual<00:04:44.270> green<00:04:44.540> increase<00:04:44.870> itself

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
stop the visual green increase itself

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.910 
stop the visual green increase itself
now<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:46.640> building<00:04:46.970> process<00:04:47.180> takes<00:04:47.720> a<00:04:48.050> lot

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
now the building process takes a lot

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.780 
now the building process takes a lot
