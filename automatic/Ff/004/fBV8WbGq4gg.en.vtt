four<00:01:19.409> quests<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:19.950> four<00:01:20.189> mini<00:01:20.369> games<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.820> if

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
four quests and four mini games and if

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.249 
four quests and four mini games and if
you<00:01:20.970> beat<00:01:21.090> all<00:01:21.299> four<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.540> each<00:01:21.720> you'll<00:01:22.020> start

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
you beat all four of each you'll start

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.960 
you beat all four of each you'll start
the<00:01:22.350> final<00:01:22.500> quest<00:01:22.830> which<00:01:23.520> if<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.700> be<00:01:23.820> that

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
the final quest which if you be that

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.310 
the final quest which if you be that
will<00:01:24.090> give<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.270> two<00:01:24.420> million<00:01:24.659> points<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.049> you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
will give you two million points and you

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.420 
will give you two million points and you
beat<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> game<00:01:25.710> essentially<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.310> can

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
beat the game essentially but you can

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.710 
beat the game essentially but you can
keep<00:01:26.549> playing<00:01:26.700> for<00:01:26.970> as<00:01:27.060> long<00:01:27.150> as<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.330> want<00:01:27.570> and

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
keep playing for as long as you want and

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.380 
keep playing for as long as you want and
give<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> premises<00:01:28.439> that's<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.040> point<00:01:29.390> and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
give the premises that's the point and

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.880 
give the premises that's the point and
by<00:01:30.509> minigames<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.049> do<00:01:31.110> actually<00:01:31.320> mean<00:01:31.650> gain

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
by minigames I do actually mean gain

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.010 
by minigames I do actually mean gain
like<00:01:32.159> video<00:01:32.460> games<00:01:32.520> where<00:01:33.060> it's<00:01:33.630> programmed

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
like video games where it's programmed

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.270 
like video games where it's programmed
so<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.409> grid<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.920> middle<00:01:35.130> would

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
so that that grid in the middle would

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.649 
so that that grid in the middle would
turn<00:01:35.460> into<00:01:35.579> essentially<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.180> video<00:01:36.509> game

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
turn into essentially a video game

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.340 
turn into essentially a video game
screen<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.140> you'll<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.320> able<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.500> play<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.740> game

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
screen and you'll be able to play a game

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.539

through the thermal Iser as many times I

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.400 
through the thermal Iser as many times I
can<00:03:10.120> also<00:03:10.329> if<00:03:10.480> I<00:03:10.540> hit<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.750> thermal<00:03:10.989> Iser<00:03:11.110> ten

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
can also if I hit the thermal Iser ten

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.840 
can also if I hit the thermal Iser ten
times<00:03:11.650> in<00:03:11.799> a<00:03:11.860> row<00:03:12.010> I'll<00:03:12.250> activate<00:03:12.610> the

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
questions about how to get the game

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.780 
questions about how to get the game
started<00:04:11.620> just<00:04:12.100> let<00:04:12.250> me<00:04:12.310> know<00:04:12.430> it's<00:04:12.579> a<00:04:12.609> little

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
started just let me know it's a little

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.920 
started just let me know it's a little
confusing<00:04:12.940> when<00:04:13.299> you<00:04:13.389> start<00:04:13.600> because<00:04:13.780> the

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
confusing when you start because the

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.590 
confusing when you start because the
program<00:04:15.200> doesn't<00:04:15.409> tell<00:04:15.650> you<00:04:15.829> what<00:04:16.239> he's<00:04:17.239> do

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
program doesn't tell you what he's do

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.300 
program doesn't tell you what he's do
what<00:04:17.840> or<00:04:17.989> anything<00:04:18.229> like<00:04:18.259> that<00:04:18.380> so<00:04:18.530> I<00:04:19.009> think

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
what or anything like that so I think

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.189 
what or anything like that so I think
initially<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:19.910> shift<00:04:20.329> keys<00:04:20.570> are<00:04:20.810> the<00:04:20.900> flipper

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
initially the shift keys are the flipper

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.260 
initially the shift keys are the flipper
keys<00:04:21.410> and<00:04:21.650> things<00:04:21.919> like<00:04:22.039> that<00:04:22.130> so<00:04:22.550> I'm<00:04:22.729> just
