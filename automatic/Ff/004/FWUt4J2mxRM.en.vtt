00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.350 
easily so this is a very simple process
for<00:02:18.550> me<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:20.110> just<00:02:20.560> put<00:02:20.710> a<00:02:20.740> little<00:02:21.250> bit<00:02:21.460> of<00:02:21.610> olive

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.120 
for me I just put a little bit of olive
oil<00:02:22.750> in<00:02:22.870> it<00:02:22.900> because<00:02:23.260> if<00:02:23.440> I<00:02:23.560> put<00:02:23.800> too<00:02:23.950> much<00:02:23.980> in

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
oil in it because if I put too much in

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.300 
oil in it because if I put too much in
it<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.880> definitely<00:02:25.090> weighs<00:02:25.570> my<00:02:25.870> hair<00:02:26.110> down<00:02:26.350> but

and<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.550> olive<00:02:30.730> oil<00:02:31.120> is<00:02:31.330> like<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.570> perfect

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260
