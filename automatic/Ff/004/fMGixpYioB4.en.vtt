some<00:00:13.230> misconceptions<00:00:13.440> people<00:00:14.040> have<00:00:14.309> about

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
some misconceptions people have about

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.300 
some misconceptions people have about
their<00:00:15.389> senses<00:00:15.960> in<00:00:16.260> case<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:16.980> didn't<00:00:17.160> catch<00:00:17.190> it

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
their senses in case you didn't catch it

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.450 
their senses in case you didn't catch it
this<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:21.410> the<00:00:22.410> first<00:00:22.680> sense<00:00:23.070> what<00:00:23.250> we<00:00:23.340> are

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
this is the first sense what we are

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.099 
this is the first sense what we are
going<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.699> talk<00:00:23.880> about<00:00:24.029> might<00:00:24.660> be<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> shocker

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
going to talk about might be a shocker

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.040 
going to talk about might be a shocker
there<00:00:25.949> are<00:00:26.070> all<00:00:26.220> these<00:00:26.430> senses<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.510> we<00:00:27.570> wish

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
there are all these senses that we wish

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.470 
there are all these senses that we wish
existed<00:00:28.800> or<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.070> some<00:00:29.220> people<00:00:29.490> think<00:00:29.789> exists

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
existed or that some people think exists

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.889 
existed or that some people think exists
but<00:00:31.380> they<00:00:31.470> don't<00:00:31.880> the<00:00:32.880> most<00:00:33.059> shocking<00:00:33.270> one<00:00:33.510> is

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
but they don't the most shocking one is

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.510 
but they don't the most shocking one is
the<00:00:34.559> sense<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.450> wetness<00:00:37.040> you<00:00:38.040> think<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.430> you

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
the sense of wetness you think that you

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.180 
the sense of wetness you think that you
can<00:00:38.700> sense<00:00:38.940> water<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.690> do<00:00:39.870> you're<00:00:40.590> wrong<00:00:40.800> you

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
can sense water you do you're wrong you

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.040 
can sense water you do you're wrong you
can't<00:00:41.460> actually<00:00:41.670> sense<00:00:42.149> how<00:00:42.329> wet<00:00:42.600> something

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
can't actually sense how wet something

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.100 
can't actually sense how wet something
is<00:00:43.200> we<00:00:43.710> can't<00:00:44.070> feel<00:00:44.370> wetness<00:00:44.940> we<00:00:45.539> do<00:00:45.719> not<00:00:45.840> have

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
is we can't feel wetness we do not have

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.170 
is we can't feel wetness we do not have
receptors<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:47.160> if<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.940> think<00:00:48.090> about

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
receptors for it if you think about

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.940 
receptors for it if you think about
being<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> shower<00:00:48.840> you're<00:00:49.200> feeling<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
being in the shower you're feeling the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.920 
being in the shower you're feeling the
pressure<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.879> water<00:00:51.059> hitting<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.600> you're

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
pressure of the water hitting you you're

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.959 
pressure of the water hitting you you're
feeling<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> temperature<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.910> water

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
feeling the temperature of that water

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.750 
feeling the temperature of that water
you're<00:00:54.570> feeling<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.550> experiencing<00:00:56.550> all<00:00:56.730> of

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
you're feeling and experiencing all of

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.130 
you're feeling and experiencing all of
these<00:00:57.030> things<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.570> know<00:00:57.899> you're<00:00:58.050> not

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
these things you know you're not

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.990 
these things you know you're not
experiencing<00:00:58.770> how<00:00:59.730> wet<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.629> water<00:01:00.899> is

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
experiencing how wet that water is

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.820 
experiencing how wet that water is
technically<00:01:03.000> hot<00:01:03.270> water<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.809> less<00:01:04.260> dense<00:01:04.589> than

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
technically hot water is less dense than

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.800 
technically hot water is less dense than
cold<00:01:04.890> water<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.580> should<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> different

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
cold water and should have a different

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.289 
cold water and should have a different
wetness<00:01:07.680> feeling<00:01:08.400> maybe<00:01:08.610> because<00:01:09.150> there's

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
wetness feeling maybe because there's

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.450 
wetness feeling maybe because there's
more<00:01:09.570> water<00:01:09.900> hitting<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.770> can't<00:01:10.979> tell

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
more water hitting you you can't tell

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.149 
more water hitting you you can't tell
we<00:01:12.060> have<00:01:12.240> no<00:01:12.420> wetness<00:01:12.750> receptors<00:01:13.320> when<00:01:14.070> you

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
we have no wetness receptors when you

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.730 
we have no wetness receptors when you
put<00:01:14.340> your<00:01:14.430> hand<00:01:14.790> into<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.659> pool

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
put your hand into a pool

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.920 
put your hand into a pool
you're<00:01:17.100> not<00:01:17.280> sensing<00:01:18.030> for<00:01:18.180> how<00:01:18.299> wet<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.750> pool

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
you're not sensing for how wet the pool

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.480 
you're not sensing for how wet the pool
is<00:01:19.170> you're<00:01:19.350> sensing<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> temperature<00:01:20.369> of

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
is you're sensing for the temperature of

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.600 
is you're sensing for the temperature of
the<00:01:20.610> water<00:01:21.290> you<00:01:22.290> could<00:01:22.409> towel<00:01:22.740> off<00:01:23.100> after<00:01:23.580> a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
the water you could towel off after a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.600 
the water you could towel off after a
shower<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.290> find<00:01:25.290> drops<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:26.009> water<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.460> your

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
shower and find drops of water on your

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.310 
shower and find drops of water on your
skin<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.119> not<00:01:27.150> know<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.659> difference<00:01:28.020> because

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
skin and not know the difference because

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.690 
skin and not know the difference because
they're<00:01:28.680> not<00:01:28.829> exhibiting<00:01:29.310> enough<00:01:29.520> pressure

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
they're not exhibiting enough pressure

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.460 
they're not exhibiting enough pressure
to<00:01:30.180> trigger<00:01:30.420> your<00:01:30.600> pressure<00:01:30.900> sensors<00:01:31.320> and

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
to trigger your pressure sensors and

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.780 
to trigger your pressure sensors and
they're<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.950> same<00:01:32.159> temperature<00:01:32.520> as<00:01:32.759> your

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
they're the same temperature as your

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.760 
they're the same temperature as your
body<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.840> don't<00:01:33.869> even<00:01:34.380> know<00:01:34.560> they're

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
body so you don't even know they're

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.789 
body so you don't even know they're
there<00:01:35.299> when<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.479> sweat<00:01:36.780> sometimes<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.560> can't

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
there when you sweat sometimes you can't

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.280 
there when you sweat sometimes you can't
tell<00:01:37.890> until<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.820> tickles<00:01:39.240> your<00:01:39.540> body<00:01:39.780> because

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
tell until it tickles your body because

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.789 
tell until it tickles your body because
it's<00:01:40.439> triggering<00:01:41.220> other<00:01:41.450> sensors<00:01:42.649> we<00:01:43.649> know

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
it's triggering other sensors we know

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.410 
it's triggering other sensors we know
wetness<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.280> there<00:01:44.430> because<00:01:44.579> we<00:01:44.700> combine<00:01:45.149> all

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
wetness is there because we combine all

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.359 
wetness is there because we combine all
of<00:01:45.450> these<00:01:45.659> different<00:01:45.720> senses<00:01:46.320> we<00:01:46.710> cannot<00:01:47.070> feel

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
of these different senses we cannot feel

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.410 
of these different senses we cannot feel
water<00:01:48.140> that's<00:01:49.140> still<00:01:49.350> messed<00:01:49.560> up<00:01:50.420> another

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
water that's still messed up another

have an extra sensory connection I mean
ESP<00:03:56.299> in<00:03:56.450> general<00:03:56.930> is<00:03:57.200> interesting<00:03:57.739> because

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
ESP in general is interesting because

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.979 
ESP in general is interesting because
people<00:03:58.430> think<00:03:58.610> and<00:03:58.760> exists<00:03:59.239> it<00:03:59.510> does<00:03:59.870> not

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
people think and exists it does not

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.220 
people think and exists it does not

yes<00:04:05.269> sometimes<00:04:05.840> you<00:04:06.049> know<00:04:06.260> who's<00:04:06.530> calling<00:04:07.010> you

you<00:04:10.100> back<00:04:10.310> that's<00:04:10.910> not<00:04:11.090> ESP<00:04:11.630> it's<00:04:12.079> a

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
you back that's not ESP it's a

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.710 
you back that's not ESP it's a
coincidence<00:04:12.410> if<00:04:12.920> you<00:04:13.610> hold<00:04:14.060> up<00:04:14.180> a<00:04:14.299> card<00:04:14.600> and

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
you guess that card over and over again

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.120 
you guess that card over and over again
if<00:04:17.359> I<00:04:17.479> hold<00:04:17.750> a<00:04:17.870> shape<00:04:18.109> on<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:18.470> back<00:04:18.590> of<00:04:18.799> a<00:04:18.890> card

and you sitting on the front of the card

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.560 
and you sitting on the front of the card
can<00:04:20.870> guess<00:04:21.109> it<00:04:21.849> over<00:04:22.849> and<00:04:23.090> over

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
can guess it over and over

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.830

maybe that's ESP maybe you're also just

maybe that's ESP maybe you're also just
go<00:04:27.169> watch<00:04:27.320> ghostbusters<00:04:27.980> you'll<00:04:28.190> figure<00:04:28.340> it

go watch ghostbusters you'll figure it

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
on these kind of extrasensory tests as

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.320 
on these kind of extrasensory tests as
twins<00:05:18.440> because<00:05:18.860> they<00:05:19.010> have<00:05:19.250> deep<00:05:19.729> emotional

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
twins because they have deep emotional

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.600 
twins because they have deep emotional
connections<00:05:20.919> there's<00:05:21.919> also<00:05:22.100> a<00:05:22.250> sense<00:05:22.490> of

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610

telepathy the movie the shadow classic

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.680 
telepathy the movie the shadow classic
also<00:05:26.930> radio<00:05:27.289> show<00:05:27.590> really<00:05:28.280> great<00:05:28.460> talks<00:05:29.389> about

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
also radio show really great talks about

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.140 
also radio show really great talks about
telepathy<00:05:30.080> and<00:05:30.440> telekinesis<00:05:31.220> it<00:05:31.729> comes

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
telepathy and telekinesis it comes

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.570 
telepathy and telekinesis it comes
actually<00:05:32.450> from<00:05:32.690> a<00:05:32.960> Victorian<00:05:33.590> period<00:05:33.860> where

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
actually from a Victorian period where

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.420 
actually from a Victorian period where
the<00:05:34.910> rise<00:05:35.120> of<00:05:35.419> science<00:05:35.770> in<00:05:36.770> the<00:05:36.950> public<00:05:37.310> eye

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
the rise of science in the public eye

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.640 
the rise of science in the public eye
also<00:05:38.240> brought<00:05:38.479> with<00:05:38.630> it<00:05:38.690> pseudoscience<00:05:39.530> and

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
also brought with it pseudoscience and

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.969 
also brought with it pseudoscience and
spirituality<00:05:40.460> you<00:05:40.580> know<00:05:40.700> mind<00:05:41.030> bullets<00:05:41.570> and

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
spirituality you know mind bullets and

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:44.890 
spirituality you know mind bullets and
picking<00:05:42.979> things<00:05:43.010> up<00:05:43.490> that's<00:05:43.910> telekinesis

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
picking things up that's telekinesis

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.400 
picking things up that's telekinesis
Kyle<00:05:45.610> anyway<00:05:46.639> it's<00:05:47.120> not<00:05:47.270> real<00:05:47.479> there<00:05:48.110> is<00:05:48.229> some

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
Kyle anyway it's not real there is some

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.900 
Kyle anyway it's not real there is some
anecdotal<00:05:48.860> evidence<00:05:49.039> for<00:05:49.460> it<00:05:49.550> similarly

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
anecdotal evidence for it similarly

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.089 
anecdotal evidence for it similarly
similarly<00:05:50.570> to<00:05:50.900> the<00:05:51.110> twin<00:05:51.349> connections<00:05:51.889> and

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:52.099 
similarly to the twin connections and

thing please we use 100% of our brains
we<00:06:18.800> have<00:06:18.889> more<00:06:19.039> than<00:06:19.130> five<00:06:19.280> senses<00:06:19.310> that's<00:06:19.880> two

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
we have more than five senses that's two

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.270 
we have more than five senses that's two
things<00:06:20.210> but<00:06:20.450> still<00:06:20.510> we<00:06:21.470> have<00:06:21.650> created<00:06:22.099> brain

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
things but still we have created brain

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.589 
things but still we have created brain
to<00:06:22.400> brain<00:06:22.490> computer<00:06:22.910> interfaces<00:06:23.300> though

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599 
to brain computer interfaces though

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:26.110 
to brain computer interfaces though
using<00:06:24.050> technology<00:06:24.830> you<00:06:25.310> can<00:06:25.460> actually<00:06:25.490> take

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
using technology you can actually take

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.350 
using technology you can actually take
thoughts<00:06:26.870> I'm<00:06:27.830> using<00:06:28.099> finger<00:06:28.490> quotes<00:06:28.610> for

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
thoughts I'm using finger quotes for

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.690 
thoughts I'm using finger quotes for
those<00:06:29.450> listening<00:06:30.220> that<00:06:31.220> is<00:06:31.370> a<00:06:31.400> whole<00:06:31.669> other

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:31.700 
those listening that is a whole other

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.490 
those listening that is a whole other
thing<00:06:31.940> though<00:06:32.360> can<00:06:32.750> take<00:06:32.930> those<00:06:33.080> thoughts<00:06:33.349> and

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
thing though can take those thoughts and

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.930 
thing though can take those thoughts and
we<00:06:33.560> can<00:06:33.710> transmit<00:06:34.099> them<00:06:34.280> over<00:06:34.520> the<00:06:34.610> internet

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
we can transmit them over the internet

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.940 
we can transmit them over the internet
and<00:06:35.120> put<00:06:35.690> them<00:06:35.840> on<00:06:36.020> to<00:06:36.200> someone<00:06:36.500> else's<00:06:36.770> brain

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:36.950 
and put them on to someone else's brain

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.570 
and put them on to someone else's brain
using<00:06:37.880> transcranial<00:06:38.360> magnetic<00:06:38.919> stimulation

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
using transcranial magnetic stimulation

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.730 
using transcranial magnetic stimulation
then<00:06:40.759> they<00:06:41.150> can<00:06:41.360> feel<00:06:41.720> something<00:06:42.500> that

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
then they can feel something that

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.290 
then they can feel something that
someone<00:06:42.979> else<00:06:43.069> is<00:06:43.280> feeling<00:06:43.460> far<00:06:44.030> far<00:06:44.210> away

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
someone else is feeling far far away

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.659 
someone else is feeling far far away
5,000<00:06:45.020> miles<00:06:45.169> away<00:06:45.349> in<00:06:45.620> the<00:06:45.949> case<00:06:46.340> of<00:06:46.520> one

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:46.669 
5,000 miles away in the case of one

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:48.460 
5,000 miles away in the case of one
study<00:06:46.909> that's<00:06:47.330> called<00:06:47.569> hyper<00:06:47.810> interaction

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:48.470 
study that's called hyper interaction

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.820 
study that's called hyper interaction
and<00:06:48.650> that's<00:06:49.039> actually<00:06:49.250> a<00:06:49.639> whole<00:06:49.969> other<00:06:50.270> thing

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
and that's actually a whole other thing

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.159 
and that's actually a whole other thing
because<00:06:51.830> using<00:06:52.699> technology<00:06:53.479> the<00:06:53.810> number<00:06:54.050> of

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:54.169 
because using technology the number of

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:59.499 
because using technology the number of
senses<00:06:54.560> we<00:06:54.889> have<00:06:55.719> could<00:06:56.719> be<00:06:56.750> unlimited<00:06:58.509> so

00:06:59.499 --> 00:06:59.509 
senses we have could be unlimited so

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:01.360 
senses we have could be unlimited so
those<00:06:59.689> are<00:06:59.840> the<00:07:00.139> senses<00:07:00.590> that<00:07:00.740> we<00:07:00.800> don't<00:07:01.099> have

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.370 
those are the senses that we don't have

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.839 
those are the senses that we don't have
maybe<00:07:01.969> you<00:07:02.150> wish<00:07:02.300> you<00:07:02.449> did<00:07:02.629> but<00:07:03.199> you<00:07:03.530> don't

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:03.849 
maybe you wish you did but you don't

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:06.040 
maybe you wish you did but you don't

tomorrow we're going to talk about the

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.070 
tomorrow we're going to talk about the
