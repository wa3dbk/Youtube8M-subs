00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.170
 but our waste 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.330
 and good morning everyone and everything 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.029
 sir promised today I'm going to you 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.220
 show how to watch episode 4 of 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.110
 star wars on your mac since the 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.060
 console so in fact it will not be 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.990
 really a movie it will be in form 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.750
 uncle acid at 6 and drawings via 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.539
 numbers symbols letters by 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.210
 computer so I do not know why 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.800
 apple has integrated this function always 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.769
 is it that it can be funny to my 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.549
 traced to his pals or what is it always 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:45.580
 Funny enough so to do this you 

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:48.129
 will have to go in terminal sa 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.600
 fight in terminale so here you are 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.409
 get there on it so what will it take 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.400
 do it's ap so I'll put you the 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:01:04.000
 the command to type but it is such net 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:04.809
 space towel points blink and light with 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.810
 one s at the end 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:14.859
 point nl then once you have 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:17.740
 typed you then validate at hockey I 

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:24.840
 I was wrong about a letter what is 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.840
 me early she light 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:40.990
 fucking kind still made a mistake 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:43.270
 it's not serious decideo here it is 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.909
 so we can see that we have the small 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.070
 animation so there is somehow 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.509
 the generic there is no way to the l2 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.509
 accelerated by cons a little pity 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.250
 so I'm going to say here that's it 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.250
 start 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.830
 I do not leave you full I 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:31.260
 will simply let or watch a 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.740
 little bit so that's a little summary 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.740
 of the movie 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.200
 after you will see the small animations 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.070
 at 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.440
 so it's not very very useful as 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.420
 function but hey it's always fun 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.640
 to have small hidden functions 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.050
 like that so that's so it was mathieu 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.760
 too much I find myself in a 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.940
 next video tell me if you have 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.710
 liked this little tip I do not know if 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.090
 she is known to many people but 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.770
 tell me if you liked 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.230
 do not forget to subscribe to my 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.460

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.180
 can be found in an upcoming video
