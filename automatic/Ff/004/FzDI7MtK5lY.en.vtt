exercises that I have for abdominals and
first<00:00:30.380> and<00:00:30.500> foremost<00:00:30.590> I<00:00:30.920> do<00:00:30.980> have<00:00:31.190> it<00:00:31.310> split<00:00:31.610> to

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
first and foremost I do have it split to

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.099 
first and foremost I do have it split to
three<00:00:31.880> different<00:00:32.029> sections<00:00:32.270> i<00:00:32.480> have<00:00:32.629> my<00:00:32.719> DVD

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:33.109 
three different sections i have my DVD

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:35.529 
three different sections i have my DVD
kind<00:00:34.100> of<00:00:34.160> men<00:00:34.399> you'd<00:00:34.579> so<00:00:34.820> you<00:00:34.879> have<00:00:35.059> upper<00:00:35.359> abs

00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:35.539 
kind of men you'd so you have upper abs

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:37.930 
kind of men you'd so you have upper abs
lower<00:00:36.260> abs<00:00:36.410> and<00:00:36.859> obliques<00:00:36.920> now<00:00:37.699> if<00:00:37.789> you've

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
lower abs and obliques now if you've

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.000 
lower abs and obliques now if you've
noticed<00:00:38.239> they're<00:00:38.629> all<00:00:38.749> in<00:00:38.870> quotations<00:00:39.409> so

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
noticed they're all in quotations so

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.439 
noticed they're all in quotations so
even<00:00:40.309> though<00:00:40.339> I<00:00:40.429> have<00:00:40.699> upper<00:00:41.059> abs<00:00:41.239> you<00:00:41.420> really

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
even though I have upper abs you really

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.149 
even though I have upper abs you really
can't<00:00:41.870> only<00:00:42.140> train<00:00:42.379> the<00:00:42.469> upper<00:00:42.679> abs<00:00:42.859> they<00:00:43.010> all

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:43.159 
can't only train the upper abs they all

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:44.919 
can't only train the upper abs they all
those<00:00:43.550> muscles<00:00:43.879> tend<00:00:44.059> to<00:00:44.149> contract<00:00:44.539> and<00:00:44.719> ten

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:44.929 
those muscles tend to contract and ten

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:46.479 
those muscles tend to contract and ten
they<00:00:45.109> can<00:00:45.260> trap<00:00:45.440> together<00:00:45.739> you<00:00:46.249> can<00:00:46.399> maybe

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
they can trap together you can maybe

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.009 
they can trap together you can maybe
have<00:00:46.670> a<00:00:46.699> little<00:00:46.850> bit<00:00:46.999> more<00:00:47.120> emphasis<00:00:47.600> on<00:00:47.780> a

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
have a little bit more emphasis on a

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:49.360 
have a little bit more emphasis on a
certain<00:00:48.350> area<00:00:48.559> you<00:00:48.649> can<00:00:48.769> emphasize<00:00:49.190> the

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
certain area you can emphasize the

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.709 
certain area you can emphasize the
oblique<00:00:49.670> so<00:00:49.850> you<00:00:49.909> can<00:00:50.059> emphasize<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:50.600> lower

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
oblique so you can emphasize the lower

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.259 
oblique so you can emphasize the lower
abs<00:00:50.989> you<00:00:51.589> can't<00:00:51.859> work<00:00:52.069> them<00:00:52.219> in<00:00:52.309> isolation<00:00:52.460> so

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
abs you can't work them in isolation so

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:55.360 
abs you can't work them in isolation so
you<00:00:54.079> can't<00:00:54.289> target<00:00:54.530> and<00:00:54.800> also<00:00:54.979> another<00:00:55.129> you

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
you can't target and also another you

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.489 
you can't target and also another you
can't<00:00:55.640> target<00:00:55.879> body<00:00:56.239> fat<00:00:56.569> reduction<00:00:57.229> you

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:57.499 
can't target body fat reduction you

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:59.979 
can't target body fat reduction you
can't<00:00:57.710> spot<00:00:58.010> reduce<00:00:58.129> fat<00:00:58.519> lower<00:00:59.479> abs<00:00:59.809> are

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
can't spot reduce fat lower abs are

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.660 
can't spot reduce fat lower abs are
tough<00:01:00.170> to<00:01:00.350> see<00:01:00.589> for<00:01:00.769> a<00:01:00.829> lot<00:01:00.979> of<00:01:01.010> people<00:01:01.129> because

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
tough to see for a lot of people because

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.129 
tough to see for a lot of people because
that's<00:01:02.059> just<00:01:02.210> really<00:01:02.539> the<00:01:02.719> last<00:01:02.899> place<00:01:03.109> he

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:03.139 
that's just really the last place he

lose body fat so there's no point in

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.639 
lose body fat so there's no point in
doing<00:01:05.570> a<00:01:05.719> thousand<00:01:06.110> repetitions<00:01:06.200> for

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
doing a thousand repetitions for

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.020 
doing a thousand repetitions for
abdominal<00:01:07.009> is<00:01:07.280> just<00:01:07.430> trying<00:01:07.579> to<00:01:07.670> burn<00:01:07.820> body

fat<00:01:08.149> off<00:01:08.810> that<00:01:09.020> area<00:01:10.030> actually<00:01:11.030> I've<00:01:11.240> said

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
fat off that area actually I've said

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.850 
fat off that area actually I've said
this<00:01:11.450> time<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:11.689> time<00:01:11.840> again<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.259> big<00:01:12.500> muscle

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
this time and time again the big muscle

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.590 
this time and time again the big muscle
groups<00:01:13.040> are<00:01:13.189> what<00:01:13.820> a<00:01:13.850> responsible<00:01:14.450> for

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
groups are what a responsible for

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.880 
groups are what a responsible for
burning<00:01:14.780> body<00:01:15.020> fat<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:15.380> exercises<00:01:15.799> like

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
burning body fat so exercises like

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.709 
burning body fat so exercises like
squats<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.460> leg<00:01:16.610> extensions<00:01:17.149> and<00:01:17.270> leg<00:01:17.390> curls

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.719 
and pull downs and rose and chest press
all<00:01:20.630> those<00:01:21.140> exercises<00:01:21.409> are<00:01:21.740> actually<00:01:22.100> better

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
all those exercises are actually better

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.580 
all those exercises are actually better
exercises<00:01:23.479> for<00:01:23.689> burning<00:01:23.960> body<00:01:24.140> fat<00:01:24.229> off<00:01:24.469> the

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
exercises for burning body fat off the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.529 
exercises for burning body fat off the
abdominal<00:01:25.039> area<00:01:25.159> so<00:01:25.820> you<00:01:25.880> can't<00:01:26.119> spot<00:01:26.420> reduce

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
abdominal area so you can't spot reduce

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.660 
abdominal area so you can't spot reduce
body<00:01:26.869> fat<00:01:26.990> but<00:01:27.380> you<00:01:27.500> do<00:01:27.710> want<00:01:27.890> to<00:01:27.979> use<00:01:28.009> abs<00:01:28.460> you

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
want to use them to develop stability

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.039 
want to use them to develop stability
for<00:01:30.829> your<00:01:30.950> core<00:01:31.600> another<00:01:32.600> issue<00:01:32.750> right<00:01:32.990> there

a lot of people tend to only focus on

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:36.580 
a lot of people tend to only focus on
core<00:01:35.450> training<00:01:35.689> they<00:01:35.840> tend<00:01:36.079> to<00:01:36.109> do<00:01:36.229> it<00:01:36.350> first

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
core training they tend to do it first

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.010 
core training they tend to do it first
in<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.799> routine<00:01:37.130> but<00:01:38.119> abdominals<00:01:38.479> are<00:01:38.810> used

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
in the routine but abdominals are used

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.779 
in the routine but abdominals are used
for<00:01:39.560> almost<00:01:39.770> every<00:01:40.009> other<00:01:40.070> exercises<00:01:40.640> are

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
for almost every other exercises are

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.399 
for almost every other exercises are
used<00:01:41.000> for<00:01:41.210> stability<00:01:41.420> already<00:01:41.990> when<00:01:42.289> you're

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
used for stability already when you're

used for stability already when you're
doing<00:01:42.680> a<00:01:42.799> lateral<00:01:43.340> raise<00:01:43.520> out<00:01:43.729> to<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:43.939> side

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
doing a lateral raise out to the side

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.760 
doing a lateral raise out to the side
with<00:01:44.270> dumbbells<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:45.049> can't<00:01:45.289> help<00:01:45.500> but<00:01:45.619> use

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
with dumbbells you can't help but use

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.679 
with dumbbells you can't help but use
the<00:01:45.890> abdominals<00:01:45.979> so<00:01:46.549> people<00:01:47.060> spend<00:01:47.390> so<00:01:47.450> much

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
the abdominals so people spend so much

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.300 
the abdominals so people spend so much
time<00:01:47.750> on<00:01:48.079> the<00:01:48.320> abdominals<00:01:48.590> you<00:01:48.890> really<00:01:49.070> don't

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
time on the abdominals you really don't

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.649 
time on the abdominals you really don't
need<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:49.549> put<00:01:49.789> that<00:01:49.939> much<00:01:50.090> into<00:01:50.390> them<00:01:50.509> you<00:01:50.539> can

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
need to put that much into them you can

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.060 
need to put that much into them you can
use<00:01:50.960> them<00:01:51.079> at<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.229> end<00:01:51.350> of<00:01:51.469> a<00:01:51.560> routine<00:01:51.890> they're

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
use them at the end of a routine they're

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.800 
use them at the end of a routine they're
already<00:01:52.219> warmed<00:01:52.609> up<00:01:52.729> they're<00:01:53.659> already

already warmed up they're already

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.270 
already warmed up they're already
fatigued<00:01:54.229> you<00:01:54.469> can<00:01:54.590> just<00:01:54.740> finish<00:01:54.920> them<00:01:55.159> off

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
important point you don't want to work

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.179 
important point you don't want to work
abdominals<00:02:02.780> first<00:02:03.409> in<00:02:03.560> your<00:02:03.619> routine<00:02:03.950> you

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
abdominals first in your routine you

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:05.739 
abdominals first in your routine you
don't<00:02:04.460> a<00:02:04.640> lot<00:02:04.880> of<00:02:04.969> people<00:02:05.090> want<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:05.329> emphasize

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:05.749 
don't a lot of people want to emphasize

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:07.149 
don't a lot of people want to emphasize
their<00:02:05.899> abdominals<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:06.560> they<00:02:06.649> do<00:02:06.710> it<00:02:06.890> first

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
their abdominals so they do it first

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.559 
their abdominals so they do it first
I'll<00:02:07.340> do<00:02:07.460> like<00:02:07.490> medicine<00:02:07.969> ball<00:02:08.119> or<00:02:08.270> physio

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
I'll do like medicine ball or physio

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:09.880 
I'll do like medicine ball or physio
ball<00:02:08.720> crunches<00:02:09.170> with<00:02:09.319> medicine<00:02:09.709> balls

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
ball crunches with medicine balls

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.040 
ball crunches with medicine balls
they'll<00:02:10.700> do<00:02:10.879> a<00:02:10.909> machines<00:02:11.540> I'll<00:02:11.780> do<00:02:11.870> things

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
they'll do a machines I'll do things

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.300 
they'll do a machines I'll do things
that<00:02:12.200> really<00:02:12.319> focus<00:02:12.709> on<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:12.950> AB

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
that really focus on the AB

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.160 
that really focus on the AB
the<00:02:13.940> problem<00:02:14.239> is<00:02:14.300> if<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.540> fatigue<00:02:14.840> your<00:02:14.989> abs

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
the problem is if you fatigue your abs

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.110 
the problem is if you fatigue your abs
first<00:02:15.530> before<00:02:15.860> doing<00:02:15.890> other<00:02:16.220> exercises<00:02:16.700> and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
first before doing other exercises and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.490 
first before doing other exercises and
probably<00:02:17.390> going<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.599> strain<00:02:17.780> something<00:02:17.810> since

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
probably going to strain something since

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.250 
probably going to strain something since
since<00:02:18.920> abs<00:02:19.160> do<00:02:19.540> provide<00:02:20.540> some<00:02:20.750> stability<00:02:20.930> to

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
since abs do provide some stability to

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.229 
since abs do provide some stability to
the<00:02:21.470> spine<00:02:21.770> to<00:02:22.130> that<00:02:22.370> whole<00:02:22.580> quarter<00:02:22.910> section

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
the spine to that whole quarter section

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.120 
the spine to that whole quarter section
if<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.480> train<00:02:23.810> abs<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.349> fatigue<00:02:24.680> if<00:02:24.860> you<00:02:24.950> train

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
if you train abs to fatigue if you train

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.309 
if you train abs to fatigue if you train
them<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.280> failure<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:25.880> then<00:02:26.420> you<00:02:26.510> go<00:02:26.599> to<00:02:26.750> say<00:02:27.290> a

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
them to failure and then you go to say a

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.320 
them to failure and then you go to say a
set<00:02:27.560> of<00:02:27.650> squats<00:02:27.920> your<00:02:28.370> abs<00:02:28.550> are<00:02:28.700> fatigued<00:02:29.030> so

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
set of squats your abs are fatigued so

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.790 
set of squats your abs are fatigued so
your<00:02:29.480> lower<00:02:29.660> back<00:02:29.930> seemed<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.230> take<00:02:30.470> more<00:02:30.709> of

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
your lower back seemed to take more of

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.440 
your lower back seemed to take more of
the<00:02:30.860> brunt<00:02:31.099> of<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.280> workload<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.269> might

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
the brunt of the workload and you might

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.180 
the brunt of the workload and you might
be<00:02:32.690> more<00:02:32.840> likely<00:02:33.080> to<00:02:33.230> strain<00:02:33.560> your<00:02:33.680> back<00:02:33.860> so

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
be more likely to strain your back so

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.890 
be more likely to strain your back so
usually<00:02:34.849> it's<00:02:34.970> best<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.239> save<00:02:35.510> your<00:02:35.660> core

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
usually it's best to save your core

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.240 
usually it's best to save your core
training<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.349> the<00:02:36.440> end<00:02:36.590> of<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.769> end<00:02:37.040> of<00:02:37.160> the

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
training to the end of the end of the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.920 
training to the end of the end of the
workout<00:02:37.700> program<00:02:38.230> also<00:02:39.400> abdominal<00:02:40.400> exercise

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
workout program also abdominal exercise

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.960 
workout program also abdominal exercise
should<00:02:41.930> only<00:02:42.140> involve<00:02:42.560> trunk<00:02:43.250> flexion<00:02:43.580> it

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
should only involve trunk flexion it

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.670 
should only involve trunk flexion it
should<00:02:44.120> bring<00:02:44.300> your<00:02:44.330> sternum<00:02:45.050> your<00:02:45.290> upper

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
should bring your sternum your upper

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.650 
should bring your sternum your upper
body<00:02:45.799> down<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:46.670> your<00:02:46.790> pelvis<00:02:47.180> so<00:02:47.330> basically

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
body down to your pelvis so basically

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.940 
body down to your pelvis so basically
you<00:02:47.720> can<00:02:47.840> think<00:02:47.989> of<00:02:48.049> your<00:02:48.170> pelvic<00:02:48.470> bone<00:02:48.650> and

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
you can think of your pelvic bone and

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.680 
you can think of your pelvic bone and
yours<00:02:49.069> Eiffel<00:02:49.430> we<00:02:49.489> process<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.090> little<00:02:50.540> notch

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
yours Eiffel we process the little notch

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.390 
yours Eiffel we process the little notch
at<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.080> bottom<00:02:51.260> of<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.380> sternum<00:02:51.560> bringing

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
at the bottom of the sternum bringing

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.520 
at the bottom of the sternum bringing
those<00:02:52.519> two<00:02:52.790> bones<00:02:53.030> together<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:54.110> abdominal

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
those two bones together the abdominal

those two bones together the abdominal
scan<00:02:54.650> they<00:02:55.130> basically<00:02:55.370> attached<00:02:55.730> at<00:02:55.910> the

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
scan they basically attached at the

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.520 
scan they basically attached at the
upper<00:02:56.269> part<00:02:56.630> of<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.720> body<00:02:56.840> attached<00:02:57.350> to<00:02:57.440> the

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
upper part of the body attached to the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.250 
upper part of the body attached to the
sternum<00:02:57.799> that's<00:02:58.069> in<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.370> top<00:02:58.610> ribs<00:02:58.940> and<00:02:59.269> then

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
sternum that's in the top ribs and then

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.640 
sternum that's in the top ribs and then
they<00:03:00.470> insert<00:03:01.220> down<00:03:01.430> in<00:03:01.849> the<00:03:02.510> pelvic<00:03:02.840> region<00:03:03.349> so

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
they insert down in the pelvic region so

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.680 
they insert down in the pelvic region so
either<00:03:04.040> pelvis<00:03:04.519> bone<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.940> iliac<00:03:05.239> crest<00:03:05.540> and

either pelvis bone the iliac crest and

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.210 
either pelvis bone the iliac crest and
kind<00:03:05.840> of<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.989> hip<00:03:06.140> bone<00:03:06.349> and<00:03:06.590> it's<00:03:07.010> bringing

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
kind of the hip bone and it's bringing

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.949 
kind of the hip bone and it's bringing
that<00:03:07.400> together<00:03:07.610> so<00:03:08.000> any<00:03:08.180> exercise<00:03:08.690> we're

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
that together so any exercise we're

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.910 
that together so any exercise we're
actually<00:03:09.110> bending<00:03:09.650> at<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:10.280> hips<00:03:10.430> hip<00:03:11.390> flexion

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
actually bending at the hips hip flexion

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.470 
actually bending at the hips hip flexion
versus<00:03:12.920> trunk<00:03:13.370> flexion<00:03:13.640> where<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.030> axis<00:03:14.390> of

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
versus trunk flexion where the axis of

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.059 
versus trunk flexion where the axis of
rotation<00:03:14.599> is<00:03:15.049> is<00:03:15.290> just<00:03:15.560> around<00:03:15.769> the<00:03:15.860> belly

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
rotation is is just around the belly

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.289 
rotation is is just around the belly
button<00:03:16.220> or<00:03:16.430> north<00:03:16.610> to<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.819> belly<00:03:16.970> button

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
button or north to the belly button

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.390 
button or north to the belly button
that's<00:03:17.959> using<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.440> abdominals<00:03:18.560> but<00:03:19.310> if

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
that's using the abdominals but if

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.099 
that's using the abdominals but if
you've<00:03:19.519> been<00:03:19.670> at<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:19.910> hips<00:03:20.209> as<00:03:20.480> in<00:03:20.660> like<00:03:20.810> sit

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
you've been at the hips as in like sit

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.690 
you've been at the hips as in like sit
up<00:03:21.230> so<00:03:21.350> you're<00:03:21.470> doing<00:03:21.620> a<00:03:21.680> set<00:03:21.890> of<00:03:21.980> exercise<00:03:22.400> and

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
up so you're doing a set of exercise and

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.190 
up so you're doing a set of exercise and
you're<00:03:23.269> bending<00:03:23.510> forward<00:03:23.780> at<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:23.989> hip<00:03:24.170> joint

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
you're bending forward at the hip joint

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.660 
you're bending forward at the hip joint
that's<00:03:24.829> really<00:03:25.100> not<00:03:25.190> working<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.549> abdominals

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
that's really not working the abdominals

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.849 
that's really not working the abdominals
anymore<00:03:26.329> if<00:03:26.630> anything<00:03:26.989> it's<00:03:27.230> working<00:03:27.560> it<00:03:27.680> as

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
anymore if anything it's working it as

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.280 
anymore if anything it's working it as
an<00:03:28.609> isolation<00:03:29.209> move<00:03:29.359> so<00:03:29.569> if<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:29.780> do<00:03:29.870> full<00:03:30.079> set

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
an isolation move so if you do full set

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.509 
an isolation move so if you do full set
ups<00:03:30.410> a<00:03:30.470> lot<00:03:30.500> of<00:03:30.650> people<00:03:30.829> do<00:03:30.920> setups<00:03:31.220> for<00:03:31.280> abs

kind of abdominal contraction whatsoever
is<00:04:12.440> to<00:04:12.650> counteract<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.310> tilt<00:04:13.549> your<00:04:14.090> you're

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
is to counteract the tilt your you're

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.330 
is to counteract the tilt your you're
basically<00:04:15.170> putting<00:04:15.650> a<00:04:15.799> lot<00:04:15.920> of<00:04:15.950> stress<00:04:16.160> on<00:04:16.250> the

you want to do all three different

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.330 
you want to do all three different
aspects<00:04:56.199> of<00:04:56.289> your<00:04:56.440> abdominals<00:04:56.680> in<00:04:57.039> one<00:04:57.190> day

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
aspects of your abdominals in one day

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.399 
aspects of your abdominals in one day
that's<00:04:57.520> great<00:04:57.909> go<00:04:58.150> ahead<00:04:58.330> and<00:04:58.449> do<00:04:58.599> upper<00:04:59.229> lower

00:04:59.399 --> 00:04:59.409 
that's great go ahead and do upper lower

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:02.129 
that's great go ahead and do upper lower
and<00:04:59.530> obliques<00:04:59.889> do<00:05:00.069> all<00:05:00.190> three<00:05:00.370> at<00:05:00.460> one<00:05:00.729> time<00:05:01.139> so

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
and obliques do all three at one time so

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:03.330 
and obliques do all three at one time so
say<00:05:02.289> if<00:05:02.380> you<00:05:02.409> don't<00:05:02.590> the<00:05:02.710> umph<00:05:02.889> to<00:05:02.949> do<00:05:03.130> abs

so<00:05:37.960> let's<00:05:38.349> move<00:05:38.440> on<00:05:38.590> to<00:05:38.620> three<00:05:38.889> different

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
so let's move on to three different

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:40.529 
so let's move on to three different
exercises<00:05:39.520> you<00:05:39.759> only<00:05:39.880> have<00:05:40.030> to<00:05:40.120> listen<00:05:40.389> this

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539 
exercises you only have to listen this

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.379 
exercises you only have to listen this
part<00:05:40.780> once<00:05:41.020> we're<00:05:41.949> gonna<00:05:42.039> go<00:05:42.159> on<00:05:42.190> to<00:05:42.340> push<00:05:42.610> the

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
part once we're gonna go on to push the

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:45.209 
part once we're gonna go on to push the
push<00:05:43.569> muscle<00:05:43.930> is<00:05:44.020> the<00:05:44.050> upper<00:05:44.380> abs<00:05:44.590> and<00:05:44.979> then

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:45.219 
push muscle is the upper abs and then

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:46.769 
push muscle is the upper abs and then
our<00:05:45.310> leg<00:05:45.520> day<00:05:45.699> we're<00:05:45.969> going<00:05:46.090> to<00:05:46.150> do<00:05:46.300> lower<00:05:46.509> abs

00:05:46.769 --> 00:05:46.779 
our leg day we're going to do lower abs

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:48.420 
our leg day we're going to do lower abs
because<00:05:47.020> just<00:05:47.380> there<00:05:47.650> in<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:47.830> same<00:05:48.009> similar

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
because just there in the same similar

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.550 
because just there in the same similar
area<00:05:49.060> of<00:05:49.120> the<00:05:49.180> body<00:05:49.300> and<00:05:49.599> then<00:05:50.259> when<00:05:50.349> we<00:05:50.440> do

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
area of the body and then when we do

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.019 
area of the body and then when we do
pull<00:05:50.830> day<00:05:51.039> we're<00:05:51.580> going<00:05:51.669> to<00:05:51.729> get<00:05:51.819> the<00:05:51.940> obliques

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:52.029 
pull day we're going to get the obliques

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:54.870 
pull day we're going to get the obliques
okay
