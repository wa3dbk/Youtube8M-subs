00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.950 
industry that they're that they're
paying<00:00:25.529> for<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.939> goes<00:00:27.180> towards<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.779> and

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
sometimes there really is a lot of

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.200 
sometimes there really is a lot of
progress<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.550> we<00:00:29.640> find<00:00:29.880> different

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
progress and we find different

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.820 
progress and we find different
alternative<00:00:30.630> things<00:00:30.840> however<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.470> think<00:00:31.710> we

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
alternative things however I think we

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.090 
alternative things however I think we
are<00:00:31.920> largely<00:00:32.309> skipping<00:00:32.880> over<00:00:33.059> alternative

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
are largely skipping over alternative

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.680 
are largely skipping over alternative
healing<00:00:35.100> methods<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.910> Western<00:00:36.210> medicine<00:00:36.600> and

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
healing methods in Western medicine and

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.440 
healing methods in Western medicine and
also<00:00:36.899> let<00:00:37.260> alone<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.530> proper<00:00:38.190> diet<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.090> want

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
also let alone a proper diet so I want

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.369

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.799 
watched this it was by Eric Burke brg
about<00:00:43.829> iodine<00:00:44.190> trace<00:00:44.850> minerals<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.629> how

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
about iodine trace minerals and how

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.619 
about iodine trace minerals and how
iodine<00:00:46.620> relates<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.370> breast<00:00:47.670> cancer<00:00:47.760> if

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
iodine relates to breast cancer if

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.240 
iodine relates to breast cancer if
actually<00:00:48.989> proven<00:00:49.289> several<00:00:49.590> studies<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.100> he

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
actually proven several studies and he

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.010 
actually proven several studies and he
references<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.059> other<00:00:51.120> doctors<00:00:51.420> as<00:00:51.690> well<00:00:51.719> so

references and other doctors as well so
you'll<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.410> check<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.649> out<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.770> think<00:00:52.949> it's

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
you'll have to check it out I think it's

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.619 
you'll have to check it out I think it's
dr.<00:00:53.370> Brownstein<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.239> think<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.899> which<00:00:55.530> iodine<00:00:56.190> a

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
dr. Brownstein I think in which iodine a

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.549 
dr. Brownstein I think in which iodine a
certain<00:00:57.629> kind<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.840> Ida<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.320> want<00:00:58.500> like

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
certain kind of Ida and you want like

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.830 
certain kind of Ida and you want like
the<00:00:58.770> liquid<00:00:59.100> iodine<00:00:59.489> formula<00:01:00.300> like<00:01:00.449> lugol's

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
the liquid iodine formula like lugol's

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.170 
the liquid iodine formula like lugol's
iodine<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.620> great<00:01:01.800> one<00:01:02.030> where<00:01:03.030> it's

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
iodine it's a great one where it's

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.560 
iodine it's a great one where it's
actually<00:01:03.449> been<00:01:03.539> proven<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.619> counter<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.700> heal

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
actually been proven to counter and heal

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.440 
actually been proven to counter and heal
or<00:01:06.960> remission<00:01:07.650> type<00:01:08.580> status<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:09.090> breast

cancer<00:01:10.460> your<00:01:11.460> memory<00:01:11.970> glands<00:01:12.360> really<00:01:13.200> need<00:01:13.439> a

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
cancer your memory glands really need a

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.230 
cancer your memory glands really need a
lot<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.830> iodine<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.400> function<00:01:14.820> saying<00:01:15.090> with

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
lot of iodine to function saying with

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.880 
lot of iodine to function saying with
your<00:01:15.360> thyroid<00:01:16.049> also<00:01:16.320> their<00:01:16.470> stuff<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.799> so

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
that they found that I think those are

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.780 
that they found that I think those are
90%<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.259> Americans<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.340> an<00:01:20.460> iodine

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
90% of Americans have an iodine

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.060 
90% of Americans have an iodine
deficiency<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:22.049> he<00:01:22.380> mentioned<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:22.799> too<00:01:22.979> and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
deficiency and he mentioned this too and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.090 
deficiency and he mentioned this too and
I<00:01:23.130> completely<00:01:23.490> agree<00:01:23.759> with<00:01:23.790> us<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.439> our<00:01:25.439> food

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
I completely agree with us that our food

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.219 
I completely agree with us that our food
companies<00:01:26.640> are<00:01:26.670> industrialized<00:01:27.600> farming<00:01:27.780> and

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
companies are industrialized farming and

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.100 
companies are industrialized farming and
bread<00:01:29.040> production<00:01:29.549> companies<00:01:29.970> they<00:01:30.600> used<00:01:30.900> to

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
bread production companies they used to

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.319 
bread production companies they used to
pull<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.500> iodized<00:01:31.829> salt<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.610> our<00:01:32.759> foods<00:01:33.090> back

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
pull it iodized salt and our foods back

pull it iodized salt and our foods back
in<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.540> day<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.869> then<00:01:33.990> they<00:01:34.110> switched<00:01:34.320> to

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
in the day and then they switched to

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.679 
in the day and then they switched to
bromine<00:01:34.829> which<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> lot<00:01:35.670> more<00:01:35.850> inexpensive

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
bromine which is a lot more inexpensive

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.240 
bromine which is a lot more inexpensive
and<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.110> cheaper<00:01:37.380> alternative<00:01:37.439> for<00:01:38.040> them<00:01:38.130> to

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
and a cheaper alternative for them to

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.810 
and a cheaper alternative for them to
save<00:01:38.430> money

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
save money

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.910

and minerals from our current diet we

and minerals from our current diet we
just<00:02:12.569> don't<00:02:12.720> our<00:02:13.019> soils<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:14.010> foods<00:02:14.280> are<00:02:14.489> so

just don't our soils and foods are so

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
depleted kind of based on a

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.460 
depleted kind of based on a
controversial<00:02:20.269> farming<00:02:21.269> I<00:02:21.390> guess<00:02:21.599> I'll<00:02:21.930> put

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
controversial farming I guess I'll put

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.710 
controversial farming I guess I'll put
like<00:02:22.650> potassium<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.879> nitrate<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.569> stuff

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
like potassium and nitrate and stuff

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.570 
like potassium and nitrate and stuff
back<00:02:24.810> in<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.080> soil<00:02:25.230> but<00:02:25.500> really<00:02:25.950> depleting<00:02:26.459> it

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
back in the soil but really depleting it

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.160 
back in the soil but really depleting it
the<00:02:26.700> way<00:02:26.819> that<00:02:26.849> we<00:02:27.060> grow<00:02:27.360> our<00:02:27.510> crops<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:28.049> way

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
the way that we grow our crops the way

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.229 
the way that we grow our crops the way
that<00:02:28.349> we<00:02:28.440> don't<00:02:28.680> we<00:02:28.950> alternate<00:02:29.700> between<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:30.090> lot

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
that we don't we alternate between a lot

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.940 
that we don't we alternate between a lot
of<00:02:30.330> crops<00:02:30.569> often<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.379> and<00:02:31.560> things<00:02:31.739> like<00:02:31.890> that

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
of crops often and and things like that

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.740 
of crops often and and things like that
that<00:02:32.129> is<00:02:32.310> leading<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.940> depletion<00:02:33.540> and

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
that is leading to depletion and

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.449 
that is leading to depletion and
nutrients<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.680> minerals<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.190> things<00:02:35.310> like

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
nutrients and minerals and things like

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.270 
nutrients and minerals and things like
that<00:02:35.519> so<00:02:35.670> anyways<00:02:36.120> um<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.690> lack<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.769> iodine<00:02:37.920> can

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
that so anyways um a lack of iodine can

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.430 
that so anyways um a lack of iodine can
cause<00:02:38.489> polycystic<00:02:39.090> ovarian<00:02:39.510> disease<00:02:39.780> or

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
cause polycystic ovarian disease or

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.690 
cause polycystic ovarian disease or
syndrome<00:02:40.879> cause<00:02:41.879> cancer<00:02:42.480> of<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.079> thyroid

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
syndrome cause cancer of the thyroid

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.970 
syndrome cause cancer of the thyroid
prostate<00:02:44.700> breast<00:02:45.180> cancer<00:02:45.900> um<00:02:46.170> possibly

prostate breast cancer um possibly
stomach<00:02:47.640> stuff<00:02:47.819> but<00:02:48.299> I<00:02:48.329> just<00:02:48.480> think<00:02:48.690> it's

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
stomach stuff but I just think it's

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.420 
stomach stuff but I just think it's
absolutely<00:02:49.170> fascinating<00:02:49.709> that<00:02:49.950> with<00:02:50.310> an

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
like that that we don't need that I

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.920 
like that that we don't need that I
really<00:05:13.670> do<00:05:13.790> believe<00:05:14.030> we're<00:05:14.180> slowly<00:05:14.330> poisonous

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
really do believe we're slowly poisonous

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.430

alone the pesticides insecticides then

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.840

we<00:05:20.930> have<00:05:21.050> our<00:05:21.170> water<00:05:21.400> system<00:05:22.400> like<00:05:22.580> especially

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
we have our water system like especially

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.750 
we have our water system like especially
a<00:05:23.000> city<00:05:23.270> water<00:05:23.510> a<00:05:23.930> lot<00:05:24.440> of<00:05:24.530> birth<00:05:24.740> control<00:05:24.980> a

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
a city water a lot of birth control a

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.090 
a city water a lot of birth control a
lot<00:05:25.940> of<00:05:26.030> medications<00:05:26.960> are<00:05:27.140> not<00:05:27.290> filtered<00:05:27.800> out

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
lot of medications are not filtered out

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.590 
lot of medications are not filtered out
through<00:05:28.130> the<00:05:28.430> water<00:05:28.640> so<00:05:28.970> you<00:05:29.000> are<00:05:29.210> drinking

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
through the water so you are drinking

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.690 
through the water so you are drinking
that<00:05:29.810> and<00:05:30.440> you<00:05:30.830> know<00:05:30.950> this<00:05:31.070> is<00:05:31.220> causing<00:05:31.550> a<00:05:31.610> lot

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
that and you know this is causing a lot

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.860 
that and you know this is causing a lot
of<00:05:31.760> stuff<00:05:32.000> they've<00:05:32.150> actually<00:05:32.300> proven<00:05:32.750> that

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
of stuff they've actually proven that

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.630 
of stuff they've actually proven that
baby<00:05:33.500> boys<00:05:33.770> are<00:05:34.220> having<00:05:34.430> smaller<00:05:34.940> ball<00:05:35.420> or

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
baby boys are having smaller ball or

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.880 
baby boys are having smaller ball or
smaller<00:05:37.640> testicles<00:05:38.060> and<00:05:38.480> genitalia<00:05:38.890> and

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
smaller testicles and genitalia and

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.560 
smaller testicles and genitalia and
things<00:05:40.490> like<00:05:40.610> that<00:05:40.790> and<00:05:40.940> so<00:05:41.030> it<00:05:41.180> really<00:05:41.330> is

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
things like that and so it really is

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.530 
things like that and so it really is
affecting<00:05:42.020> us<00:05:42.160> we<00:05:43.160> are<00:05:43.310> highly<00:05:43.940> medicated<00:05:44.120> in

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
affecting us we are highly medicated in

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.540 
affecting us we are highly medicated in
this<00:05:44.660> country<00:05:45.080> and<00:05:45.320> so<00:05:45.590> we<00:05:46.190> don't<00:05:46.370> have<00:05:46.520> a

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
this country and so we don't have a

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.750 
this country and so we don't have a
really<00:05:46.820> good<00:05:46.940> way<00:05:47.120> of<00:05:47.270> filtering<00:05:47.480> out<00:05:47.810> and

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
really good way of filtering out and

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.030 
really good way of filtering out and
kind<00:05:49.760> of<00:05:49.790> finding<00:05:50.060> a<00:05:50.150> more<00:05:50.330> healthy

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.040 
kind of finding a more healthy

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.480 
kind of finding a more healthy

alternative methods you know there's
been<00:06:04.610> times<00:06:04.850> where<00:06:05.000> people<00:06:05.240> have<00:06:05.330> mentioned

been times where people have mentioned

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.670 
been times where people have mentioned
what<00:06:07.010> is<00:06:07.130> it

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
what is it

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.170 
what is it
sodium<00:06:09.680> bicarbonate<00:06:10.220> I<00:06:10.370> thank<00:06:10.610> her<00:06:10.730> price<00:06:10.910> and

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
sodium bicarbonate I thank her price and

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.210 
sodium bicarbonate I thank her price and
I<00:06:11.600> forget<00:06:11.840> I'm<00:06:12.020> just<00:06:12.230> like<00:06:12.410> sick<00:06:12.560> and<00:06:12.980> it<00:06:13.130> is

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
I forget I'm just like sick and it is

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.280 
I forget I'm just like sick and it is
basically<00:06:13.430> like<00:06:13.820> baking<00:06:14.180> soda<00:06:14.420> and<00:06:14.720> then<00:06:15.170> I

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
basically like baking soda and then I

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.650 
basically like baking soda and then I
think<00:06:15.440> that<00:06:15.560> also<00:06:15.830> goes<00:06:16.040> back<00:06:16.280> to<00:06:16.730> dealing

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:17.660 
think that also goes back to dealing

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.420 
think that also goes back to dealing
with<00:06:17.780> either<00:06:17.990> your<00:06:18.290> too<00:06:18.470> alkaline<00:06:18.650> or<00:06:19.220> too

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
with either your too alkaline or too

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.860 
with either your too alkaline or too
acidic<00:06:19.730> with<00:06:19.910> your<00:06:20.060> system<00:06:20.390> but<00:06:20.510> they<00:06:20.600> believe

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
acidic with your system but they believe

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.590 
acidic with your system but they believe
that<00:06:20.990> that<00:06:21.110> is<00:06:21.260> also<00:06:21.440> combated<00:06:22.100> and<00:06:22.600> fought

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 
that that is also combated and fought

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.630 
that that is also combated and fought
cancer<00:06:23.990> there<00:06:24.440> are<00:06:24.470> also<00:06:24.650> theories<00:06:25.100> that<00:06:25.400> you

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:25.640 
cancer there are also theories that you
