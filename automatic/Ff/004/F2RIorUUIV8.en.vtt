go ahead and connect the corners with
the<00:01:46.770> tape<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.399> part<00:01:47.670> can<00:01:47.759> be<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.909> little

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
the tape this part can be a little

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.580 
the tape this part can be a little
tricky<00:01:48.479> alright<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.170> when<00:01:49.320> you're<00:01:49.439> done

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
taping the corners out it should look

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.399 
taping the corners out it should look
something<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.899> almost<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.350> a

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
something like this almost like a

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.010 
something like this almost like a
pyramid<00:01:53.119> next<00:01:54.119> time<00:01:54.240> we'll<00:01:54.390> have<00:01:54.420> links<00:01:54.960> in

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
pyramid next time we'll have links in

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.840 
pyramid next time we'll have links in
the<00:01:55.140> description<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.770> all<00:01:55.799> these<00:01:56.250> holographic

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
the description to all these holographic

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.819 
the description to all these holographic
videos<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.170> want<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.350> go<00:01:58.439> ahead<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.680> turn
