00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
then when you get it to the front you're

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:58.639 
then when you get it to the front you're
going<00:00:49.149> to<00:00:49.210> beat<00:00:49.479> a<00:00:49.710> bead<00:00:50.710> on<00:00:51.010> to<00:00:51.609> the<00:00:51.760> wire<00:00:57.359> and

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
going to beat a bead on to the wire and

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.639 
going to beat a bead on to the wire and
hold<00:00:59.649> it<00:00:59.799> tight<00:01:00.069> while<00:01:00.459> you<00:01:00.609> wrap<00:01:00.850> it<00:01:00.879> around

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
and send the end back through the hole

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.430 
and send the end back through the hole
and<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:09.100> feed<00:01:09.460> it<00:01:09.610> through<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:11.290> you're

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
and just feed it through and you're

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.950 
and just feed it through and you're
going<00:01:11.590> to<00:01:11.650> do<00:01:11.800> that<00:01:11.920> all<00:01:12.160> the<00:01:12.190> way<00:01:12.370> around<00:01:12.960> the

going to do that all the way around the

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.910 
going to do that all the way around the
hole<00:01:14.580> when<00:01:15.580> you<00:01:15.670> get<00:01:15.790> to<00:01:15.910> the<00:01:16.030> last<00:01:16.210> bead

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
hole when you get to the last bead

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.820 
hole when you get to the last bead
around<00:01:17.920> you're<00:01:18.460> around<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.210> top<00:01:19.800> you<00:01:20.800> are

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
around you're around the top you are

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.890 
around you're around the top you are
going<00:01:21.130> to<00:01:21.460> wrap<00:01:21.820> it<00:01:21.850> around<00:01:22.920> here<00:01:23.920> and<00:01:24.690> put<00:01:25.690> one

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
going to wrap it around here and put one

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:34.140 
going to wrap it around here and put one
more<00:01:26.850> bead<00:01:27.850> on<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:33.250> again<00:01:33.700> you'll<00:01:33.880> want<00:01:33.940> to

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
more bead on and again you'll want to

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.890 
more bead on and again you'll want to
hold<00:01:34.270> it<00:01:34.420> tight<00:01:34.600> as<00:01:34.840> you<00:01:35.020> wrap<00:01:35.550> and<00:01:36.690> with<00:01:37.690> each

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
hold it tight as you wrap and with each

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.100 
hold it tight as you wrap and with each
each<00:01:38.500> wrap<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.970> add<00:01:40.210> some<00:01:40.540> more<00:01:40.570> beads<00:01:40.870> you

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
each wrap just add some more beads you

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.160 
each wrap just add some more beads you
can<00:01:41.230> do<00:01:42.160> a<00:01:42.190> mixture<00:01:42.760> just<00:01:43.030> grab<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.390> handful<00:01:43.870> and

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
can do a mixture just grab a handful and

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:57.330 
can do a mixture just grab a handful and
mix<00:01:45.010> it<00:01:45.160> up

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.050 

and<00:01:58.689> just<00:01:59.689> keep<00:01:59.899> wrapping<00:02:00.079> all<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.560> way<00:02:00.710> down

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.399 

when<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:05.180> get<00:02:05.270> down<00:02:05.509> to<00:02:05.689> the<00:02:05.810> bottom<00:02:06.170> and

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
again holding it tight wrap it one time

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.850 
again holding it tight wrap it one time
around<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.530> bottom<00:02:18.860> without<00:02:19.190> any<00:02:19.430> beads<00:02:19.670> and

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
around the bottom without any beads and

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.040 
around the bottom without any beads and
then<00:02:21.860> flip<00:02:22.069> it<00:02:22.160> over<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.670> back<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:26.050> go

then flip it over to the back and go

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:39.970 
then flip it over to the back and go
through<00:02:32.319> two<00:02:33.319> of<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:36.010> wires<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:38.709> just<00:02:39.709> pull

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
through two of the wires and just pull

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.720 
through two of the wires and just pull
down<00:02:42.459> and<00:02:44.319> go<00:02:45.319> back<00:02:45.530> through<00:02:45.590> those<00:02:46.099> two<00:02:46.430> and

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
down and go back through those two and

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.009 
down and go back through those two and
pull<00:02:47.660> down<00:02:47.840> again<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:49.099> just<00:02:49.250> do<00:02:49.459> that<00:02:49.580> a

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
pull down again and just do that a

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.990 
pull down again and just do that a
couple<00:02:51.019> of<00:02:51.140> times<00:02:51.380> or<00:02:51.799> is<00:02:51.950> until<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:52.819> run<00:02:52.940> out

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
couple of times or is until you run out

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.130 
couple of times or is until you run out
of<00:02:53.209> wire<00:02:53.799> just<00:02:54.799> to<00:02:54.920> get<00:02:55.040> a<00:02:55.069> secure<00:02:55.519> fit<00:02:55.760> and

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
of wire just to get a secure fit and

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.870 
of wire just to get a secure fit and
then<00:02:57.140> if<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.380> have<00:02:57.560> extra<00:02:58.130> like<00:02:58.280> this<00:02:58.519> you<00:02:58.730> can

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
then if you have extra like this you can

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.569 
then if you have extra like this you can
feed<00:02:59.090> it<00:02:59.209> back<00:02:59.299> up<00:02:59.540> through<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.810> top<00:03:00.109> of<00:03:03.579> the

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
feed it back up through the top of the

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.640 
feed it back up through the top of the
wires<00:03:04.790> until<00:03:05.600> you<00:03:05.900> get<00:03:06.079> it<00:03:06.170> to<00:03:06.200> where<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:06.560> won't

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
wires until you get it to where it won't

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.430 
wires until you get it to where it won't
poke<00:03:06.950> out<00:03:07.269> and<00:03:08.269> you<00:03:08.930> are<00:03:09.049> done<00:03:09.230> with<00:03:09.380> your

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
poke out and you are done with your

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.769 
poke out and you are done with your
spoon
