00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.560
 that too would it be a hard blow for 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.969
 the psg captain certainly yes first 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.230
 because in building a club 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.920
 the coach has always held a role 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.810
 preponderant essential capital is therefore 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.880
 such a tool departure Ancelotti 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.869
 coming after antoine's dismissal 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.330
 kombouaré might not be a one a 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.699
 final stop shot it would not be they 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.730
 will go tricky but it would be without 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.000
 doubt a step a break time a 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.960
 When stopping at least one stop 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.230
 on the on the on the progression at 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.420
 not so despite all the offers not 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.820
 the impression that I feel that 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.090
 I have on carlo ancelotti knows that they 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.350
 would like to continue but I have the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.989
 feeling he is not happy no 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.030
 not with the leaders do not have with 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.149
 his staff who chose him I 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.510
 the impression that despite all these efforts 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:07.590
 we see him and we saw him in anger 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.820
 incredible during the match at tg annecy 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.350
 against evian and I think that's 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.040
 rather with the players and he says to himself 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.880
 with this group there I think I'm going 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.299
 quickly we will quickly reach the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.270
 limitations 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.860
 I think it's rather there and there is I 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.030
 guard of attitude so players who 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.650
 would have gone professional not 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.180
 able to question himself 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.229
 to be 100% in investment a 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.790
 dropped on the train 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.710
 so that's obviously and obviously 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.030
 will fly to the rescue of victory and we 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.020
 will fly to the rescue of those who 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.020
 worked well jérôme 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.960
 but in a 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.750
 I do not know if it's a semifinal 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.310
 cut where are the players of the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.950
 bayern munich have had this attitude 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.470
 hilal have put five or six 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.350
 well before to see the match good at 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.380
 wolsbourg i think we're here and and 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.060
 you can not you can not attitude 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.250
 players is incomparable but I 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.729
 would just like to come back on a whole 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:07.439
 little chapter and I beg you I'm going 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.710
 may be hard but it's death 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.560
 the death of 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.920
 neither gbagbo nor ben rhodes the chief 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.050
 performance hours and there is no 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.110
 picked up big thing on it 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.470
 do you remember that holy paris 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:27.100
 germain had requested the postponement of the match 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.930
 who knew who was following this unfortunate 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.980
 this unfortunate this unfortunate 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.630
 disappearance and in ten years the club is 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.340
 traumatized I hear it well I think 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.950
 that carlo ancelotti was truly 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.190
 to traumatize reminds you anyway 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.830
 that there was a special flight that had 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.800
 been chartered the pg had chartered a plane 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.210
 Monday morning the day of the burial 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.250
 how much was he in the plane the 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.930
 players players 3 3 players 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.550
 Parisians well how many were there 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.540
 holder on the plane I remember 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.970
 more names what is sure is that 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.590
 there had been an evening the day before he 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.570
 there are minutes in the evening I think the same 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.460
 evening but I heard that it's 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.840
 nothing is nothing home evening and even 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:15.000
 me it enormously shocked me enormously 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:20.950
 shocked that's the kind of two 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:25.090
 episodes in the life of a club that puts 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:28.120
 the sure accent we are united we are one 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.890
 club we are a team we are united 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.340
 in misfortune we are united in 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.020
 joy and when I had read that stone 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.470
 paul and jacques had found excuses 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.490
 who actually had a party 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.970
 I think it was actually the 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:46.000
 children does not matter but that we charter 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.590
 a plane and we find ourselves three 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.440
 players on the plane and I believe it 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.610
 there was not a single holder I did not 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.990
 would not put my hand to cut 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.380
 but I believe there was not a 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.780
 only I think that carlo ancelotti this 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.000
 day there he said these guys there I can 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.770
 not go to war with them I can 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.250
 not go to war I can not go 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.680
 we 're not going to pick up the moon and we're going 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.510
 not move the mountains because if he 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.340
 the same thing happens in other clubs 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.300
 but to the plane remembered there will be 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.300
 maybe even too small
