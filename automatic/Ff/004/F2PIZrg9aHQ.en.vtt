00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:09.109 
as miley cyrus so that's pretty cool I

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:10.929 
as miley cyrus so that's pretty cool I
think<00:01:09.319> that's<00:01:09.469> what<00:01:09.590> makes<00:01:09.740> the<00:01:09.889> ipad<00:01:10.340> way

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
think that's what makes the ipad way

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.669 
think that's what makes the ipad way
better<00:01:11.209> than<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:11.420> kindle<00:01:11.659> but<00:01:12.289> but<00:01:12.530> there's

better than the kindle but but there's
still<00:01:12.799> a<00:01:12.920> question<00:01:13.100> where<00:01:13.789> does<00:01:13.880> it<00:01:13.939> fit
