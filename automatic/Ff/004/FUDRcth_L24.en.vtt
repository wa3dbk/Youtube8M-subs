00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
so looking like this so the text is

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.760 
so looking like this so the text is
facing<00:01:31.759> in<00:01:31.819> the<00:01:31.880> way<00:01:31.999> and<00:01:32.499> then<00:01:33.499> we're<00:01:33.619> going

gonna need a graffiti fonts this just go
to<00:02:00.409> our<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:00.829> go<00:02:01.309> to<00:02:01.369> raise<00:02:01.609> one<00:02:01.849> this<00:02:02.029> is<00:02:02.090> a

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:02.209 
to our and go to raise one this is a

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:04.779 
to our and go to raise one this is a
really<00:02:02.569> nice<00:02:02.689> font<00:02:02.959> as<00:02:03.189> you<00:02:04.189> can<00:02:04.340> see<00:02:04.489> we<00:02:04.639> just

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
really nice font as you can see we just

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.239 
really nice font as you can see we just
render<00:02:04.999> that<00:02:05.090> you<00:02:05.179> can<00:02:05.329> see<00:02:05.419> the<00:02:05.539> form<00:02:05.719> there

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:06.249 
render that you can see the form there

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:08.380 
render that you can see the form there
so<00:02:07.249> now<00:02:07.340> it's<00:02:07.459> time<00:02:07.549> to<00:02:07.639> add<00:02:07.729> some<00:02:07.789> colors<00:02:08.270> in

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
so now it's time to add some colors in

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.819 
so now it's time to add some colors in
my<00:02:08.509> opinion<00:02:08.840> so<00:02:09.200> let's<00:02:09.319> double<00:02:09.560> click<00:02:09.590> down

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:09.829 
my opinion so let's double click down

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.500 
my opinion so let's double click down
here<00:02:09.860> to<00:02:10.219> bring<00:02:10.399> up<00:02:10.489> a<00:02:10.579> new<00:02:10.729> material<00:02:11.390> just

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
here to bring up a new material just

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.070 
here to bring up a new material just
double<00:02:11.750> click<00:02:11.870> on<00:02:11.959> this<00:02:12.049> grey<00:02:12.290> bit<00:02:12.500> here

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
double click on this grey bit here

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.300 
double click on this grey bit here
and<00:02:13.200> then<00:02:13.470> we'll<00:02:13.560> double<00:02:13.800> kill<00:02:13.950> on<00:02:14.070> that<00:02:14.190> to

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
and then we'll double kill on that to

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.760 
and then we'll double kill on that to
burn<00:02:14.430> up<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.580> material<00:02:15.090> window<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.600> color<00:02:16.530> I

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
burn up the material window and color I

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.030 
burn up the material window and color I
think<00:02:17.070> we<00:02:17.130> should<00:02:17.160> go<00:02:17.370> for<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:17.640> nice<00:02:18.560> maybe<00:02:19.560> a

think we should go for a nice maybe a

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.760 
think we should go for a nice maybe a

go<00:03:11.490> to<00:03:11.780> parameter<00:03:12.780> here<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:14.280> we<00:03:14.370> can<00:03:14.520> change

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
go to parameter here and we can change

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.730 
go to parameter here and we can change
all<00:03:15.000> these<00:03:15.270> settings<00:03:15.630> but<00:03:15.870> first<00:03:16.140> one<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.320> tick

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
all these settings but first one a tick

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.590 
all these settings but first one a tick
rotation<00:03:17.220> but<00:03:17.640> we'll<00:03:17.760> get<00:03:17.880> that<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.090> second<00:03:18.480> so

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
rotation but we'll get that a second so

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.680 
rotation but we'll get that a second so
i<00:03:18.630> want<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.810> go<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.900> X<00:03:19.080> you<00:03:19.350> want<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.530> go<00:03:19.620> 0<00:03:19.920> and

why I want to go 0 and yeah basically if
you<00:03:25.080> want<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.380> change<00:03:25.739> it<00:03:25.890> you<00:03:26.010> can<00:03:26.160> just<00:03:26.190> play

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
you want to change it you can just play

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.770 
you want to change it you can just play
around<00:03:26.459> these<00:03:26.730> settings<00:03:27.060> make<00:03:27.269> me<00:03:27.480> road<00:03:27.600> for

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
around these settings make me road for

around these settings make me road for
your<00:03:27.900> own<00:03:27.989> text<00:03:28.170> so<00:03:28.350> we<00:03:28.470> just<00:03:28.590> have<00:03:28.650> look
