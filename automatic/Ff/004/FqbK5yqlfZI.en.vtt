but if we go quickly here to the main
emulator<00:00:46.940> you<00:00:47.940> can<00:00:48.090> see<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.559> there<00:00:49.559> are<00:00:49.590> a

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
emulator you can see that there are a

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.119 
emulator you can see that there are a
whole<00:00:50.219> slew<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.640> games<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.570> choose<00:00:51.750> from<00:00:52.129> many

here hit the black button it gets me
back<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.790> emulator<00:01:47.530> and<00:01:48.940> I<00:01:49.940> can<00:01:50.540> basically

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
back to the emulator and I can basically

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.830 
back to the emulator and I can basically
go<00:01:51.200> through<00:01:51.880> by<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:52.940> way<00:01:53.090> this<00:01:53.240> is<00:01:53.510> a<00:01:53.540> call<00:01:53.810> to

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
go through by the way this is a call to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.910 
go through by the way this is a call to
front<00:01:54.200> end<00:01:54.410> it's<00:01:55.090> maximus<00:01:56.090> arcade<00:01:56.830> but<00:01:57.830> i'll

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
front end it's maximus arcade but i'll

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.280 
front end it's maximus arcade but i'll
go<00:01:58.130> now<00:01:58.370> to<00:01:58.690> Daphne<00:01:59.690> which<00:01:59.840> is<00:01:59.990> again<00:02:00.260> the

game was costly as a kid 50 shines upon
look<00:02:38.860> just<00:02:39.860> like<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.130> arcade<00:02:40.460> once<00:02:40.700> again<00:02:41.000> you

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
look just like the arcade once again you

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.800 
look just like the arcade once again you
control<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.410> actions<00:02:42.800> on<00:02:42.920> go<00:02:43.550> ahead<00:02:43.760> and

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
control the actions on go ahead and

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.140 

see<00:03:00.980> if<00:03:01.040> we<00:03:01.160> can<00:03:01.310> make<00:03:01.520> it<00:03:01.550> through<00:03:01.760> that<00:03:01.940> least

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
see if we can make it through that least

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:15.930 
see if we can make it through that least
I<00:03:02.300> know<00:03:08.170> this<00:03:09.170> practice<00:03:09.460> relatively<00:03:10.460> easier

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.200 

anyway<00:03:16.940> I<00:03:17.120> could<00:03:17.240> play<00:03:17.480> this<00:03:17.540> for<00:03:17.810> hours<00:03:18.020> but

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
anyway I could play this for hours but

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.870 
anyway I could play this for hours but
