 exactly is was a suggestion made by 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.000

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.320
 start of the video so let's go on this go 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.600
 talk and explain to you how 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.710
 that works on the sims 3 is very 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.420
 different from what happens in schools 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.640
 You have to do some more things. 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.129
 there's that have to do in 2004 and also 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.229
 Have to show you. I have to 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.590
 Talk to you too, what's different? 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.630
 when you lower a yes three pec that is 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.399
 another type of content 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.030
 custom we have produced 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.220
 3 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.350
 and when you download a small one and I go 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.259
 explain to you more that works if 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.630
 you download something from the sims 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.190
 3 that comes in small you will have to 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.470
 install folder mode 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.959
 if you install it teaches the three pec 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.720
 You have to come here and come downloads. 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:36.209
 looks at all your files that 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.519
 had met the sims 3 here and he 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:39.810
 have marked sims 3 pec 

00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:41.580
 You have to come here and put it on the square. 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.060
 download you do not need the folder mode 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.550

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.259
 and here it is I have many things to see 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.929
 attentive and content there has a part 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.420
 thing and until the beginning devastating 2003 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.970
 it will show how a common download 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.879
 even if you have to download the 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.890
 content and small living are archives 

00:01:56.879 --> 00:02:01.440

 right here on the desktop if you want 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.470
 or whatever is not any folder 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.480
 Did you come here? 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.760
 file to any place you 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.320

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.510
 work area no problem he 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.610
 I'll come with this folder that I myself 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.500
 I put it to you because here's the 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.850
 my pasta molds of course do not have 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.740
 everything that I showed you 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.510
 now I give you everything but I have 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.520
 many more can see that there are only a few 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.530
 things I left here as a test for 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.540
 see if it is really working in 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.610
 game of you beauty then for you 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.200
 open when you open it or it goes 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.170
 at most three will already appear there a 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.970
 script at the beginning of the main menu 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.300
 that they have new content or that they 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.480
 you have already put in 2003 and what now 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.520
 You can use it there in the game. 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.700
 and those here your hiking shirts 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.860
 bands that go back there in the game itself 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.660
 in the kit so it will not show that it is 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.980
 downloaded content and it seems that it is 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.230
 game itself will not have an icon 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.880
 indifferent but there you go 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.800
 check out these band shirts I 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.160
 I left it with the test just to be 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.570
 a file that is a like the core so 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.220
 It's easier for you to see this 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.350
 working but if the script already appears 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.989
 in the beginning it is because a 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.050
 mold and here is this resort also 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.580
 you have to download separate on the port 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.260
 But as I put it here in the 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.160
 You're going to vote for this 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.200
 here to download 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.350
 He 's here for you, then, beauty. 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.720
 this folder motorbikes that will come that will come 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.200
 here for you in the rar file you only 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.760
 pick it up here then copy and paste 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.610
 Quick if you want I 'm copying 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.769
 and you will come here only in your 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.430
 documents where electronic is marked 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.670
 arts 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.830
 then come here looking for 2003 after 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.739
 open that after the folder the sims 3 and comes 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.600
 here and paste your molds paste is obvious 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.609
 that I will not stick to me here because 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.070
 otherwise this is going to go up from here 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.680
 But it's just you come here to paste and it goes 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.360
 appear here already in paste beauty molds 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.090
 so along with these things here it goes already 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.390
 have this death folder here then you come 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.790

 I downloaded it, I think Tef Sun cleans it. 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.629
 in my my 2003 things but anyway 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.830
 have enough thing have pose feel 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:49.020
 many ways have a way of saying 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.750
 which also made a lot of success 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.460

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.819
 in the mold of this month four modes is not 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:11.520
 more personalized content and came here 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:13.500
 in downloads and search the sims 3 that 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.310
 will be here on the side so you can 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.900
 download 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.819
 there are some things that come as pqd 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.889
 other things we have already won three pecs 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:21.240

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.979
 pec then you come here low he puts 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.710
 on your download page there were also 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.690
 other as bad on file is small 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.669
 So you have to come and get it. 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.440
 put there after death so it's very 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.539
 important that you have a folder 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.509
 death because many many things 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:41.009
 downloaded will ask for a small one then 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:42.719
 you'll have to have a folder mode 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:45.210
 clear to the employee modes you 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:48.719
 need to have a mode folder on your 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.919
 sims 3 beauty then this is basically it 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:52.380
 This you have to do. 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.360
 I left everything ready, it 's just you download the 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.150
 in the other link that I left for you 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.300
 go there copy and paste in the folder of the sims 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.669
 3 here and your mode is already working 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.819
 so if your mode does not work yet 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:08.340
 It may be that he has that piece of work, right? 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:10.380
 one of three of x9 so I'll leave too 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.199

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.569
 files in principality only with it in 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:16.560
 because it may work without my is 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:18.029
 needed 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.979
 Only it's been a long time, I think now. 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:20.610
 No need for computer time anymore . 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.130

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.960
 If you already have the one from here, that's it. 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.599
 working in case if it does not work 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.159
 Are you going to download it? Are you going to be a father? 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:31.680

 there and replaces the file that he 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.260
