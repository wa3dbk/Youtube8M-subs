00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
actually take a micro sim and convert it

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.580 
actually take a micro sim and convert it
to<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.900> nano<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.710> can<00:00:10.860> get<00:00:10.980> these<00:00:11.099> on<00:00:11.280> Amazon<00:00:12.590> so

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
to a nano you can get these on Amazon so

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.860 
to a nano you can get these on Amazon so
they<00:00:13.740> call<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.009> nano<00:00:14.190> sim<00:00:14.460> cutter<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:15.030> what<00:00:15.809> I

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.140 
they call it nano sim cutter and what I
did<00:00:16.170> was<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.710> stuck<00:00:17.039> my<00:00:17.160> nano<00:00:17.340> SIM<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.730> there<00:00:17.910> and
