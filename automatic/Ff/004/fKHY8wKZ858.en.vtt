you<00:03:02.549> know<00:03:02.730> sometimes<00:03:03.510> taking<00:03:03.989> a<00:03:04.049> big<00:03:04.260> step

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
you know sometimes taking a big step

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:05.839 
you know sometimes taking a big step
away<00:03:04.650> from<00:03:04.769> something<00:03:05.280> allows<00:03:05.519> you<00:03:05.669> to

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
away from something allows you to

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:13.520 
away from something allows you to
reappropriation<00:03:11.959> this<00:03:12.959> happens<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.319> me<00:03:13.439> a<00:03:13.469> lot

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
reappropriation this happens to me a lot

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.869 
reappropriation this happens to me a lot
when<00:03:13.769> I<00:03:13.829> don't<00:03:14.009> play<00:03:14.159> guitar<00:03:14.310> for<00:03:14.669> a<00:03:14.729> while

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
when I don't play guitar for a while

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.339 
when I don't play guitar for a while
because<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.239> play<00:03:15.449> music<00:03:15.569> pretty<00:03:15.959> much<00:03:16.109> every

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
because I play music pretty much every

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.229 
because I play music pretty much every
day<00:03:16.500> but<00:03:16.560> sometimes<00:03:17.430> I<00:03:17.489> go<00:03:17.609> on<00:03:17.669> vacation<00:03:18.180> I

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
day but sometimes I go on vacation I

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.969 
day but sometimes I go on vacation I
won't<00:03:18.389> have<00:03:18.479> an<00:03:18.569> instrument<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:19.259> then<00:03:19.829> when<00:03:19.919> I

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:19.979 
won't have an instrument and then when I

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:21.469 
won't have an instrument and then when I
come<00:03:20.159> back<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.579> it<00:03:20.699> I<00:03:20.790> get<00:03:20.939> to<00:03:21.030> look<00:03:21.180> at<00:03:21.329> it<00:03:21.359> from

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:21.479 
come back to it I get to look at it from

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:23.629 
come back to it I get to look at it from
a<00:03:21.629> whole<00:03:21.870> new<00:03:22.169> perspective<00:03:22.500> maybe<00:03:23.340> I'm<00:03:23.579> a

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
a whole new perspective maybe I'm a

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.369 
a whole new perspective maybe I'm a
little<00:03:23.759> bit<00:03:24.000> rusty<00:03:24.419> maybe<00:03:24.629> my<00:03:24.780> fingers<00:03:25.169> don't

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
little bit rusty maybe my fingers don't

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.499 
little bit rusty maybe my fingers don't
quite<00:03:25.650> work<00:03:25.919> the<00:03:26.489> same<00:03:26.729> way<00:03:26.879> they<00:03:27.030> are<00:03:27.120> working

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:27.509 
quite work the same way they are working

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:29.689 
quite work the same way they are working
but<00:03:27.689> you<00:03:28.139> take<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.349> few<00:03:28.620> minutes<00:03:28.979> or<00:03:29.159> a<00:03:29.220> day<00:03:29.519> or

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:29.699 
but you take a few minutes or a day or

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:31.759 
but you take a few minutes or a day or
whatever<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.150> get<00:03:30.359> right<00:03:30.599> back<00:03:30.780> into<00:03:31.049> it<00:03:31.259> but

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
whatever and get right back into it but

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.259 
whatever and get right back into it but
you<00:03:31.829> have<00:03:32.069> a<00:03:32.099> new<00:03:32.310> perspective<00:03:32.579> things<00:03:33.120> are

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
you have a new perspective things are

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.240 
you have a new perspective things are
fresh<00:03:33.689> maybe<00:03:34.019> you're<00:03:34.229> trying<00:03:34.470> new<00:03:34.709> things<00:03:34.769> and

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
fresh maybe you're trying new things and

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.059 
fresh maybe you're trying new things and
I<00:03:35.389> think<00:03:36.389> this<00:03:36.540> might<00:03:37.500> seem<00:03:37.709> a<00:03:37.769> little<00:03:37.889> bit

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
I think this might seem a little bit

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.229 
I think this might seem a little bit
strange<00:03:38.430> if<00:03:38.579> you<00:03:38.639> haven't<00:03:38.909> gone<00:03:39.030> for<00:03:39.150> this

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
strange if you haven't gone for this

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.569 
strange if you haven't gone for this
before<00:03:39.449> but<00:03:39.900> I'm<00:03:40.799> really<00:03:40.949> trying<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.250> get<00:03:41.400> out

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
before but I'm really trying to get out

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.069 
before but I'm really trying to get out
of<00:03:41.609> this<00:03:41.699> but<00:03:41.879> something<00:03:42.090> big<00:03:42.479> and<00:03:42.870> life

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
of this but something big and life

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.110 
of this but something big and life
happens<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:44.189> need<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.400> take<00:03:44.669> that<00:03:44.849> chance

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
happens you need to take that chance

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.300 
happens you need to take that chance
seize<00:03:45.509> that<00:03:45.540> opportunity<00:03:45.829> to<00:03:46.829> not<00:03:47.009> just<00:03:47.040> be

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
seize that opportunity to not just be

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.929 
seize that opportunity to not just be
you<00:03:47.579> know<00:03:47.669> frustrated<00:03:48.479> or<00:03:49.319> to<00:03:49.620> be<00:03:50.099> lost<00:03:50.459> and

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:50.939 
you know frustrated or to be lost and

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.399 
you know frustrated or to be lost and
even<00:03:51.000> though<00:03:51.329> while<00:03:51.720> it's<00:03:51.840> happening<00:03:51.989> maybe

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409 
even though while it's happening maybe

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:54.229 
even though while it's happening maybe
you<00:03:52.620> may<00:03:52.889> be<00:03:52.919> lost<00:03:53.340> but<00:03:53.549> this<00:03:53.669> isn't<00:03:53.819> me<00:03:53.939> saying

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
you may be lost but this isn't me saying

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.849 
you may be lost but this isn't me saying
that<00:03:54.449> even<00:03:54.930> if<00:03:55.019> you<00:03:55.109> feel<00:03:55.319> like<00:03:55.500> you're<00:03:55.680> lost

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
that even if you feel like you're lost

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.339 
that even if you feel like you're lost
and<00:03:56.069> you<00:03:56.159> don't<00:03:56.400> know<00:03:56.579> what<00:03:56.819> to<00:03:56.969> do<00:03:57.180> just<00:03:58.139> know

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
and you don't know what to do just know

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:59.809 
and you don't know what to do just know
that<00:03:58.590> when<00:03:58.769> you<00:03:59.099> start<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.430> feel<00:03:59.579> better

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
that when you start to feel better

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.390 
that when you start to feel better
you'll<00:04:00.479> be<00:04:00.599> able<00:04:00.659> to<00:04:00.810> reproach<00:04:01.290> you<00:04:02.099> know<00:04:02.219> your

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
you'll be able to reproach you know your

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.099 
you'll be able to reproach you know your
whole<00:04:02.549> life<00:04:02.819> and<00:04:02.969> a<00:04:03.060> really<00:04:03.359> cool<00:04:03.569> new<00:04:03.840> fresh

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
whole life and a really cool new fresh

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.779 
whole life and a really cool new fresh
perspective<00:04:04.680> and<00:04:04.859> I<00:04:05.009> think<00:04:05.310> that<00:04:05.639> sometimes

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:05.789 
perspective and I think that sometimes

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:07.459 
perspective and I think that sometimes
life<00:04:06.150> does<00:04:06.389> that<00:04:06.599> to<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:06.840> it's<00:04:06.989> like<00:04:07.169> okay

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:07.469 
life does that to you it's like okay

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:08.839 
life does that to you it's like okay
listen<00:04:07.709> we're<00:04:08.039> gonna<00:04:08.099> do<00:04:08.370> this<00:04:08.519> thing<00:04:08.699> to

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
listen we're gonna do this thing to

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.149 
listen we're gonna do this thing to
shift<00:04:09.150> you<00:04:09.299> off<00:04:09.509> but<00:04:10.349> from<00:04:10.560> that<00:04:10.739> something

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
shift you off but from that something

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.009 
shift you off but from that something
new<00:04:11.310> will<00:04:11.430> come<00:04:11.459> like<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.090> Nico's<00:04:12.509> case<00:04:12.750> maybe

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
new will come like a Nico's case maybe

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.719 
new will come like a Nico's case maybe
Nico<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:14.099> know<00:04:14.189> you've<00:04:14.340> been<00:04:14.400> doing<00:04:14.459> these

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:14.729 
Nico you know you've been doing these

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:15.360 
Nico you know you've been doing these
videos

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
videos

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.390 
videos
seven<00:04:16.120> years<00:04:16.359> for<00:04:16.510> a<00:04:16.570> long<00:04:16.810> time<00:04:17.220> and<00:04:18.220> maybe

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
seven years for a long time and maybe

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.979 
seven years for a long time and maybe
it's<00:04:18.579> a<00:04:18.639> chance<00:04:18.880> to<00:04:19.000> try<00:04:19.180> something<00:04:19.209> new<00:04:19.600> too

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
it's a chance to try something new too

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.200 
it's a chance to try something new too
to<00:04:20.530> think<00:04:20.739> about<00:04:20.949> a<00:04:20.980> new<00:04:21.250> way<00:04:21.489> of<00:04:21.760> you<00:04:22.150> know

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
to think about a new way of you know

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.420 
to think about a new way of you know
expressing<00:04:22.840> those<00:04:22.990> videos<00:04:23.470> or<00:04:23.620> maybe<00:04:23.800> now

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
expressing those videos or maybe now

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.520 
expressing those videos or maybe now
you're<00:04:24.610> not<00:04:24.729> gonna<00:04:24.910> you<00:04:25.690> know<00:04:25.720> have<00:04:26.290> the<00:04:26.500> same

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
you're not gonna you know have the same

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.860 
you're not gonna you know have the same
approach<00:04:27.280> to<00:04:27.310> them<00:04:27.669> maybe<00:04:28.090> you<00:04:28.270> keep<00:04:28.419> going<00:04:28.720> on

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
approach to them maybe you keep going on

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.180 
approach to them maybe you keep going on
and<00:04:29.110> doing<00:04:29.350> what<00:04:29.470> you're<00:04:29.590> doing<00:04:29.620> in<00:04:29.919> just<00:04:30.040> get

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
and doing what you're doing in just get

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.710 
and doing what you're doing in just get
right<00:04:30.280> back<00:04:30.430> on<00:04:30.639> that's<00:04:30.760> great<00:04:31.000> but<00:04:31.300> I<00:04:31.479> really

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
right back on that's great but I really

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.300 
right back on that's great but I really
think<00:04:32.050> it's<00:04:32.229> a<00:04:32.290> chance<00:04:32.530> to<00:04:32.650> try<00:04:32.830> something<00:04:32.860> new

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
think it's a chance to try something new

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.680 
think it's a chance to try something new
you<00:04:33.340> know<00:04:33.580> you're<00:04:33.699> gonna<00:04:33.790> be<00:04:33.880> really<00:04:34.180> inspired

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
you know you're gonna be really inspired

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.330 
you know you're gonna be really inspired
when<00:04:34.930> you<00:04:35.020> finally<00:04:35.320> can<00:04:35.530> do<00:04:35.680> videos<00:04:35.979> again

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
when you finally can do videos again

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.189 
when you finally can do videos again
maybe<00:04:37.150> it's<00:04:37.330> gonna<00:04:37.449> make<00:04:37.600> time<00:04:37.780> you<00:04:37.900> think<00:04:38.050> of

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
maybe it's gonna make time you think of

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.290 
maybe it's gonna make time you think of
new<00:04:38.410> ideas<00:04:38.590> or<00:04:39.040> maybe<00:04:39.130> videos<00:04:39.580> that<00:04:39.820> teach

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
new ideas or maybe videos that teach

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.230 
new ideas or maybe videos that teach
people<00:04:40.410> how<00:04:41.410> to<00:04:41.440> you<00:04:42.010> know<00:04:42.130> cook<00:04:42.460> healthy<00:04:43.030> food
