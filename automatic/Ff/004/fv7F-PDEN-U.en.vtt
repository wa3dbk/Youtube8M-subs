00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 10 incredible facts about the blue whale 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.039
 The blue whale is the largest animal on earth. 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:20.500
 The longest blue whale measured by scientific methods came to 33.6 m. 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.139
 Its caudal fin reaches a width of up to 5 m, which is approximately 

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:26.939
 the height of two and a half doors. 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.630
 He is also the heaviest animal with a body mass of up to 200,000 kg. 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.360
 This is roughly equivalent to a 3-room family house, 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.430
 40 adult African elephants, 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.170
 254 small cars of the model Smart ForTwo or 2500 people. 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.690
 Alone his heart can weigh up to a ton with the main artery one 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.400
 Diameter of about 20 cm. 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.800
 A blue whale calf is about 7 meters long and weighs 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.830
 born of 2.5 t. 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.500
 For six to seven months, it drinks about 600 liters of milk every day 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.739
 and thus increases by 90 kg a day. 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.640
 The daily energy requirement of a fully grown blue whale is included 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.510
 about 1.5 million calories. 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.470
 In the summer months, it daily consumes an estimated 40 million people 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.460
 Crustaceans with a total weight of 3.5 t. 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.200
 In the winter months, he does not eat at all and lives off his fat reserves. 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.690
 His swimming speed during food intake is between 2 and 6.5 km / h, 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.210
 while reaching maximum speeds of 48 km / h. 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.580
 The longest dives reach times of up to 21 minutes and the 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.850
 Fountain created when exhaling shoots up to nine feet high. 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.500
 Blue whales make such a loud noise that they can still be heard 850 km away. 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.600
 The pain threshold of humans is 130 decibels and 150 decibels 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.030
 irreparable damage occurs. 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.200
 A blue whale reaches a whopping 188 decibels.
