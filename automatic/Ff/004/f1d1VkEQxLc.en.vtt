 installed the gentleman I already had 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.340
 installed so I uninstalled for 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.950
 the salah schedule has a lot I do not have 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.110
 need to make this day so the 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.160

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.130
 protected because the used one was up to date 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.520
 again the man starting in 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.760
 the reception power several several 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.260
 windows there first here the state of your 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.239
 club girlfriend real-time protection 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.060
 is activated and I advise you 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.730
 strongly to activate them so the 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.750
 definition of viruses so the updates to 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.900
 day in the heart 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.610
 all the old fartless are put to 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.080
 wholesale day in the options of 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.570
 the analysis you can actually do three 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.620
 years three analyzes one that will 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.380
 fast so she'll check all the 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.040
 all the potential places 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.680
 infected with viruses 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.930
 so it will not analyze all your pc 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.810
 against the options full analysis 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:05.120
 will scan file by file 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.989
 to detect all the viruses that can 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.340
 have on your pc 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:12.110
 so the man doing the analysis 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.349
 fast can take about two hours 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.060
 fifteen complete with me more than 18 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.980
 hours it also depends on performance 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.370
 pc and a plastic is extremely 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:25.760
 fast that I for example him giga 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.050
 of ram goes men were going faster 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.600
 the snow is going to be faster than 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:34.340
 testicle only 1 giga g so me 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.800
 it's 17 hours, but it's analyzed as 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.280
 all cahuzac files had his pc 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.139
 docu the two million files and 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.510
 of course and to customize it for 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.880
 customize it is the analysis that the 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.160
 records you analyze it so if you 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.430
 think that a folder has been affected by 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.040
 a virus can have you can analyze 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.639
 that this folder then the details of 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.840
 the nisa 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:01.820
 so you do not need to h 15 be 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.700
 you who do a quicko alive 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.850
 complete so every every 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.590
 Sundays at about 2 am 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.539
 a quick scan is going to be going to be 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.969
 done but safe if your computer 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:16.899
 is on 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:17.949
 or on standby at the club it will be done 

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:20.189
 automatically 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:23.529
 you can of course change the 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:25.779
 planning the analysis and yes so 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:27.699
 there you can see if fast analysis 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:30.489
 complete so I advise you a 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:32.769
 quick analysis it takes a lot less 

00:05:30.489 --> 00:05:34.869
 of time wants to choose your day so 

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:37.119
 once a week or so every 

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:40.749
 days and time you want 

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:43.899
 whether it's done so there you can 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:45.879
 you are not really obliging the 

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:47.139
 all that is blue does not touch him 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:49.779
 I do not advise you not to touch 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:52.749
 appears limitation of use of him 

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:54.969
 so this is your memory your ram so 

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:56.889
 he will accuse half of this drama if 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:06:00.699
 you see that you have a very pc 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:03.159
 performant want to put 100% or so 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:04.029
 your pc boys of a more wants to put that 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:09.039
 this month 10% 

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:10.809
 of course be a little slower so 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:13.089
 the protection in real time I you 

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:15.069
 strongly advises active and why 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:18.459
 every time you settle in 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:19.959
 example of programs you change a 

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:22.089
 folder where does not matter in our 

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:23.860
 program so will be analyzed quickly 

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:26.800
 making power if there is not a virus 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:31.349
 who got involved so we action by 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.349
 defect you absolutely touch nothing 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.850

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.990
 options the analysis 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.120
 I strongly advise you to do 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.950
