00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.509
 and good to everyone here you are comment 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:06.729
 media I bring white gameplay 2 and 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:10.120
 As you are watching, I will use the 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:11.320
 sat is a huge machine gun and 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.630
 Well the truth is that I have not 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.160
 used in the blog is used a 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.290
 little but nothing is uploaded 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.470
 gameplay and I'll explain why 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.810
 because it really kills a lot comes out 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.690
 super good but I'll tell you why 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.920
 no no rent does not make more or less a 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.930
 little as with the snipers not to 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.310
 the time to play that pass you can kill 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.800
 very much with good sniper you 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.659
 you can go kill but of course in what way 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.760
 of the game enough to play domain where 

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:38.769
 but the flags come out to you 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.019
 cost you your life to get you out of going spurts 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:42.550
 to play low forgiveness confirmed where are you going 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:46.149
 attended by the plates with this weapon 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.239
 that is by ethical top that has worked 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.010
 you are going to go to vigo you are going to look for and 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.269
 destroy where just back there rent 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.819
 that ranch jail or that is absurd 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.339
 and very many one against one thing that you 

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:59.049
 you're going to go pretty bad or that is or 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:00.670
 you play everything by teams or more or less is 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.219
 that you will not be profitable because you have 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.989
 that go for the goal and you can not with 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.850
 a gun that does not get a shotgun 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.400
 and an assault rifle 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.890
 it's the only thing I do not get like that 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.900
 It hinders you from having something that is going 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.369
 give you more points by pull far shot 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.540
 for example a suggestion that I 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.090
 it just happened we saw it silly 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.780
 but good eye at the moment I see this I'm going 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.520
 to recharge and attentive to one another by 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.320
 here I say my mother how does this load me 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.940
 I'm 20 and I'm bloated and it turns out they were 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.680
 appearing all there had left a 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.880
 time and why then because it is 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.799
 working because my colleague was here 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.539
 in our respawn with the shotgun in 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.610
 middle of the largest map on the map of 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.960
 game and you put that one escopetilla in 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.490
 a place where there is nobody and that's why 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.720
 they were all in the other 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.909
 point then I would kill them and follow 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.310
 going out or going down three or four 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.470
 varas of will be another point on the map since 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.640
 you see what this weapon goes but 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.119
 Well could you explain a little bit like 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.369
 been my setup good as I created the 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.640
 class and good basically my goal 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.409
 was to stay on the field is not the only 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.600
 what can you do with this weapon or go move 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.069
 of a site compare you move from the site 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.770
 that's why I put the betis and others but 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:07.450
 good as you see during the others 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.690
 running for each other I run like a 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.950
 unstitched and on top I also run with 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.840
 these goods with tucci machine gun 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.209
 ximos since I finish the character 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.090
 but good the case is what leads to 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.280
 essential hardness because you always go 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.450
 to start shooting after eye here has 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:29.019
 killed 123 this is encouraged 4 my mother 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.549
 it started coming that has been here good to 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.190
 see if he could tell us the class the 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.569
 class I was wearing as you are watching 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.739
 came to hardness because always more 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.680
 start shooting later is a weapon 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.790
 super slow so it's super necessary 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.140
 because he's going to start shooting later 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.569
 is going to be shooting you then you have 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.970
 let's say hold if he took the gun 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.190
 is the most logical thing so for that reason 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.290
 hardness after taking the guys and then 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.970
 also grip to still be more 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.760
 precise that without a rule unless the weapon does not 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.610
 was objective was simply because 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.590
 if there was one he killed it is not saying is not 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.269
 to one you have to die was basically 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.829
 my goal then why I put myself 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.420
 all these things besides that you 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.610
 escapes is shooting because I put myself 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.290
 bullets the point jacketed for that makes 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.390
 more harm then what I did was 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.160
 directly see someone well 6 for 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.750
 on top of this map that you are going to see now 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.310
 for example the clearest example to 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.690
 through all the veneers through 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.519
 practically everything we go that are the 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.830
 rocks because you can hurt through 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.710
 giving something that as you are going to see comes 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:27.520
 because here this looks one I say there 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:29.230
 point to the head another forgiveness there and I 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.660
 I see that there is another one if I say yes 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.490
 subo me the Balearic is going to jump over here 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.770
 up then so it had covers 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.450
 things finished the shadow and killed him 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.670
 It would be just that there was another more 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.200
 up here in fact I say it but not 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.730
 I knew exactly where I was then 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.860
 that's why I stayed a little longer here 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.870
 waiting to see if we went to the day I think 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.570
 with which I am shot and knows where it is 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.010
 I do not know a bit like feeling the ground 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.780
 because he was all the enemies in another 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.370
 point and you showed that I do not for 9 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.380
 I put in but he had taken me off 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.480
 dexterity that never took away my dexterity 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.910
 as a third advantage and it was simply 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.530
 that's why extra is for what 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.180
 I bring why I want skills and I 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.530
 I'm going to stay still in one place was more 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.540
 or less my goal but then you see that 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.400
 how another example kicks me is that 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.140
 just that low there comes to me 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.690
 it comes perfect go to get 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.220
 get me out on Monday like this already already 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.380
 I was grown before I was coming 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.540
 above imagine now with Monday to 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.019
 Well, I'm launching, you see, like Kiko, 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.019
 disjointed 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.659
 just killed that they start to 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:28.240
 reappear me to my right I have an uncle 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:30.009
 underneath as you are seeing there and eye to 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.870
 This response just appears to me 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.419
 I kill him on the side and I go running 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.340
 I have clouds when I'm sorry I'm going 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.250
 running running running takes longer 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.460
 a streak of 15 casualties with the weapon or 10 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.080
 an exaggerated thing and here has been when 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.550
 I do not know I did not think I had killed 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.639
 so much this fact has not been great 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.319
 thing but just put me this month 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.789
 finish the dogs and the game was 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:53.319
 practically done studying I've 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.389
 put swarm because for this bird 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:56.650
 well, imagine, but obviously not 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.020
 was starting to play this map was 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.430
 thinking a map like yemen that goes super 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.659
 good for this type of weapons charge goes 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.610
 super good because there are lots of badges and 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:06.310
 You can go through them and also have 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.650
 super good slums in the middle area and 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.479
 it's something that was documented in that 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.009
 bulletproof fence that is what I wear 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.659
 they are going to be able to kill us because 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.340
 you are going to be in a place you are going to have 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.810
 all the advantages are not going to be able to kill 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.060
 to grenades because you wear a vest or 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.379
 it is practically impossible to kill them 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.909
 it's not the one that you make it a 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:24.009
 I miss you so good there are you see 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:25.479
 38-1 that the dogs end up nailing me I'm going 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:26.580
 to use a little more the what to be 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.779
 that is 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.569
 Maybe the truth and all I had 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:34.110
 Done as 20 or 30 casualties 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:36.330
 myself my age pulling with the skull 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.250
 mother over me has been but this that 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.960
 he has put game over and a week without 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.000
 play action so good nothing I hope 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.530
 what do you like if you have to go play 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.330
 right now it means that I have done it 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.100
 well if you keep going out wanting 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.950
 play it like it does not mean that the limit 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.630
 it's been good to forgive my voice so 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.890
 I hope just to the video that later you know us 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.890
 we see in the next goodbye
