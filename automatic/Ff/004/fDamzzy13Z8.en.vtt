00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.649
 hello hello here is me up again 

00:00:02.239 --> 00:00:06.190
 a bio cook we make one today 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:06.190
 pear did 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.570
 for this we need first of all shows 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.539
 that means fed butter or margarine ever 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.740
 whether it's vegan market or otherwise 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.840
 sugar flour the simplest recipe many 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.130
 Recipes is one that does not have to be in there 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.960
 as I said this is the great one 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.280
 Advantage then we need pear family 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.450
 actually know only as lemon juice 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.660
 be frozen 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.030
 and again a lot of powdered sugar who likes 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.910
 is still a bit to re 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.650
 optional yes most of you do 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.210
 Besides the machine is completely right 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.000
 dangerous it shows that it too 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.550
 really others go by hand 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.480
 conditions the marine is soft 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:04.190
 sugar could also be from brother 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.150
 be sugar but I always like to 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:14.440
 brown cane sugar 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:14.440
 I can easily admit several media 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.250
 that you can score spelled flour though 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.920
 of course, be wheat flour that is 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.920
 not so important now 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:52.409
 press earlier 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:53.579
 really on the back of 70 sprinkles what 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:07.409
 we do here is nothing else 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:10.190
 push on street and he's done 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.079
 then three times is true in the refrigerator 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.799
 during the dough the fridge me the 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.569
 Citizen now before 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.120
 For that you have to bowl first with something 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.590
 water in it bit of lemon juice 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:27.450
 just so that they brown very quickly this 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:28.700
 be logically and bio lemon everything 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.700
 purely 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.680
 the citizens peel normally 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.700
 you do not always have to miss one 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.380
 little matter of taste 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.060
 for cake cellist because some some 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.780
 pear varieties leave a bit hard 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:49.310
 That 's why I recommend it when 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.090
 they only briefly guard masterfully with flag 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.120
 mozart is already a few minutes 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.349
 run longer 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.889
 that can be quite unattractive then 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.889
 they also hold 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:12.060
 peel and peel in normal 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.260
 cutting pieces 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:20.109
 I 'm doing a lot of it first has 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:22.629
 a bit like the pears are now 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.579
 peeled so they now see one too 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:26.379
 You can bang the dough before you can 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.790
 Well , he got out again, he only knows 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.459
 a quarter of an hour in most 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.690
 Recipes is an hour honest 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.359
 sometimes you think the writing is all 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.450
 from each other that is in the case 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.319
 really still full of cake 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.920
 given now simply in such a 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.389
 classic French did form 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.859
 we do not want to clean up 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:48.670
 simply presses herself into the woman on the rhine 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:51.250
 as it needs if it sticks a bit 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:56.889
 with the ball of your hand and bit 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:04:07.599
 flour we push the lips handball in 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:10.530
 the desired shape thumb here 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.530
 you get really cool rheine 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.340
 the beautiful thing about this one 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.550
 French cake molds is that one 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.490
 they do not need to evaluate the glue 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.789
 actually, I do not roubini anything 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.789
 happens 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:40.870
 you can see the recipe pretty much 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:45.150
 why not quite up to the edge of years 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.150
 high that burns me up the hand 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:05:01.330
 about on a height have okay 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.479
 completely now the pear from the water 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.479
 Out 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.259
 my hands away 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:27.679
 then 

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:32.509
 the spiced with man as said works 

00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:48.049
 cinnamon and the already give butter 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:53.199
 Of course , sugar is also added 

00:05:48.049 --> 00:05:55.699
 take the hands and then we put the 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:59.629
 have these little awesome ones 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:02.199
 Ground vanilla is race 

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:09.499
 would look similar now as I said 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:12.369
 and then this is just a simple one 

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:16.909
 nice nice picture of cures 

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:19.099
 so it just looks great second 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:22.909
 layer here you overlap your son completely 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:25.899
 important so easily we overrun 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:25.899
 have enough on it 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:42.230
 the conclusion also here then again 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:46.240
 Overlap that one gets 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.240
 little bit does not start so easy 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:57.410
 ok now the whole thing again 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:07:01.190
 puderzucker stopped thereby get 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.840
 a nice caramel education needs 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.970
 Of course , that's great 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.860
 rehearse 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.540
 but it's also delicious and then it works 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.450
 the first time with two degrees in the 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.520
 preheated oven 

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.230
 The pears did a lot of first 20 minutes 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.130
 in the oven 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.440
 then I have some powdered sugar 

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:21.140
 once turned off and then again five 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.850
 minutes readjusted to 22 degrees increases 

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.350
 with it for the nice point 

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.760
 women's promotion have this 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.770
 caramelized things the picture 

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.150
 Of course, the soil is delicious 

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.490
 That's why I'm leaving channel now 

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:36.070
 Just like that tastes with both 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:39.190
 Cream with ice or nature just like it 

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:41.480
