this<00:01:16.010> all<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.280> way<00:01:16.460> around<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:16.970> top

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.310 

you

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.020 

once<00:01:29.860> you're<00:01:30.070> done<00:01:30.190> with<00:01:30.310> that<00:01:30.370> you<00:01:30.640> just<00:01:30.670> want

once you're done with that you just want

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.910 
once you're done with that you just want
to<00:01:31.060> take<00:01:31.270> thread<00:01:31.660> and<00:01:31.930> you<00:01:32.170> just<00:01:32.350> want<00:01:32.530> to<00:01:32.590> pull

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
to take thread and you just want to pull

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.100 
to take thread and you just want to pull
it<00:01:33.100> and<00:01:33.340> this<00:01:33.970> will<00:01:34.150> cause<00:01:34.360> the<00:01:34.630> top<00:01:34.840> to

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
it and this will cause the top to

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.050 
it and this will cause the top to
scrunch<00:01:35.440> up<00:01:35.620> and<00:01:36.010> make<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.430> hole<00:01:36.670> a<00:01:36.850> lot

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
scrunch up and make the hole a lot

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.380 
scrunch up and make the hole a lot
smaller<00:01:37.450> now<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:39.340> is<00:01:39.490> when<00:01:39.700> you<00:01:39.880> will<00:01:40.360> take

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
smaller now this is when you will take

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.780 
smaller now this is when you will take
your<00:01:40.900> polyfill<00:01:41.650> and<00:01:41.920> you<00:01:42.130> are<00:01:42.250> going<00:01:42.460> to<00:01:42.610> try

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
your polyfill and you are going to try

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.730 
your polyfill and you are going to try
to<00:01:42.820> stuff<00:01:43.180> as<00:01:43.360> much<00:01:43.600> as<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:43.900> can<00:01:44.140> into<00:01:44.410> the

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
to stuff as much as you can into the

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.420 
to stuff as much as you can into the
strawberry

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
strawberry

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.370 
strawberry
if<00:01:46.030> you<00:01:46.180> don't<00:01:46.360> stuff<00:01:46.600> enough<00:01:46.900> it's<00:01:47.110> going<00:01:47.320> to

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
if you don't stuff enough it's going to

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.350 
if you don't stuff enough it's going to
turn<00:01:47.530> out<00:01:47.590> really<00:01:47.950> lumpy<00:01:48.370> and<00:01:48.820> it's<00:01:49.000> not<00:01:49.180> going

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
turn out really lumpy and it's not going

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.330 
turn out really lumpy and it's not going
to<00:01:49.450> hold<00:01:49.510> its<00:01:49.720> shape<00:01:49.780> and<00:01:50.170> then<00:01:50.860> you<00:01:50.979> just<00:01:51.160> want

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
to hold its shape and then you just want

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.950 
to hold its shape and then you just want
to<00:01:51.400> tighten<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:51.880> thread<00:01:52.090> even<00:01:52.240> more<00:01:52.570> to<00:01:52.750> close

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
to tighten the thread even more to close

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.100 
to tighten the thread even more to close
the<00:01:53.140> hole<00:01:53.320> in<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:53.530> top<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:55.000> once<00:01:55.810> you're<00:01:55.960> done

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
the hole in the top and once you're done

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.020 
the hole in the top and once you're done
you<00:01:56.290> just<00:01:56.350> want<00:01:56.500> to<00:01:56.680> tie<00:01:56.979> it<00:01:57.040> and<00:01:57.370> then<00:01:57.400> just

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
you just want to tie it and then just

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.430 
you just want to tie it and then just
cut<00:01:58.270> off<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.570> extra<00:01:58.900> and<00:02:01.050> this<00:02:02.050> is<00:02:02.170> what<00:02:02.290> your

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
cut off the extra and this is what your

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.249 
cut off the extra and this is what your
strawberry<00:02:02.920> should<00:02:03.100> look<00:02:03.280> like<00:02:03.690> now<00:02:04.690> just<00:02:05.020> cut

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
strawberry should look like now just cut

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.140 
strawberry should look like now just cut
out<00:02:05.380> a<00:02:05.410> leaf<00:02:05.830> shape<00:02:05.860> for<00:02:06.369> the<00:02:06.430> strawberry<00:02:06.910> and

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
out a leaf shape for the strawberry and

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.870 
out a leaf shape for the strawberry and
adding<00:02:07.570> a<00:02:07.810> figure<00:02:08.770> thread<00:02:09.220> through<00:02:09.729> the

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
adding a figure thread through the

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.400 
adding a figure thread through the
middle<00:02:09.910> because<00:02:10.570> I<00:02:10.600> wanted<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:10.929> make<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.110> loop

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
middle because I wanted to make a loop

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.440 
middle because I wanted to make a loop
so<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:11.650> couldn't<00:02:11.920> be<00:02:12.040> able<00:02:12.160> to<00:02:12.430> hook<00:02:13.000> this<00:02:13.240> onto

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
so I couldn't be able to hook this onto

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.000 
so I couldn't be able to hook this onto
something<00:02:13.840> else

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.680 

now<00:02:17.010> just<00:02:17.310> glue<00:02:17.550> on<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.850> leaf<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.330> you're

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
now just glue on the leaf and you're

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.870 
now just glue on the leaf and you're
done
