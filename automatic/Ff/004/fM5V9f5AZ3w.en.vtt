00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.530
 I have this mini tutorial for 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:14.240
 teach them how to design a map for 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:21.350
 minecraft 1.7 can be 17.21 can 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:24.440
 do a 2.41 point 7.5 but they told me 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.320
 which for 17 points to map non - Serbs 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.280
 I had too much fuks but and it was more 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.280
 advisable to play it in our world 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.280
 4.5 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.690
 in the description that they will give to 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.000
 all are going to start 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.640
 download and after that they will 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.120
 stay this 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.120
 this file is actor to extract here 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:02.840
 to see here because it was extracted would not put 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.840
 and you want a folder like that 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.329
 and good the folder brings the map 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.179
 rights because the map is not mine 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:14.179
 obviously they did not and the rules 

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:16.670
 of the game good very several standards and 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:19.399
 advice that gives the same game then 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.520
 well this is better to play better and 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:25.039
 it frees you to be more fun machine 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.640
 Well now what you are going to do is enter 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:34.330
 to get this out we get role play 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.330
 and now entrance percent to my life 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.760
 they have made to point minecraft they are going to 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.320
 go to the folder you know 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.930
 there are the west maps 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.030
 and they're going to grab the western and they're going to 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.240
 leave in 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.350
 and well this writer installation nothing 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.509
 more there is no science is that and good now 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.259

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.270
 Well, the bag is very creative because 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.100

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.100

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.450
 why not 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.150

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.840
 case as the information 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.840
 after the rover 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.230
 well we have to go the map of 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.230
 desert 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.460
 but I can not find it uncle 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.450

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:44.819
 when stealing stones 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.819
 It's the first bar where I have to come 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.970
 and then it's configured to cause 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.470
 low amateur level in the aris track 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.710
 I do not know what happen to me though 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.880
 wonder 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:06.200

 and that has definitely brought us 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:31.600
 but they are things that we have to Pakistan 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.500
 and good depends on the difficulty 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.740
