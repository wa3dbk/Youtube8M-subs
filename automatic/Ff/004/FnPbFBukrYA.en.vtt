00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:23.379 
baby yeah I things moving in there and

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:24.869 
baby yeah I things moving in there and
this<00:03:23.560> is<00:03:23.709> what's<00:03:23.859> going<00:03:24.099> on<00:03:24.250> is<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:24.639> about

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
this is what's going on is it about

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.240 
this is what's going on is it about
these<00:03:25.150> like<00:03:25.389> big<00:03:25.599> chunks<00:03:26.079> that<00:03:26.290> just<00:03:27.040> aren't

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
these like big chunks that just aren't

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.970 
these like big chunks that just aren't
and<00:03:27.459> then<00:03:27.549> the<00:03:27.639> rest<00:03:27.760> of<00:03:27.910> this<00:03:28.000> isn't<00:03:28.359> really

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
and then the rest of this isn't really

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.110 
and then the rest of this isn't really
maybe<00:03:29.980> kick<00:03:30.220> it<00:03:30.370> out<00:03:30.459> and<00:03:30.609> then<00:03:30.639> just<00:03:30.879> put<00:03:31.030> the

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
maybe kick it out and then just put the

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.400 
maybe kick it out and then just put the
big<00:03:31.299> chunk<00:03:31.540> for<00:03:31.750> themselves<00:03:32.109> I<00:03:37.410> actually

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
big chunk for themselves I actually

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.050 
big chunk for themselves I actually
think<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:38.859> the<00:03:39.010> celery<00:03:39.370> should<00:03:39.699> cook<00:03:39.910> a

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
think that the celery should cook a

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.759 
think that the celery should cook a
little<00:03:40.209> bit<00:03:40.299> longer<00:03:40.540> before<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:41.379> cauliflower

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
little bit longer before the cauliflower

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.610 
little bit longer before the cauliflower
in<00:03:42.069> here<00:03:42.540> so<00:03:43.540> I'm<00:03:43.930> gonna<00:03:44.049> let<00:03:44.199> that<00:03:44.379> happen

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
in here so I'm gonna let that happen

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.830 
in here so I'm gonna let that happen
it's<00:03:45.370> supposed<00:03:45.489> to<00:03:45.639> be<00:03:45.699> so<00:03:46.299> let<00:03:46.449> us<00:03:46.629> become

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
it's supposed to be so let us become

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.619 
it's supposed to be so let us become
soft<00:03:47.349> and<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.829> still<00:03:48.190> doesn't<00:03:49.180> seem<00:03:49.449> quite

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
soft and it still doesn't seem quite

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.729 
soft and it still doesn't seem quite
there<00:03:49.930> yet<00:03:52.169> you<00:03:53.169> got<00:03:53.290> some<00:03:53.470> cauliflower

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
there yet you got some cauliflower

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
because your cauliflower bridges kind of

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.590 
because your cauliflower bridges kind of
spread<00:05:54.060> to<00:05:54.240> me<00:05:55.280> you<00:05:56.280> know<00:05:56.400> sorry<00:05:56.970> it<00:05:57.210> has<00:05:57.360> more

spread to me you know sorry it has more

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.270 
spread to me you know sorry it has more
flavor<00:05:57.870> and<00:05:58.290> texture<00:05:58.620> than<00:05:58.920> I<00:05:58.980> thought<00:05:59.220> it

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
flavor and texture than I thought it

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.480 
flavor and texture than I thought it
would<00:05:59.520> have<00:05:59.850> yeah<00:06:00.360> um<00:06:00.630> and

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.670 

I<00:06:04.580> know<00:06:05.300> it's<00:06:05.539> awesome<00:06:05.930> I<00:06:06.110> think<00:06:06.440> this<00:06:06.530> would

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
like it could be a meal if you add like

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.430 
like it could be a meal if you add like
a<00:06:12.349> salad<00:06:12.830> next<00:06:13.099> to<00:06:13.370> it<00:06:13.490> really<00:06:14.090> yeah<00:06:14.509> more

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
a salad next to it really yeah more

really good I think I would actually
make<00:06:31.250> this<00:06:31.430> it's<00:06:31.729> like<00:06:31.880> just<00:06:32.330> just<00:06:32.599> for<00:06:32.750> a<00:06:32.810> meal

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
make this it's like just just for a meal

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:43.789 
you know the cauliflower i think what i

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:45.159 
you know the cauliflower i think what i
was<00:06:43.940> saying<00:06:44.090> before<00:06:44.150> is<00:06:44.509> right<00:06:44.720> i<00:06:44.750> think<00:06:45.050> it's

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:45.169 
was saying before is right i think it's

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:47.589 
was saying before is right i think it's
not<00:06:45.349> it's<00:06:45.889> not<00:06:46.009> it's<00:06:46.130> not<00:06:46.610> a<00:06:47.030> vegetable<00:06:47.300> that

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:47.599 
not it's not it's not a vegetable that

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:50.020 
not it's not it's not a vegetable that
has<00:06:47.840> a<00:06:47.870> strong<00:06:48.409> flavor<00:06:48.740> which<00:06:49.460> makes<00:06:49.729> it<00:06:49.880> a

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
has a strong flavor which makes it a

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.930 
has a strong flavor which makes it a
good<00:06:50.330> sort<00:06:50.690> of<00:06:50.780> base<00:06:51.050> for<00:06:51.440> things<00:06:51.680> i<00:06:52.069> would<00:06:52.669> say

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:52.940 
good sort of base for things i would say

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.110 
good sort of base for things i would say
that<00:06:53.289> most<00:06:54.289> likely<00:06:54.530> every<00:06:55.370> recipe<00:06:55.669> that<00:06:56.090> I

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 
that most likely every recipe that I

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.719 
that most likely every recipe that I
would<00:06:56.449> normally<00:06:56.750> put<00:06:57.199> some<00:06:57.979> rice<00:06:58.159> with<00:06:58.430> I

00:06:58.719 --> 00:06:58.729 
would normally put some rice with I

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:00.370 
would normally put some rice with I
