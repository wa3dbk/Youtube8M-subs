00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:05.549
 I have two some time ago 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.810
 the videos uploaded in one 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.130
 particular area the differences of 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.690
 shows today and earlier among others 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.010
 also about the childhood i already had 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.540
 longer before more videos about this 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.740
 have to create a topic, however 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.000
 we always have a little bit of the topics 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.310
 but now it is finally me 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.840
 i also wanted youtube 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.250
 Thank you to me that my channel 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.449
 Ideas arrive so well with you 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.920
 I am glad to see that it is you 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.449
 entertains toddlers to get ready 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.099
 However, that is not the sense of mine 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.689
 That's why there is a channel today 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.550
 something else maybe i will soon 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.779
 also try three videos a week 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.219
 to bring out or 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.170
 the third always when I go over 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.489
 but any topic would like to speak that 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.500
 will we see then we catch 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.180
 first on youtube there since 2006 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.350
 At that time it was a small platform where 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.210
 you upload your holiday videos 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.890
 could or as a hobby youtuber small 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.750
 It was as good as it was then 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.010
 not for money or success but rather 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.180
 to have fun with the matter 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.860
 Of course, there were already at that time 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.629
 people that were merely concerned with success 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.280
 but these were very different from today 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.920
 rare people as its the jupa 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.690
 really the exception but what is today 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.129
 today it is exactly the other way around 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.629
 almost only people who are always full 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.280
 Clicks and money are rare 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.780
 someone the videos just for fun 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.040
 Power and not with the background 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.630
 someday more famous by 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.220
 So many will go in there too 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.750
 youtube networks I've been to 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.460
 media force video said what i mean by 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.479
 That's why I think 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.310
 not here again 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.750
 But they are just scanning networks 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.520
 show that many people no longer 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.170
 the fun with the videos is what I am 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.790
 personally really a pity youtube 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.049
 is getting more professional it is not 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.759
 more just just the platform where you are 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.290
 just upload it to his video it is 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.090
 I became a real business 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.770
 personally very skeptical viewed at 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.150
 the lurid video titles the people 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.710
 how to use lew people you realize 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.939
 Of course, so many of you 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.250
 clicks and thereby also get money 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.780
 want as possible a plane zb says 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.159
 then again in a video that 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.630
 You do not deserve that much 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.250
 Like everyone else, I can say now 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.899
 of course only speak for me though 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.220
 if i have my earned adsense money 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.930
 with the clicks and so on high 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.460
 would count on what the bloody has 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.960
 holla the waldfee I need but 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.520
 no more job even if I then 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.380
 also the top tax rate and all 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.060
 Deductions in the head down still reckons 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.619
 enough money left over so I do not say that 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.570
 youtuber for clean does not have to 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.579
 much as far as I know media power looks 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.000
 So, 50 percent off the revenue so dear 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.280
 plan 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.479
 You have to say youtuber in medias power 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.369
 do not earn as much money as everyone 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.110
 I personally had this whole 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.310
 commercialization of youtube because of that 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.050
 I am also a thin one 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.370
 we live in a fucking network 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.930
 I would do my videos 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.610
 only because I enjoy it 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.230
 of course that's a puff if one 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.000
 subscribers or you get a lot of money 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.680
 But deserves something like that in my opinion 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 after not standing in the first place looks 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.560
 you look at the big youtubers in 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.060
 germany so you can see it as well 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.790
 with Germany always further down 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.410
 is pleased that our youtube picture 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.000
 rtl crime and 100 others have all 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.500
 same childish numbers as people 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.120
 did and the steal any facts 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.739
 from the internet julians block starts 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.730
 some disabled rap battle and 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.800
 earned by five percent 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.360
 own money 100% money albert or 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.950
 just old jokes from the 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.690
 Internet cloud and there is always 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.860
 more eight to twelve year olds begin 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.480
 to rotate youtube videos 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.799
 in addition there are many of the big ones 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.880
 youtuber a disabled let's play 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.920
 can then have with her convulsively 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.750
 try to increase their adsense one 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.190
 Needless as anything else understand anyway 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.690
 not who is one at all 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.130
 I also do not understand 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.810
 why it's almost exclusively kids on 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.950
 youtube were two to four years ago 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.450
 youtuber like being in the her 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.250
 naturally start celebrating something only 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.780
 12 to 14 years old dirty children so 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.880
 are the former tracks children 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.440
 today between 14 and 18 but somehow 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.150
 Nowhere do I see people at the end 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.650
 your puberty are when you look up 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.079
 youtube searches clicks you mostly see 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.850
 only people like youtube but normal 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.799
 youtube user are rarely seen except 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.970
 of course, under my video leaves media 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.620
 power this person maybe 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.299
 switch off because they simply do not 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.769
 you want to fit more in your program 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.660
 prevent one of the persons 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.640
 maybe know meters of force destroyed 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.440
 she a secret prophecy of the 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.299
 youtube messias also understands and media 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.370
 force an end and that's why 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.140
 Any person over the age of 14 is from 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.850
 lets ban youtube we can only 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.980
 hope that myths file with this 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.980
 exciting theme deals with cage
