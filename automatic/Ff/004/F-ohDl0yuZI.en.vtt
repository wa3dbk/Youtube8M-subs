one<00:01:12.860> of<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.039> problems<00:01:13.399> with<00:01:13.460> doing<00:01:13.700> this<00:01:14.000> is

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.329 
one of the problems with doing this is

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:16.149 
one of the problems with doing this is
the<00:01:14.509> fish<00:01:14.719> fights<00:01:15.049> harder<00:01:15.500> and<00:01:15.649> longer<00:01:15.799> and

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
the fish fights harder and longer and

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.560 
the fish fights harder and longer and
it's<00:01:16.340> more<00:01:16.490> likely<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:16.939> wear<00:01:17.149> through<00:01:17.420> the

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
it's more likely to wear through the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.050 
it's more likely to wear through the
trace<00:01:17.810> with<00:01:18.110> its<00:01:18.259> teeth<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:18.799> this<00:01:19.729> can<00:01:19.939> lead

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
trace with its teeth and this can lead

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.450 
trace with its teeth and this can lead
to<00:01:20.119> loss<00:01:20.420> fish<00:01:20.750> then<00:01:21.649> this<00:01:21.799> fish<00:01:22.070> wasn't<00:01:22.340> going

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
to loss fish then this fish wasn't going

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.429 
to loss fish then this fish wasn't going
to<00:01:22.520> be<00:01:22.610> lost<00:01:22.850> however<00:01:23.060> after<00:01:23.750> a<00:01:23.990> little<00:01:24.200> advice
