00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
with Bill and I am actually more of a

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.160 
with Bill and I am actually more of a
fan<00:02:06.110> of<00:02:06.140> Geno's<00:02:07.009> I<00:02:07.430> don't<00:02:08.420> know<00:02:08.569> something

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170

about<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.590> way<00:02:09.679> Geno's<00:02:10.100> does<00:02:10.369> it<00:02:10.610> their<00:02:10.759> bread

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
about the way Geno's does it their bread

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.860 
about the way Geno's does it their bread
is<00:02:11.240> a<00:02:11.270> little<00:02:12.080> less<00:02:12.350> sturdy<00:02:13.060> but<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:14.390> don't<00:02:14.690> know

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.809 
I think it's easier when you get a
mostly<00:02:17.090> bread<00:02:17.540> bite
