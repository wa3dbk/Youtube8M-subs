okay<00:00:00.989> so<00:00:01.380> in<00:00:01.829> this<00:00:02.040> video<00:00:02.250> I'm<00:00:02.879> going<00:00:03.389> to<00:00:03.510> be

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:04.520 
okay so in this video I'm going to be

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.579 
okay so in this video I'm going to be
using<00:00:05.520> solar<00:00:05.879> fires<00:00:06.240> very<00:00:06.660> useful<00:00:07.080> animate

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
using solar fires very useful animate

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.759 
using solar fires very useful animate
feature<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:08.960> animate<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.080> chart<00:00:10.320> in<00:00:10.440> order<00:00:10.530> to

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
feature to animate the chart in order to

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.379 
feature to animate the chart in order to
demonstrate<00:00:10.950> what<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.910> difference<00:00:12.240> is

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
demonstrate what the difference is

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.299 
demonstrate what the difference is
between<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.809> daytime<00:00:13.230> chart<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.799> what<00:00:14.219> the

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
between the daytime chart and what the

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.960 
between the daytime chart and what the
difference<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.730> between<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:15.059> nighttime<00:00:15.299> chart

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
difference is between a nighttime chart

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.359 
difference is between a nighttime chart
basically<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:18.630> chart<00:00:18.960> we've<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.340> a

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
basically in this chart we've this is a

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.800 
basically in this chart we've this is a
normal<00:00:20.699> chart<00:00:20.970> I've<00:00:21.119> just<00:00:21.270> taken<00:00:21.570> out<00:00:21.660> all<00:00:21.750> of

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
normal chart I've just taken out all of

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.560 
normal chart I've just taken out all of
the<00:00:21.930> houses<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.439> all<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.650> can<00:00:22.800> see<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.010> the

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
the houses and all you can see is the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.769 
the houses and all you can see is the
ascendant<00:00:24.570> descendant<00:00:25.080> axis<00:00:26.689> so<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
ascendant descendant axis so the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.359 
ascendant descendant axis so the
ascendant<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.260> over<00:00:28.470> here<00:00:28.590> on<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.740> left<00:00:28.890> this

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
ascendant is over here on the left this

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.220 
ascendant is over here on the left this
is<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.580> eastern<00:00:30.210> horizon<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.960> then<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
is the eastern horizon and then the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.920 
is the eastern horizon and then the
descendant<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.040> over<00:00:32.279> here<00:00:32.430> on<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.610> right<00:00:32.930> I

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
descendant is over here on the right I

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.290 
descendant is over here on the right I
have<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.710> chart<00:00:35.010> set<00:00:35.250> for<00:00:35.460> today<00:00:35.670> June<00:00:36.030> 9th

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
have this chart set for today June 9th

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.830 
have this chart set for today June 9th
2010<00:00:37.280> at<00:00:38.280> about<00:00:38.520> 450<00:00:39.300> 5:00<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.750> morning

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
2010 at about 450 5:00 in the morning

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.729 
2010 at about 450 5:00 in the morning
here<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.500> Denver<00:00:40.829> Colorado<00:00:41.750> now<00:00:42.750> right<00:00:43.620> now

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
here in Denver Colorado now right now

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.670 
here in Denver Colorado now right now
the<00:00:43.800> Sun<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.539> just<00:00:45.539> below<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.050> ax<00:00:46.079> descendants

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
the Sun is just below the ax descendants

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.250 
the Sun is just below the ax descendants
so<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.010> actually<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.550> before<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.690> rose<00:00:48.960> in

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
so it's actually just before it rose in

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.810 
so it's actually just before it rose in
the<00:00:49.350> morning<00:00:49.770> at<00:00:49.920> about<00:00:49.980> 5:00<00:00:50.309> o'clock<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
the morning at about 5:00 o'clock in the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.569 
the morning at about 5:00 o'clock in the
morning<00:00:51.239> now<00:00:52.140> what<00:00:52.860> I'm<00:00:52.949> going<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.100> do<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.430> I'm

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
morning now what I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.430 
morning now what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.760> start<00:00:54.120> animating<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.809> chart<00:00:55.110> and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
going to start animating the chart and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.350 
going to start animating the chart and
you<00:00:55.770> can<00:00:55.920> actually<00:00:56.010> what<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.940> see<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.329> that

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
you can actually what you see is that

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.510 
you can actually what you see is that
when<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.719> move<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.469> chart<00:00:58.710> forward<00:00:59.100> by<00:00:59.280> one

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
when you move the chart forward by one

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.429 
when you move the chart forward by one
minute<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:01.460> second<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.879> actually<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:04.320> can

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
minute a second that it actually you can

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.840 
minute a second that it actually you can
actually<00:01:04.470> see<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.979> Sun<00:01:05.129> rising<00:01:05.430> over<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
actually see the Sun rising over the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.730 
actually see the Sun rising over the
horizon<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.600> at<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.780> point<00:01:07.020> where<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.470> Sun

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
horizon so at that point where the Sun

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.090 
horizon so at that point where the Sun
moves<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:09.030> above<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.630> ascendant<00:01:10.590> or<00:01:10.770> just

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
moves just above the ascendant or just

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.370 
moves just above the ascendant or just
above<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.520> ascendant<00:01:11.909> decent<00:01:12.299> axis<00:01:12.689> that's

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
above the ascendant decent axis that's

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.080 
above the ascendant decent axis that's
literally<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.890> Sun<00:01:14.250> rising<00:01:14.790> over<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
literally the Sun rising over the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.840 
literally the Sun rising over the
eastern<00:01:15.450> horizon<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.140> morning<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:17.700> at

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
eastern horizon in the morning and at

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.370 
eastern horizon in the morning and at
that<00:01:18.030> point<00:01:18.299> when<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.570> Sun<00:01:18.750> rises<00:01:19.110> over<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
that point when the Sun rises over the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.039 
that point when the Sun rises over the
horizon<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.890> course<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.340> becomes<00:01:20.400> daytime<00:01:21.150> so

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
horizon of course it becomes daytime so

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.910 
horizon of course it becomes daytime so
at<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.680> point<00:01:23.570> that<00:01:24.570> chart<00:01:24.900> becomes<00:01:25.320> diurnal

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
at that point that chart becomes diurnal

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.210 
at that point that chart becomes diurnal
or<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.250> daytime<00:01:26.850> chart<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.890> then<00:01:28.890> we'll<00:01:29.070> just

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
or a daytime chart and then we'll just

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.100 
or a daytime chart and then we'll just
animate<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.060> move<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.390> chart<00:01:30.630> forward

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
animate it and move the chart forward

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.499 
animate it and move the chart forward
and<00:01:31.290> here<00:01:31.409> we<00:01:31.500> see<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.799> Sun<00:01:32.060> moving<00:01:33.060> during

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
and here we see the Sun moving during

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.609 
and here we see the Sun moving during
the<00:01:33.630> course<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> morning<00:01:34.320> until

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
the course of the morning until

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.450 
the course of the morning until
eventually<00:01:34.920> around<00:01:35.460> midday<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:36.030> culminates

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
eventually around midday it culminates

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.010 
eventually around midday it culminates
where<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.579> directly<00:01:39.030> overhead<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.720> sky

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
where it's directly overhead in the sky

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.499 
where it's directly overhead in the sky
and<00:01:40.350> then<00:01:41.070> eventually<00:01:41.340> as<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.329> goes<00:01:42.479> through

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
and then eventually as it goes through

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.149 
and then eventually as it goes through
the<00:01:42.689> afternoon<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.380> evening<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.950> moves

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
the afternoon and the evening it moves

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.730 
the afternoon and the evening it moves
towards<00:01:44.579> setting<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.229> other<00:01:46.350> side<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.680> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
towards setting on the other side of the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.310 
towards setting on the other side of the
horizon<00:01:47.030> so<00:01:48.030> they're<00:01:48.210> right<00:01:48.869> here<00:01:49.049> what<00:01:49.229> we

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
horizon so they're right here what we

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.499 
horizon so they're right here what we
see<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:49.649> about<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.070> go<00:01:50.250> underneath<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.970> SMN

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
see it's about to go underneath the SMN

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.510 
see it's about to go underneath the SMN
decent<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.020> axis<00:01:52.470> over<00:01:52.649> at<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.920> descendant

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
decent and axis over at the descendant

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.300 
decent and axis over at the descendant
and<00:01:53.729> at<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.450> point<00:01:54.720> when<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.049> Sun<00:01:55.310> goes

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
and at this point when the Sun goes

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.859 
and at this point when the Sun goes
underneath<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.759> descendant<00:01:57.390> it's<00:01:57.570> literally

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
underneath the descendant it's literally

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.380 
underneath the descendant it's literally
setting<00:01:58.350> underneath<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.130> horizon<00:01:59.670> that's

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
setting underneath the horizon that's

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.319 
setting underneath the horizon that's
what's<00:02:00.600> being<00:02:00.780> depicted<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.740> chart<00:02:02.329> and

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
what's being depicted in the chart and

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.719 
what's being depicted in the chart and
at<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.630> point<00:02:04.100> it<00:02:05.100> literally<00:02:05.369> becomes

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
at that point it literally becomes

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.940 
at that point it literally becomes
nighttime<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.689> Sun<00:02:06.960> goes<00:02:07.500> underneath<00:02:07.799> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
nighttime the Sun goes underneath the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.490 
nighttime the Sun goes underneath the
horizon<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.700> thus<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.840> chart<00:02:10.110> becomes

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
horizon and thus the chart becomes

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.490 
horizon and thus the chart becomes
nocturnal<00:02:11.459> or<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> nighttime<00:02:12.120> chart<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:13.470> that

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
nocturnal or a nighttime chart so that

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.650 
nocturnal or a nighttime chart so that
nocturnal<00:02:14.190> sect<00:02:14.489> becomes<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.090> sect<00:02:15.360> that's

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
nocturnal sect becomes the sect that's

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.660 
nocturnal sect becomes the sect that's
in<00:02:15.840> favor

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
in favor

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.369 
in favor
so<00:02:17.670> we'll<00:02:17.819> just<00:02:18.000> animate<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.629> and<00:02:18.780> keep<00:02:19.260> it

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
so we'll just animate it and keep it

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.320 
so we'll just animate it and keep it
moving<00:02:19.560> we<00:02:19.890> see<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.129> Sun<00:02:20.340> moving<00:02:20.370> it's<00:02:21.120> about

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
moving we see the Sun moving it's about

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.000 
moving we see the Sun moving it's about
10<00:02:21.599> 11<00:02:21.750> o'clock<00:02:22.110> at<00:02:22.319> night<00:02:22.349> now<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.709> right

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
10 11 o'clock at night now and right

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.190 
10 11 o'clock at night now and right
around<00:02:23.190> midnight<00:02:23.940> it's<00:02:24.420> at<00:02:24.569> its<00:02:24.720> lowest<00:02:24.959> point

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
around midnight it's at its lowest point

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.280 
around midnight it's at its lowest point
and<00:02:25.770> then<00:02:26.129> eventually<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.670> comes<00:02:26.879> back<00:02:27.090> up<00:02:27.290> the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
and then eventually it comes back up the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.470 
and then eventually it comes back up the
next<00:02:28.319> day<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.739> comes<00:02:29.580> over<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.849> horizon<00:02:30.300> then

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
next day and comes over the horizon then

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.369 
next day and comes over the horizon then
again<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.870> becomes<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.290> diurnal<00:02:31.680> chart<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.930> what

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
again it becomes a diurnal chart so what

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:35.660 
again it becomes a diurnal chart so what
I'm<00:02:34.470> trying<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.739> demonstrate<00:02:34.890> here<00:02:35.250> is<00:02:35.459> just

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
I'm trying to demonstrate here is just

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.479 
I'm trying to demonstrate here is just
that<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:36.140> sect<00:02:37.140> of<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.620> chart<00:02:37.890> is<00:02:38.040> completely

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
that the sect of the chart is completely

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.699 
that the sect of the chart is completely
dependent<00:02:38.760> upon<00:02:39.110> what<00:02:40.110> side<00:02:40.319> of<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.560> horizon

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
dependent upon what side of the horizon

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.250 
dependent upon what side of the horizon
or<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.489> ascendant<00:02:42.209> descended<00:02:42.629> access<00:02:43.080> that

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
or the ascendant descended access that

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.500 
or the ascendant descended access that
the<00:02:43.379> Sun<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.709> on<00:02:43.860> if<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.819> Sun<00:02:45.000> is<00:02:45.120> anywhere

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
the Sun is on if the Sun is anywhere

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.589 
the Sun is on if the Sun is anywhere
above<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.290> ascendant<00:02:46.980> descendant<00:02:47.370> axis<00:02:47.849> then

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
above the ascendant descendant axis then

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.320 
above the ascendant descendant axis then
it's<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.840> day<00:02:48.989> chart<00:02:49.290> if<00:02:49.980> it's<00:02:50.220> anywhere<00:02:50.489> below

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
it's a day chart if it's anywhere below

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.170 
it's a day chart if it's anywhere below
the<00:02:52.019> ascendant<00:02:52.800> descendant<00:02:53.370> axis<00:02:53.760> like<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.060> is

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
the ascendant descendant axis like it is

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.649 
the ascendant descendant axis like it is
now<00:02:54.390> then<00:02:54.989> it's<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.230> nighttime<00:02:55.410> chart<00:02:55.920> and

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
now then it's a nighttime chart and

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.740 
now then it's a nighttime chart and
that's<00:02:57.659> pretty<00:02:57.959> much<00:02:58.140> all<00:02:58.319> you<00:02:58.500> need<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.800> know

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
that's pretty much all you need to know

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.890 
that's pretty much all you need to know
that's<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.349> primary<00:03:02.300> criteria<00:03:03.300> for

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
that's the the primary criteria for

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.870 
that's the the primary criteria for
determining<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.560> sect<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.099> chart

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880
