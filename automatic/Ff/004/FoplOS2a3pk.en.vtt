hey<00:00:00.359> guys<00:00:00.539> welcome<00:00:00.780> back<00:00:00.930> to<00:00:01.140> Phoenix<00:00:01.290> gaming

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
hey guys welcome back to Phoenix gaming

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.980 
hey guys welcome back to Phoenix gaming
and<00:00:01.890> now<00:00:02.100> today<00:00:02.520> I<00:00:02.550> ran<00:00:02.970> into<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.330> little<00:00:03.750> tiny

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
and now today I ran into a little tiny

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.660 
and now today I ran into a little tiny
glitch<00:00:04.380> now<00:00:04.650> before<00:00:05.040> I<00:00:05.069> get<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.339> that<00:00:05.430> glitch

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
glitch now before I get to that glitch

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.860 
glitch now before I get to that glitch
I'm<00:00:05.819> gonna<00:00:05.970> go<00:00:06.060> over<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.270> little<00:00:06.420> bit<00:00:06.509> of<00:00:06.690> some

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
I'm gonna go over a little bit of some

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.780 
I'm gonna go over a little bit of some
piston<00:00:07.379> logic<00:00:07.770> now<00:00:08.250> I'm<00:00:08.340> not<00:00:08.460> gonna<00:00:08.580> go<00:00:08.760> over

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
piston logic now I'm not gonna go over

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.339 
piston logic now I'm not gonna go over
everything<00:00:09.360> with<00:00:09.570> piston<00:00:09.870> logic<00:00:10.110> because<00:00:10.260> if

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
everything with piston logic because if

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.020 
everything with piston logic because if
I<00:00:10.410> did<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.769> video<00:00:10.860> would<00:00:11.040> probably<00:00:11.340> be<00:00:11.460> 40<00:00:11.940> to

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
I did the video would probably be 40 to

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.910 
I did the video would probably be 40 to
30<00:00:12.269> minutes<00:00:12.599> long<00:00:12.809> so<00:00:13.080> I'm<00:00:13.500> just<00:00:13.620> gonna<00:00:13.740> give

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
30 minutes long so I'm just gonna give

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.640 
30 minutes long so I'm just gonna give
you<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.040> tiny<00:00:14.309> tiny<00:00:14.610> bit<00:00:14.759> on<00:00:15.500> some<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.590> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
you a tiny tiny bit on some of the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.560 
you a tiny tiny bit on some of the
piston<00:00:16.920> logic<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.430> why<00:00:17.789> I'm<00:00:17.940> doing<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.330> is

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
piston logic and why I'm doing this is

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.150 
piston logic and why I'm doing this is
to<00:00:18.720> show<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:18.960> how<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.230> got<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.740> point<00:00:19.920> of

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
to show you how I got to the point of

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.509 
to show you how I got to the point of
this<00:00:20.430> glitch<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:21.029> ran<00:00:21.270> into<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:22.710> here<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.130> am<00:00:23.220> at

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
this glitch I ran into so here I am at

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.880 
this glitch I ran into so here I am at
my<00:00:23.550> magic<00:00:24.090> button<00:00:24.560> with<00:00:25.560> my<00:00:25.590> 3x3<00:00:26.550> door<00:00:27.140> but<00:00:28.140> if

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
my magic button with my 3x3 door but if

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.349 
my magic button with my 3x3 door but if
you<00:00:29.099> want<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.369> see<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.820> tutorial<00:00:30.240> on<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
you want to see the tutorial on the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.640 
you want to see the tutorial on the
magic<00:00:30.599> button<00:00:30.779> there's<00:00:31.050> another<00:00:31.289> video<00:00:31.560> you

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
magic button there's another video you

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.490 
magic button there's another video you
can<00:00:31.859> go<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.430> it's<00:00:33.000> Rick<00:00:33.840> it's<00:00:34.020> pretty<00:00:34.320> new

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
can go to it it's Rick it's pretty new

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.590 
can go to it it's Rick it's pretty new
actually<00:00:34.890> recently<00:00:35.070> since<00:00:35.550> I've<00:00:35.670> done<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.850> but

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
actually recently since I've done it but

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.910 
actually recently since I've done it but
I<00:00:36.660> just<00:00:36.930> want<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.140> go<00:00:37.230> over<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.469> three<00:00:37.710> extra

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
I just want to go over this three extra

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.979 
I just want to go over this three extra
door<00:00:38.100> now<00:00:38.370> when<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.300> look<00:00:39.450> at<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> three<00:00:39.809> extra

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
door now when you look at a three extra

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.389 
door now when you look at a three extra
door<00:00:40.140> you're<00:00:40.290> like<00:00:40.410> okay<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.040> three<00:00:41.190> extra

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
door you're like okay it's a three extra

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.790 
door you're like okay it's a three extra
doors<00:00:41.579> who<00:00:41.790> cares<00:00:42.390> well<00:00:43.260> let's<00:00:43.469> think<00:00:43.649> about

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
doors who cares well let's think about

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.220 
doors who cares well let's think about
this<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:45.000> got<00:00:45.149> sticky<00:00:45.539> pistons<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.110> have

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
this so we got sticky pistons that have

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.190 
this so we got sticky pistons that have
to<00:00:46.350> grab<00:00:46.590> these<00:00:46.829> down<00:00:47.420> to<00:00:48.420> open<00:00:48.750> up<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.989> door

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
to grab these down to open up the door

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.060 
to grab these down to open up the door
so<00:00:49.620> if<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.770> click<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> button<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:52.440> door<00:00:52.620> opens

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
so if I click the button the door opens

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.000 
so if I click the button the door opens
now<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.510> thing<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.780> when<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.199> cuts<00:00:55.500> not<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
now the thing is when it cuts not to

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.819 
now the thing is when it cuts not to
it's<00:00:56.280> not<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> point<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.649> opening<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
it's not the point of the opening of the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.610 
it's not the point of the opening of the
door<00:00:58.980> but<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.430> closing<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.270> door<00:01:00.660> now

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
door but the closing of the door now

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.130 
door but the closing of the door now
when<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.890> close<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.550> door<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:03.539> realize<00:01:03.930> that

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
when you close the door you realize that

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.020 
when you close the door you realize that
you<00:01:04.290> have<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.470> get<00:01:04.650> two<00:01:04.890> blocks<00:01:05.220> from<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.790> one

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
you have to get two blocks from this one

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.840 
you have to get two blocks from this one
spot<00:01:06.360> up<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:07.020> here<00:01:07.350> now<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.130> got<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> sticky

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
spot up to here now you got a sticky

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.090 
spot up to here now you got a sticky
piston<00:01:09.030> there<00:01:09.420> sticky<00:01:10.380> pistons<00:01:10.740> are<00:01:10.860> meant<00:01:11.040> to

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
piston there sticky pistons are meant to

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.700 
piston there sticky pistons are meant to
pull<00:01:11.460> things<00:01:11.700> back<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.600> push<00:01:13.290> things<00:01:13.500> up

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
pull things back and push things up

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.440 
pull things back and push things up
they're<00:01:14.040> not<00:01:14.220> supposed<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.729> be<00:01:14.880> letting<00:01:15.240> go<00:01:15.420> of

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
they're not supposed to be letting go of

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.080 
they're not supposed to be letting go of
the<00:01:15.750> block<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.290> get<00:01:16.380> another<00:01:16.680> block<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.970> be

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
the block to get another block to be

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.560 
the block to get another block to be
pushing<00:01:18.540> up<00:01:19.430> so<00:01:20.430> we're<00:01:20.880> gonna<00:01:20.970> come<00:01:21.180> down<00:01:21.360> here

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
pushing up so we're gonna come down here

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.080 
pushing up so we're gonna come down here
now<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.189> I'm<00:01:23.189> gonna<00:01:23.280> go<00:01:23.460> over<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.759> little<00:01:23.939> bit

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
now and I'm gonna go over a little bit

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.130 
now and I'm gonna go over a little bit
of<00:01:24.390> why<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:24.930> happens<00:01:26.000> now<00:01:27.000> okay<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:27.960> know

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
of why this happens now okay you know

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.719 
of why this happens now okay you know
let's<00:01:28.470> just<00:01:28.890> put<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.040> sticky<00:01:29.310> piston<00:01:29.430> down

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
let's just put a sticky piston down

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.359 
let's just put a sticky piston down
right<00:01:29.880> here<00:01:30.090> with<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.479> block<00:01:30.780> now<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> sticky

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
right here with a block now a sticky

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.170 
right here with a block now a sticky
piston<00:01:32.790> when<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.090> extends<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:35.640> time<00:01:35.970> it

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
piston when it extends up the time it

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.770 
piston when it extends up the time it
takes<00:01:36.329> from<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.900> get<00:01:37.020> here<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.770> up<00:01:38.009> here<00:01:38.340> is

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
takes from it to get here to up here is

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.600 
takes from it to get here to up here is
1.5<00:01:39.780> ticks

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
1.5 ticks

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.410 
1.5 ticks
now<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.939> tick<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:43.369> Minecraft<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.270> is

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
now a tick in Minecraft is this this is

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.569 
now a tick in Minecraft is this this is
one<00:01:45.630> tick<00:01:45.840> right<00:01:45.990> here<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.040> two<00:01:47.280> ticks

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
one tick right here this is two ticks

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.120 
one tick right here this is two ticks
three<00:01:47.970> ticks<00:01:48.210> 4<00:01:48.540> ticks

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
three ticks 4 ticks

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.660 
three ticks 4 ticks
so<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.970> extends<00:01:51.570> at<00:01:51.740> one<00:01:52.740> tick<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.310> then<00:01:53.610> a

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
so this extends at one tick and then a

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.209 
so this extends at one tick and then a
half<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.840> tick<00:01:56.689> so<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.140> whole<00:01:58.380> reason

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
half of this tick so the whole reason

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.789 
half of this tick so the whole reason
why<00:01:59.399> the<00:02:00.299> piston<00:02:00.780> will<00:02:01.079> let<00:02:01.259> go<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.649> block

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
why the piston will let go of the block

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.679 
why the piston will let go of the block
so<00:02:01.950> if<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.130> put<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.670> torch<00:02:03.000> down<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.479> then

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
so if I put this torch down and then

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.230 
so if I put this torch down and then
smack<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.560> away<00:02:04.680> as<00:02:04.829> quick<00:02:05.070> as<00:02:05.189> possible

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
smack it away as quick as possible

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.450 
smack it away as quick as possible
never<00:02:08.110> go<00:02:08.229> see<00:02:08.649> how<00:02:08.710> they<00:02:08.890> call<00:02:09.040> the<00:02:09.130> buck<00:02:09.280> now

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
never go see how they call the buck now

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.530 
never go see how they call the buck now
the<00:02:09.520> reason<00:02:09.820> why<00:02:09.910> it<00:02:09.970> does<00:02:10.149> that<00:02:10.180> is<00:02:10.509> because

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
the reason why it does that is because

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.600 
the reason why it does that is because
the<00:02:10.960> energy<00:02:11.110> it's<00:02:11.590> getting<00:02:11.890> from<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.340> torch

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
the energy it's getting from the torch

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.060 
the energy it's getting from the torch
is<00:02:12.850> getting<00:02:13.570> cut<00:02:13.780> off<00:02:13.810> so<00:02:14.530> now<00:02:14.680> instead<00:02:14.860> of

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
is getting cut off so now instead of

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.440 
is getting cut off so now instead of
taking<00:02:15.630> 1.5<00:02:16.630> to<00:02:17.410> extend<00:02:18.040> it's<00:02:18.820> taking<00:02:19.270> only

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
taking 1.5 to extend it's taking only

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.680 
taking 1.5 to extend it's taking only
point<00:02:20.260> five<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.710> extend<00:02:21.130> so<00:02:21.910> when<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.210> extends

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
point five to extend so when it extends

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.900 
point five to extend so when it extends
and<00:02:22.720> retracts<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:23.440> quickly<00:02:23.710> it<00:02:24.040> can't<00:02:24.340> do<00:02:24.550> it

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
and retracts that quickly it can't do it

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.310 
and retracts that quickly it can't do it
can't<00:02:25.150> get<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.510> animation<00:02:25.960> of<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.080> block

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
can't get the animation of the block

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.290 
can't get the animation of the block
itself<00:02:26.680> as<00:02:26.890> well<00:02:27.070> and<00:02:27.310> it<00:02:27.790> will<00:02:27.910> end<00:02:28.090> up

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
itself as well and it will end up

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.590 
itself as well and it will end up
letting<00:02:28.510> go<00:02:28.780> of<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:29.260> block<00:02:30.060> now<00:02:31.060> this<00:02:31.300> is<00:02:31.480> the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
letting go of the block now this is the

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.060 
letting go of the block now this is the
hole<00:02:31.750> like<00:02:31.990> this<00:02:32.050> right<00:02:32.620> here<00:02:32.740> is<00:02:32.860> like<00:02:32.920> the

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
hole like this right here is like the

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.180 
hole like this right here is like the
mechanism<00:02:33.610> for<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:33.910> three<00:02:34.510> by<00:02:34.630> three<00:02:34.660> a<00:02:35.230> four<00:02:36.040> by

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
mechanism for a three by three a four by

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.040 
mechanism for a three by three a four by
four<00:02:36.220> so<00:02:37.150> on<00:02:37.300> and<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:37.450> forth<00:02:37.630> I'm<00:02:37.720> just<00:02:37.930> using

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
four so on and so forth I'm just using

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.900 
four so on and so forth I'm just using
doors<00:02:38.380> there<00:02:38.650> this<00:02:38.890> thing<00:02:39.100> to<00:02:39.190> do<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.310> lot<00:02:39.640> more

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
doors there this thing to do a lot more

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.010 
doors there this thing to do a lot more
than<00:02:40.150> just<00:02:40.180> doors<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:42.340> I<00:02:42.580> was<00:02:43.030> pretty<00:02:43.570> much<00:02:43.690> for

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
than just doors so I was pretty much for

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.830 
than just doors so I was pretty much for
the<00:02:44.080> glitch<00:02:44.290> arm<00:02:45.000> well<00:02:46.000> before<00:02:46.600> we<00:02:46.660> get<00:02:46.720> to

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
the glitch arm well before we get to

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.660 
the glitch arm well before we get to
glitch<00:02:47.020> this<00:02:47.800> part<00:02:48.130> right<00:02:48.220> here<00:02:48.280> if<00:02:48.459> you<00:02:48.550> see

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
glitch this part right here if you see

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.670 
glitch this part right here if you see
my<00:02:48.790> magic<00:02:48.970> button<00:02:49.390> video<00:02:49.540> this<00:02:50.230> part<00:02:50.590> right

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
my magic button video this part right

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.949 
my magic button video this part right
here<00:02:50.740> I<00:02:50.890> have<00:02:51.160> this<00:02:51.340> in<00:02:51.550> there<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:51.910> this<00:02:52.900> is

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
here I have this in there and this is

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.530 
here I have this in there and this is
why<00:02:53.590> that<00:02:53.830> but<00:02:54.070> that's<00:02:54.430> why<00:02:54.580> this<00:02:54.700> block<00:02:55.300> let's

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
why that but that's why this block let's

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.990 
why that but that's why this block let's
go<00:02:55.660> this<00:02:55.840> one<00:02:56.220> now<00:02:57.220> there<00:02:57.400> is<00:02:57.520> a<00:02:57.670> smaller

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
go this one now there is a smaller

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.500 
go this one now there is a smaller
version<00:02:58.300> there's<00:02:58.900> this<00:02:59.170> one<00:02:59.380> right<00:02:59.500> here<00:03:00.510> but

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
version there's this one right here but

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.180 
version there's this one right here but
I<00:03:01.540> did<00:03:01.810> not<00:03:01.930> use<00:03:01.990> this<00:03:02.410> version<00:03:02.620> because<00:03:02.890> this

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
I did not use this version because this

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.400 
I did not use this version because this
version<00:03:03.340> only<00:03:03.760> works<00:03:03.970> in<00:03:04.180> two<00:03:04.480> directions<00:03:04.720> if

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
version only works in two directions if

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.230 
version only works in two directions if
I<00:03:05.500> come<00:03:05.740> over<00:03:05.770> here<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.430> try<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:06.700> do<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.060> same

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
I come over here and try to do the same

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.480 
I come over here and try to do the same
one<00:03:07.420> over<00:03:07.570> here<00:03:07.930> you<00:03:08.709> can<00:03:08.890> see<00:03:09.040> it<00:03:09.160> does<00:03:09.310> not

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
one over here you can see it does not

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.030 
one over here you can see it does not
work<00:03:09.730> at<00:03:10.030> all<00:03:10.209> now<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.200> reason<00:03:11.500> why<00:03:11.620> I<00:03:11.650> like<00:03:11.860> to

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
work at all now the reason why I like to

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.770 
work at all now the reason why I like to
use<00:03:12.160> this<00:03:12.430> one<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:12.970> why<00:03:13.209> I<00:03:13.239> called<00:03:13.630> it

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
use this one and why I called it

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.050 
use this one and why I called it
Universal<00:03:14.500> is<00:03:14.650> because<00:03:15.310> you<00:03:15.459> can<00:03:15.640> use<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:15.940> in

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
Universal is because you can use it in

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.140 
Universal is because you can use it in
any<00:03:16.269> direction<00:03:16.630> and<00:03:17.200> it<00:03:17.320> will<00:03:17.350> work

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
any direction and it will work

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.170 
any direction and it will work
any<00:03:19.150> single<00:03:19.480> direction<00:03:20.050> and<00:03:20.200> it<00:03:20.290> will<00:03:20.320> work<00:03:21.180> so

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
any single direction and it will work so

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.900 
any single direction and it will work so
now<00:03:22.330> we're<00:03:22.510> going<00:03:22.630> to<00:03:22.720> get<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.140> glitch<00:03:23.910> so

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
now we're going to get to the glitch so

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.120 
now we're going to get to the glitch so
I<00:03:25.300> as<00:03:25.810> you<00:03:25.989> can<00:03:26.140> see<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.350> universal<00:03:26.800> one<00:03:26.920> is<00:03:27.100> a

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
I as you can see the universal one is a

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.740 
I as you can see the universal one is a
two<00:03:29.280> it's<00:03:30.280> two<00:03:30.580> spacings<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.239> wanted<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:31.570> make<00:03:31.720> a

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
two it's two spacings I wanted to make a

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.540 
two it's two spacings I wanted to make a
just<00:03:32.230> a<00:03:32.350> single<00:03:32.620> space<00:03:32.860> one<00:03:33.070> as<00:03:33.250> you<00:03:33.340> can<00:03:33.370> see

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
just a single space one as you can see

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.949 
just a single space one as you can see
it's<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:33.700> little<00:03:33.760> bulky<00:03:34.030> it's<00:03:34.300> look<00:03:34.570> it<00:03:34.810> looks

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
it's a little bulky it's look it looks

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.570 
it's a little bulky it's look it looks
kind<00:03:35.170> of<00:03:35.200> like<00:03:35.290> a<00:03:35.350> T<00:03:35.560> flip-flop<00:03:35.769> on<00:03:36.160> its<00:03:36.340> side

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
kind of like a T flip-flop on its side

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.090 
kind of like a T flip-flop on its side
so<00:03:36.910> I<00:03:37.750> made<00:03:37.989> this<00:03:38.140> one<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.530> it<00:03:38.620> does<00:03:38.769> it<00:03:38.950> works

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
so I made this one and it does it works

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.720 
so I made this one and it does it works
the<00:03:39.970> opposite<00:03:40.300> direction

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
the opposite direction

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.440 
the opposite direction
that<00:03:42.730> this<00:03:42.940> one<00:03:43.150> cannot<00:03:43.570> do<00:03:45.269> so<00:03:46.269> then<00:03:46.420> I

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
that this one cannot do so then I

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.180 
that this one cannot do so then I
decided<00:03:46.570> well<00:03:46.959> maybe<00:03:47.230> this<00:03:47.440> one's<00:03:47.620> Universal

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
decided well maybe this one's Universal

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.640 
decided well maybe this one's Universal
so<00:03:48.340> I<00:03:48.370> turned<00:03:48.700> it<00:03:48.850> this<00:03:49.120> way<00:03:49.450> now<00:03:50.260> this<00:03:50.440> is

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
so I turned it this way now this is

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.520 
so I turned it this way now this is
where<00:03:50.860> this<00:03:51.130> glitch<00:03:51.459> came<00:03:51.820> from<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:53.110> I<00:03:53.470> don't

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
where this glitch came from and I don't

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.800 
where this glitch came from and I don't
know<00:03:53.830> why<00:03:53.980> it<00:03:54.040> does<00:03:54.310> this<00:03:54.340> I<00:03:54.880> don't<00:03:55.660> know<00:03:55.720> if

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
know why it does this I don't know if

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.720 
know why it does this I don't know if
it's<00:03:55.930> because<00:03:56.019> a<00:03:56.110> title<00:03:56.470> update<00:03:56.680> 12<00:03:56.950> or<00:03:57.220> maybe

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
it's because a title update 12 or maybe

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.000 
it's because a title update 12 or maybe
I<00:03:57.910> just<00:03:58.360> never<00:03:58.630> done<00:03:58.900> it<00:03:58.989> before<00:03:59.080> but<00:03:59.470> if<00:03:59.950> I

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
I just never done it before but if I

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.640 
I just never done it before but if I
click<00:04:00.070> this<00:04:00.400> button<00:04:00.459> it<00:04:01.120> sends<00:04:02.019> the<00:04:02.200> block<00:04:02.380> up

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
click this button it sends the block up

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.340 
click this button it sends the block up
cool<00:04:03.280> does<00:04:03.940> what<00:04:04.150> it's<00:04:04.269> supposed<00:04:04.330> to<00:04:04.630> do<00:04:04.780> now

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
cool does what it's supposed to do now

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.940 
cool does what it's supposed to do now
when<00:04:05.530> I<00:04:05.560> click<00:04:05.980> this<00:04:06.280> button<00:04:06.340> again<00:04:07.080> it<00:04:08.080> turns

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
when I click this button again it turns

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.610 
when I click this button again it turns
the<00:04:09.250> block<00:04:09.549> into<00:04:09.880> the<00:04:10.209> extension<00:04:10.750> part<00:04:11.230> of<00:04:11.500> the

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
the block into the extension part of the

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.160 
the block into the extension part of the
sticky<00:04:11.980> piston<00:04:12.430> and<00:04:12.610> I<00:04:13.299> can<00:04:13.510> delete<00:04:13.780> this<00:04:13.989> I

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
sticky piston and I can delete this I

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.509 
sticky piston and I can delete this I
can<00:04:14.320> delete<00:04:14.500> all<00:04:14.680> of<00:04:14.860> this<00:04:15.660> and<00:04:16.739> it's<00:04:17.739> stuck

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
can delete all of this and it's stuck

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.870 
can delete all of this and it's stuck
I<00:04:18.549> don't<00:04:19.209> understand<00:04:19.930> why<00:04:20.139> it<00:04:20.200> does<00:04:20.470> is<00:04:20.709> I<00:04:20.920> look

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
I don't understand why it does is I look

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.280 
I don't understand why it does is I look
you<00:04:22.000> could<00:04:22.120> place<00:04:22.300> blocks<00:04:22.630> around<00:04:22.840> it<00:04:23.170> and

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
you could place blocks around it and

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.910 
you could place blocks around it and
everything

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
everything

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.760 
everything
and<00:04:24.010> it<00:04:24.370> doesn't<00:04:24.610> change<00:04:24.820> it<00:04:25.180> now<00:04:26.050> if<00:04:26.200> I<00:04:26.350> smack

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
and it doesn't change it now if I smack

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.050 
and it doesn't change it now if I smack
this<00:04:26.950> right<00:04:27.130> here<00:04:27.250> this<00:04:27.340> is<00:04:27.400> technically<00:04:27.910> the

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
this right here this is technically the

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.050 
this right here this is technically the
block<00:04:28.410> this<00:04:29.410> is<00:04:29.620> technically<00:04:30.040> that<00:04:30.280> block<00:04:30.550> so

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
block this is technically that block so

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.640 
block this is technically that block so
if<00:04:31.150> I<00:04:31.240> smack<00:04:31.570> this<00:04:31.720> it<00:04:31.930> will<00:04:32.080> get<00:04:32.200> deleted<00:04:32.410> but

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
if I smack this it will get deleted but

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.400 
if I smack this it will get deleted but
not<00:04:32.950> the<00:04:33.100> piston<00:04:33.490> but<00:04:34.360> the<00:04:34.480> thing<00:04:34.720> is<00:04:35.160> I<00:04:36.900> I<00:04:37.900> just

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
not the piston but the thing is I I just

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.930 
not the piston but the thing is I I just
think<00:04:38.620> it's<00:04:38.740> hilarious<00:04:39.280> I<00:04:39.460> don't<00:04:39.639> know<00:04:39.790> why

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
think it's hilarious I don't know why

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.450 
think it's hilarious I don't know why

hilarious
cuz<00:04:44.590> if<00:04:44.740> someone<00:04:45.010> sees<00:04:45.220> this<00:04:45.370> they'll<00:04:45.550> be<00:04:45.580> like

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
cuz if someone sees this they'll be like

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
and this is that whole piston logic

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.370 
and this is that whole piston logic
thing<00:04:51.280> pretty<00:04:51.490> much<00:04:51.580> only<00:04:51.910> led<00:04:52.389> to<00:04:52.419> this<00:04:52.870> part

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380

right here on why this happened and I
just<00:04:58.090> I<00:04:58.240> just<00:04:58.270> thought<00:04:58.570> it<00:04:58.690> was<00:04:58.780> funny

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
and I kind of wanted to just show it to

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.970 
and I kind of wanted to just show it to
people<00:05:01.090> but<00:05:01.810> I<00:05:01.870> want<00:05:02.050> to<00:05:02.110> give<00:05:02.260> some<00:05:02.590> sort<00:05:02.830> of

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
background to how I got to the point of

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.980 
background to how I got to the point of
why<00:05:05.380> this<00:05:05.919> happened<00:05:06.490> or<00:05:07.180> why<00:05:07.360> I<00:05:07.389> was<00:05:07.720> even

doling into any of this crap but yeah
that's<00:05:11.860> a<00:05:12.070> little<00:05:12.280> glitch<00:05:12.490> I<00:05:12.639> ran<00:05:12.850> into<00:05:13.150> a

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
that's a little glitch I ran into a

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.810 
that's a little glitch I ran into a
Minecraft<00:05:13.780> it's<00:05:14.080> an<00:05:14.380> extended<00:05:15.010> sticky<00:05:15.370> piston

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
Minecraft it's an extended sticky piston

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.180 
Minecraft it's an extended sticky piston
that's<00:05:16.380> also<00:05:17.380> not<00:05:17.800> extended<00:05:18.520> I<00:05:20.100> wonder<00:05:21.100> if<00:05:21.160> I

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
that's also not extended I wonder if I

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.230 
that's also not extended I wonder if I
put<00:05:21.340> a<00:05:21.370> torch<00:05:21.610> there<00:05:21.669> we'll<00:05:21.910> fix<00:05:22.180> it

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
put a torch there we'll fix it

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:32.010 
put a torch there we'll fix it
nope<00:05:26.400> nope<00:05:27.400> it<00:05:28.150> just<00:05:28.210> stays<00:05:28.900> that<00:05:29.200> way<00:05:29.260> I<00:05:31.020> guess

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
nope nope it just stays that way I guess

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.270 
nope nope it just stays that way I guess
that's<00:05:32.199> a<00:05:32.290> pretty<00:05:32.500> good<00:05:32.680> idea<00:05:32.919> if<00:05:32.980> you<00:05:33.070> want<00:05:33.160> to

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
that's a pretty good idea if you want to

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.129 
that's a pretty good idea if you want to
make<00:05:33.370> a<00:05:33.400> table<00:05:34.030> or<00:05:34.330> something<00:05:34.360> in<00:05:34.810> your<00:05:34.960> house

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
make a table or something in your house

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:36.810 
make a table or something in your house
and<00:05:35.440> you<00:05:35.560> don't<00:05:35.710> want<00:05:35.830> any<00:05:36.010> redstone<00:05:36.460> around

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
and you don't want any redstone around

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.600 
and you don't want any redstone around
it<00:05:37.030> I<00:05:37.410> guess<00:05:38.410> but<00:05:38.919> then<00:05:39.070> you'd<00:05:39.220> have<00:05:39.310> to<00:05:39.400> make

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
it I guess but then you'd have to make

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.580 
it I guess but then you'd have to make
that<00:05:39.730> whole<00:05:39.940> contraption<00:05:40.360> which<00:05:40.900> is<00:05:41.110> uh<00:05:43.590> I

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
that whole contraption which is uh I

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.750 
that whole contraption which is uh I
guess<00:05:44.949> I<00:05:45.040> could<00:05:45.160> show<00:05:45.280> you<00:05:45.310> guys<00:05:45.490> how<00:05:45.610> to<00:05:45.639> make

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
guess I could show you guys how to make

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.700 
guess I could show you guys how to make
it<00:05:46.060> if<00:05:46.150> you<00:05:46.240> want<00:05:46.419> to<00:05:46.449> do<00:05:46.600> it<00:05:46.750> so<00:05:47.110> let's<00:05:47.350> just<00:05:47.560> do

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
it if you want to do it so let's just do

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.770 
it if you want to do it so let's just do
it<00:05:47.740> real<00:05:47.949> quick<00:05:48.160> okay<00:05:48.400> so<00:05:48.460> block<00:05:48.940> a<00:05:49.210> torch<00:05:49.570> a

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
it real quick okay so block a torch a

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.390 
it real quick okay so block a torch a
torch<00:05:49.810> a<00:05:50.410> block<00:05:51.400> on<00:05:51.610> top<00:05:51.790> of<00:05:52.000> this<00:05:52.090> torch<00:05:52.480> a

block on top of this torch
a<00:05:56.210> torch<00:05:57.050> here<00:05:57.080> a<00:05:57.590> repeater<00:05:58.460> here<00:05:58.550> set<00:05:59.030> it<00:05:59.060> to

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
a torch here a repeater here set it to

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.150 
a torch here a repeater here set it to
two<00:05:59.510> tix<00:05:59.780> delay<00:06:01.150> block<00:06:02.150> here<00:06:02.600> block<00:06:03.560> on<00:06:03.770> top<00:06:04.010> of

two tix delay block here block on top of
this<00:06:04.280> torch<00:06:06.250> redstone<00:06:07.250> dust<00:06:09.340> then<00:06:10.340> we<00:06:10.460> need<00:06:10.610> a

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:10.790 
this torch redstone dust then we need a

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.440 
this torch redstone dust then we need a
normal<00:06:11.330> piston<00:06:12.370> block<00:06:13.370> and<00:06:13.700> then<00:06:14.120> a<00:06:14.150> normal

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
normal piston block and then a normal

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.750 
normal piston block and then a normal
piston<00:06:14.780> facing<00:06:15.080> downwards<00:06:17.110> downwards<00:06:18.760> then

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760 
piston facing downwards downwards then

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
piston facing downwards downwards then
we<00:06:19.880> need<00:06:20.090> a<00:06:20.270> block<00:06:20.930> on<00:06:21.140> this<00:06:21.650> side<00:06:22.450> with<00:06:23.450> some

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
we need a block on this side with some

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.060 
we need a block on this side with some
redstone<00:06:24.470> dust<00:06:24.680> I<00:06:26.320> don't<00:06:27.320> really<00:06:27.710> know<00:06:27.890> if<00:06:27.920> it

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070 
redstone dust I don't really know if it

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.160 
redstone dust I don't really know if it
matters<00:06:28.550> where<00:06:28.820> the<00:06:29.390> piston<00:06:29.810> goes<00:06:29.840> but<00:06:30.110> I'm

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.170 
matters where the piston goes but I'm

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.540 
matters where the piston goes but I'm
just<00:06:30.290> gonna<00:06:30.410> put<00:06:30.590> it<00:06:30.650> there<00:06:30.830> a<00:06:30.860> piston<00:06:31.400> with<00:06:31.520> a

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
just gonna put it there a piston with a

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.030 
just gonna put it there a piston with a
block<00:06:31.880> on<00:06:32.060> top<00:06:32.270> of<00:06:32.450> it<00:06:32.600> and<00:06:32.780> now<00:06:33.620> if<00:06:33.740> we<00:06:33.860> just

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.040 
block on top of it and now if we just

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:40.300 
block on top of it and now if we just
put<00:06:34.220> a<00:06:34.340> button<00:06:34.700> here<00:06:34.910> and<00:06:35.030> click<00:06:35.270> it<00:06:39.310> it

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310 
put a button here and click it it

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.520 
put a button here and click it it
doesn't<00:06:40.730> work<00:06:41.150> and<00:06:41.450> then<00:06:41.510> we<00:06:41.690> get<00:06:41.840> screwed<00:06:42.290> so

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
doesn't work and then we get screwed so

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.080 
doesn't work and then we get screwed so
let<00:06:42.740> me<00:06:42.830> try<00:06:43.100> this<00:06:43.160> I<00:06:43.490> think<00:06:43.550> I<00:06:43.790> have<00:06:43.880> to<00:06:43.970> put

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
let me try this I think I have to put

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.440 
let me try this I think I have to put
dust<00:06:44.360> down<00:06:44.540> here<00:06:44.810> as<00:06:44.900> well<00:06:45.730> is<00:06:46.730> the<00:06:46.940> dust<00:06:47.180> there

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:47.450 
dust down here as well is the dust there

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:55.990 
dust down here as well is the dust there
yes<00:06:47.720> the<00:06:47.870> dust<00:06:48.080> is<00:06:48.320> there<00:06:54.400> there<00:06:55.400> we<00:06:55.550> go

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 
yes the dust is there there we go

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.580 
yes the dust is there there we go
that's<00:06:56.750> how<00:06:56.870> you<00:06:56.930> build<00:06:57.110> it<00:06:57.230> you<00:06:57.290> got<00:06:57.410> to<00:06:57.470> put

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:57.590 
that's how you build it you got to put

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.080 
that's how you build it you got to put
dust<00:06:57.770> down<00:06:57.950> there<00:06:58.160> as<00:06:58.250> well<00:06:58.400> so<00:06:58.550> if<00:06:58.790> you<00:06:58.910> wanna

00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.090 
dust down there as well so if you wanna
