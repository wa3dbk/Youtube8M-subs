00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.490 

hey<00:00:13.940> guys<00:00:14.120> it's<00:00:14.419> Tessa<00:00:14.599> Jeffers<00:00:15.019> with<00:00:15.200> premier

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
hey guys it's Tessa Jeffers with premier

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.529 
hey guys it's Tessa Jeffers with premier
guitar<00:00:15.860> I'm<00:00:16.160> here<00:00:16.369> at<00:00:16.460> the<00:00:16.580> Music<00:00:16.759> Link<00:00:17.060> booth

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
guitar I'm here at the Music Link booth

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.620 
guitar I'm here at the Music Link booth
it's<00:00:18.170> BH<00:00:18.529> T's<00:00:18.830> iSeries<00:00:19.670> so<00:00:19.970> tell<00:00:20.150> us<00:00:20.270> how<00:00:20.450> this

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
it's BH T's iSeries so tell us how this

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.120 
it's BH T's iSeries so tell us how this
works<00:00:20.689> so<00:00:22.180> the<00:00:23.180> iSeries<00:00:23.630> is<00:00:24.140> an<00:00:24.680> amplifier

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
works so the iSeries is an amplifier

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.420 
works so the iSeries is an amplifier
that<00:00:25.550> is<00:00:25.789> really<00:00:26.270> meant<00:00:26.539> to<00:00:26.630> be<00:00:26.900> a<00:00:27.439> simple<00:00:28.250> way

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
that is really meant to be a simple way

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.510 
that is really meant to be a simple way
to<00:00:28.759> bring<00:00:29.509> your<00:00:29.719> apps<00:00:29.989> to<00:00:30.770> a<00:00:30.800> live<00:00:31.099> setting

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
to bring your apps to a live setting

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.130 
to bring your apps to a live setting
it's<00:00:32.210> really<00:00:32.450> what<00:00:32.570> we<00:00:32.629> want<00:00:32.809> to<00:00:32.870> do<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:33.050> we

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
it's really what we want to do and we

really simple for this there are there

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.729 
really simple for this there are there
are<00:00:43.550> a<00:00:43.579> lot<00:00:44.000> of<00:00:44.030> apps<00:00:44.719> in<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.079> world<00:00:45.199> tons<00:00:45.559> and

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
are a lot of apps in the world tons and

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.529 
are a lot of apps in the world tons and
tons<00:00:45.769> of<00:00:46.010> apps<00:00:46.159> in<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:46.370> world<00:00:46.489> what<00:00:47.059> they

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
tons of apps in the world what they

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:49.329 
tons of apps in the world what they
don't<00:00:47.780> have<00:00:47.870> is<00:00:48.289> the<00:00:48.320> ability<00:00:48.499> to<00:00:48.800> really<00:00:49.039> play

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
don't have is the ability to really play

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.489 
don't have is the ability to really play
nice<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.120> sound<00:00:50.539> good<00:00:50.780> through<00:00:51.140> a<00:00:51.170> speaker

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:51.499 
nice and sound good through a speaker

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:53.349 
nice and sound good through a speaker
system<00:00:51.769> and<00:00:52.010> now<00:00:52.190> we<00:00:52.249> have<00:00:52.550> that<00:00:52.730> that<00:00:53.030> our

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:53.359 
system and now we have that that our

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:56.439 
system and now we have that that our
tolling<00:00:53.929> circuitry<00:00:54.559> allows<00:00:55.370> you<00:00:55.670> to<00:00:56.120> plug<00:00:56.269> an

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
tolling circuitry allows you to plug an

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.110 
tolling circuitry allows you to plug an
iPad<00:00:56.870> or<00:00:56.899> a<00:00:57.140> mobile<00:00:57.350> device<00:00:57.649> of<00:00:57.829> your<00:00:57.949> choice

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
iPad or a mobile device of your choice

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.719 
iPad or a mobile device of your choice
into<00:00:59.120> our<00:00:59.899> amp<00:01:00.170> and<00:01:00.409> play<00:01:01.190> in<00:01:01.280> a<00:01:01.339> live<00:01:01.489> setting

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 
into our amp and play in a live setting

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.810 
into our amp and play in a live setting
so<00:01:02.239> what<00:01:02.449> app<00:01:02.749> did<00:01:03.260> you<00:01:03.379> pick<00:01:03.620> -<00:01:03.649> show<00:01:03.949> us<00:01:04.100> right

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
so what app did you pick - show us right

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.960 
so what app did you pick - show us right
now<00:01:04.850> I<00:01:05.420> have<00:01:06.140> a<00:01:06.170> bunch<00:01:06.380> of<00:01:06.470> stock<00:01:06.770> apps<00:01:07.100> apps<00:01:07.670> on

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
now I have a bunch of stock apps apps on

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.969 
now I have a bunch of stock apps apps on
here<00:01:08.000> this<00:01:08.840> one<00:01:09.110> is<00:01:09.500> jamup<00:01:10.460> pro<00:01:11.680> this<00:01:12.680> is<00:01:12.830> just

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
here this one is jamup pro this is just

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.870 
here this one is jamup pro this is just
a<00:01:13.070> stock<00:01:13.340> setting<00:01:13.760> on<00:01:13.880> this

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.250 

big<00:01:20.510> large<00:01:21.049> crunchy<00:01:21.710> sound

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.650 

and<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.950> easiest<00:01:27.250> thing<00:01:27.340> about<00:01:27.610> it<00:01:27.790> is<00:01:27.940> the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
and the easiest thing about it is the

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.120 
and the easiest thing about it is the
amp<00:01:28.870> is<00:01:29.080> sounding<00:01:29.410> great<00:01:29.590> because<00:01:29.950> of<00:01:30.070> the

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
amp is sounding great because of the

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.400 
amp is sounding great because of the
tolling<00:01:30.520> circuitry<00:01:31.030> we<00:01:31.660> can<00:01:31.810> easily<00:01:32.230> go

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
tolling circuitry we can easily go

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.770 
tolling circuitry we can easily go
straight<00:01:33.160> to<00:01:33.340> GarageBand<00:01:34.060> which<00:01:34.300> is<00:01:34.450> actually

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
straight to GarageBand which is actually

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.330 
straight to GarageBand which is actually
a<00:01:34.810> free<00:01:35.170> app<00:01:35.350> on<00:01:35.560> a<00:01:36.010> bunch<00:01:36.280> of<00:01:36.370> things<00:01:36.580> so<00:01:38.340> load

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
a free app on a bunch of things so load

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:47.430 
a free app on a bunch of things so load
that<00:01:39.550> one<00:01:39.760> up<00:01:45.300> what<00:01:46.300> more<00:01:46.690> about<00:01:46.900> the<00:01:47.020> amp<00:01:47.230> like

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
that one up what more about the amp like

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.010 
that one up what more about the amp like
what's<00:01:47.740> inside<00:01:48.040> of<00:01:48.220> it<00:01:48.660> so<00:01:49.660> the<00:01:49.750> way<00:01:49.840> it's

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
what's inside of it so the way it's

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.200 
what's inside of it so the way it's
connecting<00:01:50.470> to<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.950> amplifier<00:01:51.490> itself<00:01:51.910> is

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
connecting to the amplifier itself is

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.560 
connecting to the amplifier itself is
through<00:01:52.750> a<00:01:52.780> trrs<00:01:53.440> cable<00:01:54.340> that<00:01:54.880> allows<00:01:55.000> the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
through a trrs cable that allows the

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.350 
through a trrs cable that allows the
amplifier<00:01:55.990> to<00:01:56.140> talk<00:01:56.320> to<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.710> app<00:01:56.980> and<00:01:57.360> mobile

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
amplifier to talk to the app and mobile

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.290 
amplifier to talk to the app and mobile
device<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:59.380> key<00:02:00.040> here<00:02:00.400> is<00:02:00.610> that<00:02:00.640> totalling

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
device the key here is that totalling

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.870 
device the key here is that totalling
circuitry<00:02:01.840> that<00:02:01.870> kind<00:02:02.290> of<00:02:02.410> has<00:02:02.620> some<00:02:02.730> EQ<00:02:03.730> and

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
circuitry that kind of has some EQ and

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.090 
circuitry that kind of has some EQ and
some<00:02:04.210> buffering<00:02:04.720> that<00:02:04.930> really<00:02:05.500> smooths<00:02:05.830> out

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
some buffering that really smooths out

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.500 
some buffering that really smooths out
and<00:02:06.250> rounds<00:02:06.610> out<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.760> lot<00:02:06.970> of<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.150> brittleness

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
and rounds out a lot of the brittleness

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.450 
and rounds out a lot of the brittleness
and<00:02:07.810> harshness<00:02:08.080> that<00:02:08.290> kinda<00:02:09.070> generally

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
and harshness that kinda generally

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.930 
and harshness that kinda generally
happens<00:02:09.790> with<00:02:09.970> computerized<00:02:10.660> amp<00:02:11.260> modeling

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
happens with computerized amp modeling

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.670 
happens with computerized amp modeling
and<00:02:12.940> then<00:02:13.570> it<00:02:13.720> runs<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:13.990> through<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.170> 12<00:02:14.530> ax7

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
and then it runs it through a 12 ax7

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.580 
and then it runs it through a 12 ax7
that<00:02:15.610> has<00:02:15.880> 300<00:02:16.720> volts<00:02:16.990> running<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:17.500> and

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
that has 300 volts running to it and

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.410 
that has 300 volts running to it and
that's<00:02:17.710> a<00:02:17.770> very<00:02:18.010> very<00:02:18.250> key<00:02:18.370> spec<00:02:18.880> because<00:02:19.090> now

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
that's a very very key spec because now

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.270 
that's a very very key spec because now
you<00:02:19.480> have<00:02:19.810> a<00:02:19.840> tube<00:02:20.410> that's<00:02:20.650> actually<00:02:21.010> working

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280
