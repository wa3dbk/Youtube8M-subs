00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.759
 the girl avian frog with a year and few 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.610
 months has passed away on the outskirts of 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.290
 Damascus was not a victim of the missiles 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.870
 of the regime nor of the barrels 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.749
 explosives neither of the knives of 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.820
 the shabiha nor the chemical weapons 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:20.010
 but of the hunger aggravated by the iron 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.530
 blockage that the regime submits to 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.990
 city how can hunger kill six 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.690
 children in this city in just one 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.880
 week how is it possible that the army 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.120
 of the regime does not succeed in conquering 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.710
 city ​​for more than ten months 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.990
 army that controls two-thirds of its 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.300
 surface killing and evicting 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.120
 20,000 inhabitants one third of their 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.490
 population this small city that has 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.100
 suffered several massacres being the last 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.680
 with chemical weapons it seems to give a small 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.350
 example of the Syrian revolution in all 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.239
 its dimensions like other 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.399
 cities his people came out in 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.800
 peaceful demonstrations raising 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.470
 slogans that bothered the regime and 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.600
 his paramilitaries the free army does not 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.729
 was formed in the city until after 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.290
 that the cries of freedom were 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.360
 repressed with bullets 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.430
 peaceful movements with assaults 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.470
 arrests and torture 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.780
 maybe the proximity of the city to the center 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.360
 from damascus the military airport 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.610
 march to the barracks of the fourth 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.130
 brigade and the resistance of the guard 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.020
 Republican is the answer to the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.570
 multiple bombings and the permanent ones 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.610
 assaults but the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.040
 resistance of the free army in a 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.560
 city ​​whose inhabitants express the 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.330
 difficulty of introducing a pound of 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.120
 flour not to mention the introduction 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.310
 of a bullet or a gun is not a metaphor 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.100
 when they say they eat the leaves of the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.369
 plants because they do not have electricity or 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.110
 flour not even milk for babies 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.990
 ten months of blocking are enough 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.690
 to exhaust all its provisions not 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.880
 we have neither rice nor wheat only olives 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.200
 that is our only breakfast plate 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.500
 food and dinner 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.719
 and missile launchers take care of 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.490
 destroy your fields and silence 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.830
 will undoubtedly lead to a true 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:13.140
 humanitarian catastrophe where hundreds 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.140
 they will die of hunger without making noise
