00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.790
 hello friends this week on the channel 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.829
 come experiments we are going to make a 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.660
 piggy bank of hama bits to put our 

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:09.190
 savings our coins that we have 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.560
 by loose house and not lose those that 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.390
 so we need simple templates 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.209
 these of the pinchitos that this one think that 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.910
 they are 29 x 29 but good is going to 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.919
 find various formats and forms and the 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.140
 bags and these that go with the 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.150
 These taquitos the hama tubes 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.449
 beads go 500 as we have seen so there 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.619
 mogollÃ³n here total there are a thousand then blacks 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.200
 oranges and yellows that are what 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.570
 we're going to need the put them in bowl and 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.300
 some tweezers to put better what they are 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.640
 the hama bits good let's start 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.310
 remember that in the description of the video 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.190
 you have the template to download it and 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.050
 see how to do it let's say use it as a guide 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.480
 nothing has started making a 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.060
 box of 14 x 14 and now what is the 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.670
 black will be the unions between 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.280
 different parts of the cube bank already 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.040
 I have the four walls of the four 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.750
 sides so let's start ironing 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.269
 because no I do not have more bases is in 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.860
 temperature 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.780
 as half the temperature of the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.310
 iron because if we put it little not 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.810
 does nothing and if we put it too much 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.240
 it's going to stay that I made a 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.009
 tortilla so at mid temperature 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.500
 we give a few passes as well as 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.390
 circulate and then we put some weight 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.340
 over so it stays flat because 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.440
 well I do not know if you know but it tends to 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.600
 deformed arching a little bit then 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.820
 until it cools, then better leave it 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.220
 some weight over and it's already good 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.470
 we have one and and we're going to give it to him 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.509
 another good side because you could leave 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.100
 only one side ironed but I 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.600
 I prefer to iron it on both sides 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.450
 because that's how it looks like much more 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.300
 strong and resistant at the time of 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.729
 have that fight plus resistance 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.990
 well we have already the four walls and 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.179
 let's do the part above and from 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.560
 down there also, well, you can see the 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.720
 part above and the one below has not 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.159
 done because it's like the one above 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.899
 that all black is the top part 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.390
 You see the hole to put the 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.950
 little coins and there's the bottom part that 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.170
 it's exactly what I said 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.250
 above but all black you can do it 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.520
 with what you want but good as me 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.159
 I had too many blacks 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.340
 and that's it and that's it, so we're going to 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:13.670
 do the ironing to see how it is and 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.590
 and to have all the pieces the same as 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.080
 nothing give it in half circular form 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.569
 temperature on one side and then on the 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.069
 another one and you see how it looks tough and 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.349
 totally stuck let's do the 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.290
 assembly we started to assemble the faces 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:30.440
 of the cube you already know on the sides the 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.000
 the questions the black background and the 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.620
 top part where you enter the 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.900
 coins but not everyone already 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.940
 will recognize that it is the cube of mario bros 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.610
 in the typical you headbut it goes out 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.049
 there the extra life or the little turtle 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.660
 I know because I'm not played much but 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.760
 well you know what these are for 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.950
 cubes so let's start throwing 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.209
 coins because this has to be trained and 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.120
 you have to save for tomorrow 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.680
 have the money and buy things 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.860
 interesting and good I hope you like it 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.319
 and you see the utility and well 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.420
 ye therefore can not be opened for 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.910
 to take the money from us, because you see it 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.090
 with a glue this instant and if 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.890
 not so 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.599
 he does not do it I'm not going to leave him stuck 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.640
 because I prefer the day tomorrow because no 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.370
 break the bucket to take out the money like this 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.680
 how good this is the hama beach cube 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.620
 and you can see this photo this epic photo 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.959
 where I am with those of the companions of 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.510

 with materials of a hotel is a pass 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:42.909
 you know super simple but a 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.959
 spectacular result now yes we
