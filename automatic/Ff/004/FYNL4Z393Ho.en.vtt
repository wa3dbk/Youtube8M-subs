00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.810
 I'm all hero biker hd and in this 

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:12.009
 I'm going to show you a video of 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:14.540
 how to update the 4th silvero selection 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.820
 black version in my case of the black 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.390
 for those who do not know, they just pulled out 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:24.980
 on February 4 an update 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:27.840
 so let's see is not good as 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.720
 you can see the screen is late 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.030
 in several ways then through the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.090
 own grass of his goal program but 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.860
 the shoulder study 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.710
 or we can also use manually 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.660
 what we are going to do 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.070
 automatically through the program and 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.410
 nothing is going to it what we have to 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.730
 do is take out the information in case 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.950
 perhaps it is lost 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.050
 the second is to connect 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.120
 I recommend that you go in the last 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.450
 version of the program that in fact what 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.450
 trip 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:06.470
 but just in case we do not have much 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.840
 work when we download let's see 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.340
 what steps do we have to follow a good 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.080
 once we have installed the program that 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.150
 is basically give it to next 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.860
 next next next and if what 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.300
 you have installed is going to ask you 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.390
 if you want to uninstall the old one 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.140
 installation that if what we have to 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.940
 do is 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.110
 to my program 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.110
 let's have the camera while 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:38.580
 we are going to connect it and it is assumed that 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:42.610
 I should warn you that the room 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.189
 as we see the screen is warning of 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.350
 that there is a new succession and if we want 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.090
 update it in another option from now on 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.860
 how to install the update 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.890
 to show 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.409
 here he puts you 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.810
 in some of the features 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.990
 functions that you add or modify from 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.990
 that already exist 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.700
 good will depend on the version that 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.880
 let's have 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.190
 the version serves black black 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.830
 modify some things or add some things or 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.750
 do not 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.720
 well we hope it is used 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.810
 turn off the camera during installation 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.840
 they are feeling 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.910
 It is normal 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.670
 get to a point like the one now that 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.370
 it does not turn off in fact the main one for 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.750
 slower and is already installing the 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.970
 association of one bishop 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.830
 and when the top is updated , 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.420
 will turn off turn on to 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.050
 turn on 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.940
 and nothing when I finish apart in the 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.350
 computer screen will tell us that already 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.120
 be stuck 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.550
 I think self initiated the camera or 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.990
 Yes, I do believe that it was authorized 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.990
 the camera usually looks already 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.709
 Anyway, I'm sitting in the mountains 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.709
 it tells us that it is already updated 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.910
 we do not have files I already know nothing 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.030
 we would have the camera updated the 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.710
 current version that is the day 4 of 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.690
 February version 2.0 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.420
 and good 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.810
 that is, one of the functions that 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.810
 I would bring the 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.650
 the association or the improvements you have 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.290
 what to bring 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.400
 good things that have added or 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.959
 modified is in timelapse mode at 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.400
 restore photos in so link mode 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.989
 automatically converts them into videos 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.439
 we have to go through it 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.440
 go pro program unless we have 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:44.710
 to modify something clear 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.080
 in the little offside passion even that 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.430
 we can put the menu that the 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.980
 upside down menu to put the camera at 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.750
 reverse to record there is now a choice of 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.640
 put it automatically is to say when 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.520
 we acquire the camera automatically in 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.190
 the program of a mobile phone prode 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.600
 will remove the image yes yes if we give 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.070
 record and respective problems in the 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.880
 image is modeled after the post or guzmÃ¡n 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.190
 before the between seconds what 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.380
 admitted for 30 images will now emit 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.850
 up to 6 seconds for 30 images what 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.320
 and it will allow us to record from the 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.660
 speed actions for more 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.430
 weather 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.919
 for the r4 silver 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.990
 we can see the highlights that are 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:27.320
 marked better the moment the user 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.650
 leave while you record we can see it in 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.240
 the screen that brings the camera itself 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.220
 and choose a white box 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.240
 in resolution 7 we can record 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:41.330
 up to 240 fps and in 2.7 cam we can 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.610
 record up to 60 fps and almost everything but 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.289
 was adopted you give the aik you give to 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.300
 favorite he shares for the people who 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.050
 do not know and nothing gives us a following 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.050
 goodbye videos
