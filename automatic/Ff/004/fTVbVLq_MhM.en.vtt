 after the clean 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.690
 the ultimate goal but at the same time 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.560
 keep it 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.600
 then you can still register along the e40 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.600
 also nicely included in the first place to frame 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.220

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.099

 the room at the restaurant 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:44.079
 Then all the details of the acquisition are meaning that all hope so 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:48.699
 it is just as beautiful as your extreme right-wing church there 8 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.530
 since then the same appearance as the start has exploded with a hero 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:57.560
 currently the exponent of 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.329
 is alone 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.689
 are these 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.689
 and we will see that 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.789
 it was super fun but with the family and I don't mind very much 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:03.749
 according to him a bit 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:06.909
 however, that does not mean the presence of p 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.469
 and in the meantime I am home again and I am going to the final game 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:13.749
 I got to know the home screen with what to drink
