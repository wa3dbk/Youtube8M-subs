00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
the creek and it was a good job I put a

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.080 
the creek and it was a good job I put a
light<00:04:09.630> out<00:04:09.830> don't<00:04:10.830> often<00:04:11.040> put<00:04:11.490> lights<00:04:11.760> on<00:04:11.970> the

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
light out don't often put lights on the

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.760 
light out don't often put lights on the
boat<00:04:12.240> when<00:04:12.420> I'm<00:04:12.540> really<00:04:12.870> shoved<00:04:13.260> up<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.500> creek

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
boat when I'm really shoved up a creek

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.550 
boat when I'm really shoved up a creek
but<00:04:14.550> certainly<00:04:15.480> I<00:04:15.570> think<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:16.109> skipper<00:04:16.410> of

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
but certainly I think the skipper of

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.860 
but certainly I think the skipper of
Jolene<00:04:17.040> would<00:04:17.280> have<00:04:17.370> had<00:04:17.579> good<00:04:18.359> reason<00:04:18.840> to

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
Jolene would have had good reason to

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.530 
Jolene would have had good reason to
complain<00:04:19.310> had<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.400> not<00:04:20.549> had<00:04:20.700> a<00:04:20.760> light<00:04:20.970> on<00:04:21.180> so

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
complain had I not had a light on so

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.170 
complain had I not had a light on so
from<00:04:21.870> that<00:04:21.959> occasion<00:04:22.440> yeah<00:04:23.190> would<00:04:23.880> I<00:04:23.910> have<00:04:24.150> a

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
from that occasion yeah would I have a

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.510 
from that occasion yeah would I have a
light<00:04:24.419> if<00:04:24.600> I<00:04:24.720> was<00:04:24.870> above<00:04:25.140> where<00:04:25.950> Jolene<00:04:26.490> is

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
light if I was above where Jolene is

00:04:26.520 --> 00:05:29.519 
light if I was above where Jolene is
moored
