destructible study stars rain down and
destroy<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.920> train<00:01:57.280> thus<00:01:58.090> bringing<00:01:58.930> you

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
destroy the train thus bringing you

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.820 
destroy the train thus bringing you
farther<00:01:59.740> and<00:01:59.980> farther<00:02:00.250> down<00:02:01.710> into<00:02:02.710> the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
farther and farther down into the

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.860 
farther and farther down into the
surface<00:02:03.280> will<00:02:04.060> say<00:02:06.330> so<00:02:07.330> I<00:02:07.360> mean<00:02:07.600> that<00:02:07.720> was<00:02:07.840> the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
surface will say so I mean that was the

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.490 
surface will say so I mean that was the
idea<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:09.360> decided<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:10.510> go<00:02:10.600> with<00:02:10.660> vector<00:02:11.020> art<00:02:11.170> for

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
idea I decided to go with vector art for

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.310 
idea I decided to go with vector art for
this<00:02:11.650> game<00:02:11.830> because<00:02:12.480> first<00:02:13.480> off<00:02:13.720> it's<00:02:13.960> 48

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
this game because first off it's 48

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.660 
this game because first off it's 48
hours<00:02:14.680> so<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:14.920> know<00:02:15.160> I'm<00:02:15.280> not<00:02:15.310> going<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.610> be

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
hours so you know I'm not going to be

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.300 
hours so you know I'm not going to be
able<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.910> spending<00:02:16.270> much<00:02:17.050> time<00:02:17.080> on<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:18.130> art

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
able to spending much time on the art

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.250 
able to spending much time on the art
and<00:02:18.460> whatnot<00:02:18.940> mostly<00:02:19.450> gameplay<00:02:19.960> and

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
and whatnot mostly gameplay and

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.890 
and whatnot mostly gameplay and
mechanics<00:02:20.850> so<00:02:21.850> I<00:02:21.880> wanted<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.360> go<00:02:22.480> ahead<00:02:22.570> and

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
mechanics so I wanted to go ahead and

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.440 
mechanics so I wanted to go ahead and
make<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.230> simple<00:02:23.890> plus<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.610> fact<00:02:24.850> that<00:02:25.060> if<00:02:25.300> I

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
make it simple plus the fact that if I

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.750 
make it simple plus the fact that if I
even<00:02:25.720> did<00:02:25.990> try<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.350> make<00:02:26.590> good<00:02:26.800> art<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.280> would

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
even did try to make good art it would

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.030 
even did try to make good art it would
not<00:02:27.940> look<00:02:28.150> good<00:02:28.210> at<00:02:28.390> all<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:28.960> those<00:02:29.740> of<00:02:29.950> you

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
not look good at all and those of you

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.320 
not look good at all and those of you
that<00:02:30.160> have<00:02:30.280> watched<00:02:30.490> me<00:02:30.670> for<00:02:30.850> a<00:02:30.880> long<00:02:31.060> time

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
that have watched me for a long time

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.360 
that have watched me for a long time
would<00:02:31.570> know<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:31.780> my<00:02:32.320> art<00:02:32.560> is<00:02:32.740> absolutely

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
would know that my art is absolutely

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.210 
would know that my art is absolutely
terrible<00:02:33.810> with<00:02:34.810> tutorials<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.560> whatnot<00:02:35.890> so<00:02:36.100> I

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
terrible with tutorials and whatnot so I

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.370 
terrible with tutorials and whatnot so I
have<00:02:36.910> my<00:02:37.060> own<00:02:37.090> artists<00:02:37.540> for<00:02:37.720> personal

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
have my own artists for personal

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.190 
have my own artists for personal
projects<00:02:38.830> but<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.280> know<00:02:39.370> since<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:40.330> Ludum

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
projects but you know since the Ludum

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.500 
projects but you know since the Ludum
dare<00:02:41.490> 48-hour<00:02:42.490> competition<00:02:43.150> is<00:02:43.360> just<00:02:45.510> just

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
dare 48-hour competition is just just

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.180 
dare 48-hour competition is just just
you'd<00:02:46.780> solo<00:02:47.290> unless<00:02:47.500> you're<00:02:47.740> doing<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:47.980> gym

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
you'd solo unless you're doing the gym

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.890 
you'd solo unless you're doing the gym
then<00:02:48.430> then<00:02:48.940> you<00:02:49.030> can't<00:02:49.240> have<00:02:49.300> other<00:02:49.570> people

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
then then you can't have other people

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.320 
then then you can't have other people
working<00:02:50.830> with<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:51.400> that<00:02:51.790> type<00:02:52.150> of<00:02:52.180> stuff

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
working with you and that type of stuff

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.430 
working with you and that type of stuff
so<00:02:53.140> so<00:02:53.620> yeah<00:02:53.770> it's<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.190> simple<00:02:54.610> idea<00:02:55.050> you<00:02:56.050> know<00:02:56.170> a

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
so so yeah it's a simple idea you know a

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.860 
so so yeah it's a simple idea you know a
lot<00:02:57.220> of<00:02:57.250> this<00:02:57.550> a<00:02:57.820> lot<00:02:58.150> of<00:02:58.240> the<00:02:58.330> time<00:02:58.570> that<00:02:58.750> was

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
lot of this a lot of the time that was

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.500 
lot of this a lot of the time that was
spent<00:02:58.900> was<00:02:59.410> on<00:02:59.620> design<00:03:00.010> issues<00:03:00.400> I<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:01.180> know<00:03:01.300> at

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
spent was on design issues I you know at

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.060 
spent was on design issues I you know at
this<00:03:01.750> at<00:03:02.050> one<00:03:02.290> point<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.709> game<00:03:02.920> you're

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
this at one point the game you're

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.190 
this at one point the game you're
looking<00:03:03.520> at<00:03:03.700> right<00:03:03.760> now<00:03:04.090> was<00:03:04.810> nowhere<00:03:05.140> close

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
looking at right now was nowhere close

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.770 
looking at right now was nowhere close
to<00:03:05.560> what<00:03:05.920> it<00:03:06.040> looked<00:03:06.250> like<00:03:06.340> maybe<00:03:07.150> 12<00:03:07.480> hours

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
to what it looked like maybe 12 hours

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.050 
to what it looked like maybe 12 hours
ago<00:03:07.930> you<00:03:08.560> know<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.950> was<00:03:09.310> completely<00:03:09.640> different

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
ago you know it was completely different

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.460 
ago you know it was completely different
the<00:03:10.150> wreck<00:03:10.300> an<00:03:10.510> ins<00:03:10.720> there<00:03:11.020> were<00:03:11.110> different

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
the wreck an ins there were different

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.670 
the wreck an ins there were different
room<00:03:12.070> levels<00:03:12.550> and<00:03:12.760> such<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:13.690> mean<00:03:14.050> it<00:03:14.230> was

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
room levels and such so I mean it was

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.540 
room levels and such so I mean it was
nothing<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.370> what<00:03:15.520> you<00:03:15.640> see<00:03:15.820> right<00:03:15.850> now<00:03:17.550> so

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
nothing to what you see right now so

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.520 
nothing to what you see right now so
yeah<00:03:18.850> with<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.239> game<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.450> just<00:03:19.750> I<00:03:19.930> wanted<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.410> go

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
yeah with the game I just I wanted to go

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.270 
yeah with the game I just I wanted to go
for<00:03:20.770> a<00:03:20.830> really<00:03:21.550> fast<00:03:22.030> pace<00:03:22.709> like<00:03:23.709> what<00:03:24.130> the

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
for a really fast pace like what the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.090 
for a really fast pace like what the
hell<00:03:24.459> am<00:03:24.610> i<00:03:24.730> doing<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.570> know<00:03:25.690> there's<00:03:26.100> things

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
hell am i doing you know there's things

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.770 
hell am i doing you know there's things
going<00:03:27.310> everywhere<00:03:27.910> particles<00:03:28.570> everywhere

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
going everywhere particles everywhere

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.320 
going everywhere particles everywhere
you<00:03:29.380> know<00:03:29.500> you<00:03:29.560> got<00:03:30.360> you<00:03:31.360> know<00:03:31.390> these<00:03:33.330> blocks

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
you know you got you know these blocks

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.900 
you know you got you know these blocks
you<00:03:34.750> know<00:03:34.870> so<00:03:35.110> every<00:03:35.709> every<00:03:36.250> playthrough<00:03:36.640> is

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
you know so every every playthrough is

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.850 
you know so every every playthrough is
different<00:03:37.390> as<00:03:37.570> far<00:03:37.600> as<00:03:38.050> how<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.440> level<00:03:38.800> is

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
different as far as how the level is

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.130 
different as far as how the level is
constructed<00:03:39.430> because<00:03:39.670> these<00:03:39.880> stars<00:03:40.660> just<00:03:40.959> go

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
constructed because these stars just go

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.800 
constructed because these stars just go
ahead<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:41.380> destroy<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.520> level<00:03:42.850> for<00:03:43.030> you<00:03:43.209> so<00:03:43.780> I

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
ahead and destroy the level for you so I

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.449 
ahead and destroy the level for you so I
thought<00:03:44.080> it<00:03:44.170> was<00:03:44.230> pretty<00:03:44.410> cool<00:03:44.680> so<00:03:45.040> basically

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
thought it was pretty cool so basically

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.229 
thought it was pretty cool so basically
again<00:03:45.760> it<00:03:46.000> is<00:03:46.239> to<00:03:46.540> survive<00:03:47.020> and<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:48.640> you<00:03:49.120> can

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
again it is to survive and and you can

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.580 
again it is to survive and and you can
get<00:03:49.330> some<00:03:49.480> cool<00:03:49.660> stuff<00:03:49.840> there<00:03:50.290> in<00:03:50.500> the

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
get some cool stuff there in the

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.790 
get some cool stuff there in the
beginning<00:03:50.680> as<00:03:51.160> you<00:03:51.310> saw<00:03:51.750> you<00:03:52.750> can<00:03:53.050> customize

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
beginning as you saw you can customize

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.410 
beginning as you saw you can customize
