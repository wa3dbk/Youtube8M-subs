00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
else it doesn't look the same because I

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.039 
else it doesn't look the same because I
got<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.280> part<00:01:02.309> going<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:02.969> over<00:01:03.210> there<00:01:03.329> or

whatever so and it looks more natural
for<00:01:06.900> some<00:01:07.080> reason<00:01:07.470> with<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.159> part<00:01:08.479> but<00:01:09.479> it

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
for some reason with the part but it

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.149 
for some reason with the part but it
looks<00:01:09.869> nice<00:01:10.080> like<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.590> too<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:13.040> didn't<00:01:14.040> put
