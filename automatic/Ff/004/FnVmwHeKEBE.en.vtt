00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
eyebrow and then go measure right around

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.300 
eyebrow and then go measure right around
there<00:01:35.960> then<00:01:36.229> use<00:01:36.409> the<00:01:36.590> chart<00:01:36.860> on<00:01:37.039> the<00:01:37.159> website

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
there then use the chart on the website

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.639 
there then use the chart on the website
to<00:01:37.820> determine<00:01:38.329> what<00:01:38.479> size<00:01:38.750> that<00:01:38.810> you<00:01:39.200> need<00:01:39.229> and

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
to determine what size that you need and

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.550 
to determine what size that you need and
then<00:01:40.100> let's<00:01:40.369> take<00:01:40.640> JC's<00:01:41.450> reference<00:01:41.990> if<00:01:42.229> it

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
then let's take JC's reference if it

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.350 
then let's take JC's reference if it
measured<00:01:42.950> out<00:01:43.039> to<00:01:43.310> be<00:01:43.429> like<00:01:43.580> an<00:01:43.700> extra-large

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
measured out to be like an extra-large

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.300 
measured out to be like an extra-large
maybe<00:01:44.840> grab<00:01:45.140> a<00:01:45.170> large<00:01:45.470> and<00:01:45.830> that's<00:01:46.159> what

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
maybe grab a large and that's what

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.350 
maybe grab a large and that's what
worked<00:01:46.490> out<00:01:46.640> good<00:01:46.789> for<00:01:47.000> him

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
worked out good for him

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.169 
worked out good for him
now<00:01:47.929> this<00:01:48.140> helmet<00:01:48.380> actually<00:01:48.979> comes<00:01:49.250> in<00:01:49.640> three

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
now this helmet actually comes in three

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:51.820 
now this helmet actually comes in three
different<00:01:50.299> colorways<00:01:50.899> it<00:01:51.110> comes<00:01:51.320> in<00:01:51.470> a<00:01:51.500> gloss
