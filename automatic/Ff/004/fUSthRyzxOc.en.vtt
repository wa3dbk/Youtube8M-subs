00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
dust in them good news is that our lungs

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.459 
dust in them good news is that our lungs
have<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.730> great<00:00:48.140> capability<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.260> clean

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
have a great capability to clean

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.369 
have a great capability to clean
themselves<00:00:49.820> but<00:00:50.820> if<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.270> do<00:00:51.780> our<00:00:51.930> day<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.199> day

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
themselves but if we do our day to day

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.709 
themselves but if we do our day to day
stuff<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:53.010> know<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.579> going<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.969> shop<00:00:54.210> doing

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
stuff you know just going to shop doing

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.750 
stuff you know just going to shop doing
your<00:00:54.840> stuff<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.199> computers<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:56.100> only<00:00:56.280> use<00:00:56.579> our

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
your stuff on computers we only use our

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.099 
your stuff on computers we only use our
own<00:00:56.850> 50<00:00:57.210> percent<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.690> our<00:00:57.780> lungs

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
own 50 percent of our lungs

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.889 
own 50 percent of our lungs
so<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> do<00:00:59.219> go<00:00:59.430> out<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.850> run<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.570> actually

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
so if you do go out and run you actually

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.360 
so if you do go out and run you actually
flushed<00:01:01.199> your<00:01:01.379> lungs<00:01:01.680> through<00:01:01.920> with<00:01:02.129> fresh

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
flushed your lungs through with fresh

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.250 
flushed your lungs through with fresh
air<00:01:02.640> give<00:01:03.059> them<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.329> really<00:01:03.600> good<00:01:03.780> chance<00:01:04.019> to

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
air give them a really good chance to

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.870 
air give them a really good chance to
clean<00:01:04.470> themselves<00:01:04.650> at<00:01:05.040> least<00:01:05.280> couple<00:01:05.460> times<00:01:05.760> a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
clean themselves at least couple times a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.330 
clean themselves at least couple times a
week<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.360> medical<00:01:07.260> research<00:01:07.560> shows<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.220> you

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
week a medical research shows that you

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.609 
week a medical research shows that you
can<00:01:08.490> actually<00:01:08.820> fight<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.210> flu<00:01:09.479> 33<00:01:10.229> percent

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
can actually fight the flu 33 percent

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.679 
can actually fight the flu 33 percent
more<00:01:10.710> efficiently<00:01:11.369> when<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.970> go<00:01:12.150> for<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> small

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
more efficiently when you go for a small

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.580 
more efficiently when you go for a small
job<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.740> reason<00:01:14.070> behind<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.930> 99%<00:01:15.930> of

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
job the reason behind it is that 99% of

stagnate you know a lot of bad things
are<00:01:29.549> gonna<00:01:29.670> grow<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.000> there<00:01:30.150> but<00:01:30.360> if<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.540> move

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
are gonna grow in there but if you move

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.840 
are gonna grow in there but if you move
around<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.590> know<00:01:31.770> give<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.430> lot<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.700> oxygen

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
around you know give it a lot of oxygen

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.399 
around you know give it a lot of oxygen
you<00:01:33.360> know<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:33.570> gotta<00:01:33.720> be<00:01:33.780> good<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.229> clear

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
you know it's gotta be good and clear

researchers<00:01:44.670> don't<00:01:44.850> know<00:01:44.970> exactly<00:01:45.090> why<00:01:45.780> this

researchers don't know exactly why this

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.719 
researchers don't know exactly why this
but<00:01:46.470> they<00:01:46.590> suggest<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.220> because<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
but they suggest it's because of the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.120 
but they suggest it's because of the
spawning<00:01:48.000> motion<00:01:48.479> for<00:01:48.810> your<00:01:48.930> body<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.409> this

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
spawning motion for your body and this

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.010 
spawning motion for your body and this
motion<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.640> good<00:01:50.880> for<00:01:51.119> your<00:01:51.210> lymphatic<00:01:51.509> system

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
motion is good for your lymphatic system

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.950 
motion is good for your lymphatic system
I<00:01:52.259> hope<00:01:52.860> I'm<00:01:53.040> saying<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.399> right<00:01:53.610> but<00:01:54.180> what<00:01:54.840> is

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
I hope I'm saying it right but what is

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.749 
I hope I'm saying it right but what is
that<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.590> system<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.009> westerns<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.579> knots

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
that it's a system of westerns and knots

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.969 
that it's a system of westerns and knots
all<00:01:57.000> over<00:01:57.390> your<00:01:57.509> body<00:01:57.780> where<00:01:58.140> cells<00:01:58.439> go<00:01:58.799> and

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
all over your body where cells go and

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.789 
all over your body where cells go and
dump<00:01:59.250> their<00:01:59.430> waste<00:01:59.460> and<00:02:00.000> toxins<00:02:00.259> so<00:02:01.259> it's<00:02:01.590> not

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
dump their waste and toxins so it's not

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.100 
dump their waste and toxins so it's not
connected<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.340> heart<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.479> relies<00:02:03.869> on<00:02:03.899> the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
connected to heart so it relies on the

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.020 
connected to heart so it relies on the
external<00:02:04.770> factors<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.369> get<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.640> fluids
