00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.840
 And there you are, beauty that is the Philippi together. 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.400
 bringing you another video 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.559
 commented gameplay 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.170
 this time I was in a black gameplay 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.109
 ops 2 of the drone map is a kindle ef met 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.670
 a ground office 2834 to 0 bar 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.289
 nuclear right 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.050
 It's kind of hard for this. 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.580
 to happen is to get nuclear between n is more 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.619
 complicated of what you are getting and the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.990
 mini show of politician who has more time 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.450
 for you to do that and still 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.579
 It's not just killing, it's still got to do. 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.129
 other objectives in addition to these 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.260
 game templates already in the pdm is just to kill 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.070
 usually tdm ends around 15 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.820
 minutes at most and only minutes 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.680
 75 kilos then you have to make 30 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.230
 75 and still only in the gun né 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.140
 in case I did four with light strike and 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.239
 30 with the gun beauty I hope you guys 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.940
 like the gameplay to my view was very 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.949
 very good and I was able to pick up who 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.809
 liked the video do not forget to give a 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.600
 like to help me is for those who do not know 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.549
 I've been away from YouTube for six months. 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.310
 Now I'm coming back, I have five 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.409
 new videos who did not see gave a 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.290
 past videos and there 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.240
 I leave the channel and take a look do not forget 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.409
 to leave evaluation in all beauty 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.630
 because this really is very important 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.460
 whether you are enjoying or not the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.790
 Review videos is also always very 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.950
 Welcome and it's good if you can see that I 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.380
 I'm using a fitness squash setup 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.150
 very cool because most of them do not 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.210
 are the lethal coffers 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.700
 I'm using and the wave blackbird or better 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.189
 the orbital insight is the flame of blackbird 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.049
 because from the backoffice a call of 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.030
 blackberry and now in the restaurant calls 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.159
 of blackbird but I know it's the site 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.909
 orbital on the site both does 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.890
 they are two non-lethal coffers 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.420
 it will only show the location of the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.060
 other enemies in a pension will 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.409
 helping to kill the enemies in the area 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.030
 what it takes for you is catching 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.040
 nuclear and already Wesley Strick is a 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.200
 escort that I really like because in 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.179
 most times I can kill one 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.910
 good staff especially when the map 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.990
 it's wide open and it's small 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.550
 good 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.910
 and today I would like to bring as 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.760
 Subject Focus Moab Nuclei or Nuclear 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.130
 which is the coolest with more fun and 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.620
 if these things are good things to have 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.780
 a type game is something that will do the 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.580
 game stay cool because you go 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.710
 have an extra attraction for the game to 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.350
 get caught so let's assume that 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.810
 you've got me sweat our laziness 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.120
 man where I make more you have this 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.800
 secret talkiewicz that will be a core 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.480
 nuclear mobile 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.830
 I would like to talk about the three that 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.050
 Today is fast I will try not to 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.610
 explained basic in what each one but I think 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.130
 that most of you playing code 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.260
 You must know the look. 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.720
 basically you have to do 25 kills 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.690
 either with the gun or with your 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.350
 you get 25,000 without dying you 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.830
 receives the link you have to 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.870
 activate as fiuk do not get secrets ing 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.860
 There is no way to appear so you have to 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:16.080
 take it out on your uncle of diskin 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.970
 strix oab I do not need mobile it's secret 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.950
 then you reach 25 pounds with only 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.190
 the weapon without the spirits you can 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.100
 release he's using 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.550
 Only the look ends with the match, right? 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.800
 the mob only kills the players of the 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.900
 opponent and nuclear team what is a 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.610
 place on a pump or anything and only in the 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.290
 title you receive right? 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.120
 but I think how hard it is to get 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.300
 a clear because they are 30 that uses only 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.370
 with the gun and got one more thing more 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.810
 cool because I do not like these very much 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.330
 tron ampoules pumps 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.360
 the whole team or that ends the 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.220
 game because you end up with the game 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.520
 literally because it happens that the 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.650
 who are only the champion behind these 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.080
 secret kits and this is a good thing 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.420
 boring game only seen it from the emirate 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.040
 That was to get the avaí so if you just heard 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.570
 Face fish in the pari 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.550
 though he was about to try to catch the 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.280
 abner I was a bit boring 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.500
 I was very much at it very early in 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.600
 trading the currency and carry three and the core 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.650
 Always we find a room or 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.840
 other right 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.860
 a bourgeois to turn money into the 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.870
 other not alone said they know is and gives a 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.980
 such another and ends up getting what ends 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.900
 with the tax part 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.190
 things really really annoying I do not 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.500
 liked at least 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.260
 so in my opinion if you have nothing 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.480
 or have a nuclear-like business will be 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.440
 coolest next code is the code 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.510
 goals 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.060
 it is all indications that the 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.560
 mobile phone goes yes that this order 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.290
 Explain if I'm not mistaken, I love you. 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.120
 that I acted here said that it will take 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.980
 gameplay game we also see more 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.930
 I think if it's one more thing 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.730
 quiet nuclear kind will be more 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.500
 cool if it's a thing like never a 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.780
 a habit that the staff will only be behind 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.030
 You will be alone in this game alone. 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.140
 pushing to get it looking 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.680
 enjoy this will get a thing 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.150
 very annoying then nuclear 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.520
 It was a cool thing, a lot more. 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.410
 calm with a title go there and 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.790
 get your 30 that only with the gun you 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.680
 win the title and rest assured 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.920
 they are even using this clear team 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.050
 in this gameplay is and even when it appears 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.270
 in the left corner underneath the map 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.630
 when it was intended to achieve 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.460
 or send it looks so sic to anyone who does not 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.290
 You know what the title is, but even though 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.640
 at that time of the championship everyone already 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.830
 they should know how it is 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.540
 so I guess that's it folks I hope 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.280
 You liked the video was a 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.990
 Exception liked the gameplay I put 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.760
 the 15 on the side that is something that I 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.810
 I've never done any mobile and 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.280
 nothing like 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.250
 but this time I did the other surgery 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.080
 but there province beauty is this personal 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.130
 If you liked, do not forget to rate it. 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.600
 positively 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.480
 leave your comment telling your 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.130
 opinions people can discuss 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.870
 and if you liked the 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.000
 video subscribes to the channel to receive 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.530
 the next beauty is not that worth it 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.530
 said a hug and went
