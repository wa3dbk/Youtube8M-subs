some<00:01:57.689> more<00:01:57.899> which<00:01:58.140> are<00:01:58.320> going<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.799> be

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
some more which are going to be

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.010 
some more which are going to be
available<00:01:59.159> for<00:01:59.610> DLC<00:02:00.119> because<00:02:00.600> we've<00:02:00.780> seen

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
available for DLC because we've seen

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.080 
available for DLC because we've seen
that<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.350> past<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.430> don't<00:02:02.610> see<00:02:02.759> why<00:02:02.939> they

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
that in the past so I don't see why they

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.940 
that in the past so I don't see why they
wouldn't<00:02:03.270> do<00:02:03.420> for<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.750> game<00:02:03.960> but<00:02:04.799> that's

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
wouldn't do for this game but that's

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.219 
wouldn't do for this game but that's
pretty<00:02:05.130> much<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.399> for<00:02:05.640> now<00:02:06.049> healthy<00:02:07.049> you've

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
pretty much it for now healthy you've

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.350 
pretty much it for now healthy you've
seen<00:02:07.560> some<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:07.920> these<00:02:08.009> cameras<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.729> probably

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
seen some of these cameras and probably

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.790 
seen some of these cameras and probably
decided<00:02:09.810> which<00:02:09.959> ones<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.259> want<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.500> get<00:02:10.649> for

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
decided which ones you want to get for

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.930 
decided which ones you want to get for
yourself<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.700> was

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
yourself and I was

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.750
