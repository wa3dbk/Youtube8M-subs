00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
could do that man if I had a nickel for

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.060 
could do that man if I had a nickel for
every<00:00:35.550> time<00:00:35.760> somebody<00:00:36.239> said<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.860> well<00:00:37.860> then

Pollock<00:00:40.079> why<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:40.920> art<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.670> expensive<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.570> is

Pollock why is art so expensive this is

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.049 
Pollock why is art so expensive this is
a<00:00:42.780> very<00:00:43.079> tough<00:00:43.320> question<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:44.070> it's<00:00:44.640> kind<00:00:44.969> of

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
a very tough question and it's kind of

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.410 
a very tough question and it's kind of
entangled<00:00:45.899> among<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.469> many<00:00:46.530> different

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
entangled among so many different

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.610 
entangled among so many different
interdependent<00:00:48.420> factors<00:00:51.199> first<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.350> all<00:00:52.500> at

interdependent factors first of all at

interdependent factors first of all at
the<00:00:52.649> art<00:00:52.890> market<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.699> highly<00:00:54.420> speculative

the art market it's highly speculative

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.959 
the art market it's highly speculative
it's<00:00:55.500> kind<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.800> like<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.100> stock<00:00:56.309> market<00:00:56.340> if

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
it's kind of like the stock market if

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.180 
it's kind of like the stock market if
somebody<00:00:57.390> could<00:00:57.570> explain<00:00:58.079> exactly<00:00:58.649> why

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
somebody could explain exactly why

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.250 
somebody could explain exactly why
certain<00:00:59.699> stocks<00:01:00.030> go<00:01:00.270> up<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.750> certain<00:01:01.020> stocks

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
go down at certain times what to invest

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.770 
go down at certain times what to invest
in<00:01:04.290> what's<00:01:04.769> not<00:01:05.129> good<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.580> invest<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.119> if<00:01:06.450> there

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
in what's not good to invest in if there

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.810 
in what's not good to invest in if there
was<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> simple<00:01:07.320> answer<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.700> we

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
was a simple answer to that that we

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.000 
was a simple answer to that that we
would<00:01:08.939> all<00:01:09.090> be<00:01:09.119> rich<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.229> course<00:01:10.500> there's

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
would all be rich but of course there's

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.620 
would all be rich but of course there's
still<00:01:11.130> some<00:01:11.580> trends<00:01:12.030> as<00:01:12.119> some<00:01:12.299> general

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
still some trends as some general

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.050 
still some trends as some general
principles<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:13.380> why<00:01:13.680> some<00:01:14.040> artworks<00:01:14.520> are<00:01:14.820> more

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
principles on why some artworks are more

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.060 
principles on why some artworks are more
expensive<00:01:15.420> than<00:01:15.659> others<00:01:15.869> art<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> very

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
expensive than others art is a very

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.700 
expensive than others art is a very
scarce<00:01:17.670> resource<00:01:18.270> generally<00:01:18.960> when<00:01:19.200> an<00:01:19.320> artist

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
scarce resource generally when an artist

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.620 
scarce resource generally when an artist
makes<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.100> work<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.400> art<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:21.060> one<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.600> kind

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
makes a work of art it's one of a kind

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.649 
makes a work of art it's one of a kind
like<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> painting<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.670> individual<00:01:24.270> works<00:01:24.479> of

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
like a painting this individual works of

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.660 
like a painting this individual works of
art<00:01:24.780> are<00:01:24.930> more<00:01:25.140> valuable<00:01:25.619> than<00:01:25.799> mass-produced

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
art are more valuable than mass-produced

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.370 
art are more valuable than mass-produced
products<00:01:27.210> like<00:01:27.479> those<00:01:27.630> things<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.049> buy<00:01:28.170> from

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
products like those things you buy from

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.380 
products like those things you buy from
Walmart<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.950> says<00:01:29.130> made<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.430> China<00:01:29.700> this

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
Walmart that says made in China this

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.260 
Walmart that says made in China this
also<00:01:31.320> made<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.740> China<00:01:31.979> but<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.909> one<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.180> a

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
also made in China but this is one of a

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.710 
also made in China but this is one of a
kind

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
kind

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.780 
kind
so<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.500> general<00:01:34.650> things<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.310> are<00:01:35.430> unique

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
so in general things that are unique

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.899 
so in general things that are unique
often<00:01:36.270> have<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> higher<00:01:36.810> value<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:37.530> our<00:01:37.650> society

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
often have a higher value in our society

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.679 
often have a higher value in our society
you<00:01:38.909> can<00:01:39.060> always<00:01:39.180> build<00:01:39.509> another

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
you can always build another

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.020 
you can always build another
million-dollar<00:01:40.500> home<00:01:40.829> but<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.400> can't<00:01:41.640> really

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
million-dollar home but you can't really

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.410 
million-dollar home but you can't really
paint<00:01:42.450> another<00:01:42.750> Monet<00:01:43.549> cuz<00:01:44.549> Monet's<00:01:44.880> dead

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
paint another Monet cuz Monet's dead

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.289 
paint another Monet cuz Monet's dead
and<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.409> reason<00:01:46.829> why<00:01:47.100> sometimes<00:01:48.000> an

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
and this is a reason why sometimes an

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.030 
and this is a reason why sometimes an
artist's<00:01:48.720> work<00:01:48.750> will<00:01:49.110> become<00:01:49.259> more<00:01:49.590> valuable

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
artist's work will become more valuable

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.880 
artist's work will become more valuable
when<00:01:50.460> he<00:01:50.729> or<00:01:50.790> she<00:01:50.850> dies<00:01:51.240> because<00:01:51.990> they're<00:01:52.530> not

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
when he or she dies because they're not

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.039 
when he or she dies because they're not
really<00:01:53.100> around<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.820> produce<00:01:54.119> more<00:01:54.540> which
