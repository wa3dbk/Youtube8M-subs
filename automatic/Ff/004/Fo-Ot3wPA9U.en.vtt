00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.450
 any charger for 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.260
 car and other batteries in 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:27.110
 should consist of three main nodes 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.689
 this is first of all a power supply unit face let's say 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.870
 power transformer or pulse 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.110
 power supply control circuit then 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.330
 there is 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.800
 voltage limiter 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:42.290
 current and of course the protection circuit here 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.590
 about the protection scheme we are today and 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:49.269
 let's talk this scheme was proposed 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:53.479
 on one of the friendly radio sites 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:55.820
 used as a security block in 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:58.729
 charger circuit for say 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.019
 car batteries built on 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.470
 the basis of powerful 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.269
 n channel field-effect transistor 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.850
 which is not critical you can use 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.530
 for convenience let's say cheap transistor 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:16.850
 from motherboards or more powerful 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:20.380
 example erased 44 with a permissible current 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:24.219
 through the transition somewhere 50 amp 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.119
 the course of work on an average load and there to 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:29.570
 multi- amp field effect transistor 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.659
 heat will not be but desirable 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.640
 install on a small heat sink 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.530
 low-power control transistor 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.969
 reverse bipolar transistor 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.850
 conductivity in this embodiment 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:46.460
 transistor 2 with 945 involved 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.380
 next we have in the circuit LED 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.829
 which suggests that on 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.509
 output overload or short circuit 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:56.749
 limiting resistor for the LED 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.719
 Well, actually the power noise from which 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:02.630
 readings as the scheme works 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.310
 when connected, that is, if the circuit 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.009
 it works fine 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.000
 short circuit over field 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.850
 the transistor is open through its transition by 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.450
 transistor rather power comes 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:21.170
 coming to the output of the circuit as soon as we 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.330
 Closing the output terminals we fall 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.090
 voltage noise RCs 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.160
 and the transition of the transistor is enough for 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:34.569
 to work 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:38.720
 the bottom transistor opens it in theory 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:40.790
 shunts the field effect transistor gate 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.310
 shunts to ground with this transistor 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:49.340
 completely locked and through 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.880
 simultaneously open bottom transition 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.440
 transistor vt2 we light up 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.670
 Light-emitting diode 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.360
 r9 resistor as already said 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.830
 restrictive for LED 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.130
 parallel to the led in reverse 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.180
 A low power diode is installed in the direction. 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.959
 vd1 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:12.380
 which is not critical can 1141 48 on 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:15.019
 any other diodes use from 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.110
 the rating of the shunt depends on the maximum current 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:21.970
 protection response less than nominal 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.380
 noise, the higher the current response well 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.930
 problematic to get such shunts 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.030
 let's say zero integer zero one it and therefore 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.100
 many radio amateurs just take 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.500
 some kind of wire and use in 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.200
 As a jester, there is actually no 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.829
 a pretty bad decision is the sale 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.260
 yellow say zero as much as 1st 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:48.549
 parallels quiet get lower impedance 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:51.530
 jester I acted like wrong yes 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:55.579
 used as a shunt small 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.709
 I have an iron wire 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.980
 because he has quite a lot 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.640
 resistance so we will feed 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.370
 two battery device 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.470
 consistently connected lithium ion 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.989
 all and 2 volts output voltage at 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.690
 connecting a 12 volt bulb to 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:17.780
 in a couple of watts of output power on 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:20.840
 glows when the output is closed 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:24.410
 contacts we have a LED and 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.630
 food is no longer coming to the output in 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.640
 short circuit mode can 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.650
 stay for a long time 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.870
 since the field effect transistor is reliable 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:37.520
 closed and the circuit basically nothing 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.650
 consumes almost well this circuit is fine 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.050
 will fit as originally said in 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.480
 quality 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.100
 protection up to pereplyusovki short 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.530
 short circuits for car chargers 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.260
 devices but you can use it 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.930
 can be used for charging and say 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.090
 lower volt 6 volts and even 4 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.090
 volt batteries well need 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.810
 consider the one thing that you are at the entrance 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.480
 the circuit should be power which 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.280
 enough to trigger the field 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.870
 transistor 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:14.330
 above three and a half 4 volts for 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.240
 I highly recommend initial tests 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:20.000
 variable on 1 to you replaced by 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.490
 forgive resistor on 1 kilo mayor 9 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.180
 replace with alternator with par 10 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.630
 kilo 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:30.830
 Here is the control scheme we have 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:33.590
 goes through the mass on this all not 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.900
 forget to subscribe to the channel leave 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:40.960
 your comments comments about further 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.960
