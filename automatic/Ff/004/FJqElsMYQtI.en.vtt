edges and veins on the leaves so I begin
by<00:00:42.870> laying<00:00:43.320> down<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.680> watery<00:00:44.280> wash<00:00:44.579> firstly<00:00:45.420> on

the green veins and edges to the leaves
and<00:00:47.760> then<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.989> leaves<00:00:49.170> themselves

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
and then on the leaves themselves

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.830 
and then on the leaves themselves
everywhere<00:00:50.520> except<00:00:51.000> for<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.270> most<00:00:51.449> prominent

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
with my darkest tone areas of the leaves

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.380 
with my darkest tone areas of the leaves
it's<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.650> same<00:01:07.860> colors<00:01:08.310> I'm<00:01:08.460> using<00:01:08.490> only<00:01:09.030> at<00:01:09.270> a

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
it's the same colors I'm using only at a

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:19.609 
it's the same colors I'm using only at a
much<00:01:09.659> thicker<00:01:10.049> consistency

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.039 

now<00:01:20.159> my<00:01:20.399> lightest<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.030> darkest<00:01:21.450> tones<00:01:21.719> are<00:01:21.899> in

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
now my lightest and darkest tones are in

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.080 
now my lightest and darkest tones are in
place<00:01:22.289> I<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:22.560> work<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.219> mid-tones<00:01:23.700> too<00:01:23.969> if

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
place I can work on the mid-tones too if

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.200 
place I can work on the mid-tones too if
the<00:01:24.329> leaves<00:01:24.539> there<00:01:24.810> form

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.040 

working<00:01:28.200> with<00:01:28.350> amid<00:01:28.680> consistency<00:01:29.460> wash<00:01:29.700> I

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
working with amid consistency wash I

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.870 
working with amid consistency wash I
concentrate<00:01:31.050> on<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.470> next<00:01:31.740> darkest<00:01:32.430> areas

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
concentrate on the next darkest areas

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.110 
concentrate on the next darkest areas
first<00:01:33.240> leaving<00:01:34.050> highlight<00:01:34.710> still<00:01:35.070> then<00:01:35.970> I

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
first leaving highlight still then I

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.030 
first leaving highlight still then I
water<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.600> mix<00:01:36.840> down<00:01:37.080> a<00:01:37.140> little<00:01:37.410> bit<00:01:37.650> more<00:01:37.890> and

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
water the mix down a little bit more and

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.070 
water the mix down a little bit more and
I<00:01:38.130> work<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.670> two<00:01:39.000> areas<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.630> highlight

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
I work in two areas of the highlight

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.040 
I work in two areas of the highlight
that<00:01:40.410> I<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.740> now<00:01:40.979> see<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.370> to<00:01:41.729> light<00:01:42.050> creating

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
that I can now see a to light creating

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.990 
that I can now see a to light creating
some<00:01:43.260> textured<00:01:43.800> markings<00:01:44.280> with<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> tip<00:01:44.880> of

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
some textured markings with the tip of

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.370 
some textured markings with the tip of
my<00:01:45.060> brush<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.750> those<00:01:46.080> areas<00:01:48.020> notice<00:01:49.020> how<00:01:49.229> I'm

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
my brush in those areas notice how I'm

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.650 
my brush in those areas notice how I'm
getting<00:01:49.560> lots<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.220> little<00:01:50.400> overlaps<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.300> paint

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
getting lots of little overlaps of paint

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.900 
getting lots of little overlaps of paint
and<00:01:51.990> yet<00:01:52.890> they're<00:01:53.160> working<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.760> my<00:01:53.880> advantage

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
and yet they're working to my advantage

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.450 
and yet they're working to my advantage
to<00:01:54.510> create<00:01:55.050> the<00:01:55.170> kind<00:01:55.440> of<00:01:55.530> texture<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.220> can

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
to create the kind of texture that I can

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:06.190 
to create the kind of texture that I can
see<00:01:56.760> there<00:01:57.150> on<00:01:57.360> Holly<00:01:57.690> leaves

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.559 

now<00:02:06.830> that<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.159> highlights<00:02:07.580> are<00:02:07.790> darker<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:08.300> can

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
now that the highlights are darker I can

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.240 
now that the highlights are darker I can
see<00:02:08.780> that<00:02:08.899> some<00:02:09.170> of<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.380> darker<00:02:09.740> parts<00:02:10.039> of<00:02:10.160> the

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
see that some of the darker parts of the

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.430 
see that some of the darker parts of the
leaves<00:02:10.459> need<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:11.030> be<00:02:11.120> even<00:02:11.510> darker<00:02:11.959> so<00:02:12.230> I<00:02:12.260> add

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
leaves need to be even darker so I add

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.140 
leaves need to be even darker so I add
another<00:02:12.739> layer<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.040> paint<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.550> those<00:02:13.700> parts

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
another layer of paint to those parts

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.300 
another layer of paint to those parts
with<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.870> paint<00:02:15.110> underneath<00:02:15.440> being<00:02:15.830> totally

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
with the paint underneath being totally

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.210 
with the paint underneath being totally
dry<00:02:16.750> again<00:02:17.750> I'm<00:02:17.930> getting<00:02:18.080> overlaps<00:02:18.860> with<00:02:19.069> my

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
dry again I'm getting overlaps with my

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.800 
dry again I'm getting overlaps with my
paint<00:02:19.520> but<00:02:19.730> it<00:02:19.849> actually<00:02:20.000> helps<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:20.599> create

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
paint but it actually helps to create

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.390 
paint but it actually helps to create
the<00:02:21.080> texture

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.720 

I<00:02:28.840> then<00:02:29.840> add<00:02:30.019> even<00:02:30.319> more<00:02:30.530> texture<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:31.519> the

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
I then add even more texture to the

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.789 
I then add even more texture to the
areas<00:02:32.120> of<00:02:32.269> bright<00:02:32.569> highlight<00:02:33.049> using<00:02:33.349> the<00:02:33.560> tip

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
areas of bright highlight using the tip

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.960 
areas of bright highlight using the tip
of<00:02:33.980> my<00:02:34.129> brush<00:02:34.189> and<00:02:34.640> some<00:02:34.879> thick<00:02:35.180> paint

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.330 

now<00:02:40.630> that<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.960> leaves<00:02:41.200> are<00:02:41.410> darker<00:02:41.830> overall<00:02:42.310> I

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
now that the leaves are darker overall I

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.040 
now that the leaves are darker overall I
can<00:02:42.730> judge<00:02:42.970> that<00:02:43.180> my<00:02:43.330> veins<00:02:43.630> should<00:02:43.900> actually

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
can judge that my veins should actually

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.380 
can judge that my veins should actually
be<00:02:44.380> darker<00:02:44.800> too<00:02:45.010> so<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:45.370> add<00:02:45.520> another<00:02:45.850> layer<00:02:46.180> on

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
be darker too so I add another layer on

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.540 
be darker too so I add another layer on
to<00:02:46.570> those<00:02:46.690> with<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.930> tiny<00:02:47.260> brush<00:02:47.650> when<00:02:48.400> the

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
to those with a tiny brush when the

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:59.420 
to those with a tiny brush when the
paint<00:02:48.940> around<00:02:49.300> them<00:02:49.600> is<00:02:49.780> now<00:02:50.080> completely<00:02:50.530> dry

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.119 

and<00:03:00.430> I<00:03:01.060> can<00:03:01.390> now<00:03:01.599> use<00:03:01.629> some<00:03:02.200> brown<00:03:02.500> paint<00:03:02.890> to

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
and I can now use some brown paint to

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.490 
and I can now use some brown paint to
create<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.580> pointy<00:03:04.030> spines<00:03:04.420> at<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.870> ends<00:03:05.349> of

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
create the pointy spines at the ends of

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.330 
create the pointy spines at the ends of
each<00:03:05.980> of<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.370> points<00:03:06.610> of<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.030> leaves<00:03:08.340> once

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
each of the points of the leaves once

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.160 
each of the points of the leaves once
I've<00:03:09.550> painted<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:10.180> dark<00:03:10.450> branch<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.110> the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
I've painted the dark branch and the

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.080 
I've painted the dark branch and the
berries<00:03:11.560> it's<00:03:11.800> easier<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.370> see<00:03:12.550> what<00:03:12.790> further

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
berries it's easier to see what further

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.699 
berries it's easier to see what further
areas<00:03:13.629> of<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.870> leaves<00:03:14.080> should<00:03:14.319> receive

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
areas of the leaves should receive

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.440 
areas of the leaves should receive
another<00:03:15.040> layer<00:03:15.310> of<00:03:15.459> paint<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:15.849> darken<00:03:16.239> them<00:03:16.360> up

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
another layer of paint to darken them up

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.280 
another layer of paint to darken them up
even<00:03:16.870> more

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
even more

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.380 
even more
this<00:03:17.920> requires<00:03:18.340> stepping<00:03:18.880> back<00:03:19.090> and

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
this requires stepping back and

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.449 
this requires stepping back and
comparing<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.319> painting<00:03:20.800> to<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:20.980> reference
