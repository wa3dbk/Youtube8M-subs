00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello friends without too many 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.730
 thank you for being here I am abrupt and 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.370
 like most of you probably 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.040
 you know last weekend it 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.110
 carried out the of 23 this convention 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.109
 where disney releases information 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.270
 about your future projects some of 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.300
 they already knew them but others 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.519
 they were a complete surprise hopefully that 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.710
 please this video and if it happens to me 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.420
 some movie since it is very many 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.490
 a lot of the information that was revealed 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.890
 during the event leave it here below in 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.320
 the comments for which we complement 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.290
 the same let's start for example with 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.450
 2015 this year in November comes the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.610
 tape the good die nas now we have 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.190
 the full trailer sports an animation 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.620
 very very advanced and a story 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.829
 endearing that on the one hand and on the other in 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.989
 December 18 will premiere episode 7 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.059
 of star wars this is something that everyone 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.730
 you knew but I did not want to leave 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.879
 pass it and put them out of this list 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.260
 On the other hand, since 2016, it has started a 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.090
 little more exciting because they are 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.250
 projects that we do not have much 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.300
 information for example in March it 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.610
 will premiere the cim 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.680
 its top since although we already have a 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.810
 teaser trailer which explains to us that 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.750
 it's a world where humans do not exist 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.570
 and even during the 23rd was given to 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.910
 know that shakira will be involved 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.480
 in the dubbing of this project in April 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.940
 from the same year 2016 will come the adaptation 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.560
 the action of the book of the forest 'I must 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.050
 admit that I 'm not a fan of what he does 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.570
 Disney to take animated classics and 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.430
 take them to live action however this 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.200
 I am excited because it already 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.870
 confirmed that it will have performances 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.210
 special voice like that of scarlett 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.220
 johansson as the snake christopher 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.930
 walken as the king of monkeys and bill 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.270
 Murray as it goes light just to mention 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.740
 some and even during the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.230
 convention some had the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.210
 opportunity to see advances in video and 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.490
 those who saw it assure that it is 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.670
 great only one month later in May 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.530
 of 2016 will be released the sequel to 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.540
 'Alice in Wonderland' 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.940
 tape that was directed by Tim Burton 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.770
 this will be called alice through 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.450
 mirror 'and will again have the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.730
 participation of johnny depp as the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.900
 crazy hatter I must admit that his 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.909
 predecessor 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.189
 of my liking therefore it is a project 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.260
 who did not pay much attention without 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:21.540
 However, in June, a 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.340
 long-awaited sequel looking for d'or and 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.620
 obviously it's the sequel of looking for 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.200
 Nemo will have Ellen again 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.659
 degenerate in dori's voice and it will be 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.849
 six months after the first one when 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.980
 Dore and remember his family was going to 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.709
 look for it at the end of the year between 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.599
 November and December 2016 will arrive 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.909
 a project that promises a lot 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.560
 her name is cute and she will have the 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.450
 participation of the rock 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.060
 this is an animation that will be placed 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.069
 2000 years ago apparently disney 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.470
 will continue with its tendency to empower 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.200
 to the female characters since the 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.120
 protagonist is obviously a girl and 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.760
 it has also been said that he will have the 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.650
 directors of the little mermaid and aladdin well 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.280
 which is a project that has a guarantee 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.319
 disney and in 2017 specifically in 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.450
 March we will have the light version 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.639
 action of beauty and the beast 'which 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.340
 has participation of emma watson 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:16.560
 like the beautiful dan stevens like the beast 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.780
 and it has even been mentioned that gastÃ³n 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.160
 will be played by luke evans 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.800
 It has also been confirmed that this 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.450
 movie will be a musical I tell them 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.910
 again that I'm not a fan of the 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.790
 adaptations live action of disney 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.010
 however for seeing emma watson 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:36.030
 would drop the ticket anywhere in June 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.800
 the same year 2017 will come toy story 4 the 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.670
 which has been said to be a kind of 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.680
 romantic comedy between betty boop and the 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.080
 I really do not know what to think about this post 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.330
 that, like many, it seemed to me that 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.459
 everything and story 3 closed perfectly 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.680
 to all this history however I do not know 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.170
 has said in the timeline where it 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.870
 finds maybe it could be between toy 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.060
 story 2 and toy story3 or after the 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.430
 toy story 3 events but let's remember 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.680
 that in toy story3 udi said that because 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.480
 he was not with them so he does not 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.459
 we know but the fact that it's called 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.530
 toy story 4 makes me think that 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.470
 possibly we will see the continuation of 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.660
 the events of that tape I do not like 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.120
 a lot but we'll have to wait and 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.639
 is confirmed we can not do anything to the 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.770
 respect and in June we will have a new 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.330
 delivery of pirates of the Caribbean I do not know 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.680
 nor in what number van have you confirmed 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.509
 that we will count again 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.820
 with the participation of johnny depp as 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:32.880
 jack sparrow or I mean the captain 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.740
 jack sparrow and will return the character of 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.840
 will turner that is played by 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.759
 orlando bloom remember that it is one of 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.460
 the favorites of the public and the one that 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:43.280
 started all this we just hope that 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.870
 with these two characters confirmed 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.750
 let's have the spirit of the first 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.150
 delivery at the end of 2017 will reach the 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.280
 coconut ribbon which will be inspired by 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.500
 the celebration of the day of the dead in 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.150
 mexico after a movie like the 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.340
 book of life directed and produced 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.500
 by the mexicans guillermo del toro and 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.729
 Jorge Gutierrez Disney will have to do 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.039
 something different 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:08.370
 However, looking to not lose 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:11.220
 essence of this holiday for 2018 it 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.590
 has confirmed the giant movie the 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.169
 which will be an animated adaptation of the 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.970
 story of jacques and beans 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.160
 has shown a conceptual art and looks 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.840
 very very well on the other hand it should be noted 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.000
 that despite having projects 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.099
 confirmed you do not have anything about your 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.030
 history and neither about its date of 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:32.430
 premiere such is the case of cars 3 which 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.130
 it says it could arrive in 2018 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.900
 and also of the incredible two so is 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.610
 this movie that showed us that is 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.890
 possible to lead a family of 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.110
 superheroes to the big screen which 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:46.410
 it is also said some sources assure 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:49.470
 could reach the end of 2017 or 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:52.740
 mid 2018 however if you 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:55.950
 premieres in 2017 at the latest they would have 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:58.470
 spent 13 years since the first one in 2004 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.570
 which was directed by brad bird and the 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.940
 which already ensures to be working in a 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.680
 script for this sequel the only good 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.990
 news in particular with the incredible 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.420
 two because cars 3 does not excite me much 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.980
 is that they are already confirmed leave me here 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.810
 down in your comments what is the 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.760
 movie that most expect from the next 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.280
 years not only disney but in 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.530
 general also so that it nurtures more 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.810
 this conversation and on the other hand it fits 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.440
 point out that I only mentioned 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.320
 star wars 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.720
 episode 7 and even despite being 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.490
 of disney I did not mention those of marvel 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.460
 because then that is a point and 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.380
 I wanted to focus on other projects in 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.020
 the personal thing that I most expect or those that 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.830
 I hope more are moana and coconut coconut 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.590
 obviously for being a Mexican holiday 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.630
 and cute for being an original story not 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.120
 is sequel is not remake is not adaptation 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.760
 live action is an original story that 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.200
 I think it can be moving but let me 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.120
 down here your comments 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.550
 I invite you as always to visit my 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.380
 channel the link is in the description 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.300
 I am abrupt and I see them next 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.830
 week to continue talking about movies 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.830
 without excess
