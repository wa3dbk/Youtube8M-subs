00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.650
 we have heard from the ananta a 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.689
 complain, in short, a decision 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.820
 arbitration that objectively favored the 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.289
 Lazio, however, I can say something when 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.750
 says the Lazio is always favored no 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.550
 when he loses it is not always this 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.160
 don't tell us but I say this to 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.690
 you because you say if these things are there 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.309
 merits for you we don't exist 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.839
 reported what the coach said 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.089
 of alatanta president lotito up 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:42.129
 now forgive them if they want to be controversial 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:44.620
 and we do not know when you Controversy 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.870
 I'm just saying to come back with i 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.730
 feet on the ground because our game 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.370
 our instrument is based on the feet 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.230
 I work starting whoever has seen it I think 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.480
 that he understood that maybe he left her 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.239
 deserved something I deserved because 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:03.129
 this now after numbers to excuse me 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:06.039
 forgive sure that we don't deserve it 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.539
 controversy so external the goal he has 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:08.649
 unlocked the game was a goal that 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:11.100
 in short it was somehow 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:11.100
 disputed 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.770
 forgive me, ma'am 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:15.970
 the regulation is clear to provide for 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.160
 things now it's about finding out if 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.450
 volunteer or volunteer then second 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.090
 her a right decision that 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.420
 of the referee by regulation a vision 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.189
 right 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.689
 ok then that of I could say that 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.159
 before there was a rigor that was not from 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.380
 less but I take note of what 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.479
 anchovies and nobody wants the problem then 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.130
 there is a rigor that has not been given a 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.079
 net rigor that I was not from yet 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.490
 nobody discussed this but us 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.020
 we are not even minded 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.549
 president lotito I make her one last 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.350
 question must promise to answer 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.850
 very quickly because we have a frog 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.880
 that is waiting for us, I understood though 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.259
 excuse the levers makes an interview 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:54.009
 as of conferences equal as the 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.630
 church but then peddling home 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.700
 president with I make the employee 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.680
 then if I do the president he has though 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.479
 being treated as president I do 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.119
 not to predict the players are 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.829
 employees then good that you work yes 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.539
 a lot wants to make the face pack 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.920
 with my resident love but for all 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.620
 relax president of the do one 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.180
 President's question, however, really 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.470
 because there are rules that you are 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.850
 with him player respect 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.799
 look, I wanted to ask you this was it 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.920
 painted as the winner of the last 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:22.239
 soccer league battle for failure 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.880
 election let's say what was the 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.020
 candidate 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.350
 I go with more votes than the 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.070
 previous meeting on Friday 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.360
 president of the football league 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.680
 considering that tomorrow the law is read 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.660
 president of the Football Association and not there 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.890
 will be a president of the league but this one 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.540
 my colleagues must also say so 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.850
 because I do not vote is obvious from her there 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.060
 old precedent as I ask her 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.030
 opinion and and vote I think there are 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.670
 the conditions to recreate the we say 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.490
 so a completely different climate of 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.170
 re starting of the league in the name of 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.360
 some principles first of all that i 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.970
 present must reacquire fatherhood 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.190
 choices through an active role 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.350
 both through powers that come 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.660
 they are conferred to the council to which 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.160
 the presidents must attend and then 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.900
 clearly an alloy restructuring 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.750
 then after that then optimistic though 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.700
 Friday or no but I do n't know who I am 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.380
 optimistic in the sense of 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.780
 responsibility of the presidents who 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.370
 surely they care about the fate of 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.380
 football and therefore also the football league 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.240
 and therefore they will find how they always have 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.100
 also done in the past will try to 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.030
 find solutions to solve i 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.790
 problems and believe maybe if someone 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.080
 had avoided creating cracks 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.270
 probably refer to mine 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.280
 colleagues but someone who thought that 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.440
 from the outside it could come to dictate the 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.240
 rules however to abortions say so 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.550
 I say but this is saying I'm not 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.610
 saying that they were two candidates is fine 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.140
 I think the reps 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.550
 since I didn't do night school 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.800
 that I did the real and professional ones 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.510
 many evenings were used but this 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.370
 no one has ever found was the best parties 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:04:00.320
 soligo novel is never too much though 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:01.100
 the asp smar we have to start with one 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.410
 different mesh 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.030
 okay i hope this logic there 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.560
 then lead to the solution of the problem goes 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.560
 well thank you thanks to president lotito
