00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.160
 The next thing we're going to learn is 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.999
 how to put a cover page 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.919
 default that we want in 

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:09.809
 our site for that let's explain 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.269
 that when we do not tell you any page 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.099
 default drupal by default we 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.040
 shows the last nodes that we have 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.920
 published from newest to oldest one 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.080
 under another when we write a node 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.410
 like for example this one if we look at 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.410
 Edit 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.930
 in the publishing options we 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.090
 we told him to put it in what 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:35.190
 he calls home page when he does not 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.190
 it says another if we remove it 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.460
 and we go to the home we see that we do not have 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.440
 nothing on this main page that's 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.670
 because we have not configured which page 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.620
 we want it to appear by default 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.980
 then drupal will always place us 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.140
 the last nodes as the main page 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.000
 but we this configuration by 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.770
 defect we can change it and we can 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.500
 tell drupal that any other 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.690
 page can be the homepage that 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.730
 is our goal for this example of 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.440
 web of company that we are doing what 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.510
 what we are going to do is create a page 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.150
 that we are going to call page of 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.100
 welcome for example and that page that 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.630
 node we will place as a page 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.190
 main first 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.000
 we create the node as a basic page 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.100
 We will call you 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.500
 Welcome 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.810
 we wrote the welcome text for 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.600
 our customers from our website and 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:33.009
 we give him to save before we are going to put him 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.549
 a simple url for google and for 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.510
 our clients that we are going to call 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.630
 Welcome 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.220
 and we keep we have created our 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.230
 welcome 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.340
 now how do we tell the group that this 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.120
 node we want the page to be 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.040
 principal 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.620
 well where we were before in 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.360
 Site information is in 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.860
 configuration 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.230
 site information 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.080
 one of the options other than the name and 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.420
 of the slogan is the page that we want 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.430
 place as home page 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.220
 default we are going to put that the 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.960
 initial page may end be 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.420
 welcome that is what is called the one 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.420
 we have created and we give to save 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.630
 now we are going to start 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.400
