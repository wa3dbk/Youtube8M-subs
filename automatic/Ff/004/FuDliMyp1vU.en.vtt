00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.000
 Welcome to Beijing at the tops and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.009
 flops 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.859
 we are here in the parallel world of 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.710
 mercedes benz back there the g-class 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.870
 here in front of the cla who would not have 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.199
 recognized immediately and there is one 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.060
 study that makes me love again mlc 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.310
 chinese we have seen have 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.410
 meanwhile hears its own design 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.000
 please finally copy to 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.080
 you do not need that and me 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.369
 disappear here now because he 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.640
 softening slowly on mine 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.009
 voice affects 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.399
 I have no idea what this car 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.899
 but it can or should 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.960
 disqualifies itself about this 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.720
 color like pink really does that in the 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.890
 eyes hurt the car is called changan too 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.210
 So fish in fashion for fashion as well 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.120
 you always get it anyway 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:56.210
 but may translate the thing is now 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:01:00.890
 really not in fashion does that mean 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.359
 fair the porsche cayman gts gts means 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.869
 15 ps more 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.940
 we now have 340 ps trainer here 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.259
 Dare is a bit deeper 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.180
 sounds a bit more aggressive 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:16.130
 my god what more could you want 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.539
 as I said my day of the fair one of the 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.250
 most beautiful cars of the fair in beijing 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:22.550
 is at bmw 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.740
 We call him the Ninth Denner 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.810
 located above the 71 it is not 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.270
 car what will come in series but 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.520
 just because of that a top because he 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.340
 the interior is beautifully made 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:40.700
 new controls and of course 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:42.950
 the shape of a grid we are at 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.880
 Brand with the sonic name I have to 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.490
 read the h7 ph ev who has any of it 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.950
 not one behind me 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.439
 interesting mixture of rolls royce 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.990
 with wolga grill yes that is the new one 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.810
 Chinese self-confidence is driving 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.909
 in it the party boss soon in the 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.259
 holiday i do not know i know 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.060
 honestly not if that is here now 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.280
 my top or flop is because of the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.280
 karlschule so shit how cool is 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.620
 one of my favorite cars in beijing 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.780
 the Jetta sedan but not as 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.519
 but as a coupÃ© especially for the 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.890
 Made in China 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:27.129
 a really fancy car in very much 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:31.329
 valued a model that also in europe and 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:33.519
 in germany good chance meant jasch 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.260
 I'm sorry but my 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.540
 next flop is already back 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.090
 you a 6 feet ninety long 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.680
 state body but this stretchlimo 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.799
 have been since the nineties 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.989
 really out of vokuhila is never more 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.180
 so the best thing about this part is the 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:56.169
 the looks of mischa but the 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:58.090
 rest floss one of the jobs is definitely 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:59.980
 even the fair here are many 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.359
 people but it is not so 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.129
 uncomfortable as you always get from the 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.290
 Chinese are all very strong 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.939
 friendly minded and what me 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.370
 really impressed is that we are here 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:11.680
 have seen scary many premieres 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.569
 many new cars not only for the 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.370
 Chinese market are important but 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.549
 for the global to the European 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:22.590
 market and that's why it's mine 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.590
 job of the fair the fair itself
