00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.790
 Illustrator software can be used 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.370
 in order to vectorized drawings made 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.700
 in traditional trad as we say 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.740
 often so she's going to be interested 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.480
 there will be a first interest we will 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.630
 say technical and that once we have 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.190
 all vectorized in the star software at 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.690
 vector drawing level 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.840
 there are obviously and all the tools 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.000
 of illustrator the pen the brush for 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.280
 colorized over the outside feather 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.950
 we will be able to modify the drawing of 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.230
 infinite way 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.179
 a little reminder a vectorized object that's 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.219
 an object that at the level of dimensions 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:44.420
 no longer has any constraints since everything 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.399
 becomes math 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.890
 while in photoshop or in everything 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.019
 other bitmap type earth software that 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.030
 work with pixels you do 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.769
 an illustration a logo a band 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.210
 drawn a certain format it's planned 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.250
 for this format there obviously it can 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.570
 to be produced in smaller but as soon as 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.129
 you're going to do it bigger at 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.530
 have new pixel creations and 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:07.189
 so blur that appears so how 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.869
 it's happening in illustrator stopped in 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.070
 other versions of illustrators 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.110
 knowing that it's really a function 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.240
 which women get better with each version 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.850
 less 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.399
 activate your illustration and then here 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.810
 you will have this little menu 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.780
 vectorization of the image 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.420
 gold is looking a little further 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.310
 how is it at the level of the 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.539
 floating pallet that's here 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.039
 vectorization images here we go 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.260
 just look at business 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.390
 vectorization of the image 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.940
 we will click by default because it 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.400
 we do you'll see a message that 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.250
 will you tell where the tension its image 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.950
 high resolution high size that 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.050
 risk being slow so you check it off 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.790
 more show once you'll have 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.270
 well understood why do you have this 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.500
 warning message 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.240
 obviously a more illustration we're going 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.220
 to be long 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.570
 loaded in color and that 's more the 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.100
 vectorization is going to be moors and 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.060
 obviously it depends on the power 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.060
 your processor 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.740
 ference all at once we find ourselves 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.770
 with a trait that is much more 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.590
 smooth and a I'm going to do a z check 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.050
 so were strictly black and 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.650
 white so with all the little flaws 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.900
 and then if I restore the vectorization 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.770
 you see at once he 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.770
 much smoother 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.110
 then you can cons 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.870
 ask that there really you 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.900
 have a create small paths 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.540
 vector for each part and you 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.090
 can you then intervene so 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.970
 on those parts there to move them 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.319
 change we will look at another 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.090
 picture 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.980
 we're not doing this time 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.780
 vectorization of the image directly on 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.879
 going to see in the menus what is it 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.489
 who offers us there you see we have 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.469
 a loyalty pass photo fidelity and 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.540
 three colors ten years gray logo black 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:58.189
 and white sketch silhouette drawing or 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.520
 deal with investing by doing drawing at 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:02.340
 feature 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.200
 so the drawing to the brothers logically 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.170
 should give us something 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.690
 much more united and that's where 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.220
 it's typically a bad anchor by 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.140
 compared to some things I have 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.230
 already spoken saying that everything is extremely 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.240
 regular and we absolutely lose the 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.950
 foreground and backward feeling 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.340
 plan that was given by the thickness of 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.340
 contours 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.420
 can try drawing technique to see 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.830
 that's going to give illustration access the 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.140
 the technical drawing 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.850
 good then the technical drawing the 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.550
 result is really not very 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.890
 interesting it must be a little bit more 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.140
 easy to set up for jobs 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.220
 of architectured things like that we have 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.220
 the sketches 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.569
 if you are not excellent in your 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.400
 anchoring well why not use a 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.959
 method like that so washed 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.370
 development s who if they recover a 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.370
 little more little details 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.830
 the normal vectorization why not 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.209
 use features of the illustrator 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.890
 of vectorization finally to give a 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.130
 returned to your drawing to give him a 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.840
 style 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.370
 really no problem to have 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.320
 things saying yes but it's not 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.520
 really less than he did not so if 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.410
 you did it then 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.690
 look now we're going to do in the 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.790
 vectorization we will choose a 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.810
 high fidelity photo vectorization on 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.810
 this watercolor colors 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.970
 there actually it actually 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.980
 I'm doing for the 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.120
 Swiss or compared to the rendering 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.830
 watercolors the client we wanted some 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.560
 something that makes a little bit more 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.020
 so here I am going to propose 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.720
 work that way what he has 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.010
 completely seduced but I do not have 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.480
 does the vectorization that I'm in 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.760
 finally offer you that 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.110
 the computer is calculating 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.510
 because there, logically, we should 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.240
 have a result quite close to 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.770
 the original watercolor and I did 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.770
 something a little destructive 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.599
 this is really 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.699
 director but who is improving and 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:00.680
 then who benefits a lot from the 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:01.940
 power of the new processors because 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.069
 that if you really have a job 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.229
 continuous to do and that every time 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:07.460
 you spend five minutes waiting for that 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.970
 the software offers succeed the 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.520
 vectorization see it's really at its 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.020
 ends it's pretty good if I do a 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.020
 control z it's a little bit less 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.229
 materials of course that the original but 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.560
 it alice and totally enjoyable 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:26.750
 respecting a lot of details 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:30.919
 then we will start again this time 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.729
 going in low fidelity photo so there 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.860
 you will see that there is going to be a 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.970
 simplification even more marked what 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.979
 is a way like any other 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.130
 finally introduce random 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:42.020
 in a job ie you 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.250
 put your work colors in a 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.389
 kind of roping you know not 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.610
 obligatorily what is going 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:48.620
 stand out as a result I got myself 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.690
 realized that for example the very 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.440
 black outline at the angle of China do not 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.600
 did not go out all the time in pure black 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.550
 but I will not intervene after 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.930
 blow I admit a little bit the same 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.820
 process that if I printed on a 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.830
 very absorbent paper send it a 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.110
 side we are not in Andy Warhol 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.490
 but we are starting to get closer 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.940
 so that's the kind of rendering that I've 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.240
 established with my client 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.640
 so here we will open in the menu 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.470
 drop down windows we will get them the 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.300
 vectorization of the image as 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.550
 floating palette and you're going to click 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.190
 on advanced once you click on 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:26.740
 move on there you'll see that you 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:28.810
 can parameterize very finely 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.120
 what the layouts are more or less 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.009
 faithful is what the angles are 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.970
 respected ie is what you 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:35.319
 really want there to be a lot of 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.940
 rounded things or a lot of things 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:38.530
 a lot more squares here I have 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.120
 a lot of parameters and then you 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.380
 so click on preview to see 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.720
 every time what will this give 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.919
 so I invite you to watch how 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.720
 it all works by making 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:48.380
 essays maybe starting mostly 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.300
 on black and white 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.680
 at the color level it's going to be long 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.920
 to do tests on a lot of 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.290
 things 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:57.110
 you may have problems with 

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:59.450
 time productivity anyway 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:02.120
 once you like it you will have the 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:04.220
 ability to save the setting 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.050
 which you like and apply it 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.380
 systematically to others 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:11.980
 illustrations 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:13.300
 but at the same time remember that it 

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.860
 will really depend on your 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.060
 illustrations you can have 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.350
 makes a setting that you find very 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.460
 well with watercolors and then if you 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.080
 apply it to everything that 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.790
 made the gouache found that rendering does not 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.590
 you're not happy but hey it's 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:27.390
 really a very interesting option to 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.390
 study with illustrator
