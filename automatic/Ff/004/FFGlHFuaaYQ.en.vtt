00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.759
 and then the opening goal for them 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.080
 Ghent assist the cages and definition 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:26.000
 of privas and there are a lot of 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.110
 passivity a lot of passivity in 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.329
 the rearguard of genk priscilla the 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.860
 fantastic bass of camus for your 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.780
 scenes of passivity also at the level 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.899
 defensive Ghent side efficiency 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.960
 usual of m luminous precision 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.879
 amazing surgical and there and that 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.040
 it's fuel drop advanced bone 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.080
 it must be put out of reach of 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.500
 books he did very well but it's up to 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.880
 caviar 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.220
 these are really the two days in 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.360
 this foul his free kick that brought 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.870
 the second goal 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.350
 second balloons no presence and the 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.320
 coulibaly strike that pierces the 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.720
 defense have collected ben ali 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.670
 all alone not a player at this limit 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.680
 is there obviously we need the 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.080
 succeed this half-volley because she 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.369
 bounces right in front of him he has this match 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.720
 completely this match 7 balls and the king 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.270
 for a guardian it is not necessarily 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.869
 easy because I have to announce their 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.460
 montage and monsieur coulibaly 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.890
 impressive always good here we are 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.020
 who knows tonight what's that 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.610
 you miss it a little pity but good 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.460
 we do not like to take goals and that's it 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.960
 a little upset about that goal because I 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.240
 think that at the beginning of the match we had a 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.520
 little trouble we have great hurry we 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.410
 we went back in their gestures that he 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.940
 did not have to go back as and when 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.460
 measure we managed to find jus to 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.380
 find fabien and that's it more 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.060
 simplify our game then what is it 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.170
 solidly very very sturdy in the second 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.670
 half time we did not see the attackers anymore 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.200
 gloves then do they need to 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.180
 their fault or it is you who have 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.229
 tightened the screw not at the half time we went 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.460
 spoken also because I think 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.720
 including putting their left 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.940
 a lot of hope what we see and kg 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.229
 who dribbled easily than true 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.460
 there too who should easily that 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.869
 was making me angry 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.970
 personally I think the team 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.130
 so they saw it so we did not talk much 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.989
 admitting that we have tightened things 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.790
 and to say and now we have a 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.680
 coulibaly scorer is your team bis 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.049
 so yeah this year it's my 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.579
 first goal here we wait for him no 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.680
 but after that the most important 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.120
 it's the three points tonight we hear 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.190
 now more and more rumors 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.820
 manchester united le grand reich smiles 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.739
 david vidic ferdinand there is a place 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.540
 who gets free myself I am aware of 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.620
 nothing here I put there match some 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.910
 weeks I was a little critical and 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.610
 now today this is it going a 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.959
 little better so I continued on this 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.640
 line there then we'll see what happens 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.720
 but I know for the moment 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.600
 later we shall see 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.090
 thank you coulis obviously there is a 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.190
 difference between aroused the interest of 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.790
 manchester united go to manchester 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.650
 united 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.840
 manchester united is holder at 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.609
 manchester it's true he still 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.530
 something and if the caterers of 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.760
 France is smart because "here 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.500
 that he still has a large margin of 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.569
 progression he crossed a big landing 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.909
 last season he's in the process of 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.909
 confirm this year he has all the time 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.260
 to change era because we know 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.879
 that in these countries there like england 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.530
 or else it's a lot harder 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.099
 of course but it's true in our 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.720
 championship 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.720
 it became a reference
