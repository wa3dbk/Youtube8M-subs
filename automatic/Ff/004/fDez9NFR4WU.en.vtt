about<00:03:14.340> post-workout<00:03:15.090> meals<00:03:15.360> if<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:15.840> need<00:03:15.990> a

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
about post-workout meals if I need a

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.230 
about post-workout meals if I need a
workout<00:03:16.380> that<00:03:16.440> I<00:03:16.590> didn't<00:03:16.950> feel<00:03:17.100> as<00:03:17.340> intense<00:03:17.970> as

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
workout that I didn't feel as intense as

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.360 
workout that I didn't feel as intense as
usual<00:03:18.630> or<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:19.200> only<00:03:19.350> works<00:03:19.620> smaller<00:03:19.980> muscle

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
usual or it only works smaller muscle

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.770 
usual or it only works smaller muscle
groups<00:03:20.400> would<00:03:20.880> it<00:03:21.000> be<00:03:21.090> better<00:03:21.240> to<00:03:21.360> have<00:03:21.510> less

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
groups would it be better to have less

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.930 
groups would it be better to have less
carbs<00:03:22.200> than<00:03:22.380> I<00:03:22.410> usually<00:03:22.620> do<00:03:22.950> for<00:03:23.160> example<00:03:23.850> I

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
carbs than I usually do for example I

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.370 
carbs than I usually do for example I
normally<00:03:24.270> have<00:03:24.360> a<00:03:24.420> protein<00:03:24.930> with<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.200> banana

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
normally have a protein with a banana

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.620 
normally have a protein with a banana
plus<00:03:25.800> 2<00:03:25.980> tablespoons<00:03:26.160> of<00:03:26.610> maple<00:03:26.730> syrup<00:03:26.910> would

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
plus 2 tablespoons of maple syrup would

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.390 
plus 2 tablespoons of maple syrup would
be<00:03:27.780> better<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:28.200> only<00:03:28.350> have<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.620> banana<00:03:28.800> in<00:03:29.220> that

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
be better to only have a banana in that

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.610 
be better to only have a banana in that
case<00:03:29.700> great<00:03:30.300> question<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:30.930> I<00:03:31.080> agree<00:03:31.350> with<00:03:31.500> the

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
case great question and I agree with the

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.990 
case great question and I agree with the
way<00:03:31.650> you're<00:03:31.950> doing<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:32.340> when<00:03:32.730> you're<00:03:32.850> working

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
way you're doing it when you're working

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.699 
way you're doing it when you're working
big<00:03:33.420> muscle<00:03:33.780> groups<00:03:33.930> we're<00:03:34.140> working<00:03:34.440> legs

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
big muscle groups we're working legs

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.010 
big muscle groups we're working legs
we're<00:03:34.980> going<00:03:35.190> back<00:03:35.459> chest<00:03:36.120> those<00:03:36.600> big<00:03:36.870> muscles

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
we're going back chest those big muscles

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.020 
we're going back chest those big muscles
you're<00:03:37.560> using<00:03:37.709> up<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:38.010> lot<00:03:38.040> of<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.400> glycogen<00:03:38.730> in

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
you're using up a lot of the glycogen in

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.000 
you're using up a lot of the glycogen in
your<00:03:39.180> muscle<00:03:39.480> cells<00:03:39.720> so<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:39.959> need<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.800> fill

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
your muscle cells so you need to fill

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.560 
your muscle cells so you need to fill
those<00:03:41.160> back<00:03:41.370> up<00:03:41.550> with<00:03:41.700> carbs<00:03:42.060> after<00:03:42.240> your

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
those back up with carbs after your

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.480 
those back up with carbs after your
workout<00:03:42.870> so<00:03:43.020> you<00:03:43.110> can<00:03:43.260> take<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.830> little<00:03:44.100> higher

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
workout so you can take a little higher

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.190 
workout so you can take a little higher
amounts<00:03:44.970> of<00:03:45.120> carbs<00:03:45.480> but<00:03:45.810> if<00:03:45.930> you're<00:03:46.050> working

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
amounts of carbs but if you're working

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.870 
amounts of carbs but if you're working
smaller<00:03:46.709> muscle<00:03:47.040> groups<00:03:47.070> like<00:03:47.400> biceps

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
smaller muscle groups like biceps

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.730 
smaller muscle groups like biceps
triceps<00:03:48.090> maybe<00:03:48.959> you're<00:03:49.140> isolating<00:03:49.620> your

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
triceps maybe you're isolating your

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.980 
triceps maybe you're isolating your
calves<00:03:49.980> you're<00:03:50.580> not<00:03:50.700> burning<00:03:51.000> as<00:03:51.360> much<00:03:51.630> muscle

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
calves you're not burning as much muscle

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.380 
calves you're not burning as much muscle
glycogen<00:03:52.440> so<00:03:53.190> you<00:03:53.280> can<00:03:53.490> actually<00:03:53.670> take<00:03:54.209> in<00:03:54.360> a

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
glycogen so you can actually take in a

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.060 
glycogen so you can actually take in a
little<00:03:54.720> bit<00:03:54.810> less<00:03:55.050> carbs<00:03:55.530> than<00:03:55.860> when<00:03:55.950> you're

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
little bit less carbs than when you're

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.830 
little bit less carbs than when you're
hitting<00:03:56.220> those<00:03:56.370> big<00:03:56.670> muscle<00:03:57.300> groups<00:03:57.510> but

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
hitting those big muscle groups but

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.090 
hitting those big muscle groups but
great<00:03:58.140> sources<00:03:58.530> there<00:03:58.740> that<00:03:58.890> you're<00:03:59.010> talking

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
great sources there that you're talking

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.860 
great sources there that you're talking
about<00:03:59.340> banana<00:03:59.700> maple<00:04:00.150> syrup<00:04:00.390> great<00:04:00.600> sources

about banana maple syrup great sources

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.810 
about banana maple syrup great sources
of<00:04:00.990> post-workout<00:04:01.650> curbs<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.490> the<00:04:02.640> last

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
of post-workout curbs and the last

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.880 
of post-workout curbs and the last
question<00:04:02.940> will<00:04:03.240> do<00:04:03.360> is<00:04:03.600> do<00:04:04.020> you<00:04:04.110> do<00:04:04.260> full<00:04:04.620> body

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
question will do is do you do full body

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.100 
question will do is do you do full body
workouts<00:04:05.370> or<00:04:05.550> you<00:04:05.670> do<00:04:05.790> splits<00:04:06.240> well<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:06.990> really

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
workouts or you do splits well it really

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.320 
workouts or you do splits well it really
depends<00:04:07.470> it<00:04:07.830> depends<00:04:08.130> on<00:04:08.220> what<00:04:08.400> phase<00:04:08.670> I<00:04:08.880> am<00:04:09.030> in

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
depends it depends on what phase I am in

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.940 
depends it depends on what phase I am in
my<00:04:09.480> training<00:04:09.930> if<00:04:10.050> I'm<00:04:10.200> looking<00:04:10.350> to<00:04:10.530> add<00:04:10.650> size

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
my training if I'm looking to add size

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.530 
my training if I'm looking to add size
or<00:04:11.280> if<00:04:11.340> I'm<00:04:11.430> looking<00:04:11.580> to<00:04:11.730> add<00:04:11.910> mass<00:04:12.150> which<00:04:12.420> I'm

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
or if I'm looking to add mass which I'm

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.180 
or if I'm looking to add mass which I'm
not<00:04:12.660> really<00:04:12.870> looking<00:04:13.050> to<00:04:13.230> do<00:04:13.410> anymore<00:04:13.590> that's

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
not really looking to do anymore that's

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.580 
not really looking to do anymore that's
what<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.430> would<00:04:14.640> focus<00:04:14.850> on<00:04:15.180> split<00:04:15.989> groups<00:04:16.260> so<00:04:16.530> it

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
what I would focus on split groups so it

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.620 
what I would focus on split groups so it
may<00:04:16.709> be<00:04:16.739> split<00:04:17.100> each<00:04:17.250> workout<00:04:17.669> up<00:04:17.910> into<00:04:18.419> two

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
may be split each workout up into two

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.970 
may be split each workout up into two
muscle<00:04:18.959> groups<00:04:18.989> or<00:04:19.290> maybe<00:04:19.410> even<00:04:19.470> just<00:04:19.770> one

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
muscle groups or maybe even just one

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.349 
muscle groups or maybe even just one
muscle<00:04:20.280> group<00:04:20.310> if<00:04:20.549> I'm<00:04:20.669> looking<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:20.970> add<00:04:21.120> size

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
muscle group if I'm looking to add size

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.050 
muscle group if I'm looking to add size
and<00:04:21.660> really<00:04:21.900> stress<00:04:22.410> that<00:04:22.650> muscle<00:04:23.100> but<00:04:23.640> where

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
and really stress that muscle but where

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.170 
and really stress that muscle but where
I<00:04:24.090> am<00:04:24.270> right<00:04:24.300> now<00:04:24.600> in<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.930> face

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
I am right now in the face

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.490 
I am right now in the face
I<00:04:25.210> am<00:04:25.419> right<00:04:25.630> now<00:04:25.750> I'm<00:04:25.780> in<00:04:25.960> maintenance<00:04:26.289> mode

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
I am right now I'm in maintenance mode

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.070 
I am right now I'm in maintenance mode
so<00:04:27.130> most<00:04:27.430> of<00:04:27.550> my<00:04:27.610> workouts<00:04:28.090> are<00:04:28.360> circuit

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
so most of my workouts are circuit

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.080 
so most of my workouts are circuit
workout<00:04:29.500> so<00:04:29.650> I'm<00:04:29.740> basically<00:04:30.039> hitting<00:04:30.490> all<00:04:30.729> the

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
workout so I'm basically hitting all the

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.090 
workout so I'm basically hitting all the
major<00:04:31.330> movements<00:04:31.930> with<00:04:32.050> compound<00:04:32.560> exercises

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
major movements with compound exercises

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.300 
major movements with compound exercises
like<00:04:33.639> squats<00:04:33.930> deadlifts<00:04:34.930> presses<00:04:35.770> and<00:04:35.949> I'm

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
like squats deadlifts presses and I'm

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.969 
like squats deadlifts presses and I'm
hitting<00:04:36.610> my<00:04:36.639> full<00:04:37.090> body<00:04:37.780> keeping<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.740> rest

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
hitting my full body keeping the rest

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.740 
hitting my full body keeping the rest
periods<00:04:39.340> very<00:04:39.639> short<00:04:40.000> so<00:04:40.479> I'm<00:04:40.600> actually

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
periods very short so I'm actually

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.659 
periods very short so I'm actually
