of Dada Dada X to the second or ik that

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.600 
of Dada Dada X to the second or ik that
the<00:06:15.750> animation<00:06:16.410> looked<00:06:16.560> a<00:06:16.680> lot<00:06:16.950> better<00:06:17.310> like

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
the animation looked a lot better like

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.340 
the animation looked a lot better like
the<00:06:17.730> character<00:06:18.150> designs<00:06:18.390> to<00:06:18.600> the<00:06:18.690> art<00:06:18.900> to<00:06:19.260> the

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
the character designs to the art to the

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.110 
the character designs to the art to the
animation<00:06:19.860> looks<00:06:20.070> so<00:06:20.310> much<00:06:20.520> better<00:06:20.760> than<00:06:21.060> it

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
animation looks so much better than it

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.000 
animation looks so much better than it
did<00:06:21.330> from<00:06:21.540> the<00:06:21.690> last<00:06:21.720> season<00:06:22.140> I'm<00:06:22.590> guessing

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
did from the last season I'm guessing

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.890 
did from the last season I'm guessing
that<00:06:23.130> season<00:06:23.580> break<00:06:23.820> that<00:06:24.060> this<00:06:24.240> series<00:06:24.540> got

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
that season break that this series got

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.500 
that season break that this series got
probably<00:06:25.650> gave<00:06:25.770> the<00:06:26.220> studio<00:06:26.580> enough<00:06:26.940> time<00:06:27.210> to

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
probably gave the studio enough time to

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.360 
probably gave the studio enough time to
actually<00:06:27.930> work<00:06:28.080> on<00:06:28.200> the<00:06:28.320> art<00:06:28.500> animation<00:06:29.160> and

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
actually work on the art animation and

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.460 
actually work on the art animation and
get<00:06:29.910> it<00:06:30.000> prepped<00:06:30.270> up<00:06:30.510> for<00:06:30.780> this<00:06:31.020> season<00:06:31.320> which

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
get it prepped up for this season which

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.040 
get it prepped up for this season which
I'm<00:06:31.590> really<00:06:32.190> glad<00:06:32.340> that<00:06:32.729> the<00:06:33.000> rara<00:06:33.390> is<00:06:33.600> taking

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
I'm really glad that the rara is taking

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.779 
I'm really glad that the rara is taking
seasonal<00:06:34.530> breaks<00:06:34.800> because<00:06:35.039> it<00:06:35.250> allows<00:06:35.490> it<00:06:35.700> to

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:35.789

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 
on it because if this was going on for

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.490 
on it because if this was going on for
like<00:06:48.060> fifty<00:06:48.360> episodes<00:06:48.510> and<00:06:49.350> you<00:06:49.410> know

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 
like fifty episodes and you know

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.469 
like fifty episodes and you know
straight<00:06:49.919> it<00:06:50.460> you<00:06:50.669> know<00:06:50.910> there<00:06:51.180> would<00:06:51.300> be<00:06:51.330> an

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 
straight it you know there would be an

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:53.090 
straight it you know there would be an
animation<00:06:51.900> derp<00:06:52.229> and<00:06:52.440> quality<00:06:52.889> drop

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 
animation derp and quality drop

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.070 
animation derp and quality drop
eventually<00:06:54.000> I<00:06:54.030> mean<00:06:54.210> not<00:06:54.330> all<00:06:54.360> studios<00:06:54.930> are

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
eventually I mean not all studios are

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.230 
eventually I mean not all studios are
like<00:06:55.199> madhouse<00:06:55.680> or<00:06:56.070> you<00:06:56.190> know<00:06:56.310> I<00:06:56.550> think<00:06:56.970> David

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 
like madhouse or you know I think David

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.520 
like madhouse or you know I think David
productions<00:06:57.660> that<00:06:57.810> did<00:06:57.960> Jojo<00:06:58.290> not<00:06:58.440> all

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.530 
productions that did Jojo not all

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.170 
productions that did Jojo not all
studios<00:06:58.919> are<00:06:59.040> like<00:06:59.190> that<00:06:59.400> so<00:06:59.610> of<00:06:59.760> course<00:06:59.910> there

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 
studios are like that so of course there

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.719 
studios are like that so of course there
will<00:07:00.330> be<00:07:00.360> a<00:07:00.690> quality<00:07:01.229> drop<00:07:01.500> eventually<00:07:02.160> so

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:02.729 
will be a quality drop eventually so

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:04.879 
will be a quality drop eventually so
