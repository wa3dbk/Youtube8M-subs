00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.350 
the blues that you have to dab on
because<00:02:55.380> when<00:02:55.739> you<00:02:55.950> do<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.340> lot<00:02:56.579> of<00:02:56.610> nails<00:02:56.910> they

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
because when you do a lot of nails they

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.250 
because when you do a lot of nails they
seem<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.750> clog<00:02:58.140> up<00:02:58.350> at<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.829> top<00:02:59.130> and<00:03:00.260> they

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
seem to clog up at the top and they

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.200 
seem to clog up at the top and they
don't<00:03:01.440> you<00:03:01.590> don't<00:03:01.829> give<00:03:02.010> much<00:03:02.280> themselves<00:03:02.850> all

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
don't you don't give much themselves all

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.660 
don't you don't give much themselves all
so<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.780> find<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.320> use<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.560> lot<00:03:04.860> more<00:03:04.890> when<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.490> do

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
so I find you use a lot more when you do

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.550 
so I find you use a lot more when you do
use<00:03:06.630> those<00:03:06.900> when<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:08.400> brush<00:03:08.610> on<00:03:08.790> one<00:03:09.260> if<00:03:10.260> they

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
use those when the brush on one if they

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.640 
use those when the brush on one if they
are<00:03:10.620> left<00:03:11.100> upright<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:12.090> find<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.840> they

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
are left upright you find that they

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.730 
are left upright you find that they
don't<00:03:13.860> pop<00:03:14.070> up<00:03:14.130> around<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.420> top<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:16.050> you<00:03:16.710> can

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
don't pop up around the top and you can

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.980 
don't pop up around the top and you can
control<00:03:17.340> how<00:03:17.580> much<00:03:17.640> below<00:03:18.210> you<00:03:18.390> want<00:03:18.630> to<00:03:18.780> put

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
control how much below you want to put

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.390 
control how much below you want to put
on<00:03:19.140> with<00:03:19.890> less<00:03:20.130> is<00:03:20.310> more<00:03:20.490> this<00:03:21.420> bit<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.400> then

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
on with less is more this bit and then

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.640 
on with less is more this bit and then
my<00:03:23.730> liquid<00:03:24.240> I<00:03:24.600> always<00:03:25.080> just<00:03:25.200> have<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.440> small

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
my liquid I always just have a small

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.110 
my liquid I always just have a small
container<00:03:26.130> because<00:03:26.400> obviously<00:03:26.700> it's<00:03:27.000> that

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
container because obviously it's that

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.630 
container because obviously it's that

come and sighs about that but I cut them
in<00:05:10.100> half<00:05:10.130> and<00:05:10.700> they've<00:05:11.690> got<00:05:11.720> a<00:05:11.900> little<00:05:12.020> plastic

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
in half and they've got a little plastic

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.160 
in half and they've got a little plastic
lip<00:05:12.830> that<00:05:13.640> you<00:05:13.880> put<00:05:14.330> up<00:05:14.480> and<00:05:14.690> then<00:05:14.870> when<00:05:15.020> you

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
lip that you put up and then when you

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.980 
lip that you put up and then when you
pump<00:05:15.590> or<00:05:16.010> put<00:05:16.250> some<00:05:16.430> liquid<00:05:16.580> on<00:05:16.760> there<00:05:16.970> and<00:05:17.270> you

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
pump or put some liquid on there and you

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.840 
pump or put some liquid on there and you
wipe<00:05:18.140> over<00:05:18.380> now<00:05:18.590> you<00:05:18.650> don't<00:05:19.010> get<00:05:19.190> any<00:05:19.400> product

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
wipe over now you don't get any product

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.370 
wipe over now you don't get any product
on<00:05:20.030> your<00:05:20.060> hand<00:05:20.510> so<00:05:20.750> it's<00:05:20.870> really<00:05:21.110> good<00:05:21.290> if

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
on your hand so it's really good if

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.340 
on your hand so it's really good if
you're<00:05:21.500> taking<00:05:21.620> off<00:05:21.860> nail<00:05:22.100> polish<00:05:22.520> and<00:05:23.350> just

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
you're taking off nail polish and just

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.110 
you're taking off nail polish and just
in<00:05:24.500> general<00:05:24.530> i<00:05:24.920> really<00:05:25.250> like<00:05:25.430> these<00:05:25.670> because

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
in general i really like these because

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.570 
in general i really like these because
they're<00:05:26.920> they're<00:05:27.920> supposed<00:05:28.130> to<00:05:28.250> be<00:05:28.370> lint-free

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
they're they're supposed to be lint-free

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.390 
they're they're supposed to be lint-free
so<00:05:29.390> they<00:05:29.510> don't<00:05:29.690> leave<00:05:29.840> any<00:05:30.020> fluff<00:05:30.400> sometimes

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
so they don't leave any fluff sometimes

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.230 
so they don't leave any fluff sometimes
they<00:05:31.550> might<00:05:31.700> leave<00:05:31.910> the<00:05:32.060> old<00:05:32.180> strand<00:05:32.660> that

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
they might leave the old strand that

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.010 
they might leave the old strand that
these<00:05:36.130> fine<00:05:37.130> just<00:05:37.460> come<00:05:37.880> apart<00:05:38.030> really<00:05:38.600> easy

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
these fine just come apart really easy

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.710 
these fine just come apart really easy
so<00:05:39.050> i<00:05:39.290> don't<00:05:39.500> really<00:05:39.680> as<00:05:40.130> i<00:05:40.280> do<00:05:40.340> go<00:05:40.790> out<00:05:41.000> and<00:05:41.600> i

really really really like this because

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.430 
really really really like this because
see<00:05:56.060> that<00:05:56.210> little<00:05:56.330> line<00:05:56.630> on<00:05:56.810> side<00:05:57.080> there<00:05:57.290> you

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
see that little line on side there you

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.510 
see that little line on side there you
might<00:05:57.710> not<00:05:57.919> be<00:05:58.130> able<00:05:58.280> to<00:05:58.960> that<00:05:59.960> is<00:05:59.990> actually<00:06:00.860> if

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
might not be able to that is actually if

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.940 
might not be able to that is actually if
you<00:06:01.700> put<00:06:01.910> enough<00:06:01.940> monomer<00:06:02.570> in<00:06:02.690> there<00:06:02.950> that's

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:03.950 
you put enough monomer in there that's

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.610 
you put enough monomer in there that's
enough<00:06:04.280> to<00:06:04.430> do<00:06:04.580> basically<00:06:05.060> your<00:06:06.050> rebalance

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620

all your reportable thin so it's kind of

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.409 
all your reportable thin so it's kind of
a<00:06:09.650> guide<00:06:09.890> really<00:06:10.460> and<00:06:11.350> it's<00:06:12.350> almost<00:06:12.620> true
