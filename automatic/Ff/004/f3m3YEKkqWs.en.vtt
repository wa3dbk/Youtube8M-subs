00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.480
 He is the first German television made with 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:13.380
 Today, there are two phones on the German market 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.119
 is that a message 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.170
 So at the and the mobile phone Vodafone sells since today it is 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.720
 obviously not when Apple launches its so-called IFOAM 

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:26.800
 then only bonds on Harry Potter are good enough 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.400
 So the first devices were released in the midnight sale APA 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.540
 what can this little iPhone actually do what others can not do? 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.730
 Anyway, it can provide a topic of conversation our author Christian falls says 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.400
 he has never had so much visit in his profession as today 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.400
 Ten thousand units have been sold on the first day 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.140
 the celebrity density is great 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.560
 the message of the advertising strategists clearly see who cares for the iPhone 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.040
 has never been staged a team Consumer has been staged 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.040
 Cult star Tost seeks conjured up 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.350
 In fact, the operation is unique without classic buttons 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.390
 The iPhone will shit down a lot with the internet platform hits 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.150
 also built in Apple's popular music games iPod 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.750
 Purchase arguments enough for the fan community finally midnight finally 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.530
 Friday 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.810
 They make a pilgrimage to the sales start in Cologne. Rain long journey 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.050
 The iPhone will simply flatten the happy Fringe club and 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.280
 because we have been months running either there will come out 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.630
 otherwise all that Cologne saw was a big one 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.330
 Computers have that one again a small profit 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.820
 in a compact form, what more do you want? 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.950
 even if it's out in the closet 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.170
 The iPhone is not a bargain 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.000
 besieged like a pop star the first buyer but he also pays the full 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.360
 Price almost 400 euros 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.280
 and for a device that offers a lot but is not perfect 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.900
 The iPhone, for example, no UMTS what you actually expect today 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.490
 It is allowed to transfer the data if it's relatively slow transfers 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.990
 when the camera at Leipzig failed only two megapixels and there 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.640
 You also can not send text messages with photos or progress too 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.430
 actually today is standard 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.250
 the monthly fee from 49 euros far from cheap say experts 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.509
 in Germany, IMO sells exclusively on the phone 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:19.349
 no iPhone without Timo Boll contract 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.249
 Hackers do not want to offer that on the internet 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:28.000
 how to use the iPhone with other mobile phone providers whether it is too 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:29.649
 technical problems 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:32.739
 and above all, if that's legal, that's not clear yet 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.010
 Anyway, the nex-5 she pleased Timo Boll did not like it 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.010
 the iPhone should provide for sales 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.589
 The Mobile Internet is peer to grow at any mobile industry 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.680
 we assume that future growth will come from mobile data communications 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:49.929
 will come 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:53.670
 and so the company hopes that will provide from the initial vortex 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.040
 permanently tangible sales figures
