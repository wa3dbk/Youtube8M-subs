and I didn't go a lot I didn't do a lot
of<00:01:56.509> contouring<00:01:57.049> because<00:01:57.409> it's<00:01:57.590> not<00:01:57.740> really

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
of contouring because it's not really

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.639 
of contouring because it's not really
required<00:01:58.460> in<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.789> song<00:01:59.000> what<00:01:59.899> she's<00:02:00.229> wearing

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
required in the song what she's wearing

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.999 
required in the song what she's wearing
so<00:02:00.950> her<00:02:01.729> look<00:02:01.969> is<00:02:02.149> very<00:02:02.270> soft<00:02:02.929> and<00:02:03.469> just<00:02:03.679> it's

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
so her look is very soft and just it's

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.410 
so her look is very soft and just it's
kind<00:02:04.369> of<00:02:04.429> natural<00:02:06.219> so<00:02:07.219> basically<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.179> lip

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
kind of natural so basically the lip

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:21.740 
kind of natural so basically the lip
color<00:02:08.720> will<00:02:09.020> do<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.320> trick

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.390

try to blend it as much as possible

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.900
