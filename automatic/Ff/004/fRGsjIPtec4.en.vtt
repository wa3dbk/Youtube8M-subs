instead<00:04:00.859> of<00:04:00.919> like<00:04:01.189> PS<00:04:02.349> PSN<00:04:03.349> and<00:04:03.379> stuff<00:04:03.709> you

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:03.889 
instead of like PS PSN and stuff you

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.399 
instead of like PS PSN and stuff you
won't<00:04:03.919> have<00:04:04.250> just<00:04:04.669> account<00:04:05.120> number<00:04:05.479> because

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:06.409 
won't have just account number because

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:09.939 
won't have just account number because
the<00:04:06.829> the<00:04:07.329> online<00:04:08.329> support<00:04:08.659> will<00:04:08.840> be<00:04:08.949> flexible

the the online support will be flexible

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:14.050 
the the online support will be flexible
so<00:04:10.209> basically<00:04:11.209> what<00:04:12.220> would<00:04:13.220> a<00:04:13.250> set<00:04:13.519> is<00:04:13.729> saying

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
so basically what would a set is saying

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.449 
so basically what would a set is saying
that<00:04:14.180> if<00:04:14.479> publishers<00:04:15.139> and<00:04:15.650> you<00:04:16.039> know<00:04:16.159> third

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
that if publishers and you know third

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.550 
that if publishers and you know third
parties<00:04:16.849> have<00:04:17.060> their<00:04:17.239> own<00:04:17.269> networks<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:18.349> want
