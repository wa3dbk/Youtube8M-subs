ten<00:01:25.710> dollars<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:27.150> hard<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.689> say<00:01:27.810> how<00:01:27.930> much

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
ten dollars I it's hard to say how much

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.630 
ten dollars I it's hard to say how much
it<00:01:28.110> costs<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.590> varies<00:01:28.799> written<00:01:29.130> for<00:01:29.250> region<00:01:29.460> so

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
it costs it varies written for region so

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.310 
it costs it varies written for region so
much<00:01:29.820> will<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.540> cost<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.869> know<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.110> kind<00:01:31.259> of

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
much will it cost you know that kind of

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.350 
much will it cost you know that kind of
region<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.860> then<00:01:32.100> it's<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.909> know<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.150> least

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
region and then it's you know the least

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.270 
region and then it's you know the least
updated<00:01:33.780> version<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.680> gets<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.920> collective

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
updated version and it gets a collective

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.190 
updated version and it gets a collective
amount<00:01:35.610> plus<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.270> Spock<00:01:36.479> again<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.960> mint

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
amount plus it Spock again the mint

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.410 
amount plus it Spock again the mint
costless<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.860> then<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.460> between<00:01:38.579> we<00:01:39.030> have<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
costless and then in between we have the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.999 
costless and then in between we have the
consultations<00:01:39.990> which<00:01:40.140> both<00:01:40.350> cost<00:01:40.619> twenty

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
consultations which both cost twenty

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.100 
consultations which both cost twenty
dollars<00:01:41.280> yeah<00:01:42.000> you've<00:01:42.240> got<00:01:42.270> 1,600<00:01:42.960> maker

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
dollars yeah you've got 1,600 maker

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.410 
dollars yeah you've got 1,600 maker
points<00:01:43.500> for<00:01:43.710> Minecraft<00:01:44.189> near<00:01:44.399> from<00:01:44.579> 60<00:01:44.939> now<00:01:45.360> we

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
points for Minecraft near from 60 now we

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.440 
points for Minecraft near from 60 now we
just<00:01:45.509> cost<00:01:45.840> twenty<00:01:46.409> dollars<00:01:46.649> flat<00:01:46.920> and

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
just cost twenty dollars flat and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.969 
just cost twenty dollars flat and
basically<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.570> think<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> next-gen<00:01:49.619> versions

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
basically I think the next-gen versions

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.139 
basically I think the next-gen versions
are<00:01:50.070> going<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.250> follow<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.700> trend<00:01:50.939> because

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
are going to follow this trend because

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.670 
are going to follow this trend because
they<00:01:51.390> could<00:01:51.600> help<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.930> 25<00:01:52.350> or<00:01:52.590> something

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
they could help it to 25 or something

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.649 
they could help it to 25 or something
like<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.040> but<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.030> doesn't<00:01:54.270> really<00:01:54.329> seem

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
like that but it doesn't really seem

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.139 
like that but it doesn't really seem
that<00:01:54.930> logical<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.770> do<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:55.950> especially<00:01:56.149> when

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
that logical to do it especially when

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.520 
that logical to do it especially when
you<00:01:57.240> consider<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.750> fact<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:58.049> those<00:01:58.229> people

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
you consider the fact that those people

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.780 
you consider the fact that those people
can<00:01:58.590> be<00:01:58.710> buying<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:58.950> game<00:01:59.159> for<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.399> second

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
can be buying this game for the second

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.660 
can be buying this game for the second
time<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.360> telling<00:02:01.229> them<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.380> pay<00:02:01.590> $25<00:02:02.430> some

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
time so telling them to pay $25 some

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.100 
time so telling them to pay $25 some
they<00:02:02.790> just<00:02:03.030> paid<00:02:03.180> twenty<00:02:03.479> dollars<00:02:03.719> for<00:02:03.899> just

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
they just paid twenty dollars for just

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.230 
they just paid twenty dollars for just
for<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.259> better<00:02:04.439> version<00:02:04.829> which<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.969> there's

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
for a better version which it there's

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.520 
for a better version which it there's
something<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.509> seems<00:02:06.899> like<00:02:07.140> they<00:02:07.380> just

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
something that seems like they just

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.320 
something that seems like they just
won't<00:02:07.770> do<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.250> seems<00:02:08.670> really<00:02:09.060> scummy

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
won't do that it seems really scummy

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.430 
won't do that it seems really scummy
when<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.599> think<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:09.989> your<00:02:10.080> head<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.259> it

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
when you think that in your head so it

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.750 
when you think that in your head so it
just<00:02:10.649> doesn't<00:02:10.920> seem<00:02:11.069> like<00:02:11.340> it's<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.550> lot

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
just doesn't seem like it's a lot

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.940 
just doesn't seem like it's a lot
option<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.750> think<00:02:12.959> he'll<00:02:13.290> cost<00:02:13.530> on<00:02:13.739> both

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
option so I think he'll cost on both

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.800 
option so I think he'll cost on both
platforms<00:02:14.189> is<00:02:14.640> twenty<00:02:15.120> dollars<00:02:15.420> or<00:02:15.599> your

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
platforms is twenty dollars or your

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.770 
platforms is twenty dollars or your
local<00:02:15.930> currency<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:17.239> now<00:02:18.239> might<00:02:18.420> seem<00:02:18.599> like<00:02:18.750> a

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
local currency and now might seem like a

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.059 
local currency and now might seem like a
big<00:02:19.019> assumption<00:02:19.349> but<00:02:19.650> when<00:02:19.769> you<00:02:19.860> think<00:02:19.980> about

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
big assumption but when you think about

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.440 
big assumption but when you think about
it<00:02:20.250> there's<00:02:20.610> no<00:02:20.670> way<00:02:20.970> they<00:02:21.150> could<00:02:21.269> really

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
it there's no way they could really

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.449 
it there's no way they could really
charge<00:02:21.689> more<00:02:22.049> and<00:02:22.260> there's<00:02:22.680> no<00:02:22.769> reason<00:02:23.069> for

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
charge more and there's no reason for

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.699 
charge more and there's no reason for
them<00:02:23.549> to<00:02:23.610> charge<00:02:23.939> less<00:02:24.299> like<00:02:24.599> I<00:02:24.810> don't<00:02:25.140> see<00:02:25.470> the

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
them to charge less like I don't see the

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:26.990 
them to charge less like I don't see the
logic<00:02:25.739> and<00:02:26.129> then<00:02:26.220> discarding<00:02:26.670> less<00:02:26.819> because

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
logic and then discarding less because

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.670 
logic and then discarding less because
it's<00:02:27.180> not<00:02:27.329> the<00:02:27.659> amount<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:28.019> cost<00:02:28.260> doesn't

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
it's not the amount it cost doesn't

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.259 
it's not the amount it cost doesn't
really<00:02:28.829> affect<00:02:29.220> how<00:02:29.400> many<00:02:29.549> sales<00:02:29.819> they<00:02:30.090> make

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
really affect how many sales they make

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.729 
really affect how many sales they make
the<00:02:30.450> game<00:02:30.599> we<00:02:30.720> just<00:02:30.900> picked<00:02:31.019> up<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.319> perceive

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
the game we just picked up you perceive

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.619 
the game we just picked up you perceive
so<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.819> doesn't<00:02:33.090> make<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.209> lot<00:02:33.329> of<00:02:33.390> sense<00:02:33.450> to

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
so it doesn't make a lot of sense to

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.449 
so it doesn't make a lot of sense to
charge<00:02:33.930> less<00:02:34.230> maybe<00:02:34.560> they'll<00:02:34.860> do<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.069> big<00:02:35.220> sense

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
charge less maybe they'll do a big sense

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.130 
charge less maybe they'll do a big sense
simple<00:02:35.879> i<00:02:36.060> think<00:02:36.450> twenty<00:02:36.599> dollars<00:02:36.959> is<00:02:37.110> a

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
having as big problems of it so they

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.449 
having as big problems of it so they
probably<00:03:55.379> wouldn't<00:03:55.650> do<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.859> same<00:03:55.889> thing<00:03:56.250> but

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
probably wouldn't do the same thing but

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.490 
probably wouldn't do the same thing but
it<00:03:56.940> could<00:03:57.120> happen<00:03:57.239> evil<00:03:57.599> a<00:03:57.720> that's<00:03:58.049> the<00:03:58.290> only

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
it could happen evil a that's the only

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.720 
it could happen evil a that's the only
way<00:03:58.620> it's<00:03:58.739> gonna<00:03:58.829> happen<00:03:59.069> my<00:03:59.280> life<00:03:59.430> think

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
way it's gonna happen my life think

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.149 
way it's gonna happen my life think
unfortunately<00:04:00.030> so<00:04:01.019> yeah<00:04:01.409> just<00:04:01.769> to<00:04:01.919> sum<00:04:02.129> up

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
unfortunately so yeah just to sum up

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.309 
unfortunately so yeah just to sum up
twenty<00:04:02.730> dollars<00:04:03.030> seems<00:04:03.269> like<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.930> price<00:04:04.169> is

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
twenty dollars seems like the price is

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.379 
twenty dollars seems like the price is
gonna<00:04:04.470> be<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:04.980> just<00:04:05.159> make<00:04:05.310> any<00:04:05.400> real<00:04:05.730> sense<00:04:06.180> to

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
gonna be it just make any real sense to

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:08.869 
gonna be it just make any real sense to
it<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.569> be<00:04:06.659> above<00:04:07.019> or<00:04:07.319> below<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:07.859> and<00:04:07.979> it<00:04:08.639> just

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
it to be above or below that and it just

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.939 
it to be above or below that and it just
doesn't<00:04:09.180> seem<00:04:09.359> like<00:04:09.389> it<00:04:09.750> so<00:04:10.470> twenty<00:04:10.709> dollars

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949 
doesn't seem like it so twenty dollars

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:12.439 
doesn't seem like it so twenty dollars
really<00:04:11.310> does<00:04:11.489> seem<00:04:11.669> like<00:04:11.729> the<00:04:11.849> exact<00:04:12.239> price

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:12.449 
really does seem like the exact price

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:14.839 
really does seem like the exact price
and<00:04:12.659> a<00:04:13.229> sample<00:04:13.739> of<00:04:13.769> discount<00:04:14.190> could<00:04:14.459> happen

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
and a sample of discount could happen

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.819 
and a sample of discount could happen
but<00:04:15.209> I've<00:04:15.329> really<00:04:15.659> really<00:04:15.870> down<00:04:16.049> before<00:04:16.440> Jay<00:04:16.650> I

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
but I've really really down before Jay I

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.770 
but I've really really down before Jay I
think<00:04:17.099> it<00:04:17.220> would<00:04:17.340> be<00:04:17.370> Microsoft<00:04:17.970> or<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:18.720> know

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
think it would be Microsoft or you know

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.110 
think it would be Microsoft or you know
potentially<00:04:18.930> Sony<00:04:19.650> um<00:04:20.219> so<00:04:20.519> yeah<00:04:20.669> that's<00:04:20.849> the

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
potentially Sony um so yeah that's the

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.370 
potentially Sony um so yeah that's the
way<00:04:21.239> it's<00:04:21.359> going<00:04:21.450> to<00:04:21.510> go<00:04:21.570> unfortunately<00:04:22.079> I

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
way it's going to go unfortunately I

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.600 
way it's going to go unfortunately I
don't<00:04:22.560> think<00:04:22.830> would've<00:04:23.099> been<00:04:23.190> getting

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610
