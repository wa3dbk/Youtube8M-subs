the back in the rest of the phone
it's<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.230> little<00:02:13.470> bit<00:02:13.590> hard<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.860> see<00:02:14.100> but<00:02:14.340> this

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
it's a little bit hard to see but this

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.040 
it's a little bit hard to see but this
green<00:02:14.910> shield<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.300> really<00:02:15.540> nice<00:02:15.660> because<00:02:15.840> it

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
green shield is really nice because it

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.990 
green shield is really nice because it
doesn't<00:02:16.290> actually<00:02:16.380> cover<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.100> whole<00:02:17.520> screen

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
doesn't actually cover the whole screen

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.770 
doesn't actually cover the whole screen
about<00:02:18.960> a<00:02:19.200> quarter<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:20.070> a<00:02:20.280> centimeter<00:02:20.780> around

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
about a quarter of a centimeter around

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.140 
about a quarter of a centimeter around
the<00:02:21.870> edges<00:02:22.020> there<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.830> no<00:02:22.980> screen<00:02:23.220> shield<00:02:23.610> so

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
the edges there is no screen shield so

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.420 
the edges there is no screen shield so
it<00:02:24.360> makes<00:02:24.540> up<00:02:24.750> for<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.990> curved<00:02:25.500> glass<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:26.250> it's

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
it makes up for the curved glass so it's

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.460 
it makes up for the curved glass so it's
very<00:02:26.580> easy<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:27.390> installing<00:02:27.960> you<00:02:28.140> don't<00:02:28.320> get
