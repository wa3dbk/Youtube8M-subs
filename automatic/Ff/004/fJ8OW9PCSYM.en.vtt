more because you're actually focusing on
one<00:01:12.900> thing<00:01:13.020> as<00:01:13.170> opposed<00:01:13.440> to<00:01:13.500> taking<00:01:13.770> multiple

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
one thing as opposed to taking multiple

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.290 
one thing as opposed to taking multiple
classes<00:01:14.370> and<00:01:14.490> trying<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.700> multitask<00:01:14.850> and

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
classes and trying to multitask and

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.610 
classes and trying to multitask and
juggle<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> bunch<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.840> different<00:01:16.080> things<00:01:16.290> I

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
juggle a bunch of different things I

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.830 
juggle a bunch of different things I
have<00:01:17.040> some<00:01:17.280> students<00:01:17.640> say<00:01:17.910> that<00:01:17.940> they<00:01:18.630> feel

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
have some students say that they feel

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.470 
have some students say that they feel
like<00:01:18.900> they<00:01:19.290> absorb<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.040> material<00:01:20.490> better<00:01:20.760> the

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 
like they absorb the material better the

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.410 
like they absorb the material better the
downside<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.140> it's<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.500> compressed<00:01:23.270> upside<00:01:24.270> is

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
downside is it's so compressed upside is

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.990 
downside is it's so compressed upside is
you<00:01:24.450> can<00:01:24.720> focus<00:01:24.930> on<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.380> you're<00:01:26.130> not<00:01:26.280> taking

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
you can focus on it you're not taking

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.570 
you can focus on it you're not taking
five<00:01:27.210> classes<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.930> may<00:01:28.050> be<00:01:28.110> taking<00:01:28.530> two<00:01:28.710> most

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
five classes you may be taking two most

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.630 
five classes you may be taking two most
students<00:01:29.850> are<00:01:29.910> taking<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.330> I<00:01:31.310> think<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
students are taking one I think that the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.610 
students are taking one I think that the
advantage<00:01:33.120> of<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.330> summer<00:01:33.540> class<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.170> if

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
advantage of a summer class is that if

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.400 
advantage of a summer class is that if
you<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> time<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.520> devote<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.410> you

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
you have the time to devote to it you

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.200 
you have the time to devote to it you
get<00:01:37.560> all<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.980> stuff<00:01:38.220> at<00:01:38.370> once<00:01:40.970> it<00:01:41.970> allows<00:01:42.180> a

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
get all of the stuff at once it allows a

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.430 
get all of the stuff at once it allows a
student<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.780> have<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.990> more<00:01:43.200> intense

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
student to have a more intense

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.080 
student to have a more intense
experience<00:01:44.100> where<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.370> take<00:01:44.550> a<00:01:44.580> course<00:01:44.910> in<00:01:44.970> a
