00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
we then look at this die if it says a

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.380 
we then look at this die if it says a
stop<00:01:39.350> sign<00:01:39.620> then<00:01:39.920> hope<00:01:40.190> rounds<00:01:40.670> over<00:01:40.790> and<00:01:41.180> I

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
stop sign then hope rounds over and I

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.510 
stop sign then hope rounds over and I
just<00:01:41.570> got<00:01:41.690> ten<00:01:41.900> points<00:01:42.080> and<00:01:42.620> I<00:01:42.890> don't<00:01:43.040> want

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
points okay so anyhow let's say the stop

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.310 
points okay so anyhow let's say the stop
sign<00:01:47.060> wasn't<00:01:47.270> rolled<00:01:47.540> let's<00:01:47.900> say<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.140> time

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
sign wasn't rolled let's say the time

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.810 
sign wasn't rolled let's say the time
serie<00:01:48.530> was<00:01:48.650> rolled<00:01:48.860> at<00:01:49.250> that<00:01:49.460> point<00:01:49.730> you

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
serie was rolled at that point you

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.670 
serie was rolled at that point you

that<00:02:10.280> point<00:02:10.580> BAM<00:02:11.270> they're<00:02:11.660> gonna<00:02:11.780> get<00:02:11.930> the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
that point BAM they're gonna get the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.630 
that point BAM they're gonna get the
points<00:02:12.350> but<00:02:12.770> first<00:02:13.040> they<00:02:13.160> look<00:02:13.340> at<00:02:13.459> this

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
points but first they look at this

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.000 
points but first they look at this
action<00:02:14.030> die<00:02:14.209> here<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.600> says<00:02:14.780> times<00:02:15.050> three<00:02:15.470> so

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
action die here it says times three so

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.260 
action die here it says times three so
instead<00:02:16.190> of<00:02:16.250> getting<00:02:16.370> ten<00:02:16.670> points<00:02:17.000> they're

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
instead of getting ten points they're

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.690 
instead of getting ten points they're
going<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.600> get<00:02:17.720> thirty<00:02:18.170> if<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.980> had<00:02:19.130> said<00:02:19.310> times

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
going to get thirty if it had said times

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.810 
going to get thirty if it had said times
two<00:02:20.030> they<00:02:20.720> would<00:02:20.900> get<00:02:21.050> 20<00:02:21.500> if<00:02:21.709> anybody<00:02:22.520> rolls

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
two they would get 20 if anybody rolls

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.970 
two they would get 20 if anybody rolls
one<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.150> these<00:02:23.270> they<00:02:23.930> get<00:02:24.080> another<00:02:24.290> skip<00:02:24.709> chip

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
one of these they get another skip chip

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.320 
one of these they get another skip chip
that's<00:02:25.310> great<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.730> that<00:02:25.820> happens<00:02:26.120> any<00:02:26.270> time

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
that's great and that happens any time

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.690 
that's great and that happens any time
you<00:02:26.570> roll<00:02:26.720> if<00:02:26.930> you<00:02:27.560> roll<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.830> -<00:02:28.220> then<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:28.459> would

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
you roll if you roll the - then I would

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.600 
you roll if you roll the - then I would
lose<00:02:28.940> ten<00:02:29.420> points<00:02:29.840> which<00:02:30.170> is<00:02:30.350> great<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.190> of

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
lose ten points which is great and of

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.100 
lose ten points which is great and of
course<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.910> stop<00:02:32.120> sign<00:02:32.330> if<00:02:32.570> it's<00:02:32.690> rolled<00:02:32.870> at<00:02:32.989> any

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
course a stop sign if it's rolled at any

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.630 
course a stop sign if it's rolled at any
time<00:02:33.350> causes<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.130> round<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.370> immediately

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
time causes the round to immediately

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.340 
time causes the round to immediately
stop<00:02:34.910> doesn't<00:02:35.150> matter<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.570> whoever<00:02:35.930> roll<00:02:36.200> the

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
stop doesn't matter and whoever roll the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.290 
stop doesn't matter and whoever roll the
stop<00:02:36.500> sign<00:02:36.739> gets<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.100> points<00:02:37.459> only<00:02:38.000> nurses

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
stop sign gets the points only nurses

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.120 
stop sign gets the points only nurses
arrow<00:02:38.510> I<00:02:38.780> can<00:02:38.959> point<00:02:39.410> it<00:02:39.530> at<00:02:39.650> you<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:39.920> say

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
arrow I can point it at you and say

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.970 
arrow I can point it at you and say
you're<00:02:40.790> going<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.330> get<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:41.720> ten<00:02:41.900> points<00:02:42.320> so

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
you're going to get the ten points so

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.320 
you're going to get the ten points so
you<00:02:43.070> can<00:02:43.190> see<00:02:43.310> that<00:02:43.489> if<00:02:43.580> 40<00:02:43.850> points<00:02:44.120> is<00:02:44.180> out

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
you can see that if 40 points is out

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.270 
you can see that if 40 points is out
there<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:44.690> you<00:02:45.320> roll<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.620> times<00:02:45.860> three

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
there and you roll the times three

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.280 
there and you roll the times three
that's<00:02:46.820> a<00:02:47.030> really<00:02:47.300> bad<00:02:47.480> thing<00:02:47.720> but<00:02:48.019> it's<00:02:48.170> also

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
that's a really bad thing but it's also

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.420 
that's a really bad thing but it's also
much<00:02:48.590> harder<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:49.070> do

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
much harder to do

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.490 
much harder to do
now<00:02:50.120> these<00:02:50.269> skip<00:02:50.600> chips<00:02:50.900> here<00:02:51.140> ladies<00:02:51.440> and

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
this game you can pay a skip chip before

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.190 
this game you can pay a skip chip before
your<00:02:55.040> turn<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.640> not<00:02:56.360> roll<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.600> dice<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.019> pass

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
it to the next person I don't want to go

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.930 
it to the next person I don't want to go
you<00:02:59.150> go<00:02:59.360> or<00:02:59.690> you<00:03:00.260> can<00:03:00.650> pay<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:00.860> skip<00:03:01.489> chips

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
you go or you can pay to skip chips

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.720 
you go or you can pay to skip chips
if<00:03:02.239> you've<00:03:03.080> rolled<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.560> dice<00:03:03.739> and<00:03:03.980> they

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
if you've rolled the dice and they

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.699 
if you've rolled the dice and they
rolled<00:03:04.970> poorly<00:03:05.360> so<00:03:05.930> you<00:03:06.019> say<00:03:06.290> you<00:03:06.350> know<00:03:06.530> what

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
rolled poorly so you say you know what

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.290 
rolled poorly so you say you know what
let's<00:03:07.040> just<00:03:07.160> ignore<00:03:07.280> this<00:03:07.580> turn<00:03:07.790> go<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.120> the

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
let's just ignore this turn go to the

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.920 
let's just ignore this turn go to the
next<00:03:08.480> person

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
next person

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.630 
next person
so<00:03:09.500> essentially<00:03:09.769> you<00:03:09.890> can<00:03:10.010> pay<00:03:10.100> one<00:03:10.310> chip<00:03:10.519> to

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
so essentially you can pay one chip to

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.460 
so essentially you can pay one chip to
skip<00:03:10.820> your<00:03:10.940> turn<00:03:11.000> before<00:03:11.300> you<00:03:11.540> go<00:03:11.660> or<00:03:12.080> to<00:03:12.350> to

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
skip your turn before you go or to to

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.830 
skip your turn before you go or to to
skip<00:03:12.680> your<00:03:12.799> turn<00:03:12.859> after<00:03:13.489> you<00:03:13.609> go<00:03:13.760> so<00:03:14.570> this<00:03:14.720> is

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
skip your turn after you go so this is

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.720 
skip your turn after you go so this is
going<00:03:14.989> to<00:03:15.079> continue<00:03:15.380> once<00:03:16.100> one<00:03:16.310> person<00:03:16.340> has

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
going to continue once one person has

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:17.570 
going to continue once one person has
gotten<00:03:16.910> points

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
gotten points

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.070 
gotten points
the<00:03:17.760> next<00:03:18.000> person<00:03:18.180> will<00:03:18.330> roll<00:03:18.660> all<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.810> dice

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
the next person will roll all the dice

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.260 
the next person will roll all the dice
this<00:03:19.590> will<00:03:19.800> continue<00:03:20.070> until<00:03:20.250> one<00:03:20.700> person<00:03:21.120> has

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
this will continue until one person has

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.510 
this will continue until one person has
100<00:03:21.750> points<00:03:21.930> when<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.770> happens<00:03:23.130> whoever<00:03:23.340> has

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
100 points when that happens whoever has

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.000 
100 points when that happens whoever has
the<00:03:23.640> lowest<00:03:23.790> score<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.750> winner<00:03:25.010> okay

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
the lowest score is the winner okay

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.710 
the lowest score is the winner okay
first<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:26.520> all<00:03:26.640> we'll<00:03:27.150> talk<00:03:27.270> about<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.510> box

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
first of all we'll talk about the box

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.990 
first of all we'll talk about the box
has<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.470> magnetic<00:03:28.830> top<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.460> the<00:03:29.640> dice<00:03:29.790> go

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
has a magnetic top and the dice go

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.180 
has a magnetic top and the dice go
inside<00:03:30.330> really<00:03:30.900> cool<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.410> don't<00:03:31.980> know<00:03:32.070> why

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
inside really cool I don't know why

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.900 
inside really cool I don't know why
that's<00:03:32.370> so<00:03:32.520> cool

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
that's so cool

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.150 
that's so cool
but<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.270> know<00:03:33.360> it<00:03:33.660> is<00:03:33.810> cool<00:03:34.050> it's<00:03:34.740> because<00:03:35.040> I'm

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
but you know it is cool it's because I'm

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.440 
but you know it is cool it's because I'm
tired<00:03:35.280> of<00:03:35.400> these<00:03:35.490> boxes<00:03:35.940> where<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.270> dice

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
tired of these boxes where you the dice

the game I thought the game was okay
I<00:03:58.440> thought<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:59.070> fun<00:03:59.280> -<00:03:59.490> throwing<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.970> dice<00:04:00.150> and

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
I thought of fun - throwing the dice and

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.940 
I thought of fun - throwing the dice and
then<00:04:00.540> like<00:04:00.900> trying<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.290> get<00:04:01.470> other<00:04:01.620> people<00:04:01.650> the

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
then like trying to get other people the

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.480 
then like trying to get other people the
points<00:04:02.280> but<00:04:02.700> that's<00:04:03.000> basically<00:04:03.270> it<00:04:04.490> well

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
points but that's basically it well

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.610 
points but that's basically it well
really<00:04:05.700> that<00:04:05.940> is<00:04:06.360> basically<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:07.140> in<00:04:07.260> this<00:04:07.410> game

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
really that is basically it in this game

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.880 
really that is basically it in this game
it's<00:04:08.490> it's<00:04:09.000> not<00:04:09.150> like<00:04:09.390> LCR<00:04:09.960> where<00:04:10.350> you<00:04:10.530> mean

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
it's it's not like LCR where you mean

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.590 
it's it's not like LCR where you mean
you<00:04:11.010> have<00:04:11.190> some<00:04:11.430> choice<00:04:11.700> you<00:04:11.910> can<00:04:12.030> say<00:04:12.270> it's

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
you have some choice you can say it's

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.170 
you have some choice you can say it's
your<00:04:13.170> choice<00:04:13.380> is<00:04:13.620> whenever<00:04:14.610> I<00:04:14.670> use<00:04:14.850> a<00:04:14.880> skip

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
your choice is whenever I use a skip

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.509 
your choice is whenever I use a skip
chip<00:04:15.390> yeah<00:04:15.660> that's<00:04:16.200> basically<00:04:16.380> it<00:04:16.739> other<00:04:17.280> than

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
chip yeah that's basically it other than

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.890 
chip yeah that's basically it other than
that<00:04:17.580> your<00:04:17.820> old<00:04:17.970> die<00:04:18.120> something<00:04:18.390> I<00:04:18.510> hope<00:04:18.780> I

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
that your old die something I hope I

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.349 
that your old die something I hope I
roll<00:04:19.200> I<00:04:19.560> almost<00:04:19.980> wished<00:04:20.340> a<00:04:20.489> stop<00:04:20.730> sign<00:04:20.970> wasn't

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
roll I almost wished a stop sign wasn't

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.909 
roll I almost wished a stop sign wasn't
in<00:04:21.450> there<00:04:21.630> because<00:04:22.320> I<00:04:22.380> think<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.620> game<00:04:22.770> is

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
in there because I think the game is

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.380 
in there because I think the game is
more<00:04:23.040> fun<00:04:23.100> when<00:04:23.400> you're<00:04:23.550> pushing<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:24.270> oh<00:04:24.360> I

the green on your turn are you gonna
push<00:04:28.020> you<00:04:28.530> know<00:04:28.590> play<00:04:28.800> a<00:04:28.830> skip<00:04:29.160> chip<00:04:29.430> cuz<00:04:30.030> the

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
push you know play a skip chip cuz the

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.640 
push you know play a skip chip cuz the
stop<00:04:30.419> sign<00:04:30.630> has<00:04:30.780> rolled<00:04:30.990> one<00:04:31.200> out<00:04:31.320> of<00:04:31.350> six

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
stop sign has rolled one out of six

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.830 
stop sign has rolled one out of six
times<00:04:31.919> so<00:04:32.580> it<00:04:32.730> won't<00:04:32.970> go<00:04:33.120> around<00:04:33.240> a<00:04:33.450> table<00:04:33.750> that

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
times so it won't go around a table that

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.010 
times so it won't go around a table that
often<00:04:34.140> the<00:04:34.230> stop<00:04:34.440> sign<00:04:34.680> will<00:04:34.950> be<00:04:35.160> rolled<00:04:35.990> but<00:04:36.990> I

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
often the stop sign will be rolled but I

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.570 
often the stop sign will be rolled but I
have<00:04:37.290> seen<00:04:37.500> someone<00:04:37.740> get<00:04:37.919> a<00:04:37.950> hundred<00:04:38.250> and

medium thing yeah that's kind of where
I'm<00:05:18.270> at<00:05:18.390> -<00:05:18.630> like<00:05:19.169> I<00:05:19.320> said<00:05:19.590> I<00:05:19.620> won't<00:05:19.860> be<00:05:19.950> running

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
I'm at - like I said I won't be running

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.890 
I'm at - like I said I won't be running
out<00:05:20.580> to<00:05:20.700> play<00:05:20.880> this<00:05:21.030> game<00:05:21.240> but<00:05:21.570> I<00:05:21.630> certainly

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
out to play this game but I certainly

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.300 
out to play this game but I certainly
see<00:05:22.200> that<00:05:22.230> there<00:05:22.440> would<00:05:22.530> be<00:05:22.560> a<00:05:22.620> market<00:05:22.890> for<00:05:23.070> and

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
see that there would be a market for and

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.130 
see that there would be a market for and
I<00:05:23.340> think<00:05:23.520> a<00:05:23.580> lot<00:05:23.700> of<00:05:23.730> people<00:05:24.090> would<00:05:24.450> enjoy<00:05:24.930> it

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
I think a lot of people would enjoy it

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.719 
I think a lot of people would enjoy it
just<00:05:25.470> because<00:05:26.039> you<00:05:26.130> can<00:05:26.250> shoot<00:05:26.400> the<00:05:26.550> breeze

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
just because you can shoot the breeze

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.100 
just because you can shoot the breeze
while<00:05:27.030> you're<00:05:27.150> rolling<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.419> dice<00:05:27.660> and<00:05:27.930> such
