silver<00:01:19.049> which<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> bit<00:01:19.590> surprising<00:01:19.710> because

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
silver which is a bit surprising because

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.870 
silver which is a bit surprising because
he<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.490> very<00:01:20.700> good<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.920> right<00:01:22.920> center<00:01:23.610> back

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
he is very good and right center back

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.870 
he is very good and right center back
we've<00:01:24.150> got<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.810> de<00:01:25.409> recheck<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.100> he<00:01:26.700> is

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
we've got this a de recheck and he is

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.600 
we've got this a de recheck and he is
pretty<00:01:27.150> good<00:01:27.390> 68<00:01:28.200> pace<00:01:28.439> but<00:01:28.710> when<00:01:29.130> you

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
pretty good 68 pace but when you

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.980 
pretty good 68 pace but when you
actually<00:01:29.759> play<00:01:30.119> with<00:01:30.299> him<00:01:30.420> he's<00:01:30.540> got<00:01:30.720> better

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
actually play with him he's got better

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.510 
actually play with him he's got better
pace<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.380> night<00:01:31.530> he<00:01:31.890> has<00:01:32.009> good<00:01:32.189> acceleration

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
pace of night he has good acceleration

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.020 
pace of night he has good acceleration
so<00:01:33.180> that's<00:01:33.930> always<00:01:34.200> good<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.939> defending<00:01:35.939> he

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
so that's always good and defending he

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.080 
so that's always good and defending he
got<00:01:36.150> 33<00:01:36.600> different<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:36.990> 71<00:01:37.409> headed<00:01:37.820> so<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.939> is

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
got 33 different in 71 headed so that is

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.240 
got 33 different in 71 headed so that is
very<00:01:39.150> good<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.750> silver<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.770> where<00:01:41.009> these

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
very good for a silver so where these

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.609 
very good for a silver so where these
