00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:10.769
 so beauty now I'm going to teach you so 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.150
 360 spin 365 order is nothing more than 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.450
 that revolves around the axis of the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.450
 back 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.130
 but let's first of all share the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.539
 body positioning 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.369
 the technique I use to find the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.990
 positioning of the body is to make a 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.830
 manual to find a good reference point. 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.240
 balance 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.920
 I'll be back in the next four 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:35.130
 wheels and arms to generate a 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.270
 initial movement will have to be 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.489
 concentrate on leaving the circumference 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.350
 closed as possible if you open the 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:50.670
 circle will lose speed that 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:52.559
 you do not want that to happen I ''m' 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.570
 looking full to show you more 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:01.230
 It's better to look ahead if you work. 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.969
 in a fixed direction that neither the author of 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.760
 This maneuver is learned in stages. 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.350
 first one after two then three and 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:18.299
 so you can still do the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:22.280
 As you wish, this maneuver requires 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.280
 perseverance then do not give up 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.770
