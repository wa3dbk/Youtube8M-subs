00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
people of this mostly it's always been

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.450 
people of this mostly it's always been
about<00:00:54.289> open-pollinated<00:00:55.289> seeds<00:00:55.460> because

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
about open-pollinated seeds because

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.459 
about open-pollinated seeds because
they'll<00:00:57.059> come<00:00:57.329> true<00:00:57.629> as<00:00:57.840> long<00:00:58.199> as<00:00:58.230> you

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
they'll come true as long as you

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.229 
they'll come true as long as you
recognize<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.219> rules<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.699> not<00:00:59.969> allowing

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
recognize the rules of not allowing

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.930

certain members of certain families to

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.090 
certain members of certain families to
get<00:01:03.329> cross<00:01:03.570> pollinated<00:01:04.369> so<00:01:05.600> it<00:01:06.600> means<00:01:07.100> people

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
get cross pollinated so it means people

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.980 
get cross pollinated so it means people
are<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.430> control<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.450> seeds<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.780> they

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
are in control of the seeds that they

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.110 
are in control of the seeds that they
grow<00:01:10.430> instead<00:01:11.430> of

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
grow instead of

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.200 
grow instead of
having<00:01:13.810> to<00:01:13.900> go<00:01:14.020> back<00:01:14.230> to<00:01:14.580> see<00:01:15.580> company<00:01:15.970> to<00:01:16.090> get

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
having to go back to see company to get

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.950 
having to go back to see company to get
the<00:01:16.390> same<00:01:16.570> hybrid<00:01:17.260> seat<00:01:17.620> again<00:01:18.330> okay<00:01:19.330> so<00:01:21.960> John

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
the same hybrid seat again okay so John

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.280 
the same hybrid seat again okay so John
Jevons<00:01:23.380> for<00:01:23.830> example<00:01:24.250> a<00:01:24.460> key<00:01:25.420> factor<00:01:25.660> of<00:01:26.050> his

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
Jevons for example a key factor of his

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.070 
Jevons for example a key factor of his
his<00:01:27.010> encouragement<00:01:27.850> and<00:01:28.150> approaches<00:01:28.780> he's

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
his encouragement and approaches he's

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.810 
his encouragement and approaches he's
saying<00:01:29.380> you<00:01:29.590> got<00:01:30.190> to<00:01:30.310> use<00:01:30.400> open-pollinated

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
saying you got to use open-pollinated

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.920 
saying you got to use open-pollinated
seeds<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.770> is<00:01:33.100> this<00:01:33.490> just<00:01:33.520> this<00:01:34.510> is<00:01:34.690> just

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
seeds so is this just this is just

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.750 
seeds so is this just this is just
bringing<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.380> focus<00:01:35.560> back<00:01:36.010> bringing<00:01:36.550> the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
bringing the focus back bringing the

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.130 
bringing the focus back bringing the
accent<00:01:37.270> back<00:01:37.510> to<00:01:39.450> recognizing<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.930> role<00:01:40.960> of

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
accent back to recognizing the role of

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.970 
accent back to recognizing the role of
cigs<00:01:42.510> yeah<00:01:43.510> pretty<00:01:43.870> much<00:01:43.960> because<00:01:44.680> she's<00:01:46.980> a

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
cigs yeah pretty much because she's a

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.760 
cigs yeah pretty much because she's a
really<00:01:48.310> crucial<00:01:49.150> lay<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.630> kind<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.440> seats<00:01:50.650> you

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
really crucial lay the kind of seats you

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.860 
really crucial lay the kind of seats you
have<00:01:50.920> determined<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:52.360> kind<00:01:52.600> of<00:01:52.690> food<00:01:52.810> that

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
have determined the kind of food that

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.740 
have determined the kind of food that
you<00:01:53.170> eat<00:01:53.200> and<00:01:53.590> if<00:01:54.370> you<00:01:54.460> have<00:01:54.580> GMO<00:01:55.090> or<00:01:55.120> hybrid

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
you eat and if you have GMO or hybrid

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.880 
you eat and if you have GMO or hybrid
seeds<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.410> you're<00:01:57.160> right<00:01:58.000> away<00:01:58.890> entering

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
seeds and you're right away entering

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.950 
seeds and you're right away entering
into<00:02:00.010> a<00:02:00.160> disempowered<00:02:01.150> relationship<00:02:01.750> with

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
into a disempowered relationship with

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.230 
into a disempowered relationship with
with<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.350> seeds<00:02:02.740> where<00:02:03.160> somebody<00:02:04.030> else

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
with the seeds where somebody else

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.710 
with the seeds where somebody else
controls<00:02:04.870> the<00:02:05.170> seed<00:02:05.440> and<00:02:06.150> takes<00:02:07.150> advantage<00:02:07.630> of

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
controls the seed and takes advantage of

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.970 
controls the seed and takes advantage of
you<00:02:07.960> from<00:02:08.619> their<00:02:08.800> control<00:02:09.420> okay<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:11.440> it's<00:02:11.680> it's

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
you from their control okay so it's it's

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.390 
you from their control okay so it's it's
seeds<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.700> were<00:02:13.240> grown<00:02:13.600> either<00:02:14.200> by<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.560> come

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
seeds that were grown either by you come

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.940 
seeds that were grown either by you come
up<00:02:15.520> to<00:02:15.610> come<00:02:15.640> off<00:02:15.880> your<00:02:16.000> own<00:02:16.180> plants<00:02:16.690> or<00:02:17.140> you're

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
up to come off your own plants or you're

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.949 
up to come off your own plants or you're
getting<00:02:18.100> your<00:02:18.340> seeds<00:02:18.580> from<00:02:18.820> people<00:02:19.239> who

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
getting your seeds from people who

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.660 
getting your seeds from people who
haven't<00:02:20.800> crossed<00:02:21.130> their<00:02:21.370> seeds<00:02:21.640> haven't

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
haven't crossed their seeds haven't

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.160 
haven't crossed their seeds haven't
genetically<00:02:24.670> modified<00:02:25.090> their<00:02:25.300> seeds<00:02:25.570> right

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
genetically modified their seeds right

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.920 
genetically modified their seeds right
they've<00:02:26.920> been<00:02:27.070> pollinated<00:02:27.730> in<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.420> open<00:02:28.690> air

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
they've been pollinated in the open air

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.890 
they've been pollinated in the open air
yeah<00:02:29.650> okay<00:02:30.280> yeah<00:02:30.550> so<00:02:30.790> open<00:02:31.090> pollinated<00:02:31.540> means

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
yeah okay yeah so open pollinated means

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.470 
yeah okay yeah so open pollinated means
