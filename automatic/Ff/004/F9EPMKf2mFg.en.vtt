00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
today we're working the muscle from

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.590 
today we're working the muscle from
three<00:01:03.280> different<00:01:03.460> angles<00:01:03.879> what<00:01:04.059> he<00:01:04.150> was<00:01:04.300> doing

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
three different angles what he was doing

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.060 
three different angles what he was doing
he<00:01:04.780> was<00:01:04.869> working<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.320> side<00:01:05.590> called<00:01:05.979> the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
he was working the side called the

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.250 
he was working the side called the
brachialis<00:01:06.660> what<00:01:07.660> we're<00:01:07.810> doing<00:01:08.020> with<00:01:08.110> only

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
brachialis what we're doing with only

brachialis what we're doing with only
working<00:01:08.650> with<00:01:08.800> one<00:01:08.860> set<00:01:09.100> its<00:01:09.729> total<00:01:10.060> failure

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
working with one set its total failure

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.840 
working with one set its total failure
will<00:01:11.200> work<00:01:11.380> in<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.619> muscle<00:01:12.010> from<00:01:12.280> different

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
will work in the muscle from different

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.630 
will work in the muscle from different
sectors<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:14.080> later<00:01:14.650> on<00:01:14.740> in<00:01:15.010> our<00:01:15.100> series<00:01:15.400> I'll

see what he does today and I'll go into

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:18.430 
see what he does today and I'll go into
the<00:01:58.439> logic<00:01:58.830> of<00:01:58.920> this

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.320 

okay<00:02:19.440> that's<00:02:19.950> very<00:02:20.160> strong<00:02:20.850> on<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.150> lake

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
okay that's very strong on the lake

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.800 
okay that's very strong on the lake
press<00:02:21.630> with<00:02:21.930> his<00:02:22.110> genetics<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:23.240> he<00:02:24.240> graduated

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
press with his genetics so he graduated

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.720 
press with his genetics so he graduated
today<00:02:24.960> next<00:02:25.890> workout<00:02:26.340> we're<00:02:26.580> going<00:02:26.670> to

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
today next workout we're going to

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.150 
today next workout we're going to
probably<00:02:26.910> put<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.180> quarter<00:02:27.510> on<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:28.170> this<00:02:28.350> imma

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
probably put a quarter on to this imma

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.530 
probably put a quarter on to this imma
take<00:02:29.340> them<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.760> limit<00:02:29.910> where<00:02:30.270> he's<00:02:30.360> not

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
take them to the limit where he's not

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.900 
take them to the limit where he's not
getting<00:02:30.870> tech<00:02:31.050> rep<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:31.560> he's<00:02:32.220> continued<00:02:32.820> to

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
getting tech rep so he's continued to

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.850 
getting tech rep so he's continued to
make<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.270> lot<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.540> improvement<00:02:34.290> even<00:02:34.470> being<00:02:34.740> in

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
make a lot of improvement even being in

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.220 
make a lot of improvement even being in
a<00:02:34.980> negative<00:02:35.160> calorie<00:02:35.700> bounce<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.810> logic

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
a negative calorie bounce so the logic

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.510 
a negative calorie bounce so the logic
is<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.560> want<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:37.740> get<00:02:37.860> stronger<00:02:38.250> every

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
is you want to get stronger every

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.610 
is you want to get stronger every
workout<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.660> will<00:02:39.780> not<00:02:39.930> look<00:02:40.110> at<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:40.410> thing

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
workout you will not look at this thing

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.770 
workout you will not look at this thing
is<00:02:41.040> heavy<00:02:41.220> set<00:02:41.580> next<00:02:41.820> workout<00:02:42.210> we're<00:02:42.480> going<00:02:42.720> to

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
is heavy set next workout we're going to

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.750 
is heavy set next workout we're going to
put<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.050> quarter<00:02:43.470> on<00:02:43.590> each<00:02:43.740> side<00:02:43.980> I'm<00:02:44.610> going

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
put the quarter on each side I'm going

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.950 
put the quarter on each side I'm going
to<00:02:44.820> take<00:02:44.940> them<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.300> limit<00:02:45.480> where<00:02:45.810> he's

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
to take them to the limit where he's

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.480 
to take them to the limit where he's
only<00:02:46.140> need<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.410> get<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.680> six<00:02:46.860> seven<00:02:47.160> reps<00:02:47.340> out

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
only need to get to six seven reps out

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.620

3,500<00:06:02.589> calories<00:06:02.739> so<00:06:03.309> did<00:06:04.119> the<00:06:04.209> math<00:06:04.419> is<00:06:04.659> this

00:06:04.859 --> 00:06:04.869 
3,500 calories so did the math is this

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:06.869 
3,500 calories so did the math is this
not<00:06:05.110> possible<00:06:05.649> because<00:06:05.709> amount<00:06:06.099> of<00:06:06.309> fat<00:06:06.519> in

two<00:06:07.329> weeks<00:06:07.539> a<00:06:07.599> lot<00:06:07.719> of<00:06:07.839> edgewater<00:06:08.169> but<00:06:08.769> he<00:06:08.829> did

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:08.979 
two weeks a lot of edgewater but he did

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:11.069 
two weeks a lot of edgewater but he did
lose<00:06:09.159> a<00:06:09.189> lot<00:06:09.339> of<00:06:09.369> fat<00:06:09.669> too<00:06:09.969> and<00:06:10.569> we'll<00:06:10.839> get<00:06:10.959> into

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:11.079 
lose a lot of fat too and we'll get into

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:13.259 
lose a lot of fat too and we'll get into
that<00:06:11.199> to<00:06:11.559> a<00:06:11.589> little<00:06:11.860> more<00:06:12.099> of<00:06:12.219> the<00:06:12.249> logic<00:06:12.879> what

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:13.269 
that to a little more of the logic what

00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:16.259 
that to a little more of the logic what
is<00:06:13.419> true<00:06:13.659> fat<00:06:13.959> versus<00:06:14.439> water<00:06:14.800> so<00:06:15.399> but<00:06:16.059> you

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:16.269 
is true fat versus water so but you

00:06:16.269 --> 00:06:17.579 
is true fat versus water so but you
