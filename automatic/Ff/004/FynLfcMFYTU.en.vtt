many different kinds of drills we've

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.609 
many different kinds of drills we've
certainly<00:01:50.490> tried<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.789> with<00:01:50.880> many<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.499> might

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
certainly tried it with many so it might

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.620 
certainly tried it with many so it might
take<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> few<00:01:52.950> minutes<00:01:53.369> but<00:01:53.609> certainly<00:01:54.060> make

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
take a few minutes but certainly make

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.880 
take a few minutes but certainly make
sure<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.929> get<00:01:55.020> everything<00:01:55.289> lined<00:01:55.710> up

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
sure you get everything lined up

sure you get everything lined up
properly<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.429> then<00:01:56.670> tighten<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.030> up<00:01:57.119> one

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
properly and then tighten it up one

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.480 
properly and then tighten it up one
thing<00:01:58.109> when<00:01:58.530> you're<00:01:58.649> looking<00:01:58.679> at<00:01:59.069> your<00:01:59.100> drill

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
thing when you're looking at your drill

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.940 
thing when you're looking at your drill
make<00:01:59.850> sure<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.869> have<00:02:01.109> the<00:02:01.649> clutch

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
make sure that you have the clutch

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.330 
make sure that you have the clutch
setting<00:02:02.219> on<00:02:02.490> drill<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.390> then<00:02:04.259> your<00:02:04.890> drill<00:02:05.159> on

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
setting on drill and then your drill on

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.789 
setting on drill and then your drill on
low<00:02:05.549> overall<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:07.079> that's<00:02:07.259> going<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.499> give
