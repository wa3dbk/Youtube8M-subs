so<00:00:08.810> it<00:00:08.930> started<00:00:09.350> because<00:00:09.680> we<00:00:09.950> really<00:00:10.400> were

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:10.520 
so it started because we really were

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.520 
so it started because we really were
looking<00:00:10.820> for<00:00:11.030> a<00:00:11.060> flaw

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530 
looking for a flaw

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.670 
looking for a flaw
p<00:00:11.710> that<00:00:11.920> matched

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:13.680 
p that matched

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.530 
p that matched
kids<00:00:13.920> we<00:00:14.220> really<00:00:14.610> knew<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:15.120> they<00:00:15.270> didn't

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
kids we really knew that they didn't

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.720 
kids we really knew that they didn't
come<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.930> us<00:00:16.110> as<00:00:16.440> empty<00:00:16.740> vessels<00:00:17.220> waiting<00:00:17.610> to

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
come to us as empty vessels waiting to

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.390 
come to us as empty vessels waiting to
be<00:00:17.850> filled<00:00:18.120> and<00:00:18.420> we<00:00:19.080> knew<00:00:19.290> that<00:00:19.320> we<00:00:20.220> could

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
be filled and we knew that we could

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.040 
be filled and we knew that we could
improve<00:00:20.520> our<00:00:21.060> teaching<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.570> learning<00:00:21.720> at<00:00:21.990> the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
improve our teaching and learning at the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.050 
improve our teaching and learning at the
school<00:00:22.440> and<00:00:22.710> then<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.310> started<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.730> look<00:00:23.850> at

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
school and then we started to look at

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.540 
school and then we started to look at
Reggio<00:00:24.360> Emilia<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.990> everything<00:00:25.980> resonated

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
Reggio Emilia and everything resonated

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.670 
Reggio Emilia and everything resonated
with<00:00:26.700> us<00:00:26.730> right<00:00:27.270> from<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.720> get-go<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.290> that

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
with us right from the get-go and that

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.680 
with us right from the get-go and that
was<00:00:28.830> really<00:00:28.950> exciting<00:00:29.520> a<00:00:29.640> reggio<00:00:30.120> inspired

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.690 
was really exciting a reggio inspired

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.160 
was really exciting a reggio inspired
approach<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.700> is<00:00:32.700> an<00:00:33.360> approach<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.140> a

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
approach is is an approach it is a

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.350 
approach is is an approach it is a
philosophy<00:00:34.860> there<00:00:35.190> are<00:00:35.309> some<00:00:35.640> fundamental

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
philosophy there are some fundamental

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.750 
philosophy there are some fundamental
principles<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.470> beliefs<00:00:37.739> about<00:00:38.160> how<00:00:38.699> we

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
principles and beliefs about how we

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.630 
principles and beliefs about how we
believe<00:00:39.300> children<00:00:39.750> learn<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.890> challenge<00:00:41.400> was

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
believe children learn the challenge was

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.780 
believe children learn the challenge was
to<00:00:41.670> think<00:00:42.059> about<00:00:42.330> that<00:00:42.660> approach<00:00:43.199> in<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:44.580> our

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
to think about that approach in in our

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.450 
to think about that approach in in our
context<00:00:45.540> and<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.260> how<00:00:46.560> could<00:00:46.739> we<00:00:46.950> take<00:00:47.190> all<00:00:47.430> of

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
context and so how could we take all of

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.819 
context and so how could we take all of
those<00:00:47.850> wonderful<00:00:48.320> opportunities<00:00:49.320> and

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
those wonderful opportunities and

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.250 
those wonderful opportunities and
created<00:00:50.370> an<00:00:50.460> environment<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:51.090> also<00:00:51.630> valued

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
created an environment that also valued

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.340 
created an environment that also valued
all<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.890> things<00:00:53.040> that<00:00:53.190> BSS<00:00:53.850> has<00:00:54.210> valued<00:00:55.110> in

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
all of the things that BSS has valued in

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.590 
all of the things that BSS has valued in
the<00:00:55.530> past

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.150 

think<00:00:59.750> we<00:01:00.140> always<00:01:00.469> look<00:01:00.559> to<00:01:00.590> them<00:01:00.739> as<00:01:00.829> them<00:01:01.039> as

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
think we always look to them as them as

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160 
think we always look to them as them as
learners<00:01:01.309> girls<00:01:02.059> children<00:01:02.600> as<00:01:02.719> learners<00:01:02.899> and

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
learners girls children as learners and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.429 
learners girls children as learners and
now<00:01:03.769> we<00:01:03.829> see<00:01:04.009> them<00:01:04.309> more<00:01:04.460> as<00:01:04.610> a<00:01:04.640> whole<00:01:04.939> being<00:01:05.900> we

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
now we see them more as a whole being we

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.710 
now we see them more as a whole being we
see<00:01:06.680> them<00:01:06.830> in<00:01:06.950> such<00:01:07.130> a<00:01:07.159> very<00:01:07.460> clear<00:01:08.030> dynamic

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
see them in such a very clear dynamic

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.660 
see them in such a very clear dynamic
way<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:09.140> before<00:01:10.100> we<00:01:10.130> would<00:01:10.340> have<00:01:10.430> seen<00:01:10.640> them

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
way and before we would have seen them

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.840 
way and before we would have seen them
as<00:01:10.940> math<00:01:11.299> learners<00:01:11.770> literacy<00:01:12.770> learners<00:01:13.130> how

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
as math learners literacy learners how

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.130 
as math learners literacy learners how
they<00:01:14.000> learn<00:01:14.149> in<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.330> computer<00:01:14.720> and<00:01:14.960> we<00:01:15.020> were

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
they learn in the computer and we were

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.719 
they learn in the computer and we were
very<00:01:15.170> compartmentalized<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:16.250> segmented

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
very compartmentalized and segmented

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.420 
very compartmentalized and segmented
kids<00:01:17.180> have<00:01:17.420> are<00:01:17.720> very<00:01:18.530> confident<00:01:19.130> in<00:01:19.280> their

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
kids have are very confident in their

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.639 
kids have are very confident in their
questions<00:01:19.909> asked<00:01:20.210> brilliant<00:01:20.869> questions<00:01:21.380> and

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
questions asked brilliant questions and

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.740 
questions asked brilliant questions and
not<00:01:21.740> just<00:01:21.979> simple<00:01:22.399> yes-or-no<00:01:23.060> questions<00:01:23.570> but

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
not just simple yes-or-no questions but

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.330 
not just simple yes-or-no questions but
really<00:01:24.080> have<00:01:24.229> evolved<00:01:24.710> their<00:01:24.920> thinking<00:01:25.190> you

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
really have evolved their thinking you

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.910 
really have evolved their thinking you
can<00:01:25.460> learn<00:01:25.610> about<00:01:25.729> anything<00:01:26.060> in<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.330> world<00:01:26.479> by

can learn about anything in the world by

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.680 
can learn about anything in the world by
asking<00:01:27.920> your<00:01:28.130> questions<00:01:28.729> children<00:01:29.450> then

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
asking your questions children then

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.950 
asking your questions children then
retain<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:30.830> notion<00:01:31.280> of<00:01:31.369> my<00:01:32.210> interests<00:01:32.869> are

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
retain the notion of my interests are

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.960 
retain the notion of my interests are
powerful<00:01:33.740> and<00:01:33.890> important<00:01:34.490> they<00:01:34.909> see

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
powerful and important they see

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.559 
powerful and important they see
themselves<00:01:35.539> as<00:01:35.960> powerful<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:37.569> resourceful

and resourceful and they and not as
little<00:01:41.600> it<00:01:41.960> all<00:01:42.140> comes<00:01:42.470> back<00:01:42.590> to<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:43.460> image<00:01:43.729> of

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
little it all comes back to the image of

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.490 
little it all comes back to the image of
the<00:01:43.970> child<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.450> how<00:01:44.630> do<00:01:44.690> you<00:01:44.840> see<00:01:45.080> them<00:01:45.259> we

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
the child and how do you see them we

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.320 
the child and how do you see them we
believe<00:01:45.800> that<00:01:46.009> when<00:01:46.280> they<00:01:46.429> come<00:01:46.640> to<00:01:46.819> us<00:01:46.850> when

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
believe that when they come to us when

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.450 
believe that when they come to us when
they're<00:01:47.539> 3<00:01:48.110> and<00:01:48.289> therefore<00:01:48.740> they're<00:01:48.979> already

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
they're 3 and therefore they're already

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.800 
they're 3 and therefore they're already
incredibly<00:01:50.149> intellectually<00:01:50.869> powerful

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.050 

we<00:01:55.560> really<00:01:55.829> value<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.369> relationship<00:01:56.399> that

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
we really value the relationship that

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.109 
we really value the relationship that
parents<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:58.430> with<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.700> learning<00:02:00.000> community

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
parents have with the learning community

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.450 
parents have with the learning community
here<00:02:00.720> it's<00:02:01.110> really<00:02:01.530> really<00:02:01.799> important<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.430> us

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
here it's really really important to us

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.819 
here it's really really important to us
