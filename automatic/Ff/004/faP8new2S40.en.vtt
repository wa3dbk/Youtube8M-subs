00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.100
 few games are as popular as 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.930
 of the saga hangs out or after 11 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.060
 games without counting the expansions 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.400
 we can say that it will certainly be a 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.279
 absolute success of both sales and 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.990
 of quality and now after a 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.900
 very long wait since the last 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.469
 release of a gta in 2008 the rockstar 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.719
 invested something around 266 million 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.829
 dollars to make today until 5 that is 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.110
 more money than is invested in 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.989
 many hollywood productions and it's obvious 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.700
 that the result was very good 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.579
 we will now see five reasons for 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:52.469
 You play this game and it's spectacular. 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.530
 the first reason the best soundtrack 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.940
 of history 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.739
 for many this detail passes 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.410
 unnoticed but the quality of the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.989
 radio stations on gta5 is amazing 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.890
 rockstar games has licensed 240 songs 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.840
 to the game 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.310
 big names like johnny cash elton 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.260
 john are present 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.840
 besides these pop music classics 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.360
 recent as only girl de rihana and what 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.880
 I'm dead because neither spears at all. 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.470
 radios still have schedules 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.570
 journalists reporting on the crimes they 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.880
 happened in the city including those who 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.040
 you commit 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.170
 You call to press games. 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.610
 regardless of the answer I suggest 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.770
 Did you watch the last video that is 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.180
 linked in the description as it finishes 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.040
 in which he spoke about the importance 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.840
 of a good soundtrack 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.380
 already basic if you want to go there 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.380
 take a look 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:52.829
 the second motive three characters 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:54.929
 main if gta was already incredible with 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.950
 only one protagonist per game imagines 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.319
 with three 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.200
 franklin and michael and trevor share the 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:03.210
 protagonism of gta 5 when the rockstar 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.429
 announced this news many fans 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.009
 twisted their nose but the end result 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:11.090
 was a slap in the face of these pessimists 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.709
 slap in society's face 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.120
 with an exceptional script for each 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.640
 on personality traits 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.830
 completely different among them 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.310
 experience of playing is much more 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.310
 so cool 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:39.430
 the third gigantic map motif is 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.500
 characteristic of rockstar produce 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.660
 games in open map as in case she 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.630
 and in the air radio edition beyond the own 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.970
 big now however gta5 we take 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.640
 to a completely higher level the map 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.140
 it's really gigantic though it's not 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.460
 exhausting walk along it since 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.860
 graphic details that we see are 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.780
 fantastic and talking in detail if 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.010
 Do you usually pay attention to this self? 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.320
 I recommend watching the channel video 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.670
 of 2010 promotions points to several 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.470
 small details that often 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.270
 they go unnoticed but are very 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.860
 interesting that rockstar has implemented 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.810
 in the game you now see an excerpt from the video 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.980
 link to watch is in the description already 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.810
 was unable to obtain permission to 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.850
 show here only one 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.290
 stretch and was allowed but it does not hurt 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.440
 If you're curious, go there and 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.440
 after 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.050
 O 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:07.160
 The Fourth Reason Choices and More Choices 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.340
 practically everything within the world of 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.650
 gta5 is transformable rockstar has returned to 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.090
 bet on the formula gta san andreas where 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.100
 now I had several options for 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.030
 modification of cars between 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.470
 others 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.020
 this characteristic which had diminished 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.880
 drastically in gta 4 is a form of the 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.950
 player feels much more immersed in the 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.650
 game as well as clothes and cars 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.110
 he can plan the crimes he committed 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.890
 choosing the locations the strategy and even 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.890
 the comparsas that will use for the act 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.800
 that the tumor is closed with the key 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.120
 gold 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.320
 obviously many games will still be 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.550
 released for playstation 3 xbox 360 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.220
 no more huge budget games 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.050
 should be made for these platforms already 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.840
 that in a short time the new wishes 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.400
 of consumption of all gamer came ps4 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.680
 eo xbox hand 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.510
 I particularly can not think of one 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.060
 way this generation ends up better because 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:05.030
 gta epic guy even more after 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.390
 so long waiting for a new game 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.730
 huh 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:11.740
 just missed launching the pc along with 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.740
 business consoles launch 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:19.280
 Of course, these are just a few 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.260
 of the reasons that make gta5 foda do 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.880
 The way that it is you will definitely go 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.800
