00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
but by far the most interesting and most

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.610 
but by far the most interesting and most
important<00:02:12.069> detail<00:02:12.430> is<00:02:12.730> ah<00:02:13.180> now<00:02:13.780> we<00:02:13.840> know<00:02:14.200> like

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
important detail is ah now we know like

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.220 
important detail is ah now we know like
what<00:02:15.400> is<00:02:15.549> his<00:02:15.730> trophies<00:02:16.239> don't<00:02:16.390> want<00:02:16.599> Pokemon

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
what is his trophies don't want Pokemon

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.949 
what is his trophies don't want Pokemon
every<00:02:17.950> SS<00:02:18.310> trophy<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:18.849> Pokemon<00:02:19.299> belong<00:02:19.599> to

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
every SS trophy and Pokemon belong to

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.350 
every SS trophy and Pokemon belong to
because<00:02:20.680> of<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.040> cursor<00:02:21.430> so<00:02:21.880> that's<00:02:22.030> really

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
because of the cursor so that's really

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.910 
because of the cursor so that's really
cool<00:02:22.540> that's<00:02:22.750> really<00:02:22.959> convenient<00:02:23.319> probably

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920
