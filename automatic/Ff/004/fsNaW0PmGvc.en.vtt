and I will actually played what the
normal<00:03:48.940> pool<00:03:49.150> is<00:03:49.590> let's<00:03:50.590> play<00:03:50.769> a<00:03:50.799> normal<00:03:51.040> game

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
normal pool is let's play a normal game

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.920 
normal pool is let's play a normal game
of<00:03:51.459> pool<00:03:51.609> here<00:03:51.879> so<00:03:52.090> eight<00:03:52.180> ball<00:03:52.449> could<00:03:52.690> be<00:03:52.750> the

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
of pool here so eight ball could be the

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.439 
of pool here so eight ball could be the
finest<00:03:53.680> Feridun<00:03:54.489> phone<00:03:54.730> from<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.030> parent<00:03:55.329> i

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:55.449 
finest Feridun phone from the parent i

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:58.259 
finest Feridun phone from the parent i
don't<00:03:56.290> know<00:03:56.379> a<00:03:56.919> boat<00:03:57.160> or<00:03:57.430> I<00:03:57.459> think

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
don't know a boat or I think

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.800 
don't know a boat or I think
Sky<00:03:59.049> Lounge<00:03:59.500> poor<00:04:00.310> yeah<00:04:00.760> when<00:04:01.389> I<00:04:01.419> played<00:04:01.690> this

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
Sky Lounge poor yeah when I played this

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.240 
Sky Lounge poor yeah when I played this
earlier<00:04:02.230> it<00:04:02.410> was<00:04:03.180> striped<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:04.569> colored<00:04:05.290> and<00:04:05.500> I

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
earlier it was striped and colored and I

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.729 
earlier it was striped and colored and I
was<00:04:06.430> hitting<00:04:06.730> them<00:04:06.879> in<00:04:07.329> any<00:04:07.900> order<00:04:08.230> I<00:04:08.290> wants<00:04:08.620> it

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
was hitting them in any order I wants it

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:09.990 
was hitting them in any order I wants it
so<00:04:08.889> I'm<00:04:08.980> guessing<00:04:09.310> us<00:04:09.430> in<00:04:09.549> the<00:04:09.639> wrong<00:04:09.790> mode

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
so I'm guessing us in the wrong mode

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.479 
so I'm guessing us in the wrong mode
Heath<00:04:10.660> he<00:04:11.349> wasn't<00:04:11.620> here<00:04:11.769> first<00:04:12.099> though<00:04:12.310> -

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
Heath he wasn't here first though -

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.360 
Heath he wasn't here first though -
that's<00:04:13.120> a<00:04:13.269> bit<00:04:13.540> of<00:04:13.599> a<00:04:13.660> pain<00:04:13.870> but<00:04:14.799> I<00:04:14.889> didn't<00:04:15.280> get

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
that's a bit of a pain but I didn't get

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.099 
that's a bit of a pain but I didn't get
the<00:04:15.519> ability<00:04:15.639> to<00:04:15.910> hit<00:04:16.090> whenever<00:04:16.269> what<00:04:16.570> I<00:04:16.599> hear

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
the ability to hit whenever what I hear

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.140 
the ability to hit whenever what I hear
is<00:04:17.229> basically<00:04:17.769> I<00:04:17.919> can<00:04:18.219> hear<00:04:18.700> whatever<00:04:18.849> ball<00:04:19.120> I

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
is basically I can hear whatever ball I

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.800 
is basically I can hear whatever ball I
want<00:04:19.450> and<00:04:19.680> you

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
want and you

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.750 
want and you
all<00:04:21.260> right<00:04:21.440> so<00:04:21.620> this<00:04:21.709> game<00:04:21.950> looks<00:04:22.310> very<00:04:22.430> nice

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
all right so this game looks very nice

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.030 
all right so this game looks very nice
the<00:04:23.030> physics<00:04:23.389> in<00:04:23.480> the<00:04:23.570> game<00:04:23.750> are<00:04:23.990> very<00:04:24.560> very

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
the physics in the game are very very

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.670 
the physics in the game are very very
good<00:04:25.280> it's<00:04:26.180> probably<00:04:26.570> one<00:04:26.660> of<00:04:26.690> my<00:04:26.810> favorite

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
good it's probably one of my favorite

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.320 
good it's probably one of my favorite
pool<00:04:27.860> simulators<00:04:28.430> to<00:04:28.700> be<00:04:28.790> honest<00:04:29.030> playing

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
pool simulators to be honest playing

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.050 
pool simulators to be honest playing
this<00:04:29.600> they<00:04:30.530> made<00:04:30.919> some<00:04:31.100> official<00:04:31.580> like<00:04:31.790> pool

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
this they made some official like pool

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.940 
this they made some official like pool
championship<00:04:32.960> games<00:04:33.260> and<00:04:33.500> they<00:04:33.560> also<00:04:33.710> did

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
championship games and they also did

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.409 
championship games and they also did
pool<00:04:34.160> paradise<00:04:34.700> which<00:04:34.970> was<00:04:35.120> on<00:04:35.270> the

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
pool paradise which was on the

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.930 
pool paradise which was on the
PlayStation<00:04:36.200> 2<00:04:36.230> which<00:04:37.160> is<00:04:37.370> always<00:04:37.700> quite<00:04:37.910> a

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
PlayStation 2 which is always quite a

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.000 
PlayStation 2 which is always quite a
bit<00:04:38.180> but<00:04:38.270> this<00:04:38.389> game<00:04:38.960> is<00:04:39.380> definitely<00:04:39.830> better

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
bit but this game is definitely better

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.620 
bit but this game is definitely better
in<00:04:40.250> terms<00:04:40.460> of<00:04:40.639> physics<00:04:40.940> now<00:04:41.210> you<00:04:41.270> can<00:04:41.480> see

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
in terms of physics now you can see

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.720 
in terms of physics now you can see
there<00:04:41.780> he<00:04:41.960> is<00:04:41.990> completely<00:04:42.620> owning<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:43.550> pool

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
there he is completely owning the pool

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.629 
there he is completely owning the pool
table<00:04:44.120> here<00:04:44.510> is<00:04:44.690> just<00:04:44.990> potting<00:04:45.680> everything

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
table here is just potting everything

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.720 
table here is just potting everything
and<00:04:46.900> that's<00:04:47.900> not<00:04:48.050> realistic<00:04:48.460> unless<00:04:49.460> you're<00:04:49.639> a

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
and that's not realistic unless you're a

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.120 
and that's not realistic unless you're a
skilled<00:04:50.060> player<00:04:50.389> that's<00:04:51.080> not<00:04:51.440> realistic<00:04:51.740> in

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
skilled player that's not realistic in

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.159 
skilled player that's not realistic in
the<00:04:52.220> slightest<00:04:52.669> I'm<00:04:53.090> not<00:04:53.330> I'm<00:04:53.660> not<00:04:53.840> too<00:04:53.990> happy

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
the slightest I'm not I'm not too happy

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.750 
the slightest I'm not I'm not too happy
about<00:04:54.350> the<00:04:54.590> AI<00:04:54.770> I'm<00:04:55.070> guessing<00:04:55.490> there's<00:04:55.640> a<00:04:55.669> way

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
about the AI I'm guessing there's a way

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.330 
about the AI I'm guessing there's a way
to<00:04:55.820> turn<00:04:56.090> it<00:04:56.210> down<00:04:56.240> and<00:04:56.870> will<00:04:56.990> slow<00:04:57.200> it<00:04:57.350> down<00:04:57.380> so

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
to turn it down and will slow it down so

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.800 
to turn it down and will slow it down so
what<00:04:58.490> we're<00:04:58.610> gonna<00:04:58.700> do<00:04:58.820> here<00:04:59.030> other<00:04:59.240> than<00:04:59.330> try

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
what we're gonna do here other than try

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.830 
what we're gonna do here other than try
and<00:05:00.140> put<00:05:00.350> this<00:05:00.500> ball<00:05:00.740> in<00:05:00.770> that<00:05:01.070> hole<00:05:01.250> there<00:05:01.840> and

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
and put this ball in that hole there and

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.140 
and put this ball in that hole there and
it<00:05:03.050> goes<00:05:03.169> into<00:05:03.440> a<00:05:03.560> cool<00:05:03.800> slow-mo<00:05:04.130> they<00:05:04.730> go

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
it goes into a cool slow-mo they go

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.850 
it goes into a cool slow-mo they go
that's<00:05:05.750> awesome

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
that's awesome
