00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:03.650 
all right I got a couple more of these

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:10.730 
all right I got a couple more of these
lens<00:00:04.650> replica<00:00:05.490> mugs<00:00:06.450> in<00:00:07.109> and<00:00:08.690> so<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.960> 100

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
lens replica mugs in and so the 100

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.610 
lens replica mugs in and so the 100
millimeter<00:00:11.070> macro<00:00:11.670> comes<00:00:12.179> into<00:00:12.509> this<00:00:13.349> box

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
millimeter macro comes into this box

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.750 
millimeter macro comes into this box
right<00:00:13.889> here

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:24.529 

the<00:00:19.130> 2470<00:00:20.810> comes<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.140> box<00:00:22.410> right<00:00:22.560> here<00:00:23.539> so

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
the 2470 comes in this box right here so

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.710 
the 2470 comes in this box right here so
it<00:00:24.630> kind<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.900> looks<00:00:25.199> like<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.849> canon<00:00:26.849> box

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.770 

so<00:00:31.080> anyways<00:00:31.380> just<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.520> show<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
so anyways just to show you this is the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:43.040 
so anyways just to show you this is the
100<00:00:36.780> millimeter<00:00:37.170> macro<00:00:38.600> lens<00:00:39.600> mug<00:00:41.870> this<00:00:42.870> is

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
100 millimeter macro lens mug this is

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.029 
100 millimeter macro lens mug this is
actually<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> real<00:00:44.239> 100<00:00:45.239> millimeter<00:00:45.600> macro

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
actually the real 100 millimeter macro

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:52.160 
actually the real 100 millimeter macro
lens<00:00:48.680> so<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:51.090> real<00:00:51.300> lens<00:00:51.750> here

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
lens so this is the the real lens here

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.920 
lens so this is the the real lens here
this<00:00:52.829> guy<00:00:53.100> has<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> screw<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.120> top<00:00:56.809> it's<00:00:57.809> not

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
this guy has a screw on top it's not

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.680 
this guy has a screw on top it's not
really<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> lens<00:00:58.500> cap<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.699> it's<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.180> stainless

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
really a lens cap and it's a stainless

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.340 
really a lens cap and it's a stainless
steel<00:01:00.719> mug<00:01:01.100> but<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.370> see<00:01:06.350> some

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
steel mug but you can see some

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:16.399 
steel mug but you can see some
similarities<00:01:07.770> here<00:01:14.689> so<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.780> also<00:01:15.900> has<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
similarities here so it also has the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:25.870 
similarities here so it also has the
image<00:01:17.220> stabilization<00:01:18.560> switches<00:01:19.560> auto<00:01:20.070> focus

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:33.890 

so<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:29.329> 100<00:01:30.329> millimeter<00:01:30.780> macro<00:01:32.900> lens

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
so that is the 100 millimeter macro lens

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.270 
so that is the 100 millimeter macro lens
mug<00:01:34.369> not<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> bad<00:01:35.939> replica<00:01:36.650> not<00:01:37.650> super<00:01:37.979> clean

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
mug not a bad replica not super clean

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:47.929 
mug not a bad replica not super clean
but<00:01:38.600> not<00:01:39.600> bad<00:01:41.180> here<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:45.079> 24<00:01:46.079> 105<00:01:46.590> which<00:01:46.939> you

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
but not bad here is the 24 105 which you

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.330 
but not bad here is the 24 105 which you
guys<00:01:48.030> probably<00:01:48.299> seen<00:01:48.570> like<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> while<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.530> long

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
guys probably seen like a while a long

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.630 
guys probably seen like a while a long
time<00:01:50.549> ago<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.689> can<00:01:51.810> see<00:01:52.020> how<00:01:52.860> similar<00:01:53.220> this

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
time ago so you can see how similar this

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.540 
time ago so you can see how similar this
is

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:06.010 

this<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.300> real<00:02:00.540> lens<00:02:01.440> right<00:02:01.710> here<00:02:04.340> and

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
this is the real lens right here and

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.190 
this is the real lens right here and
this<00:02:07.020> one<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.410> actually<00:02:07.620> the<00:02:09.200> coffee<00:02:10.200> mug

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
this one is actually the coffee mug

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.150 
this one is actually the coffee mug
there's<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.260> new<00:02:13.410> version<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.800> this<00:02:13.950> with

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
there's a new version of this with

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.810 
there's a new version of this with
stainless<00:02:14.550> steel<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:16.400> I'm<00:02:17.400> probably<00:02:17.610> gonna

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
stainless steel so I'm probably gonna

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.430 
stainless steel so I'm probably gonna
have<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.000> upgrade<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.420> because<00:02:18.930> this<00:02:19.080> one<00:02:19.260> is

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
have to upgrade that because this one is

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.900 
have to upgrade that because this one is
just<00:02:20.040> mostly<00:02:20.940> plastic<00:02:21.590> but<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.740> 24-105<00:02:23.370> looks

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
just mostly plastic but the 24-105 looks

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.250 
just mostly plastic but the 24-105 looks
almost<00:02:24.360> dead<00:02:24.900> on<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:26.070> size<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.670> markings

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
almost dead on the the size the markings

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.250 
almost dead on the the size the markings
comes<00:02:28.260> with<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.590> petal<00:02:29.190> hood<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:31.080> again

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
comes with the petal hood and again

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:42.729 
comes with the petal hood and again
that's<00:02:31.470> just<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.830> plastic<00:02:32.760> cup

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:50.619 

and<00:02:44.420> again<00:02:45.420> this<00:02:45.719> guy<00:02:48.530> is<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.560> stainless<00:02:50.159> steel

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
and again this guy is a stainless steel

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.989 
and again this guy is a stainless steel
they<00:02:51.629> come<00:02:51.810> with<00:02:51.959> bag<00:02:52.170> bags<00:02:53.159> aren't<00:02:53.730> really

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:53.999 
they come with bag bags aren't really

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:59.869 
they come with bag bags aren't really
that<00:02:54.120> great<00:02:54.329> but<00:02:55.730> this<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.939> the<00:02:57.090> hood<00:02:58.790> or<00:02:59.790> the

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
that great but this is the hood or the

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.190 
that great but this is the hood or the
lens<00:03:00.090> cap<00:03:00.359> you<00:03:01.079> could<00:03:01.260> see<00:03:01.469> a<00:03:02.870> fairly<00:03:03.870> close

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
lens cap you could see a fairly close

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:11.899 
lens cap you could see a fairly close
and<00:03:06.469> the<00:03:07.469> tone<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:08.489> 2470<00:03:09.419> is<00:03:09.599> a<00:03:09.629> zoom<00:03:10.439> lens<00:03:10.909> so

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
and the tone the 2470 is a zoom lens so

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:18.470 
and the tone the 2470 is a zoom lens so
this<00:03:12.060> is<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.269> real<00:03:12.739> 2470<00:03:14.060> and<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:17.480> stainless

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
this is the real 2470 and the stainless

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:30.830 
this is the real 2470 and the stainless
steel<00:03:18.629> mug<00:03:18.810> actually<00:03:19.290> zooms<00:03:19.530> as<00:03:19.739> well<00:03:29.840> and

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
steel mug actually zooms as well and

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.189 
steel mug actually zooms as well and
then<00:03:31.019> back<00:03:31.169> here<00:03:31.199> is<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:32.129> I<00:03:32.489> put<00:03:32.969> a<00:03:33.000> lens<00:03:33.689> ring<00:03:34.019> on

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
then back here is a I put a lens ring on

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:39.890 
then back here is a I put a lens ring on
here<00:03:34.349> tripod<00:03:34.739> ring<00:03:35.120> but<00:03:36.120> this<00:03:36.239> is<00:03:36.389> the<00:03:38.599> 70<00:03:39.599> to

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
here tripod ring but this is the 70 to

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.099 
here tripod ring but this is the 70 to
200<00:03:41.150> f/4<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:44.480> unfortunately<00:03:45.480> I<00:03:45.510> don't<00:03:45.719> own<00:03:45.959> an

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
200 f/4 and unfortunately I don't own an

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.089 
200 f/4 and unfortunately I don't own an
f4<00:03:46.560> lens

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
f4 lens

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:52.369 
f4 lens
this<00:03:47.699> is<00:03:47.849> the<00:03:47.970> real<00:03:48.949> 2.8<00:03:49.949> lens<00:03:50.159> so<00:03:51.229> they<00:03:52.229> don't

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
this is the real 2.8 lens so they don't

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.050 
this is the real 2.8 lens so they don't
match<00:03:52.500> up<00:03:52.739> perfectly<00:03:52.919> because<00:03:53.280> this<00:03:53.489> is<00:03:53.609> a<00:03:53.639> the

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
match up perfectly because this is a the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.020 
match up perfectly because this is a the
f/4<00:03:54.509> l<00:03:55.009> so<00:03:56.009> I<00:03:56.040> don't<00:03:56.310> I<00:03:56.430> don't<00:03:56.489> own<00:03:56.699> that<00:03:56.729> lens

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
f/4 l so I don't I don't own that lens
