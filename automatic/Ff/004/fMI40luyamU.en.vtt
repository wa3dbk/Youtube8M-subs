the<00:00:46.310> saturday<00:00:46.700> d<00:00:47.210> rosaria's<00:00:47.750> numbers<00:00:48.050> speak

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
the saturday d rosaria's numbers speak

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.400 
the saturday d rosaria's numbers speak
for<00:00:48.320> itself<00:00:48.880> so<00:00:49.880> I<00:00:49.910> think<00:00:50.630> you<00:00:50.750> know<00:00:50.840> he<00:00:50.930> is

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
for itself so I think you know he is

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.830 
for itself so I think you know he is
dangerous<00:00:52.000> midfield<00:00:53.000> these<00:00:53.150> dangers<00:00:53.510> up<00:00:53.660> top

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
dangerous midfield these dangers up top

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.330 
dangerous midfield these dangers up top
you<00:00:54.079> can<00:00:54.230> play<00:00:54.470> a<00:00:54.500> couple<00:00:55.160> different

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
you can play a couple different

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.700 
you can play a couple different
positions<00:00:55.970> and<00:00:56.540> it's<00:00:57.110> just<00:00:57.290> another<00:00:57.500> weapon

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
positions and it's just another weapon

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.040 
positions and it's just another weapon
to<00:00:58.010> our<00:00:58.100> attack<00:00:58.370> we<00:00:58.910> got<00:00:59.060> a<00:00:59.090> lot<00:00:59.270> of<00:00:59.300> pace<00:00:59.810> going

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
to our attack we got a lot of pace going

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.900 
to our attack we got a lot of pace going
forward<00:01:00.440> which<00:01:00.590> is<00:01:00.770> which<00:01:00.950> is<00:01:01.130> good<00:01:01.340> so<00:01:01.820> let's

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
forward which is which is good so let's

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.819 
forward which is which is good so let's
just<00:01:02.149> find<00:01:02.360> them<00:01:02.510> find<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.079> pocket<00:01:03.440> step<00:01:03.710> in

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
just find them find the pocket step in

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.399 
just find them find the pocket step in
the<00:01:03.950> slipping<00:01:04.909> them<00:01:05.030> through<00:01:05.239> and<00:01:05.780> hopefully

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
the slipping them through and hopefully

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.410 
the slipping them through and hopefully
I<00:01:06.620> could<00:01:06.800> create<00:01:07.100> even<00:01:07.670> more<00:01:07.700> space<00:01:08.120> for<00:01:08.150> them

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
I could create even more space for them

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.270 
I could create even more space for them
now<00:01:08.900> that<00:01:09.140> you<00:01:09.710> know<00:01:09.740> coming<00:01:10.070> from<00:01:10.159> the

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
now that you know coming from the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.820 
now that you know coming from the
midfield<00:01:10.670> so<00:01:10.880> having<00:01:11.570> a<00:01:11.600> you<00:01:12.350> know<00:01:12.440> attacking

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
midfield so having a you know attacking

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.320 
midfield so having a you know attacking
options<00:01:13.100> from<00:01:13.190> various<00:01:13.520> areas<00:01:13.760> is<00:01:14.090> always<00:01:14.300> a

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
options from various areas is always a

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.140 
options from various areas is always a
positive<00:01:14.600> thing<00:01:15.070> of<00:01:16.070> course<00:01:16.310> we<00:01:16.880> have<00:01:16.970> to<00:01:17.060> be

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
positive thing of course we have to be

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.850 
positive thing of course we have to be
very<00:01:17.300> mindful<00:01:17.570> defensive<00:01:18.260> so<00:01:18.440> we<00:01:18.590> don't<00:01:18.740> have

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
very mindful defensive so we don't have

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.410 
very mindful defensive so we don't have
too<00:01:18.979> much<00:01:19.100> numbers<00:01:19.430> going<00:01:19.580> forward<00:01:19.909> but<00:01:20.060> like

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
too much numbers going forward but like

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.469 
too much numbers going forward but like
