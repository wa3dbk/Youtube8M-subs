 proposes to deconstruct the territories 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.349
 admitted from the traditional school for 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.119
 consider this one as an archipelago a 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.130
 ecosystem with various interfaces 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.950
 multiplying the exchanges the passages

 creativity 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.860
 a pedagogy more organized by 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.170
 projects that by subject a pedagogy 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.430
 promoting interdisciplinarity and

 community while providing follow-up 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.840
 personalized by its nomadic use 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.590
 its instantaneity and flexibility 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.450
 used to 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.310
 the digital touch pad is needed 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.030
 in the learning process like 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.829
 the right tool helium studio questions 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.750
 the rectangular universal format of 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.520
 current tablets and offers a format 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.680
 dedicated to the school favoring work 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.690
 collaborative 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.850
 these tablets are put to the 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.980
 available to all while access 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.960

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.950
 forums students as teachers can 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.500
 so they themselves become creator of

 content work tool in real time 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.520
 the tablet accompanies the lips to 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.890
 daily creating continuity between 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.140
 individual work and collective work 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:58.399
 between working at school and working at 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:02:00.200
 distance with the archipelago project and 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.210
 the home studio being the school outside 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.800
 in a nebula of places so 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.270
 optimize links between all 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.220
 actors who accompany the child in 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.049
 its development and develops the school 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.670
 within its walls in a diversity of 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.650
 customized spaces guided by 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.430
 the teacher the students can of a 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.810

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.570
 calm this environment associated with 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.760
 furniture elements redesigned for a 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.930
 better flexibility of used allows a 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.930
 great freedom of movement 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.830
 the place with these steps here and there 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.570
 signs in space of informal exchanges 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.040
 the passages are places of diffusion

 current forums broadcasting 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.470
 questions and centers of interest 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.970
 it's also where the tablets are 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.860
 made available to students 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.220
 once reloaded by induction on the

 tables to similar and walk them 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.480
 vertical walls 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.430
 they allow to hang tablets 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.100
 creating larger areas of 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.840
 work here small groups of students 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.280
 advance their projects guided by 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.400
 the teacher who are moving a 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.080
 group at the other light the tables are 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.200
 easily movable and offers a 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.420
 multitude of configurations 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.100
 culbuto stools are pivoting body 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.710
 for a dynamic sitting posture 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.170
 whose balanced is the key always to

 provision ready to be straddled to is 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.470
 pushed back or under the arm 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.010
 they become the companions of

 rhythms of each 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.210
 the hermitage is a recessed space 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.380
 conducive to study and reflect the

 markets the cushions and offers a 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.010
 quieter environment that allows by 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.660
 example to students to take a step back 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.640
 on a project to do some research 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.010
 more fed or to watch the 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.390
 video of a modular course the margins 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.610
 allow to create sets to 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.380
 variable geometry went to the ground or 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.090
 superimposed on each other 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.950
 cushions on the steps

 body in a posture of comfort and 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.800
 are usable alone as assemble in 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.750
 clusters of varied shapes 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.090
 the plateau is a space of diffusion and 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.160
 capture of image sound and 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.570

 it offers a central scene that can be 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.220
 reconfigured at leisure mobile markets 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.840
 allowing alternately to atomize or 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.540
 group an audience according to

 from school to archipelago 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.490
 it allows to link practice and theory 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.890
 project experience within these six 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.260
 islands a fab lab a large workshop a 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.990

 and even a lab kitchen inspired by 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.190
 circus arts the marquee does 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.310
 to coexist sports activities and
