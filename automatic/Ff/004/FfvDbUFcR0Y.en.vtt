of it either I think maybe not but I did
really<00:04:45.509> good<00:04:45.689> I<00:04:45.960> I<00:04:46.229> was<00:04:47.069> in<00:04:47.159> the<00:04:47.219> first<00:04:47.400> place

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
really good I I was in the first place

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.029 
really good I I was in the first place
and<00:04:47.909> it<00:04:47.969> was<00:04:48.060> like<00:04:48.240> me<00:04:48.419> versus<00:04:48.810> like<00:04:49.020> 14<00:04:49.710> people

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
and it was like me versus like 14 people

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:51.469 
and it was like me versus like 14 people
is<00:04:50.129> my<00:04:50.250> first<00:04:50.460> time<00:04:50.610> playing<00:04:50.759> in<00:04:50.939> years<00:04:51.180> and<00:04:51.270> I

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
is my first time playing in years and I

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.089 
is my first time playing in years and I
was<00:04:51.770> so<00:04:52.770> I<00:04:53.039> have<00:04:53.280> fine<00:04:54.090> motor<00:04:54.800> skills<00:04:55.800> because

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
was so I have fine motor skills because

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.369 
was so I have fine motor skills because
that's<00:04:56.219> what<00:04:56.340> you<00:04:56.430> need<00:04:56.639> for<00:04:56.969> a<00:04:57.029> shooter<00:04:57.569> but

00:04:58.369 --> 00:04:58.379

some<00:06:05.390> people<00:06:05.660> like<00:06:05.960> try<00:06:06.860> to<00:06:06.890> see<00:06:07.130> how<00:06:07.280> much

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
some people like try to see how much

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.940 
some people like try to see how much
over<00:06:08.660> this<00:06:08.810> beat<00:06:09.020> them<00:06:09.140> but<00:06:09.230> they<00:06:09.290> can<00:06:09.500> go<00:06:09.650> like

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
over this beat them but they can go like

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.830 
over this beat them but they can go like
the<00:06:10.190> speed<00:06:10.370> limits<00:06:10.610> 50<00:06:10.700> they<00:06:11.030> tried<00:06:11.210> to<00:06:11.240> 60<00:06:11.660> or

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
the speed limits 50 they tried to 60 or

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.410 
the speed limits 50 they tried to 60 or
70<00:06:12.290> or<00:06:12.380> 80<00:06:12.470> I<00:06:12.710> don't<00:06:13.130> I<00:06:13.370> try<00:06:14.030> to<00:06:14.090> see<00:06:14.240> how<00:06:14.360> many

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:14.420 
70 or 80 I don't I try to see how many

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.720 
70 or 80 I don't I try to see how many
times<00:06:14.870> like<00:06:15.110> new<00:06:15.290> speed<00:06:15.560> limit<00:06:15.800> like<00:06:15.980> double

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:16.730 
times like new speed limit like double

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.110 
times like new speed limit like double
triple<00:06:17.210> i<00:06:17.740> think<00:06:18.740> i<00:06:18.980> think<00:06:19.520> the<00:06:19.610> quickest<00:06:20.000> i've

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
triple i think i think the quickest i've

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.520 
triple i think i think the quickest i've
done<00:06:20.300> on<00:06:20.480> a<00:06:20.510> road<00:06:20.750> but<00:06:20.960> it<00:06:21.020> was<00:06:21.110> a<00:06:21.170> road<00:06:21.320> to<00:06:21.410> the

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
done on a road but it was a road to the

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.890 
done on a road but it was a road to the
lower<00:06:21.950> than<00:06:22.160> normal<00:06:22.190> speed<00:06:22.610> limit<00:06:22.850> was<00:06:23.300> five

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
lower than normal speed limit was five

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.200 
lower than normal speed limit was five
times<00:06:24.140> quintuple<00:06:24.950> i<00:06:25.130> was<00:06:25.640> doing<00:06:25.790> couldn't<00:06:26.090> up

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
times quintuple i was doing couldn't up

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.960 
times quintuple i was doing couldn't up
all<00:06:26.330> the<00:06:26.420> speed<00:06:26.630> limit<00:06:26.840> I<00:06:26.930> was<00:06:27.050> like<00:06:27.310> I<00:06:28.310> think

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
all the speed limit I was like I think

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.880 
all the speed limit I was like I think
this<00:06:29.240> beat<00:06:29.420> him<00:06:29.540> was<00:06:29.720> 30<00:06:30.020> and<00:06:30.140> I<00:06:30.260> was<00:06:30.350> doing<00:06:30.410> 150

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
this beat him was 30 and I was doing 150

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:37.959 
this beat him was 30 and I was doing 150
so<00:06:31.340> I<00:06:31.870> thought<00:06:32.870> was<00:06:32.990> funny

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:37.969 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:39.789 

I<00:06:38.029> think<00:06:38.779> I<00:06:38.869> might<00:06:39.019> even<00:06:39.049> have<00:06:39.349> that<00:06:39.529> video

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:39.799 
I think I might even have that video

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:41.439 
I think I might even have that video
into<00:06:40.129> YouTube<00:06:40.279> it<00:06:40.909> might<00:06:41.089> be<00:06:41.179> on<00:06:41.239> my<00:06:41.329> other

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:41.449 
into YouTube it might be on my other

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:43.659 
into YouTube it might be on my other
channel<00:06:41.569> I<00:06:42.079> think<00:06:42.889> the<00:06:42.949> video<00:06:43.069> is<00:06:43.189> called<00:06:43.369> like

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:43.669 
channel I think the video is called like

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:45.129 
channel I think the video is called like
five<00:06:43.849> times<00:06:44.119> the<00:06:44.299> speed<00:06:44.479> limit<00:06:44.749> or<00:06:44.779> four<00:06:44.989> down

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:45.139 
five times the speed limit or four down

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:50.830 
five times the speed limit or four down
to<00:06:45.259> speed<00:06:45.439> limits<00:06:45.709> and<00:06:45.799> I<00:06:45.949> know

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:50.840 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.430 

anyways<00:06:51.710> later
