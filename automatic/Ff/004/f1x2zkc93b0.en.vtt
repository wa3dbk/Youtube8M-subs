00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.809
 good morning again be reportable 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.880
 We are here to provide you with the information 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.559
 of maintenance operation and 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.440
 operation of your batteries of force 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.630
 motor below we are going to give you 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.699
 the necessary instructions for these 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.990
 requirements 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.350
 this is the initial presentation of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.609
 our batteries for packing before 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.710
 of the installation on your computer 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.690
 below we present the guide 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.520
 for proper maintenance and 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.040
 preventive maintenance of your batteries 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.140
 where you will find the industrial 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.620
 attached to one of the sides of your 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.620
 drums 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.450
 must maintain a minimum level of 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.490
 liquid for its operation 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.090
 a reason is recommended to work a 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.940
 Battery waterless why lack 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.670
 the Aegean causes crystallization of 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.540
 Lead detachment of plaques and by 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.540
 consequent 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.149
 Next show 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.840
 my batteries 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.550
 this is the leveling plug of 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.790
 drums 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:29.140
 the minimum level for leveling the 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:33.440
 battery should be where the part starts 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.560
 top of the yellow mesh plug 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:40.340
 minimum level for what reason if we exceed 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.700
 the level of here the battery in the moment 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.990
 of the load will have a warm-up 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.560
 and increase the volume in the ac if 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.500
 we access that level we're going to have 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.110
 liquid spills and loss of 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.899
 electrolyte which generates voltage that 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.840
 sulfation and land deterioration 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:04.030
 same is for no reason recommended 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.299
 except that migration leveling 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.319
 should always be done after 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.470
 charge to the battery 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.080
 never charged and always after 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.239
 for no reason should be added 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.340
 been to the battery should be done with water 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.940
 demineralized 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.050
 to avoid internal shorts and their legs 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.960
 it is very internal within it 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.720
 this is the hydrometer expiration in 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.120
 which is used to determine the 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.610
 concentration of electrolytes or acid 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.260
 sulfuric we have a battery 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.260
 we have a scale of 1100 to 1300 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.819
 when the 3a fully loaded six 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.170
 thousand believers as the 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:51.410
 hours of work is decreasing more 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.490
 climbing ladder universe 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.490
 how it is used 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.650
 we go that the subway 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.360
 must remain the float must 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:09.260
 stay free on both ends 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.330
 where I check the liquid level I 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.470
 is indicating the reading that I have 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.720
 inheritance in this case we are in 1280 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.680
 sulfuric acid concentration of 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.959
 illuminated 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.379
 We are indicating that these have we 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.379
 fully charged 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.780
 regarding the incidents 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.240
 detecting with the multi meter we can 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.700
 determine the voltage per cell and 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.730
 You can also tell us when a 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.930
 cell that is showing some failure 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.460
 normally the voltage in the central 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.800
 Nominal contract of a fence are two 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.510
 votes if we find the average expenditure is 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.150
 starts very big with respect to the 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.740
 others indicates that the cell mind 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.330
 is presenting some flaw and is the 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.310
 when calling for service 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.790
 to get some kind of corrective or 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.910
 a special 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.930
 as we take with such 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.620
 i 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:10.069
 the batteries are connected 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.310
 with an Anderson power connector is 350 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:16.130
 is connected the tap has a cable 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.530
 positive a negative cable 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.590
 and cell number 1 of the battery 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.740
 there is always the positive cable 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.990
 in this case where the sign comes 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.040
 positive with the output cable that's going to 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.040
 be cell number 1 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.050
 how the voltages are taken on the two 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.050
 wells 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.269
 and consecutively we are taking cell 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.439
 the cell the voltage 

00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:52.439
 continuing to follow the series 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.250
 in order to have a specific order of 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.250
 the dinner 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:18.360
 completely clean and dry batteries 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.600
 at the top because reason to 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.380
 avoid 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.800
 voltage that earth sulfation and 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.870
 deterioration of them 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.610
 which causes malfunction and 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.800
 you win in the team 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.110
 My name is German Sirevich, these are 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.490
 the basic instructions for good 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:42.470
 maintenance and operation of their 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:42.470
 any batteries in this cover
