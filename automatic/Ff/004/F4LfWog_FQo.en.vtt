00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.859
 the task of speaking with your representative 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.680
 and it has slipped we support it there is no 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.920
 a formal offer for the people of memos 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.960
 but since yesterday confirms the directive 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.640
 that if there is good interest we are going to 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.619
 offers let's say hello to my granddaughter and 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.840
 it turns out that it is in the market memo 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.850
 Eighty minutes the detail told you so 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.590
 the French team president as 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.170
 Good evening, tell us in detail 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.450

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.370
 carlos as if yesterday already 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.890
 the president of the ajax confirmed me 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.200
 alain orsoni said that memo ochoa yes 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.629
 have offers or rather if there is interest 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.789
 of two teams from England per memo and 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.800
 one of a Spanish painting that has not yet 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.930
 It has a particular offering that is 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.000
 talking to several teams but that 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.530
 he asks for 10 million dollars and the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.170
 team that wants to take to memo ochoa 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.969
 is what he has to pay says he has 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.920
 or no crisis crisis in the old 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.970
 continent and good also ensures that 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.280
 it will be up to him 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.630
 when the memo goes away if it is leaving the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.980
 ajax me but what do you think if 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.980
 we hear the words of the manager 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.000
 proposal 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.410
 all right 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:44.690
 that's why we have children and men 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.400
 minnelli then let's say more than 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.250
 for sale that has always been with the 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.420
 ajax me what he tells you clearly and this 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.520
 It must be said that there are two teams 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.730
 English and possibly a Spanish but 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.860
 It does not clarify if it's the liverpool or you 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.690
 says the name of none I asked 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.520
 directly by these rumors there are 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.840
 precisely since last Friday if 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.020
 it was the liverpool of england and it says 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.460
 that he so to speak for was left with 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.550
 all the teams that came up with 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.930
 him in not giving names of the interested 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.640
 and that it would be until the summer when 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.830
 really feel to practice with 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.570
 them and well as I tell you what 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.100
 want are 10 million euros we are going to 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.709
 see if they pay it because we talked 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.260
 precisely on this issue not that very 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.850
 few teams want to pay that 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.500
 amount of money especially for 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.630
 porter who does not have a passport 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.250
 community that in this case would be a 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.489
 great problem also for Guillermo 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.280
 ochoa recently comes to be designated 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.989
 by a prestigious newspaper the most 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.300
 prestigious of europe surely the 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.730
 sports team in the ideal eleven not 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.440
 that day in which the ajax I 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.489
 I visit the Paris Saint Germain in the 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.840
 team 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.920
 let's go feel 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.260
 the one that buys the most players and gave me a 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.410
 great party min him and let's see 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.019
 some of the numbers memo charges in 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.480
 France remembering that you were there 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.790
 of start if we were the one of the little ones 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.989
 means I went to meet 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.360
 visit a little bit before he played 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:14.450
 5200 minutes practically 60 games 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.769
 already in France-98 received the 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.660
 average is high because you'll see that the 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.099
 team has always been having many 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.510
 problems has taken some thrashing 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.010
 so recognize it for having some 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.769
 matches is a fact of where he has taken 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.540
 five or six goals of so much pressure that 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.950
 Normally and well, well, there it is 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.780
 21 this 21 parties this campaign all 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.810
 as a proprietor I'm obviously going 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.090
 playing the 90 because I think it has grown 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.519
 You'll have to see if you're ready 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.950
 for a league like the English as the 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.390
 Spanish where not only is one or two 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.940
 teams that are going to sue you like this if 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.950
 there are going to be six or seven or up to ten 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.799
 good ability has vinyl and that's 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.269
 clear and finally clarify that it is not a 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.170
 invention of promoters is saying 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.849
 Own 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.380
 the ajax or so he has not said so 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.640
 thank you very much for your mining report 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.640
 good night carlos raffo
