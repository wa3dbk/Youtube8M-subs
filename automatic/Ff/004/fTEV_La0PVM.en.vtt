this is the way the inside your motors
gonna<00:01:06.460> look<00:01:06.640> nice<00:01:06.850> pretty<00:01:07.150> dirty<00:01:07.420> it<00:01:07.659> has

gonna look nice pretty dirty it has
almost<00:01:08.680> 90,000<00:01:09.250> miles<00:01:09.370> on<00:01:09.580> it<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:10.630> you'll

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
almost 90,000 miles on it but you'll

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.710 
almost 90,000 miles on it but you'll
take<00:01:11.290> these<00:01:11.500> off<00:01:11.770> right<00:01:12.040> here<00:01:12.310> because<00:01:13.060> your

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
take these off right here because your

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.030 
take these off right here because your
spark<00:01:13.990> plugs<00:01:14.200> actually<00:01:14.530> sit<00:01:14.770> underneath

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
spark plugs actually sit underneath

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.920 
spark plugs actually sit underneath
there<00:01:15.370> see<00:01:15.730> they<00:01:15.880> come<00:01:16.030> off<00:01:16.180> just<00:01:16.390> like<00:01:16.540> that

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
there see they come off just like that

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.620 
there see they come off just like that
okay<00:01:17.890> you<00:01:18.430> won't<00:01:18.580> have<00:01:18.700> to<00:01:18.850> disconnect<00:01:19.240> actual

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
okay you won't have to disconnect actual

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.060 
okay you won't have to disconnect actual
wireless<00:01:19.870> unless<00:01:20.320> you're<00:01:20.470> replacing<00:01:21.040> the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
wireless unless you're replacing the

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.320 
wireless unless you're replacing the
actual<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:22.210> actual<00:01:22.510> head<00:01:22.720> there<00:01:23.040> okay<00:01:24.330> so

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
actual the actual head there okay so

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.840 
actual the actual head there okay so
it's<00:01:25.990> pretty<00:01:26.260> it's<00:01:27.220> pretty<00:01:27.340> straightforward

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
it's pretty it's pretty straightforward

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.340 
it's pretty it's pretty straightforward
so<00:01:28.360> we're<00:01:28.510> going<00:01:28.600> to<00:01:28.660> go<00:01:28.780> ahead<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:29.110> remove

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
so we're going to go ahead and remove

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.660 
so we're going to go ahead and remove
the<00:01:29.470> spark<00:01:29.680> plug<00:01:29.770> show<00:01:30.190> you<00:01:30.250> what<00:01:30.430> it<00:01:30.520> looks

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
the spark plug show you what it looks

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.300 
the spark plug show you what it looks
like<00:01:32.220> again<00:01:33.220> this<00:01:33.490> is<00:01:33.640> on<00:01:33.760> a<00:01:33.790> Mazda<00:01:35.040> Mazda<00:01:36.040> 6

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
like again this is on a Mazda Mazda 6

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.760 
like again this is on a Mazda Mazda 6
2007<00:01:37.300> model<00:01:37.600> like<00:01:38.110> I<00:01:38.200> said<00:01:38.350> I<00:01:38.380> believe<00:01:38.410> it

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
2007 model like I said I believe it

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.760 
2007 model like I said I believe it
covers<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.220> oh<00:01:39.760> seven<00:01:40.360> 209<00:01:40.840> I<00:01:41.110> think<00:01:41.590> it<00:01:41.680> even

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
covers the oh seven 209 I think it even

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.030 
covers the oh seven 209 I think it even
covers<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.220> old<00:01:42.400> six<00:01:42.670> but<00:01:42.910> and<00:01:43.750> that's<00:01:44.620> Mazda

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
covers the old six but and that's Mazda

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.260 
covers the old six but and that's Mazda
so<00:01:45.220> should<00:01:45.430> all<00:01:45.520> pretty<00:01:45.790> much<00:01:45.940> be<00:01:46.120> the<00:01:46.150> same

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
so should all pretty much be the same

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.130 
so should all pretty much be the same
I'm<00:01:46.690> going<00:01:46.960> to<00:01:47.020> zoom<00:01:47.230> in<00:01:47.350> on<00:01:47.470> there<00:01:47.650> for<00:01:47.800> you

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.620 

now<00:01:53.140> we<00:01:53.200> hope<00:01:53.440> this<00:01:53.590> high-definition<00:01:54.340> quality

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
now we hope this high-definition quality

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.400 
now we hope this high-definition quality
really<00:01:55.630> comes<00:01:55.930> through<00:01:55.990> through<00:01:56.290> your

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
really comes through through your

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.110 
really comes through through your
computer<00:01:57.900> we<00:01:58.900> want<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.110> put<00:01:59.290> at<00:01:59.410> full<00:01:59.650> 1080p<00:02:00.130> so

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
computer we want to put at full 1080p so

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.420 
computer we want to put at full 1080p so
you'll<00:02:01.270> be<00:02:01.390> able<00:02:01.450> to<00:02:01.630> see<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:02.050> what<00:02:03.010> it<00:02:03.130> is<00:02:03.250> is

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
you'll be able to see the what it is is

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.070 
you'll be able to see the what it is is
he<00:02:03.550> actually<00:02:03.670> is<00:02:03.880> doing<00:02:04.030> now<00:02:04.600> you<00:02:04.660> will<00:02:04.900> need<00:02:05.050> a

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
he actually is doing now you will need a

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.440 
he actually is doing now you will need a
5/8<00:02:06.360> spark<00:02:07.360> plug<00:02:07.630> socket<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:09.580> long<00:02:09.879> socket<00:02:10.330> and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
5/8 spark plug socket a long socket and

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.210 
5/8 spark plug socket a long socket and
what<00:02:10.989> I<00:02:11.019> mean<00:02:11.200> by<00:02:11.319> a<00:02:11.349> spark<00:02:11.590> plug<00:02:11.650> socket<00:02:12.129> it

socket<00:04:13.640> came<00:04:14.120> out<00:04:14.350> ok<00:04:15.350> the<00:04:15.560> 5/8<00:04:15.920> socket<00:04:16.070> came

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
socket came out ok the 5/8 socket came

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.580 
socket came out ok the 5/8 socket came
off<00:04:16.609> it's<00:04:17.030> stuck<00:04:17.359> in<00:04:17.510> there<00:04:17.630> haven't<00:04:18.440> either

nose on handy because sometimes that
suction<00:04:20.269> is<00:04:20.510> works<00:04:20.780> too<00:04:21.019> a<00:04:21.200> little<00:04:21.380> too<00:04:21.650> good

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
suction is works too a little too good

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.880 
suction is works too a little too good
which<00:04:22.729> is<00:04:22.910> which<00:04:23.210> is<00:04:23.240> good<00:04:23.540> but<00:04:23.780> you'll<00:04:24.770> get

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
which is which is good but you'll get

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.200 
which is which is good but you'll get
the<00:04:25.040> socket<00:04:25.280> stuck<00:04:25.640> in<00:04:25.760> there<00:04:25.910> and<00:04:26.000> you<00:04:26.060> need

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
the socket stuck in there and you need

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.180 
the socket stuck in there and you need
an<00:04:26.330> internal<00:04:26.690> so<00:04:26.840> extracted<00:04:27.380> ok

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
an internal so extracted ok

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.700 
an internal so extracted ok
and<00:04:29.550> that's<00:04:30.030> it<00:04:30.240> guys<00:04:30.750> it<00:04:31.080> pretty<00:04:31.530> much<00:04:31.650> just

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
the torque specs and this is going to be

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.840 
the torque specs and this is going to be
a<00:05:29.910> eight<00:05:30.510> millimeter<00:05:30.960> socket<00:05:31.050> right<00:05:31.590> here

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
a eight millimeter socket right here

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.940 
a eight millimeter socket right here
this<00:05:32.850> one<00:05:33.060> right<00:05:33.290> here<00:05:34.290> eight<00:05:34.500> millimeter

this one right here eight millimeter

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.420 
this one right here eight millimeter
socket<00:05:35.040> and<00:05:35.490> write<00:05:35.670> that<00:05:35.850> down<00:05:36.170> and<00:05:37.170> then<00:05:38.010> your

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
socket and write that down and then your

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.760 
socket and write that down and then your
basic<00:05:38.640> channel<00:05:39.090> locks<00:05:39.270> we'll<00:05:40.200> take<00:05:40.410> this<00:05:40.590> off

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
basic channel locks we'll take this off

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.170 
basic channel locks we'll take this off
right<00:05:41.040> here<00:05:41.160> yep<00:05:41.990> okay<00:05:43.730> alright<00:05:44.730> guys<00:05:44.910> that's

it we're done now just all it takes is

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.250 
it we're done now just all it takes is

put the cover back on and we'll go ahead

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.600 
put the cover back on and we'll go ahead
and<00:05:49.350> put<00:05:49.500> that<00:05:49.530> back<00:05:49.680> on<00:05:49.919> for<00:05:50.190> you<00:05:50.250> so<00:05:50.280> you'll

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
and put that back on for you so you'll

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.370 
and put that back on for you so you'll
see<00:05:50.790> what<00:05:50.970> it<00:05:51.090> looks<00:05:51.270> like<00:05:51.360> and<00:05:51.720> how<00:05:51.780> you<00:05:52.200> need

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
see what it looks like and how you need

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.920 
see what it looks like and how you need
to<00:05:52.410> remove<00:05:52.740> that<00:05:53.000> in<00:05:54.000> the<00:05:54.150> very<00:05:54.330> beginning<00:05:54.750> so

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
to remove that in the very beginning so

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.750 
to remove that in the very beginning so
it's<00:05:55.110> kind<00:05:55.260> of<00:05:55.320> like<00:05:55.410> a<00:05:55.470> reverse<00:05:55.620> process<00:05:56.040> of

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
it's kind of like a reverse process of

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:08.719 
it's kind of like a reverse process of
course

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:27.790 

I'll<00:06:09.729> forget<00:06:09.939> the<00:06:10.089> whole<00:06:10.239> stick

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:53.620 

you're<00:06:28.800> eight

see<00:06:54.630> I<00:06:54.660> was<00:06:54.810> just<00:06:54.840> doing<00:06:55.200> it<00:06:55.260> wrist<00:06:55.530> tight

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
see I was just doing it wrist tight

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.600 
see I was just doing it wrist tight
that's<00:06:56.040> all<00:06:56.280> you<00:06:56.460> need<00:06:56.640> just<00:06:57.570> R<00:06:57.720> is<00:06:57.960> tight<00:06:58.610> no

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
that's all you need just R is tight no

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.270 
that's all you need just R is tight no
need<00:06:59.790> to<00:06:59.910> over<00:07:00.180> torque<00:07:00.770> or<00:07:01.770> you<00:07:01.860> need<00:07:02.010> that<00:07:02.160> of

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 
need to over torque or you need that of
