00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
what do you do you can't say to people

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
change but no one wants to because there

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.790 
change but no one wants to because there
isn't<00:00:38.640> an<00:00:38.879> alternative<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.780> satisfies<00:00:40.410> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
clear that the Agni motor was the go-to

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.899

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
the more we worked with Agni more it

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.670 
the more we worked with Agni more it
became<00:01:35.700> clear<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.060> they<00:01:36.780> had<00:01:37.110> aspects<00:01:37.560> of

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
became clear that they had aspects of

technology and conceptual approach and
we<00:01:40.320> had<00:01:40.470> aspects<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.100> engineering<00:01:41.640> design<00:01:42.090> for

manufacture formal development that just

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.179 
manufacture formal development that just
works<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.450> well<00:01:45.540> together<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.649> developed

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
works so well together but developed

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.460 
works so well together but developed
into<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.490> merger<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.000> we've<00:01:48.540> been<00:01:48.840> working

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
into the merger and we've been working

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.740 
into the merger and we've been working
together<00:01:49.560> since<00:01:50.250> last<00:01:50.520> year<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.390> gives<00:01:51.600> us

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
together since last year and it gives us

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.010 
together since last year and it gives us
the<00:01:51.960> ability<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.380> deliver<00:01:53.070> really

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
the ability to deliver really

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.600 
the ability to deliver really
