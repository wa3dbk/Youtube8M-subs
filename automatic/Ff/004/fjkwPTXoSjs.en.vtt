00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Hello everyone, today I want to do you 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.299
 see a technique to go and decorate 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.760
 and customize in a very original way 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.800
 in our shirts need to 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.450
 this project is first of all the 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.150
 shirt we decided to decorate 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.460
 I will use this white in this case 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.000
 then we'll need color for the fabric 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.100
 must be specific for fabric 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.840
 water and a sprinkler if not 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.699
 you have it at home so you ca n't 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.470
 recover it from some finished product 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.720
 you can buy it in any 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.759
 home improvement store for a few cents 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.290
 the last things we need only 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.210
 silhouettes of what we want to go to 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.890
 impress on the shirt 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.629
 I 'm going to do a writing so it's me 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.180
 invoice going to already have 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.680
 letters ready of course if you don't have 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.780
 this luck you can simply 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.030
 go and draw on a card 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.739
 go and cut it then open by ma 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.289
 what are we going to put a sheet of 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.180
 plastic or paper inside the shirt 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.360
 so that the color is not three steps 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.360
 under 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.800
 then take the letters 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.950
 now in the break we go to put the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.760
 color and add one or two 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.250
 water drops 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.410
 the water must be very little indeed 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.900
 because yes we have to dilute the color for 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.420
 go and break it better but if it is too much 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.550
 watered down then risks expanding between 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.550
 the fibers and not to keep the outline 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.130
 let it dry well and then remove 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.130
 all fees 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.310
 if you prefer then with a small brush e 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.870
 of white paint we can go to 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.110
 finish the edges if there are any 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.640
 smudge or even to fill all 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.640
 the letter depends on your taste 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.760
 and here is the result we have transformed 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:29.610
 an anonymous white t-shirt in one 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.629
 beautiful colored t-shirt e 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.360
 personalized like no other 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.409
 surely he will have the last step 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.510
 very important if we want the 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:39.760
 color lasts over time and don't go 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.340
 to disperse in the washes is to 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.140
 go Assyrian of the t-shirt allocation 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.420
 I recommend not having passed the iron 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.459
 directly on the color because yes 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.010
 it would ruin everything past 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.079
 the student note so that the heat 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.629
 of iron go to tie 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.220
 indissolubly the fibers with the color 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.440
 obviously this technique can be 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.389
 used not only for t-shirts but 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.340
 also for bag cushions 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:05.470
 for all that stuff and you can 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.989
 go to use not only the letters 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.760
 but any outline of flowers animals 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.680
 all that comes to mind 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.450
 having said that I hope you enjoyed the 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.790

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.359
