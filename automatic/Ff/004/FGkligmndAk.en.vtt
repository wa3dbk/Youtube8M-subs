would<00:03:04.440> be<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.709> time<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:04.920> do<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.430> because<00:03:05.849> the

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
would be the time to do it because the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.850 
would be the time to do it because the
candy<00:03:06.480> sets<00:03:06.720> pretty<00:03:06.959> fast<00:03:09.110> you<00:03:10.110> can<00:03:10.319> do<00:03:10.470> one<00:03:10.709> of

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
candy sets pretty fast you can do one of

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.650 
candy sets pretty fast you can do one of
two<00:03:11.069> things<00:03:11.099> you<00:03:11.730> could<00:03:11.879> have<00:03:12.060> them<00:03:12.209> sit<00:03:12.510> on<00:03:12.629> a

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
two things you could have them sit on a

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.990 
two things you could have them sit on a
plate<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.200> dry<00:03:13.440> that<00:03:13.709> way<00:03:13.890> or<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:14.579> can<00:03:14.819> have

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
plate and dry that way or you can have

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.880 
plate and dry that way or you can have
them<00:03:15.180> stand<00:03:15.540> up<00:03:15.750> so<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.290> they<00:03:16.530> don't<00:03:16.680> have

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
them stand up so that they don't have

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.069 
them stand up so that they don't have
any<00:03:17.040> flat<00:03:17.489> edges<00:03:17.730> you'll<00:03:18.510> just<00:03:18.660> need<00:03:18.810> some

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
any flat edges you'll just need some

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.240 
any flat edges you'll just need some
floral<00:03:19.470> dry<00:03:19.680> foam

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.460

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
I used a mason jar to hold the plastic

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.070 
I used a mason jar to hold the plastic
ziplock<00:03:24.980> baggie<00:03:25.460> in<00:03:25.640> place<00:03:25.970> while<00:03:26.420> I<00:03:26.480> swim<00:03:26.960> the

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
ziplock baggie in place while I swim the

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.730 
ziplock baggie in place while I swim the

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.080 

after<00:03:34.740> the<00:03:34.830> melteth<00:03:35.130> candy<00:03:35.490> was<00:03:35.670> all<00:03:35.819> poured

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
after the melteth candy was all poured

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.070 
after the melteth candy was all poured
into<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.540> baggie

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
into the baggie

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.870 
into the baggie
I<00:03:37.110> took<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.800> baggie<00:03:37.980> out<00:03:38.220> of<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.430> jar<00:03:38.670> and

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
I took the baggie out of the jar and

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.730 
I took the baggie out of the jar and
then<00:03:38.970> made<00:03:39.600> a<00:03:39.630> tiny<00:03:39.930> little<00:03:40.290> snip<00:03:40.530> at<00:03:40.650> the

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
then made a tiny little snip at the

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:56.660 
then made a tiny little snip at the
corner

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670

them cool completely before decorating
them<00:04:18.280> I<00:04:19.260> used<00:04:20.260> vanilla<00:04:20.530> and<00:04:21.160> cream<00:04:21.549> cheese

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
frosting white frosting is so boring and

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.190 
frosting white frosting is so boring and
when<00:04:24.760> spring<00:04:25.060> is<00:04:25.240> in<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.390> air<00:04:25.480> you<00:04:25.600> just<00:04:26.020> want

to<00:04:26.260> pop<00:04:26.440> a<00:04:26.470> color<00:04:26.770> everywhere<00:04:27.250> so<00:04:28.210> I<00:04:28.240> used<00:04:28.570> a

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
to pop a color everywhere so I used a

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.810 
to pop a color everywhere so I used a
drop<00:04:29.020> of<00:04:29.050> purple<00:04:29.560> food<00:04:29.830> coloring<00:04:29.890> into<00:04:30.580> the
