00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.160 
of a four on the nose and on the tail
they're<00:00:37.450> gonna<00:00:37.540> be<00:00:37.660> a<00:00:37.690> little<00:00:37.810> bit<00:00:37.960> stiffer

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
they're gonna be a little bit stiffer

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.729 
they're gonna be a little bit stiffer
than<00:00:38.290> going<00:00:38.800> to<00:00:38.950> be<00:00:39.040> a<00:00:39.090> level<00:00:40.090> six<00:00:40.540> flex<00:00:41.470> rating

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
than going to be a level six flex rating

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.950 
than going to be a level six flex rating
but<00:00:42.100> overall<00:00:42.579> this<00:00:42.910> board<00:00:43.180> is<00:00:43.360> a<00:00:43.390> level<00:00:43.720> four

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
but overall this board is a level four

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.990 
but overall this board is a level four
so<00:00:44.290> just<00:00:44.829> a<00:00:44.980> little<00:00:45.220> bit<00:00:45.309> done<00:00:45.520> from<00:00:45.880> the

so just a little bit done from the

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.729 
so just a little bit done from the
center<00:00:46.360> so<00:00:46.480> a<00:00:46.510> little<00:00:46.630> bit<00:00:46.809> softer<00:00:47.290> than<00:00:47.320> most

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739

between<00:00:53.829> your<00:00:53.980> bindings<00:00:54.129> you're<00:00:54.430> gonna<00:00:54.550> have

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
between your bindings you're gonna have

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.090 
between your bindings you're gonna have
a<00:00:54.790> slight<00:00:55.300> camber<00:00:55.600> that's<00:00:56.140> actually<00:00:56.500> one<00:00:56.739> half

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
a slight camber that's actually one half

you're<00:01:04.750> going<00:01:04.960> to<00:01:05.079> have<00:01:05.289> a<00:01:05.740> reverse<00:01:06.520> camber

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
you're going to have a reverse camber

the sidecut radius is pretty unique it's

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.550 
the sidecut radius is pretty unique it's

sidecut when you're getting into the
term<00:01:26.979> it's<00:01:27.130> gonna<00:01:27.250> be<00:01:27.400> nice<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:27.729> mellow<00:01:28.270> but

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
term it's gonna be nice and mellow but

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.840 
term it's gonna be nice and mellow but
as<00:01:28.930> you<00:01:29.140> gradually<00:01:29.560> exit<00:01:30.070> out<00:01:30.280> of<00:01:30.430> turns<00:01:30.670> and

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
as you gradually exit out of turns and

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.760 
as you gradually exit out of turns and
get<00:01:30.939> closer<00:01:31.210> to<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.570> tail<00:01:31.840> of<00:01:32.049> the<00:01:32.140> board<00:01:32.439> it

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
get closer to the tail of the board it

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.859 
get closer to the tail of the board it
actually<00:01:32.970> dips<00:01:33.970> it<00:01:34.180> in<00:01:34.270> just<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:34.509> little<00:01:34.540> bit

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
actually dips it in just a little bit

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.050 
actually dips it in just a little bit
this<00:01:35.080> will<00:01:35.290> help<00:01:35.590> you<00:01:35.710> accelerate<00:01:36.280> down<00:01:37.030> the

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
this will help you accelerate down the

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.910 
this will help you accelerate down the
hill<00:01:37.360> so<00:01:37.479> it's<00:01:37.600> gonna<00:01:37.780> be<00:01:37.930> nice<00:01:38.140> easy<00:01:38.470> turning

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
hill so it's gonna be nice easy turning

hill so it's gonna be nice easy turning
into<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.340> turn<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.509> then<00:01:40.720> a<00:01:40.900> progressive

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
into the turn and then a progressive

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.280 
into the turn and then a progressive
