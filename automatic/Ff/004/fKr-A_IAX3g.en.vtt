promised i will show you how to make
your<00:00:03.659> own<00:00:03.810> copy<00:00:04.170> copies<00:00:04.910> using<00:00:05.910> foam<00:00:06.150> core

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
your own copy copies using foam core

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.930 
your own copy copies using foam core
board<00:00:06.450> and<00:00:07.020> yeah<00:00:07.919> so<00:00:08.130> let's<00:00:08.309> get<00:00:08.519> right<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.820> the

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
board and yeah so let's get right to the

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.290 
board and yeah so let's get right to the

basics so what I have here is a

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.379 
basics so what I have here is a
explosion<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.290> an<00:00:13.559> explosion<00:00:14.240> diagram<00:00:15.240> off

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
explosion is an explosion diagram off

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.300 
explosion is an explosion diagram off
the<00:00:15.750> whole<00:00:15.900> thing<00:00:16.170> it's<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.800> need<00:00:16.920> two<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.190> the

uh yeah so I will attach a better

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.819 
uh yeah so I will attach a better
diagram<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.210> video<00:00:51.360> maybe<00:00:52.079> if<00:00:52.559> you

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
diagram in the in the video maybe if you

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.560 
diagram in the in the video maybe if you
really<00:00:53.430> want<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.730> know<00:00:53.820> how<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.090> do<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.480> I

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
really want to know how to do it I

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.060 
really want to know how to do it I
really<00:00:54.600> want<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.110> know<00:00:55.230> how<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.410> construct<00:00:55.920> it

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
really want to know how to construct it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.510 
really want to know how to construct it
using<00:00:56.250> my<00:00:57.120> own<00:00:57.329> dimensions<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:59.160> first<00:00:59.399> you

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
using my own dimensions so first you

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.060 
using my own dimensions so first you
start<00:00:59.550> out<00:01:00.090> with<00:01:00.359> cutting<00:01:00.899> two<00:01:01.079> pieces<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.530> a

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
start out with cutting two pieces of a

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.939 
start out with cutting two pieces of a
foam<00:01:02.309> core<00:01:02.520> board<00:01:02.579> with<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:04.049> dimension<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.500> 48

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
foam core board with the dimension of 48

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.530 
foam core board with the dimension of 48
14<00:01:05.369> cm<00:01:05.790> I'm<00:01:06.570> 23<00:01:07.409> centimeters<00:01:08.090> sorry<00:01:09.090> guys<00:01:09.299> I

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
14 cm I'm 23 centimeters sorry guys I

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.020 
14 cm I'm 23 centimeters sorry guys I
don't<00:01:09.750> use<00:01:10.049> inches<00:01:10.500> but<00:01:11.189> again<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.000> just

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
don't use inches but again this is just

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.660 
don't use inches but again this is just
a<00:01:12.570> suggestion<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.680> can<00:01:13.890> use<00:01:14.369> your<00:01:14.520> own

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
a suggestion you can use your own

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.090 
a suggestion you can use your own
dimension<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.990> course<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.650> convert

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
dimension and of course you can convert

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.730 
dimension and of course you can convert
it<00:01:17.220> if<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.490> want<00:01:17.960> so<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.080> next<00:01:19.290> step<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.619> to

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
it if you want so the next step is to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.219 
it if you want so the next step is to
cut<00:01:19.920> five<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.549> these<00:01:20.790> boards<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.900> reason

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
cut five of these boards and the reason

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.929 
cut five of these boards and the reason
why<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.409> cut<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> little<00:01:23.070> bit<00:01:23.430> small<00:01:23.790> it's

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
why I cut it a little bit small it's

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.670 
why I cut it a little bit small it's
because<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.450> are<00:01:24.479> going<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.990> insert<00:01:25.380> these

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
because we are going to insert these

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.359 
because we are going to insert these
boards<00:01:26.159> into<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.000> slot<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.860> I<00:01:28.860> will<00:01:28.979> explain

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
boards into the slot and I will explain

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.530 
boards into the slot and I will explain
it<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.880> later<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.329> how<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> slots

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
it to you later on how to do the slots

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.810 
it to you later on how to do the slots
we<00:01:34.200> will<00:01:34.380> also<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.770> needing<00:01:35.190> a<00:01:35.340> table<00:01:35.640> at<00:01:35.790> the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
we will also be needing a table at the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.740 
we will also be needing a table at the
bottom<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.390> as<00:01:36.480> well<00:01:36.690> as<00:01:36.870> the<00:01:37.050> backside<00:01:38.750> so

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
bottom and as well as the backside so

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.390 
bottom and as well as the backside so
the<00:01:39.840> first<00:01:40.080> steps<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.470> take<00:01:40.620> the<00:01:40.740> side<00:01:40.980> boards

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
the first steps is take the side boards

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.610 
the first steps is take the side boards
and<00:01:41.580> cut<00:01:41.910> out<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.240> slots<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.720> 0.5<00:01:43.590> a

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
and cut out the slots of 0.5 a

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.490 
and cut out the slots of 0.5 a
centimeter<00:01:44.430> thickness<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.870> need<00:01:45.990> 5<00:01:46.260> 3

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
centimeter thickness and you need 5 3

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.310 
centimeter thickness and you need 5 3
slots<00:01:46.800> for<00:01:47.040> each<00:01:47.190> side<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.900> make<00:01:48.900> sure<00:01:49.080> that

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
slots for each side and make sure that

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.860 
slots for each side and make sure that
you<00:01:49.470> don't<00:01:49.590> cut<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.070> thoroughly<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.450> sense

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
you don't cut it thoroughly in a sense

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.990 
you don't cut it thoroughly in a sense
that<00:01:52.110> do<00:01:52.800> you<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:53.130> take<00:01:53.490> out<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.790> foam

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
that do you just take out the foam

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.480 
that do you just take out the foam
instead<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.570> whole<00:01:54.690> thing<00:01:55.310> will<00:01:56.310> take

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
instead of the whole thing will take

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.940 
instead of the whole thing will take
some<00:01:56.700> time<00:01:56.730> I<00:01:57.150> struggled<00:01:57.660> a<00:01:57.720> bit<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:58.080> guess<00:01:58.830> you

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
some time I struggled a bit I guess you

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.160 
some time I struggled a bit I guess you
just<00:01:59.010> have<00:01:59.220> to<00:01:59.370> be<00:01:59.490> patient<00:01:59.670> but<00:02:00.420> if<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.900> know

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
just have to be patient but if you know

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.470 
just have to be patient but if you know
a<00:02:01.200> better<00:02:01.560> way<00:02:01.800> or<00:02:01.830> an<00:02:02.520> easier<00:02:02.850> way<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.240> how<00:02:03.450> to

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 
a better way or an easier way on how to

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.920 
a better way or an easier way on how to
remove<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.080> please<00:02:04.980> leave<00:02:05.610> me<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> comment<00:02:06.180> I'd

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
remove it please leave me a comment I'd

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.950 
remove it please leave me a comment I'd
really<00:02:07.320> appreciate<00:02:07.410> it<00:02:08.010> so<00:02:08.510> this<00:02:09.510> is<00:02:09.660> how<00:02:09.810> they

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
really appreciate it so this is how they

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.720 
really appreciate it so this is how they
look<00:02:10.140> like<00:02:10.170> we've<00:02:10.470> slots<00:02:10.770> although<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.490> still

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
look like we've slots although is still

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.570 
look like we've slots although is still
unfinished<00:02:12.170> but<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.320> will<00:02:13.470> end<00:02:13.800> up<00:02:14.100> with<00:02:14.160> 10

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
unfinished but you will end up with 10

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.180 
unfinished but you will end up with 10
slots<00:02:14.820> if<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.360> did<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.630> right

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
slots if you did it right

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.550 
slots if you did it right
and<00:02:17.280> now<00:02:18.180> what<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.600> need<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.750> do<00:02:18.960> is<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.290> slide

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
and now what you need to do is to slide

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.800 
and now what you need to do is to slide
those<00:02:19.800> five<00:02:20.100> ports<00:02:20.520> into<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:21.000> slots<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.540> glue

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
those five ports into the slots and glue

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.670 
those five ports into the slots and glue
them<00:02:22.020> together

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
them together

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.550 
them together
I<00:02:22.830> used<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:24.000> USU<00:02:24.540> glue<00:02:24.960> which<00:02:25.290> works

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
I used the USU glue which works

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.890 
I used the USU glue which works
perfectly<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.550> can<00:02:26.790> use<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.210> Huggle<00:02:27.540> gun<00:02:27.720> if

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
perfectly you can use the Huggle gun if

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.200 
perfectly you can use the Huggle gun if
you<00:02:27.990> have<00:02:28.140> them<00:02:28.320> supposedly<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.520> holds<00:02:29.940> better

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
you have them supposedly it holds better

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.050 
you have them supposedly it holds better
as<00:02:31.300> you<00:02:32.260> can<00:02:32.440> see<00:02:32.650> here<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:32.860> was<00:02:33.130> using<00:02:33.430> books<00:02:33.670> as

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
as you can see here I was using books as

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.100 
as you can see here I was using books as
weights<00:02:34.570> to<00:02:34.960> hold<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.770> pieces<00:02:36.070> together<00:02:36.310> and

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
weights to hold the pieces together and

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.360 
weights to hold the pieces together and
then<00:02:38.110> you<00:02:38.260> can<00:02:38.440> go<00:02:38.560> ahead<00:02:38.710> and<00:02:38.890> glue<00:02:39.220> the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
then you can go ahead and glue the

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.330 
then you can go ahead and glue the
backside<00:02:39.850> after<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.720> glue<00:02:40.960> dries<00:02:40.990> out<00:02:41.530> I

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
backside after the glue dries out I

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.860 
backside after the glue dries out I
didn't<00:02:42.850> wait<00:02:42.970> for<00:02:43.150> that<00:02:43.330> long<00:02:43.510> though<00:02:43.720> I

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
didn't wait for that long though I

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.600 
didn't wait for that long though I
probably<00:02:44.110> waited<00:02:44.470> for<00:02:44.680> about<00:02:44.920> 10<00:02:45.160> minutes<00:02:45.370> and

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
probably waited for about 10 minutes and

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.030 
probably waited for about 10 minutes and
went<00:02:46.270> ahead<00:02:46.360> for<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.900> next<00:02:46.930> step<00:02:47.290> but<00:02:47.920> of

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
went ahead for the next step but of

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.950 
went ahead for the next step but of
course<00:02:48.280> you<00:02:48.460> can<00:02:48.670> wait<00:02:49.180> up<00:02:49.360> as<00:02:49.510> long<00:02:49.690> as<00:02:49.810> you

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
course you can wait up as long as you

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.600 
course you can wait up as long as you
think<00:02:50.050> it's<00:02:50.320> necessary<00:02:50.740> for<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.220> pieces<00:02:51.490> to

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
think it's necessary for the pieces to

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.440 
think it's necessary for the pieces to
completely<00:02:52.030> stick<00:02:52.870> together<00:02:53.490> and<00:02:54.490> I<00:02:55.270> guess

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
completely stick together and I guess

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.960 
completely stick together and I guess
for<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.810> last<00:02:56.020> step<00:02:56.290> is<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:56.710> just<00:02:56.950> glue<00:02:57.490> the

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
for the last step is to just glue the

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.210 
for the last step is to just glue the
top<00:02:58.510> part<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:58.840> also<00:02:59.020> the<00:02:59.260> bottom<00:02:59.710> part<00:02:59.920> which

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
top part and also the bottom part which

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.390 
top part and also the bottom part which
is<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.610> base<00:03:01.320> just<00:03:02.320> glue<00:03:02.500> them<00:03:02.620> together<00:03:02.830> and

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
is the base just glue them together and

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.640 
is the base just glue them together and
you're<00:03:03.760> practically<00:03:04.270> done

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.259 

again<00:03:07.650> as<00:03:07.799> I<00:03:07.920> said<00:03:08.159> you<00:03:08.370> probably<00:03:08.819> might<00:03:09.090> not

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
again as I said you probably might not

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.640 
again as I said you probably might not
end<00:03:09.510> up<00:03:09.659> with<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.870> best<00:03:10.079> quality<00:03:10.469> of<00:03:10.500> this

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
end up with the best quality of this

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.979 
end up with the best quality of this
cubby<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.099> myself<00:03:11.760> needed<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.420> trim<00:03:12.719> out<00:03:12.870> the

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
cubby I myself needed to trim out the

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.809 
cubby I myself needed to trim out the
board<00:03:13.230> here<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.709> there<00:03:13.890> but<00:03:14.430> the

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
board here and there but the

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.970 
board here and there but the
imperfections<00:03:15.599> are<00:03:15.840> almost<00:03:16.319> visually

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
imperfections are almost visually

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.119 
imperfections are almost visually
invisible<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.579> it<00:03:18.150> works<00:03:18.590> yeah<00:03:19.590> I<00:03:19.620> had<00:03:19.920> fun

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
invisible and it works yeah I had fun
