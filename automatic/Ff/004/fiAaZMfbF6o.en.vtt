00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.210 
Call of Duty times 10 it's like they
take<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.899> call<00:01:47.049> of<00:01:47.140> duty<00:01:47.350> model<00:01:47.679> and<00:01:47.860> just

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
take the call of duty model and just

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.919 
take the call of duty model and just
like<00:01:48.369> add<00:01:48.579> all<00:01:48.789> these<00:01:48.939> different<00:01:49.210> things<00:01:49.390> so

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
like add all these different things so

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.169 
like add all these different things so
basically<00:01:50.770> okay<00:01:51.039> so<00:01:51.100> you're<00:01:51.429> either<00:01:51.460> a<00:01:51.700> pilot

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
basically okay so you're either a pilot

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:54.990 
basically okay so you're either a pilot
or<00:01:52.360> I<00:01:52.560> Titan<00:01:53.560> pilots<00:01:54.399> are<00:01:54.520> just<00:01:54.670> like<00:01:54.819> you're

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
or I Titan pilots are just like you're

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.789 
or I Titan pilots are just like you're
into<00:01:55.119> their<00:01:55.240> soldiers<00:01:55.659> but<00:01:55.960> they<00:01:56.200> they're

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
into their soldiers but they they're

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.020 
into their soldiers but they they're
better'n<00:01:57.039> is<00:01:57.220> because<00:01:57.460> you<00:01:57.579> can<00:01:57.700> double<00:01:58.000> jump

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
better'n is because you can double jump

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.819 
better'n is because you can double jump
they<00:01:58.390> have<00:01:58.479> like<00:01:58.630> little<00:01:58.840> jets<00:01:59.079> and<00:01:59.289> you<00:01:59.679> can

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
they have like little jets and you can

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.100 
they have like little jets and you can
double<00:01:59.979> jump<00:02:00.159> and<00:02:00.579> run<00:02:00.789> off<00:02:00.909> walls<00:02:01.210> so<00:02:01.840> you<00:02:01.929> can

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
double jump and run off walls so you can

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.960 
double jump and run off walls so you can
basically<00:02:02.229> just<00:02:02.710> like<00:02:02.799> run<00:02:03.369> off<00:02:03.399> a<00:02:03.520> wall<00:02:03.729> jump

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
basically just like run off a wall jump

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.429 
basically just like run off a wall jump
out<00:02:04.090> another<00:02:04.270> wall<00:02:04.479> run<00:02:04.689> off<00:02:04.810> that<00:02:04.990> one<00:02:05.200> run

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
out another wall run off that one run

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:06.480 
out another wall run off that one run
off<00:02:05.560> that<00:02:05.740> one<00:02:05.860> inch<00:02:06.009> it's<00:02:06.250> like<00:02:06.340> your

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
off that one inch it's like your

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.609 
off that one inch it's like your
maneuverability<00:02:07.240> is<00:02:07.390> like<00:02:07.659> the<00:02:08.440> roof

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
maneuverability is like the roof

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.440 
maneuverability is like the roof
obviously<00:02:09.459> you<00:02:09.519> can't<00:02:09.670> fly<00:02:09.880> or<00:02:09.940> anything<00:02:10.330> but

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
obviously you can't fly or anything but

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.910 
obviously you can't fly or anything but
like<00:02:10.509> it's<00:02:10.959> crazy<00:02:11.230> you're<00:02:11.560> like<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:11.739> little

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
like it's crazy you're like a little

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.289 
like it's crazy you're like a little
monkey<00:02:12.099> going<00:02:12.430> through<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.670> things<00:02:12.849> and<00:02:13.030> then

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
monkey going through the things and then

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.600 
monkey going through the things and then
when<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:13.989> get<00:02:14.080> enough<00:02:14.290> points<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:15.220> get<00:02:15.549> a

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
when you get enough points you get a

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.250 
when you get enough points you get a
Titan<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.209> you<00:02:16.299> can<00:02:16.420> call<00:02:16.630> it<00:02:16.780> down<00:02:16.930> from<00:02:17.140> the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
Titan so you can call it down from the

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.330 
Titan so you can call it down from the
sky<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.739> it's<00:02:17.950> like<00:02:18.069> in<00:02:18.190> Halo<00:02:18.489> resume<00:02:18.730> and

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
sky and it's like in Halo resume and

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.300 
sky and it's like in Halo resume and
that's<00:02:21.340> what<00:02:21.459> it<00:02:21.549> does<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:22.410> but<00:02:23.410> it's<00:02:23.950> super

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
that's what it does you but it's super

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.880 
that's what it does you but it's super
fun<00:02:24.519> and<00:02:24.819> they<00:02:25.209> rid<00:02:25.450> it's<00:02:25.750> really<00:02:26.110> like<00:02:26.290> they

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
fun and they rid it's really like they

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.190 
fun and they rid it's really like they
really<00:02:27.040> balanced<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.790> so<00:02:28.180> it's<00:02:28.420> not<00:02:28.510> like<00:02:28.870> all

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
really balanced it so it's not like all

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.330 
really balanced it so it's not like all
you<00:02:29.349> get<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.560> tighten<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:29.950> you're<00:02:30.069> just<00:02:30.190> like

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
you get it tighten and you're just like

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.289 
you get it tighten and you're just like
going<00:02:30.549> around<00:02:30.700> you're<00:02:30.970> just<00:02:31.000> killing

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
going around you're just killing

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.270 
going around you're just killing
everybody<00:02:31.569> with<00:02:31.840> tightness<00:02:32.110> so<00:02:32.680> so<00:02:33.010> it's<00:02:33.160> not

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
everybody with tightness so so it's not

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.099 
everybody with tightness so so it's not
like<00:02:33.549> overpowering<00:02:34.060> or<00:02:34.510> anything<00:02:34.959> like<00:02:34.989> that

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
like overpowering or anything like that

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.410 
like overpowering or anything like that
it's<00:02:35.380> very<00:02:35.560> equal<00:02:35.920> yeah<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:36.700> then<00:02:36.819> also<00:02:37.030> like

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
it's very equal yeah and then also like

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.120 
it's very equal yeah and then also like
if<00:02:37.630> you're<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:37.930> pilot<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.380> have<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.680> special

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
if you're a pilot you have a special

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.890 
if you're a pilot you have a special
Titan<00:02:39.489> killing<00:02:39.819> weapon<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:40.420> it's<00:02:40.569> like<00:02:40.630> it's

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
Titan killing weapon so it's like it's

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.090 
Titan killing weapon so it's like it's
heavier<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.560> it's<00:02:41.709> not<00:02:41.859> gonna<00:02:42.010> obviously

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
heavier and it's not gonna obviously

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.009 
heavier and it's not gonna obviously
it's<00:02:42.459> not<00:02:42.489> as<00:02:42.730> good<00:02:42.910> as<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.299> Titan<00:02:43.540> itself<00:02:43.840> but

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
it's not as good as the Titan itself but

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.210 
it's not as good as the Titan itself but
they<00:02:44.200> kind<00:02:44.500> of<00:02:44.560> take<00:02:44.739> all<00:02:44.890> that<00:02:44.980> into<00:02:45.100> account

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
they kind of take all that into account

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.740 
they kind of take all that into account
and<00:02:45.609> like<00:02:45.790> it's<00:02:45.940> those<00:02:46.120> little<00:02:46.269> things<00:02:46.420> where
