00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.069
 for me, explain what happened 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.780
 because that the first goal that the people 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.890
 just saw the goal from leo came 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.620
 corner 1 l deviate the ball the box is 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:18.769
 in the second lock the ball enters the flag 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.989
 at the time he rented a supposed 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:23.689
 borges nor there the marcelo of lima henrique 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:26.449
 go there and consult the flag and indeed 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.640
 coincidently who was watching the 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.819
 tv broadcast tv that closed 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.399
 showed the game just happened there is from the site 

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:36.199
 I used the flag with the flag 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.920
 habit will talk to the power in this 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:41.390
 half time the television replay appears 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.300
 ends the replay a series of e-mail and 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.030
 confirmed the incident mind because it is so 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.440
 who left the replay to pimba the marcelo 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.079
 lima henrique points out problems that 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.239
 someone from outside saw and communicated I did not 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.550
 I doubt there's no way to prove it, but mine. 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.649
 distrust only increases because I 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.120
 I wanted to understand if there is a communication 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.100
 via radio 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.499
 because of course you have to immediately leave the 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.150
 the other side to get near the flag 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:06.980
 and talk with the flag ask what 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.200
 happened if you were prevented or will not 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.600
 to do any place of the field today 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.450
 the feeling of it is a time for 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.340
 replay appear is good as vital Sergio 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.500
 says it 's a black box that will only open 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.030
 to the communication of arbitrators and assistants 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.370
 during the game 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.710
 if there is nothing much being said between 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.630
 they do not have this media not 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.100
 It's open for everyone to know that I 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.030
 I have a secret no mystery in the 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.300
 general 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.880
 I already said this round web kiss in 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.810
 2009 Confederations Cup which is when 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.330
 I back 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.490
 That penalty for Brazil is Brazil and 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.230
 generous goes from the Confederations Cup 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.960
 he took a corner after he came back 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.360
 mark just will now work here 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.460
 I'll have a good goal that was irregular and 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.920
 and is common in various games 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.340
 what happened in the cruise game will be 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.910
 the land there comes back a little 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.650
 I do not want to divert it is already irregular 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.630
 look around 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.460
 I already fished there now 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.760
 completely off the corner mark 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.190
 looks completely out there 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.920
 if you go back a little bit the player 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.420
 still disrupts the vision a bit but I 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.670
 I was careful to see under all 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.380
 angles and is now completely gone. 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.750
 of the corner mark and get 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.790
 like and regular at the source 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.250
 the face that is now behind the 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.390
 goal and is usually behind the balloon 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.130
 do nothing 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.470
 we are giving an assignment 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.470
 a function for this comrade 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.150
 looks at the ball a bit at the 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.760
 table for cornering 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.000
 the team is very strong this ball is only waiting 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.490
 a little bit there for him to propagate the 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.890
 go there, the assistant will look at it there 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.870
 have to change the side if you put it next 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.490
 but it can at the time of the collection of 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.940
 corner can come close to the 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.520
 time and leave it looks that refers to a 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.250
 rate of 5 is the one that should be raised 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.900
 by the side of there is or have already have 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.630
 flag because the wizard is 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.850
 side flag can not stay from the dj only to 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.580
 original image without sedition boot 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.950
 original stop because you can see 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.110
 even better with the act the players of the 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.890
 Cruise has no turning one 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.070
 a little 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.230
 I think it's the best we have there 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.470
 Look, can you see a part of the 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:25.450
 drawing and 01 ball besides you see gave the 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.420
 ball is completely out of shape 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.340
 agree with me it's ok you convince 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.709
 for a detail to be beaten in the afternoon 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.980
 now unpublished that the flag marked the 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.739
 borges did not exist in his goal taking and 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.300
 if the ball were in the mark the goal would be 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.430
 always be cool because the tram does not have 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.130
 what to say if you run and run again 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.920
 goal robert new goal you will see the 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.230
 the reason for the complaint or the 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.000
 complaint is that borges tried 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.000
 participate in the play 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.370
 when stretching the leg the throw of the luisão that 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.610
 that's the reason why the flag is right 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.570
 because according to fifa even without touching 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.840
 on the ball 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.260
 the borges while stretching the leg to the steam 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.680
 caravela direct 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.599
 this is the point is the flag has 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.060
 reason in logic is that by stretching the leg 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.430
 even without touching the ball he did not leave 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.650
 him participate in the bid him to mark 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.840
 just one detail the flag is wrong 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.270
 he at any moment had a goat asked 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.010
 but on thursday in morumbi são paulo 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.949
 and athletic paranaense the goal of são paulo 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.410
 that has been validated an aloísio does not touch the 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.850
 ball but it goes towards the ball in the 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.430
 second beam and after the deviation of 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.389
 head and the goal was 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.010
 validated 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.960
 on thursday they are paulo and athletic 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.110
 Paraná volume almost the Aloisio 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.910
 He took out Sao Paulo, he will not play. 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.470
 but it's the same as the post it goes in 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.330
 direction of the ball only that Borges does not 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.550
 was prevented today in the fifth luiz 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.310
 time then there comes the interpretation 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.100
 he has disrupted the goalkeeper the goalkeeper 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.500
 or not if the ball would already be already now 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.310
 You are entering at any time and not 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.310
 consider this
