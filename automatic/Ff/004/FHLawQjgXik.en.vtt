00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
burned alive so you don't win unless

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.899 
burned alive so you don't win unless
everyone<00:01:49.259> gets<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.680> there<00:01:49.920> but<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.490> has<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.640> go

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
everyone gets in there but it has to go

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.880 
everyone gets in there but it has to go
in<00:01:51.680> ascending<00:01:52.680> order<00:01:53.869> so<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:55.140> aces<00:01:55.649> first

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
in ascending order so like aces first

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.459 
in ascending order so like aces first
and<00:01:56.159> twos<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.610> threes<00:01:56.750> now<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.810> women<00:01:58.170> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
and twos and threes now the women the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.200 
and twos and threes now the women the
children<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.340> eventually<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.880> get<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.030> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
children and eventually you get to the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.380 
children and eventually you get to the
royal<00:02:00.450> family<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.549> think<00:02:02.549> that's<00:02:02.729> how<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.149> goes

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
royal family I think that's how it goes

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.760 
royal family I think that's how it goes
although<00:02:04.200> there's<00:02:04.439> four<00:02:04.710> royal<00:02:05.009> families<00:02:06.770> may

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
although there's four royal families may

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.400 
although there's four royal families may
