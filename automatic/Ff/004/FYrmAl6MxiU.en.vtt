 hello another recipe very easy the roll of 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.160
 we 're going to do chicken with thighs 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.920
 but it can be done with breast against 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.390
 the thigh is like most played he quoted here 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.700
 we are removing the bone and then 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:17.900
 let's make some finite filetito 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.210
 Dorna and removing the fat 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.970
 and when we have it and all parties 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.070
 of filetitos we are going to salpimentar a 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.960
 little salt above and also 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.929
 then a little pepper 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.090
 once filleted we will put a couple 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.489
 of slices of turkey 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.519
 this cooked turkey also serves some 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.430
 slices of ham as a few 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:43.980
 slices of cheese that already come in 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.519
 your squares we also put in the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.949
 inside the thigh anti-thigh fillets 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:53.250
 roll up and place it in a mold 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:57.250
 oven we have heated the oven and there 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.730
 we have the projects 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:04.750
 then in a boat we will put everything 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.970
 the small mayonnaise jar in this 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.680
 case mayonnaise and bar and the bars in 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.020
 this case is better because it releases us 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.930
 too liquid and we will add a 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.580
 small teaspoon of marmalade 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.000
 peach 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:24.120
 and a tablespoon of onion soup 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.120
 about what we crush that all very well 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.490
 we are putting it above the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.490
 rolls 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.940
 spreading it everywhere 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.570
 once so in the preheated oven to 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:46.110
 170 we will put our tray and what 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.200
 we will leave around 40 to 45 minutes and 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.079
 that's how they end up 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.729
 the cheese has melted a lot and what 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.009
 above it has been doradito must 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.390
 make sure they are well made by 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.500
 inside the fillets that's why the 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.500
 fillets should be thin
