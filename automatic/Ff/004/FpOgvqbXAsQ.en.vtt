first<00:03:51.870> off<00:03:52.019> stadium<00:03:52.470> looks<00:03:52.650> pretty<00:03:53.190> good<00:03:53.430> I'm

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
first off stadium looks pretty good I'm

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.150 
first off stadium looks pretty good I'm
crowds<00:03:54.389> probably<00:03:54.989> not<00:03:55.139> quite<00:03:55.620> as<00:03:55.739> much<00:03:55.859> for<00:03:56.130> a

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
crowds probably not quite as much for a

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.309 
crowds probably not quite as much for a
Bulldog's<00:03:56.579> game<00:03:56.790> but<00:03:57.000> anyways<00:03:57.720> I'm<00:03:57.900> thinking

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
Bulldog's game but anyways I'm thinking

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.759 
Bulldog's game but anyways I'm thinking
it<00:03:58.530> looks<00:03:58.560> pretty<00:03:58.889> good<00:04:00.260> I'm<00:04:01.260> not<00:04:01.380> sure<00:04:01.560> what

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
it looks pretty good I'm not sure what

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:02.990 
it looks pretty good I'm not sure what
sort<00:04:01.980> of<00:04:02.040> camera<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:02.430> I'm<00:04:02.519> not<00:04:02.700> sure<00:04:02.790> off<00:04:02.880> on

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
sort of camera and I'm not sure off on

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.849 
sort of camera and I'm not sure off on
my<00:04:03.090> huge<00:04:03.329> friend<00:04:03.569> at<00:04:03.660> camera<00:04:03.900> angle<00:04:04.170> but<00:04:04.290> it<00:04:04.680> is

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
my huge friend at camera angle but it is

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.080 
my huge friend at camera angle but it is
from<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.100> kickoff<00:04:05.370> while<00:04:05.609> it<00:04:05.700> looks<00:04:05.819> of<00:04:05.940> things

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
from a kickoff while it looks of things

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.879 
from a kickoff while it looks of things
so<00:04:06.359> maybe<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:07.079> changed<00:04:07.109> once<00:04:07.560> we<00:04:07.650> get<00:04:07.739> into

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
so maybe it changed once we get into

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.039 
so maybe it changed once we get into
that<00:04:07.950> but<00:04:08.280> it<00:04:08.609> is<00:04:08.940> looking<00:04:09.180> pretty<00:04:09.420> good<00:04:09.660> thus

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
that but it is looking pretty good thus

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.229 
that but it is looking pretty good thus
far<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:10.530> then<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.459> final<00:04:11.489> on<00:04:11.910> that<00:04:12.090> sorry

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
field looks like they've got the fire

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.810 
field looks like they've got the fire
that<00:04:37.530> happens<00:04:37.770> when<00:04:37.950> teams<00:04:38.310> run<00:04:38.490> out<00:04:38.670> and

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
that happens when teams run out and

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.220 
that happens when teams run out and
score<00:04:39.000> tries<00:04:39.150> and<00:04:39.390> that<00:04:39.480> Ian's<00:04:39.780> add<00:04:39.930> in<00:04:40.050> all

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
score tries and that Ian's add in all

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.280 
score tries and that Ian's add in all
the<00:04:40.410> big<00:04:40.620> games<00:04:40.860> so<00:04:41.520> that's<00:04:41.670> pretty<00:04:41.850> cool

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
the big games so that's pretty cool

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.930 
the big games so that's pretty cool
pretty<00:04:43.290> happy<00:04:43.620> about<00:04:43.680> that<00:04:44.040> and<00:04:44.160> then<00:04:44.850> the

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
pretty happy about that and then the

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.670 
pretty happy about that and then the
last<00:04:45.060> screenshot<00:04:45.600> is<00:04:45.840> I'm<00:04:46.110> not<00:04:46.290> sure<00:04:46.440> who<00:04:46.560> it's

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
last screenshot is I'm not sure who it's

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.290 
last screenshot is I'm not sure who it's
exactly<00:04:47.040> is<00:04:47.220> looks<00:04:47.430> like<00:04:47.490> Alex<00:04:47.730> Johnson

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
exactly is looks like Alex Johnson

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.020 
exactly is looks like Alex Johnson
possibly<00:04:48.810> going<00:04:49.620> into<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:50.010> corner<00:04:50.370> so<00:04:50.580> does

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
possibly going into the corner so does

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.080 
possibly going into the corner so does
show<00:04:51.500> they<00:04:52.500> do<00:04:52.560> have<00:04:52.830> some<00:04:53.370> better<00:04:53.580> put<00:04:53.850> downs

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
show they do have some better put downs

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.540 
show they do have some better put downs
hopefully<00:04:54.660> in<00:04:55.380> the<00:04:55.500> corner<00:04:55.830> I<00:04:55.980> know<00:04:56.340> there<00:04:56.520> was

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
hopefully in the corner I know there was

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.220 
hopefully in the corner I know there was
like<00:04:56.640> one<00:04:57.000> animation<00:04:57.360> or<00:04:57.600> rubber<00:04:57.750> glove<00:04:58.020> to

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
like one animation or rubber glove to

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.350 
like one animation or rubber glove to
wear<00:04:58.410> player<00:04:58.710> could<00:04:59.000> sometimes<00:05:00.000> if<00:05:00.210> they're

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
wear player could sometimes if they're

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
wear player could sometimes if they're
going<00:05:00.480> in<00:05:00.630> the<00:05:00.660> corner<00:05:00.930> they<00:05:01.020> could<00:05:01.170> do<00:05:01.260> the

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
going in the corner they could do the

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.010 
going in the corner they could do the
diving<00:05:01.710> wanted<00:05:01.920> to<00:05:02.010> run<00:05:02.130> pull<00:05:02.370> him<00:05:02.490> out<00:05:02.840> but<00:05:03.840> I

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
diving wanted to run pull him out but I

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.750 
diving wanted to run pull him out but I
think<00:05:04.260> I<00:05:04.320> maybe<00:05:04.560> saw<00:05:04.770> it<00:05:04.920> once<00:05:05.220> and<00:05:05.460> it<00:05:05.550> didn't

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
think I maybe saw it once and it didn't

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.450 
think I maybe saw it once and it didn't
actually<00:05:05.850> work<00:05:06.210> out<00:05:06.420> anyways<00:05:07.350> but<00:05:07.590> it<00:05:08.250> looks

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
actually work out anyways but it looks

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.190 
actually work out anyways but it looks
to<00:05:08.490> be<00:05:08.640> a<00:05:08.670> bit<00:05:09.030> of<00:05:09.060> a<00:05:09.240> spectacular<00:05:09.840> put<00:05:10.020> down

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
to be a bit of a spectacular put down

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.650 
to be a bit of a spectacular put down
and<00:05:10.440> it's<00:05:10.920> just<00:05:11.070> like<00:05:11.250> at<00:05:11.700> least<00:05:11.880> we<00:05:12.000> can<00:05:12.120> sort

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
and it's just like at least we can sort

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.820 
and it's just like at least we can sort
of<00:05:12.720> tell<00:05:12.840> who<00:05:12.990> it<00:05:13.050> was<00:05:13.200> i'm<00:05:13.320> pretty<00:05:13.500> sure<00:05:13.650> it's

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
of tell who it was i'm pretty sure it's

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.510 
of tell who it was i'm pretty sure it's
alex<00:05:14.040> johnson<00:05:14.780> if<00:05:15.780> not<00:05:16.140> totally<00:05:16.980> like<00:05:17.400> this

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
alex johnson if not totally like this

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.610 
alex johnson if not totally like this

I'm<00:05:38.910> actually<00:05:39.210> pretty<00:05:39.450> impressed<00:05:39.780> I'm<00:05:40.230> going

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
I'm actually pretty impressed I'm going

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.480 
I'm actually pretty impressed I'm going
to<00:05:40.410> save<00:05:40.560> the<00:05:40.680> last<00:05:40.830> few<00:05:41.040> batches<00:05:41.220> of

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
to save the last few batches of

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.370 
to save the last few batches of
screenshots<00:05:41.760> haven't<00:05:42.210> really<00:05:42.360> been<00:05:42.480> hugely

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
screenshots haven't really been hugely

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.020 
screenshots haven't really been hugely
impressive<00:05:43.680> for<00:05:43.920> me<00:05:44.010> but<00:05:44.220> this<00:05:44.670> is<00:05:44.850> actually

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
impressive for me but this is actually

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.910 
impressive for me but this is actually
the<00:05:45.360> first<00:05:45.390> set<00:05:45.810> where<00:05:46.020> they<00:05:46.410> really<00:05:46.710> proper

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
the first set where they really proper

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.650 
the first set where they really proper
being<00:05:47.190> properly<00:05:47.790> being<00:05:48.030> screenshots<00:05:48.570> that

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
being properly being screenshots that

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.020 
being properly being screenshots that
look<00:05:48.960> good<00:05:49.590> rather<00:05:49.830> than<00:05:50.010> sort<00:05:50.550> of<00:05:50.730> just<00:05:50.940> the

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
look good rather than sort of just the

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.370 
look good rather than sort of just the
ones<00:05:51.210> at<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.390> end<00:05:51.600> which<00:05:51.870> is<00:05:51.960> to<00:05:52.050> put<00:05:52.200> down

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
ones at the end which is to put down

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.200 
ones at the end which is to put down
where<00:05:52.950> it's<00:05:53.070> obviously<00:05:53.400> not<00:05:53.520> gameplay<00:05:54.060> it's

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
where it's obviously not gameplay it's

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.990 
where it's obviously not gameplay it's
like<00:05:54.360> a<00:05:54.390> rendered<00:05:55.170> photo<00:05:55.410> also<00:05:56.280> a<00:05:56.430> rented<00:05:56.880> bit

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
like a rendered photo also a rented bit

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.330 
like a rendered photo also a rented bit
of<00:05:57.090> gameplay<00:05:57.800> so<00:05:58.800> I'm<00:05:58.890> pretty<00:05:59.010> happy<00:05:59.130> with

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
of gameplay so I'm pretty happy with

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.890 
of gameplay so I'm pretty happy with
that<00:05:59.400> and<00:05:59.610> also<00:05:59.730> we<00:05:59.820> haven't<00:06:00.030> seen<00:06:00.180> very<00:06:00.420> much

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
that and also we haven't seen very much

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.990 
that and also we haven't seen very much
