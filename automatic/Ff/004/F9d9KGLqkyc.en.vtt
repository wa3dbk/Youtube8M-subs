simply<00:03:08.709> for<00:03:09.069> the<00:03:09.160> fact<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:09.489> I<00:03:09.579> ran<00:03:09.849> a<00:03:10.090> lot<00:03:10.569> of

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
simply for the fact that I ran a lot of

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.599 
simply for the fact that I ran a lot of
minutes<00:03:11.079> at<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.349> shooting<00:03:11.680> guard<00:03:11.799> spot<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.459> I

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
minutes at the shooting guard spot and I

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.089 
minutes at the shooting guard spot and I
just<00:03:12.849> don't<00:03:13.090> have<00:03:13.329> the<00:03:13.540> option<00:03:13.989> to<00:03:14.470> run<00:03:14.709> plays

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.180 
just don't have the option to run plays
and<00:03:15.549> that<00:03:16.030> is<00:03:16.209> definitely<00:03:16.389> bittersweet<00:03:17.200> sweet

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
and that is definitely bittersweet sweet

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.890 
and that is definitely bittersweet sweet
in<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.489> sense<00:03:18.730> that<00:03:18.849> I<00:03:18.970> can<00:03:19.090> run<00:03:19.419> pick<00:03:19.750> and

in the sense that I can run pick and

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.569 
in the sense that I can run pick and
rolls<00:03:20.109> because<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.530> love<00:03:20.859> running<00:03:21.130> a<00:03:21.310> lot<00:03:21.459> of

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
rolls because I love running a lot of

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.099 
rolls because I love running a lot of
pick<00:03:21.730> and<00:03:21.880> rolls<00:03:22.060> but<00:03:22.329> it<00:03:22.480> just<00:03:22.630> gets<00:03:22.780> a<00:03:22.959> little

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
pick and rolls but it just gets a little

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.140 
pick and rolls but it just gets a little
bit<00:03:23.319> repetitive<00:03:23.859> when<00:03:24.400> you're<00:03:24.549> watching<00:03:25.030> me

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
bit repetitive when you're watching me

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.729 
bit repetitive when you're watching me
just<00:03:25.480> going<00:03:25.660> for<00:03:25.930> pick<00:03:26.169> and<00:03:26.319> rolls<00:03:26.470> all<00:03:26.709> the

just going for pick and rolls all the

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.849 
just going for pick and rolls all the
time<00:03:27.130> and<00:03:27.370> bitter<00:03:28.060> because<00:03:28.720> it<00:03:28.930> disrupts<00:03:29.709> the

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
time and bitter because it disrupts the

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.099 
time and bitter because it disrupts the
spacing<00:03:30.519> on<00:03:30.639> the<00:03:30.669> court<00:03:31.120> even<00:03:31.569> though<00:03:31.840> we<00:03:32.079> just

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
spacing on the court even though we just

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.900 
spacing on the court even though we just
