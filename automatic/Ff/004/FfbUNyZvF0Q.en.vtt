00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello everyone for this new video 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.410
 I will introduce you to four exercises 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.599
 of sheathing so these exercises have a 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.250
 great interest for runners because 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.620
 that in fact they will allow you to 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.190
 strengthen and solidify in some 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.930
 so the center of your body and by 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.300
 therefore you will be able to improve 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.460
 your posture is also your stride 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.980
 which will be much more economical because in 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.279
 done on every ground impact you have 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.779
 - you crush you did it so it's 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.619
 I present to you immediately the 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.230
 first exercise 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.290
 so you go to the ground 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.090
 forearms on the mat you 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.460
 hear your legs and you go 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.559
 maintain the so-called position 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.149
 the plank drive so if 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.309
 exercise is too difficult you 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.160
 can simply put your knees at 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.480
 ground and maintain the position so the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.090
 important instructions are they always 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.430
 searched for you self grow keep your 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.710
 back straight do not have buttocks 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.430
 too much you read too low so a good 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.970
 head alignment columns and ponds and 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.100
 you breathe deeply when you 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.090
 sufficiently master this exercise you 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.490
 can add a little bit of 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.000
 difficulties in suppressing supports 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.369
 so for example here you just take off 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.860
 a foot and you hold you can 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.770
 do the same thing of course 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.049
 the other side through this exercise you 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.360
 have really strengthen the chain 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.950
 previous important to keep a good 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.119
 balance between the muscle chains 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.659
 he will also have to you makes 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.130
 force the posterior chain so you 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.140
 have this time lying on the 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.290
 back so the feet are width of the 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.250
 pelvis knees stay well in the lax 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.350
 is simply you are coming 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.149
 do an extension of lenche one you 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.149
 take off the buttocks of the carpet and you 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.119
 will maintain the position so very 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.229
 importantly tighten the buttocks 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.299
 maintain a good alignment between your 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.420
 thighs and your spine and 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.290
 you hold the position 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.119
 this one is a little easier 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.490
 that exercise I do not show you 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.450
 previously so do not hesitate if you 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.429
 need to spread a little bit 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.869
 a little bit off the heels of your 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.950
 buttocks to make the exercise a little 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.810
 little more difficult 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.310
 you can also if you 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.599
 want to delete to support so 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.500
 again if you make 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.040
 exercise is a little bit more 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.470
 difficult 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.349
 the priority is to good posture so 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.550
 especially keep a straight back and a 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.269
 good alignment at your level 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.400
 joints 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.650
 so here both exercises have reinforced 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.470
 the anterior and posterior chain for 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.930
 the side chains you are going to ask 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.319
 your forearm perpendicular ground 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.140
 to your body then you will take off 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.459
 also in plank position so 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.980
 this exercise is a little bit more 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.150
 difficult as the exercises for the 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.950
 anterior and posterior chain 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.140
 so do not worry if you hold 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.540
 a little less long even 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.700
 set good alignment head columns 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.370
 basin I'm always looking for 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.750
 to grow up I breathe deeply and to 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.530
 from the moment I get over to 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.620
 hold the position 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.260
 it's time to relax very important 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.290
 do the exercise on each side and 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.849
 do the same time right and left 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.819
 so for example if left you hold 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:18.160
 20 seconds and to the right you are 25 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.720
 seconds keep for the series 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.069
 following 20 seconds on both sides this 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.959
 that if you always keep a time 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.299
 superior on one side or the other 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.040
 you maintain an imbalance between your 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.130
 muscle chains and in the long run 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.930
 it can cause injury 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.540
 for more information on the pond 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.250
 keeping on the number of series how 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.060
 program these exercises into your 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.680
 planning 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.410
 remember to log on to the site 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.639

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:48.269
 we'll meet again very soon for 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.269
