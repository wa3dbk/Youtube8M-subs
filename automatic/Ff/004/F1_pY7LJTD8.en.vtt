00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.149
 Hello everyone and welcome one more day to 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.730
 my channel in today's video has something 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:13.309
 a tutorial on how to make pasta 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.180
 relief to use with the stencil 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.950
 just to make funds the truth is that 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.020
 it's very simple to do and it 's super 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.439
 economic this tutorial of I do because 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.079
 a girl asked me for facebook 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.960
 to know how it was done exactly and 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:32.450
 well I leave it to you as I do it as no 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.680
 It suits me very well 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.430
 I like the personal thing a lot 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.430
 result 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.960
 because it was the first thing that made him lose 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.960
 this here is already noticing something more 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.400
 on the site 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:55.180
 The materials that we will need are 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.180
 Water 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:03.100
 we are also going to need powders from 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.780
 baby talc of this laid the 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.620
 they bought bazaars the truth is that they go 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.530
 very very well 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:13.740
 then we will need but in everything 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:16.670
 white this also meets the bazaar 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.729
 and finally 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.799
 white paint because sometimes the 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.470
 powders remain as a grayish color 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:30.680
 so I will use white paint 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.680
 a spoon to put everything together very well 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.289
 a container makes it possible for 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.850
 hermetic so that when we do and 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:43.579
 we have it in a lot of time not 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.369
 dry I use this I bought it 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.170
 in the marÃ­a market at 13 and as you see is 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.579
 tiny and it gave me pretty good here 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.270
 then keeping always that I have done it 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.500
 so let's go with the tutorial first thing 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.500
 what we are going to do is measure two 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.500
 Tablespoons of well-filled talcum powder 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.200
 and then three tablespoons of glue 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.200
 White 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.929
 as he says he will not hear us 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.030
 we will start to move very well 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.350
 now as you see has been left with a color 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:35.030
 grayish clear so it's time to 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.980
 add white paint 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.630
 if in our case he has not had that 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.209
 color has remained white because it would not 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.510
 we need to do this step but good now 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.510
 we go 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.640
 and I would be ready to use 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.379
 As you can see I get a lot more to tell you 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.019
 that if you have been too thick 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.939
 It is time to pour water and 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.260
 you have to go very slowly 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.480
 because if it would not be too liquid and 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.450
 you would have to take powder again 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.239
 talc then very slowly and at 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.019
 otherwise that has remained very liquid 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.370
 and you can continue to powder talcum powder 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.680
 until you like the consistency and 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.860
 maybe more or less firm to be able 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.840
 use it 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.400
 and remember whenever you have to 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.420
 keep it very well communal and 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.220
 previously in an airtight container 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.710
 what 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.390
 we are going to secretar the quick does not last a 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.160
 little bit more of time and well I hope that 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.940
 I really liked this tutorial as 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:46.770
 abr efe is very serious and see you in the 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.770
 next a huge baby kiss
