00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.109
 hello how about my people or are I going to 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.600
 teach how to upload the fps of your village 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.130
 san andreas to the maximum the maximum 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.870
 can have 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.300
 well first you have to go to the link that 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.930
 I'll leave you in the description is 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.930
 dead line 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.480
 wait about five seconds 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.480
 and they give him up to be advertising 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.510
 and then they give you here the button that says 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.540
 is online and start the download only 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.310
 weighs new megabytes 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.310
 they left them radical file 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.220
 we'll see 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.750
 right click and extract here is going to 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.750
 leave this folder upload 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.829
 and there will be a folder that says more apps 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.140
 it's by day and magic 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:03.019
 and they enter the folder that started this 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.019
 san andrÃ©s and copy everything there 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:11.900
 then abandoned ugt a game 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:21.469
 and what you get here I'll stick why 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.469
 because Miguel does not need to have 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.560
 then they go to the other folder and the areas 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.460
 star minis and corvera of the star 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.460
 and they stick it 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.140
 Y 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.490
 and they stay there 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.890
 then in the folder at that moment that 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.590
 they copy that this is to remove the smoke 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.860
 they copy it and they go to the mobile folder of their 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.860
 gta 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.719
 and they stick it 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.470
 if they want to lower the quality of the cars 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.450
 that's only if he has very low pepe 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.980
 ok this raises too much the quality of 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.330
 the cars and has many I do not know 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.330
 I recommend but if they do not have 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.760
 and fuck 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.540
 installed 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.540
 in the models folder 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.810
 and it hits 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.290
 ok we'll stay that the next thing will be 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.660
 and install the game booster 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.830
 I believe that 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.830
 fuck 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:05.200
 the game booster coop in the file that 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:09.030
 it's called san andreas fps and they stick it 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.030
 also where they have their people installed 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.350
 ok read 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.349
 then file that is released round it 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.930
 they can send a hangar direct access 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:32.200
 to the desk that's for when they give 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.239
 double click your toupee is going to release more 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.700
 quick to put faster but 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:41.569
 put him then they have to open that 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.569
 now we go 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.480
 good 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.640
 following 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.020
 execute that at your end it 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.650
 install fast 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.800
 ok here choose hold to the multi of 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.500
 facto 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.690
 and configure 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.180
 and here they select all those present 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.079
 everyone 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.079
 absolutely 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:28.660
 good 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.030
 Y 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.480
 and they give him to apply and for the game what 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.700
 they select and woods to run whenever 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.160
 they are going to open the game they have to open 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.650
 trick them and run it with the game 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.780
 booster 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.780
 but before opening the game 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:52.019
 and add the file of copies 

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:52.019
 efe 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:59.710
 and they can in 14 and then open hold 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:02.160
 arc and ready sandra row 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.940
 now for 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.269
 to increase your branch a click team 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.829
 right properties 

00:05:08.269 --> 00:05:12.000
 advanced system configuration I think 

00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:15.340
 that way 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.250
 performance configuration 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.729
 advanced and here I'm going to virtual you're going 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.529
 to change 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:25.339
 and this is going to understand it up here 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:27.830
 they are going to custom size they take it away 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:30.620
 for a custom size and they put the 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.499
 size that is recommended if you upload it 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.110
 much less will it work they have to 

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:38.749
 put it in the recommended as I have 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.839
 a woman in 8 gigs puts me recommended 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:44.389
 12,000 megabytes that would be 12 gigs and 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:45.889
 they give it to establish and accept and it's going to 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:48.050
 ask to restart the computer and the 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:51.349
 restart 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.540
 and now the last parents those who have 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:55.430
 nvidia card 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.910
 and open the driver for the data with 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.910
 envy 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:05.219
 where he says establish three of 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:13.270
 you can adjust the configuration of the 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.400
 previewed image they download it to the 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.870
 middle lesson and put it minimal where 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.790
 says performance 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:23.830
 and here find the configuration 3 of 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.830
 put everything where it says 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:31.480
 well this was all friends I hope you
