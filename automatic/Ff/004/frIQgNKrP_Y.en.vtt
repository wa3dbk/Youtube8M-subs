of<00:00:07.529> all<00:00:07.649> here<00:00:08.420> I'm<00:00:09.420> going<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.719> talk<00:00:09.870> about<00:00:09.900> the

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
of all here I'm going to talk about the

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.039 
of all here I'm going to talk about the
wiring<00:00:11.580> on<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.910> tractor<00:00:12.420> for<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.780> wind

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
wiring on the tractor for the wind

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.500 
wiring on the tractor for the wind
chechi<00:00:13.940> and<00:00:14.940> as<00:00:15.389> when<00:00:15.509> he<00:00:15.660> got<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.619> made<00:00:17.160> this

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
chechi and as when he got is I made this

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.630 
chechi and as when he got is I made this
little<00:00:18.510> bracket<00:00:18.869> with<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> controller<00:00:20.310> on<00:00:20.609> it

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
little bracket with a controller on it

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.099 
little bracket with a controller on it
for<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.119> wind<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:23.060> basically<00:00:24.060> you've<00:00:24.390> got<00:00:24.420> a

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
for the wind and basically you've got a

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.589 
for the wind and basically you've got a
red<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.920> black<00:00:26.130> wire<00:00:26.490> coming<00:00:26.760> off<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.240> it

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
red and a black wire coming off of it

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.919 
red and a black wire coming off of it
they<00:00:27.869> go<00:00:28.050> directly<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.769> battery<00:00:29.900> to<00:00:30.900> power

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
they go directly to the battery to power

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.590 
they go directly to the battery to power
the<00:00:31.320> switch<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.099> then<00:00:32.759> you've<00:00:33.180> got<00:00:33.420> another

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the switch and then you've got another

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.940 
the switch and then you've got another
two<00:00:34.230> red<00:00:34.530> or<00:00:35.130> another<00:00:35.910> red<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.390> black<00:00:36.540> wire

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
two red or another red and black wire

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.690 
two red or another red and black wire
that<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.910> for<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.290> push<00:00:40.559> button<00:00:40.980> up<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.460> down

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
that is for the push button up and down

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.420 
that is for the push button up and down
and<00:00:42.059> that's<00:00:42.960> basically<00:00:43.410> about<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:44.070> it's

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
and that's basically about it it's

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.830 
and that's basically about it it's
pretty<00:00:44.670> simple<00:00:45.149> wiring

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
pretty simple wiring

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.529 
pretty simple wiring
um<00:00:46.590> I've<00:00:47.070> got<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.460> two<00:00:47.640> red<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.030> black<00:00:48.210> going

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
um I've got the two red and black going

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.590 
um I've got the two red and black going
down<00:00:48.899> through<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.649> frame<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.430> down<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
down through the frame and down to the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.810 
down through the frame and down to the
winch<00:00:51.870> underneath<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:53.039> foot<00:00:53.370> pedal<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:55.820> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
winch underneath this foot pedal and the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.330 
winch underneath this foot pedal and the
other<00:00:56.910> wires<00:00:57.270> are<00:00:57.539> just<00:00:57.719> ran<00:00:57.930> underneath<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
other wires are just ran underneath the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.570 
other wires are just ran underneath the
hood<00:01:00.020> into<00:01:01.020> where<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> battery<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:03.019> um<00:01:04.580> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
hood into where the battery is um the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.649 
hood into where the battery is um the
next<00:01:05.760> thing<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:07.400> um<00:01:08.400> I've<00:01:09.180> had<00:01:09.450> some

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
next thing is is um I've had some

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.590 
next thing is is um I've had some
questions<00:01:10.229> on<00:01:10.799> how<00:01:11.490> about<00:01:11.670> when<00:01:12.090> skate<00:01:12.420> was

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
questions on how about when skate was

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.310 
questions on how about when skate was
hooked<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:14.150> really<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.299> pretty<00:01:15.600> simple

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
hooked up and really it's pretty simple

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.670 
hooked up and really it's pretty simple
you've<00:01:17.250> got<00:01:17.549> your<00:01:17.790> winch<00:01:18.290> located<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
you've got your winch located to the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.550 
you've got your winch located to the
frame<00:01:20.240> it's<00:01:21.240> actually<00:01:21.630> bolted<00:01:22.049> on<00:01:22.200> there<00:01:22.439> with

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
frame it's actually bolted on there with

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.109 
frame it's actually bolted on there with
a<00:01:22.590> pizza<00:01:23.009> angle<00:01:23.400> iron<00:01:23.580> um<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.990> actually<00:01:25.229> had<00:01:25.619> to

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
a pizza angle iron um I actually had to

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.929 
a pizza angle iron um I actually had to
take<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.330> body<00:01:27.570> off<00:01:27.750> temporarily<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:29.400> mount

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
take the body off temporarily to mount

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.120 
take the body off temporarily to mount
the<00:01:30.150> pizza<00:01:30.450> angler<00:01:30.900> into<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.290> frame<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.950> order

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the pizza angler into the frame in order

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.620 
the pizza angler into the frame in order
to<00:01:32.369> drill<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> holes<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.090> had<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.329> take<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
to drill the holes I had to take the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.170 
to drill the holes I had to take the
body<00:01:33.840> off<00:01:34.189> so<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.400> was<00:01:35.520> kind<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.790> wood<00:01:35.970> bits

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
body off so that was kind of wood bits

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.890 
body off so that was kind of wood bits
the<00:01:36.450> first<00:01:36.720> time<00:01:37.049> but<00:01:37.470> after<00:01:37.970> that<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.270> good

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
the first time but after that it's good

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.030 
the first time but after that it's good
and<00:01:40.470> then<00:01:41.369> basically<00:01:42.350> you've<00:01:43.350> got<00:01:43.590> your<00:01:43.740> winch

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
and then basically you've got your winch

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.170 
and then basically you've got your winch
cable<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.350> goes<00:01:46.649> all<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.950> way

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
cable and that goes all the way

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.160 
cable and that goes all the way
underneath<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:49.320> front<00:01:49.619> axle<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:51.110> I<00:01:52.110> don't

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
underneath the front axle and I don't

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.960 
underneath the front axle and I don't
know<00:01:52.290> if<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.500> can<00:01:52.680> see<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.729> goes

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
know if you can see that but it goes

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.020 
know if you can see that but it goes
underneath<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.570> front<00:01:54.840> axle<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.590> then<00:01:56.490> up<00:01:56.850> in

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
underneath the front axle and then up in

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.870 
underneath the front axle and then up in
there<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.710> where<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.950> original<00:01:59.119> um<00:02:01.880> manual

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
there is where the original um manual

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.560 
there is where the original um manual
hand<00:02:03.689> lifts<00:02:04.229> would<00:02:04.710> usually<00:02:04.950> hook<00:02:05.340> up<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.850> I

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
hand lifts would usually hook up and I

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.180 
hand lifts would usually hook up and I
just<00:02:06.810> took<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.229> bar<00:02:07.500> out<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.710> there<00:02:08.009> and

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
just took that bar out of there and

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.880 
just took that bar out of there and
instead

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
instead

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.000 
instead
I<00:02:09.300> hooked<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.539> winch<00:02:10.750> cable<00:02:10.899> to<00:02:11.560> that<00:02:11.590> little

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
I hooked the winch cable to that little

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.040 
I hooked the winch cable to that little
thing<00:02:12.790> up<00:02:12.970> there<00:02:13.180> you<00:02:13.360> can't<00:02:13.630> see<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:13.959> on

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
thing up there you can't see it on

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.830 
thing up there you can't see it on
camera<00:02:14.319> but<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:15.069> know<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:15.850> I<00:02:15.940> talk<00:02:16.180> you'll
