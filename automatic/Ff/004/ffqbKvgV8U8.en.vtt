I've died from trying to reload and it's

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.929 
I've died from trying to reload and it's
just<00:01:34.590> not<00:01:34.740> reloaded<00:01:35.070> quick<00:01:35.310> enough<00:01:35.579> they

reload a lot faster and when you just
press<00:01:45.570> X<00:01:45.840> once<00:01:46.229> what<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.070> thing<00:01:47.310> about<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.700> if

you double tap ex you will lose all the
ammo<00:01:49.799> thats<00:01:50.220> left<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.180> clip<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.780> tend

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
ammo thats left in that clip so I tend

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.389 
ammo thats left in that clip so I tend
to<00:01:52.079> do<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.259> when<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.500> have<00:01:52.710> about<00:01:52.920> one<00:01:53.159> or<00:01:53.340> two

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
to do is when I have about one or two

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.609 
to do is when I have about one or two
bullets<00:01:54.119> left<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.479> when<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.750> quickly<00:01:55.110> reload

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
bullets left is when I quickly reload

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.590 
bullets left is when I quickly reload
but<00:01:56.189> if<00:01:56.399> I'm<00:01:56.549> an<00:01:56.670> hour<00:01:56.790> very<00:01:57.240> dangerous

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
but if I'm an hour very dangerous

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.209 
but if I'm an hour very dangerous
situation<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.229> need<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.530> reload<00:01:58.770> burberry

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
situation and I need to reload burberry

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.980 
situation and I need to reload burberry
fast<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.610> don't<00:01:59.850> care<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.210> use<00:02:00.570> double<00:02:00.840> tough

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
fast I don't care I use double tough

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.899 
fast I don't care I use double tough
eggs<00:02:01.229> we<00:02:01.469> don't<00:02:01.649> think<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.219> get<00:02:02.549> back<00:02:02.610> to

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
eggs we don't think and get back to

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.880 
eggs we don't think and get back to
getting<00:02:03.119> my<00:02:03.299> kills<00:02:03.630> but<00:02:04.259> if<00:02:04.439> you're<00:02:04.619> not<00:02:04.860> a

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
getting my kills but if you're not a

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.830 
getting my kills but if you're not a
desperate<00:02:05.369> situation<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:06.149> way<00:02:06.390> too<00:02:06.450> gets

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
desperate situation is way too gets

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.510 
desperate situation is way too gets
about<00:02:06.990> two<00:02:07.320> or<00:02:07.500> three<00:02:07.799> bullets<00:02:08.129> left<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
about two or three bullets left in the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.200 
about two or three bullets left in the
clip<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:09.060> double<00:02:09.390> tap<00:02:09.539> eggs<00:02:09.750> and

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
clip in double tap eggs and

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.450 
clip in double tap eggs and
a<00:02:10.240> lot<00:02:10.930> faster<00:02:11.440> but<00:02:11.950> if<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:12.130> want<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.370> do

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
a lot faster but if you want to do

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.790 
a lot faster but if you want to do
single<00:02:12.880> tap<00:02:13.360> eggs<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:13.960> that's<00:02:14.140> ok<00:02:14.530> as<00:02:14.590> well

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
single tap eggs and that's ok as well

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.530 
single tap eggs and that's ok as well
but<00:02:14.950> double<00:02:15.250> tap<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.520> eggs<00:02:15.670> allows<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.420> to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
but double tap and eggs allows you to

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.090 
but double tap and eggs allows you to
read<00:02:16.660> out<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:16.930> lot<00:02:17.290> faster<00:02:17.320> than<00:02:17.800> one<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.040> just

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
read out a lot faster than one you just

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.460 
read out a lot faster than one you just
tap<00:02:18.490> it<00:02:18.520> once<00:02:18.880> next<00:02:19.450> thing<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.630> do<00:02:19.780> is<00:02:19.960> a<00:02:20.080> class

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
tap it once next thing to do is a class

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.590 
tap it once next thing to do is a class
so<00:02:20.710> now<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.100> class<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.520> matters<00:02:21.940> quite<00:02:22.240> a<00:02:22.300> lot

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
so now the class of matters quite a lot

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.670 
so now the class of matters quite a lot
i'm<00:02:22.690> going<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:22.960> show<00:02:23.020> you<00:02:23.080> guys<00:02:23.260> kind<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.590> an

i'm going to show you guys kind of an

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.500 
i'm going to show you guys kind of an
example<00:02:23.770> of<00:02:24.280> things<00:02:24.820> you<00:02:25.030> want<00:02:25.210> to<00:02:25.240> have<00:02:25.390> in

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
example of things you want to have in

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.240 
example of things you want to have in
your<00:02:25.540> class<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.140> allow<00:02:26.350> you<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.530> stay<00:02:26.860> alive

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
your class that allow you to stay alive

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.670 
your class that allow you to stay alive
a<00:02:27.490> lot<00:02:27.700> longer<00:02:27.760> this<00:02:28.540> isn't<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:28.960> class<00:02:29.200> so<00:02:29.380> this

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
a lot longer this isn't a class so this

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.710 
a lot longer this isn't a class so this
is<00:02:29.830> just<00:02:30.100> things<00:02:30.640> in<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.940> class<00:02:31.240> that<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:31.540> guys

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
is just things in a class that you guys

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.480 
is just things in a class that you guys
need<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:31.930> do<00:02:32.140> in<00:02:32.470> your<00:02:32.680> own<00:02:32.710> custom<00:02:33.250> classes

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
need to do in your own custom classes

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.370 
need to do in your own custom classes
that<00:02:34.030> allow<00:02:34.240> you<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:34.390> stay<00:02:34.630> alive<00:02:34.960> a<00:02:35.140> lot

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
longer than I let's tickle at the class

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.580 
longer than I let's tickle at the class
now<00:02:37.090> for<00:02:37.240> the<00:02:37.300> weapon<00:02:37.570> I<00:02:37.630> put<00:02:37.810> about<00:02:38.020> 27

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
said this is an exact class job it's

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.340 
said this is an exact class job it's
just<00:02:42.340> an<00:02:42.430> example<00:02:42.580> now<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.600> want<00:02:43.960> to<00:02:44.110> pressure

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
just an example now you want to pressure

lot is the blast pressure of users in
all<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.400> classes<00:03:45.520> I've<00:03:45.910> done<00:03:46.090> so<00:03:46.270> far<00:03:46.300> it's<00:03:46.810> a

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
all the classes I've done so far it's a

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
very very important to have in this game

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.960 
very very important to have in this game
because<00:03:49.330> it<00:03:50.050> moves<00:03:50.620> everything<00:03:51.100> you<00:03:51.370> do<00:03:51.580> with

because it moves everything you do with
your<00:03:52.230> exosuit<00:03:53.230> on<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.860> map<00:03:54.040> if<00:03:54.190> you<00:03:54.220> blast<00:03:54.640> on

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
your exosuit on the map if you blast on

your exosuit on the map if you blast on
with<00:03:55.000> your<00:03:55.120> blast<00:03:55.420> booze<00:03:55.690> whatever<00:03:56.050> it<00:03:56.200> is

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
you're doing it won't be seen on them up

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.540 
you're doing it won't be seen on them up
and<00:03:58.780> that's<00:03:58.960> very<00:03:59.320> very<00:03:59.590> important<00:04:00.430> because

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
and that's very very important because

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.220 
and that's very very important because
it<00:04:00.850> allows<00:04:00.880> you<00:04:01.330> to<00:04:01.450> stay<00:04:01.720> hidden<00:04:01.930> and

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
it allows you to stay hidden and

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.320 
it allows you to stay hidden and
therefore<00:04:02.890> that<00:04:03.040> enhances<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:03.880> time<00:04:04.150> you

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
therefore that enhances the time you

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.290 
therefore that enhances the time you
have<00:04:04.480> alive<00:04:04.990> next<00:04:05.830> is<00:04:05.950> hardwired<00:04:06.490> this<00:04:07.030> allows

have alive next is hardwired this allows

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.030 
have alive next is hardwired this allows
you<00:04:07.420> to<00:04:07.510> be<00:04:07.630> immune<00:04:07.990> to<00:04:08.020> system<00:04:08.560> hacking<00:04:08.860> stuff

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
you to be immune to system hacking stuff

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.770 
you to be immune to system hacking stuff
like<00:04:09.280> that<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.790> thing<00:04:10.060> about<00:04:10.090> assistant<00:04:10.630> mark
