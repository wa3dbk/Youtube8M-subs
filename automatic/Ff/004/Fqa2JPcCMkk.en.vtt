00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
couple videos which are made it's just

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.020 
couple videos which are made it's just
that<00:00:36.719> you're<00:00:37.350> when<00:00:37.800> you're<00:00:37.920> going<00:00:38.129> into<00:00:38.399> arena

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
that you're when you're going into arena

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.970 
that you're when you're going into arena
that<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:40.020> got<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> little<00:00:40.710> arena<00:00:41.670> rate<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.480> can

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
that you got a little arena rate I can

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.130 
that you got a little arena rate I can
just<00:00:43.980> above<00:00:44.219> your<00:00:44.280> head<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.090> can<00:00:45.629> see<00:00:45.870> when

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
just above your head so you can see when

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.790 
just above your head so you can see when
your<00:00:46.260> maid<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.590> behind<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.070> wall<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.960> it<00:00:48.960> gives

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
your maid is behind a wall and it gives

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.580 
your maid is behind a wall and it gives
you<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> little<00:00:50.219> advantage<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.329> think<00:00:51.590> it's

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
you a little advantage and I think it's

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.760 
you a little advantage and I think it's
pretty<00:00:52.860> cool<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.820> changes<00:00:54.289> automatically<00:00:55.289> and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
pretty cool it changes automatically and

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.139 
pretty cool it changes automatically and
it<00:00:56.340> always<00:00:56.789> sets<00:00:57.510> itself<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.160> think<00:00:59.550> that's

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
it always sets itself so I think that's

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.910 
it always sets itself so I think that's
pretty<00:01:00.420> cool<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:00.989> just<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.320> little<00:01:01.469> gimmick

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
pretty cool it's just a little gimmick

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.160 
pretty cool it's just a little gimmick
but<00:01:02.579> it's<00:01:02.850> pretty<00:01:03.120> useful<00:01:05.330> ok<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.630> next<00:01:06.659> add

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
but it's pretty useful ok the next add

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.010 
but it's pretty useful ok the next add
on<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.439> I'm<00:01:07.830> talking<00:01:08.400> about<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:09.020> custom

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
the next add on that I wanted to talk

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.320 
the next add on that I wanted to talk
about<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:06.290> lui<00:02:07.290> it's<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:09.679> UI<00:02:11.209> that<00:02:12.209> i'm

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
about is lui it's a the UI that i'm

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.590 
about is lui it's a the UI that i'm
using<00:02:12.690> right<00:02:12.720> now<00:02:12.930> it's

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
using right now it's

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.730 
using right now it's
just<00:02:13.750> in<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:14.110> small<00:02:14.560> atom<00:02:14.950> which<00:02:16.230> makes<00:02:17.230> will<00:02:17.620> of

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
just in a small atom which makes will of

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.380 
just in a small atom which makes will of
warcraft<00:02:18.160> just<00:02:19.000> look<00:02:19.240> a<00:02:19.420> bit<00:02:19.720> more<00:02:20.460> HD<00:02:21.460> and<00:02:21.910> a

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
warcraft just look a bit more HD and a

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.250 
warcraft just look a bit more HD and a
bit<00:02:22.630> more<00:02:22.810> qualitative<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:24.990> yeah<00:02:25.990> i<00:02:26.020> think

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
bit more qualitative and yeah i think

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.350 
bit more qualitative and yeah i think
it's<00:02:26.770> pretty<00:02:27.010> cool<00:02:27.250> with<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.610> animations

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
it's pretty cool with the animations

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.710 
it's pretty cool with the animations
especially<00:02:29.020> for<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.560> health<00:02:30.310> bars<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:31.270> the

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
especially for the health bars and the

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.360 
especially for the health bars and the
3d<00:02:32.470> portray<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.990> yeah<00:02:34.990> it's<00:02:35.350> pretty<00:02:35.710> useful<00:02:36.010> i

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
3d portray and yeah it's pretty useful i

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.370 
3d portray and yeah it's pretty useful i
think<00:02:36.670> it's<00:02:37.000> it's<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:39.160> makes<00:02:39.430> well<00:02:39.880> more<00:02:40.630> good

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
think it's it's it makes well more good

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.710 
think it's it's it makes well more good
looking<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:42.100> I<00:02:42.250> think<00:02:42.670> when<00:02:43.360> you're<00:02:43.480> playing

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
looking and I think when you're playing

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.350 
looking and I think when you're playing

this game for so long like I do for

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.350 
this game for so long like I do for
eight<00:02:46.480> years<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:49.510> want<00:02:49.720> something<00:02:50.200> new<00:02:50.440> and

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
eight years you want something new and

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.570 
eight years you want something new and
this<00:02:52.360> Adam<00:02:52.750> totally<00:02:53.140> made<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.850> ok<00:02:54.850> next<00:02:55.510> one<00:02:56.580> ok

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
this Adam totally made it ok next one ok

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.880 
this Adam totally made it ok next one ok
the<00:02:57.910> next<00:02:57.940> Adam<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:59.110> next<00:02:59.350> Adam<00:02:59.680> is<00:02:59.920> only<00:03:00.450> CC

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
the next Adam the next Adam is only CC

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.040 
the next Adam the next Adam is only CC
it's<00:03:02.890> just<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.340> little<00:03:03.490> gimmick<00:03:03.910> that<00:03:03.940> makes<00:03:04.450> a

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
it's just a little gimmick that makes a

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.140 
it's just a little gimmick that makes a
small<00:03:05.530> countdown<00:03:06.100> on<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.520> spell<00:03:06.760> that<00:03:07.000> you

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
small countdown on the spell that you

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.050 
small countdown on the spell that you
just<00:03:07.510> used<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:08.110> I<00:03:09.070> think<00:03:09.340> it's<00:03:09.490> pretty<00:03:09.760> cool

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
just used and I think it's pretty cool

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.560 
just used and I think it's pretty cool
because<00:03:10.120> you<00:03:10.690> you're<00:03:11.260> just<00:03:11.290> not<00:03:11.680> having<00:03:11.950> this

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
because you you're just not having this

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.660 
because you you're just not having this
yeah<00:03:13.570> animation<00:03:14.230> which<00:03:14.560> shows<00:03:14.830> you<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:15.400> time

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
yeah animation which shows you the time

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.020 
yeah animation which shows you the time
on<00:03:16.210> yet<00:03:16.870> just<00:03:17.170> not<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.920> time<00:03:18.160> so<00:03:18.760> we<00:03:18.880> have<00:03:19.000> a

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
on yet just not the time so we have a

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.020 
on yet just not the time so we have a
little<00:03:19.390> counter<00:03:19.900> there<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.770> that's<00:03:21.370> cool<00:03:21.700> for

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
little counter there and that's cool for

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.590 
little counter there and that's cool for
for<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.540> one<00:03:22.720> shot<00:03:22.900> macro<00:03:22.960> and<00:03:24.210> as<00:03:25.210> you<00:03:25.390> see

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
for the one shot macro and as you see

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.070 
for the one shot macro and as you see
you<00:03:25.930> got<00:03:26.080> this<00:03:26.230> little<00:03:26.470> count<00:03:26.800> down<00:03:26.980> there<00:03:27.340> and

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
you got this little count down there and

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.100 
you got this little count down there and
yeah<00:03:29.080> that's<00:03:29.410> that's<00:03:30.040> pretty<00:03:30.220> cool<00:03:31.110> ok

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
yeah that's that's pretty cool ok

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.140 
yeah that's that's pretty cool ok
another<00:03:32.590> ad<00:03:33.070> on<00:03:33.220> that<00:03:33.430> I<00:03:33.460> wanted<00:03:33.790> to<00:03:33.850> mention

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
another ad on that I wanted to mention

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.150 
another ad on that I wanted to mention
is<00:03:34.810> play<00:03:35.290> buffs<00:03:35.650> it<00:03:36.100> shows<00:03:36.810> like<00:03:37.920> well<00:03:38.920> in

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
is play buffs it shows like well in

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160 
is play buffs it shows like well in
combination<00:03:39.790> with<00:03:39.820> tidy<00:03:40.330> plates<00:03:40.540> it<00:03:40.900> shows

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
combination with tidy plates it shows

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.150 
combination with tidy plates it shows
little<00:03:42.040> icons<00:03:42.730> about<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.330> enemy<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.140> I<00:03:44.950> think

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
little icons about the enemy and I think

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.370 
little icons about the enemy and I think
it's<00:03:45.280> pretty<00:03:45.430> useful<00:03:45.700> for<00:03:46.210> arenas<00:03:46.690> especially

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
it's pretty useful for arenas especially

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.370 
it's pretty useful for arenas especially
so<00:03:48.010> you<00:03:48.100> can<00:03:48.400> see<00:03:48.610> always<00:03:48.940> your<00:03:49.600> D<00:03:49.750> buffs<00:03:49.990> that
