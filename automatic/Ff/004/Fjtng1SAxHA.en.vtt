 two editions the pro and the limit this 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.770
 edition is not characterized by calling the 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.080
 attention as it brings us hearing aids or 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.080
 night vision lenses or a camera 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.170
 i 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.320
 we see the design of the soldier we see in 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.270
 the white box on the other side 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.180
 we see how the 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:30.310
 exoskeleton is very curly as it looks 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.310
 very futuristic and we open 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.000
 and we see that it contains everything that comes 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.640
 downloadable which is the card in the 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.310

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.910
 digital day zero is a multiplayer map 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.910

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:54.450
 and comes a season pass of 4 part s 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.640
 it would be a matter of trying to see what 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.640
 contains because for me this is new 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.450
 we see the art book that shows us 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.450
 with some images of the video game 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.780

 bombs weapons arsenal and much more 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.670
 that contains this little book 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.920
 so 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.260
 let's see how is this game and what 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.940
 that it contains is not bad but it does not 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.769
 compare nothing to the other editions 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.540
