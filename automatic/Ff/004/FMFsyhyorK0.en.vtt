while<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.640> did<00:01:11.970> Alex<00:01:12.299> Oh<00:01:12.479> could<00:01:13.020> have<00:01:13.110> been<00:01:13.200> a

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
while I did Alex Oh could have been a

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.429 
while I did Alex Oh could have been a
little<00:01:13.380> bit<00:01:13.619> longer<00:01:14.570> than<00:01:15.570> most<00:01:15.990> people<00:01:16.320> would

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
little bit longer than most people would

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.109 
little bit longer than most people would
have<00:01:16.530> taken<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.890> was<00:01:17.009> about<00:01:17.189> 4.5<00:01:17.880> mil

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
have taken it was about 4.5 mil

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.050 
have taken it was about 4.5 mil
experience<00:01:19.250> nevertheless<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.670> think<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.970> was

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
experience nevertheless I think it was

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.910 
experience nevertheless I think it was
worth<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.420> because<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.259> will<00:01:22.409> show<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.680> the

worth it because I will show you the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.740 
worth it because I will show you the
loop<00:01:23.100> right<00:01:23.490> now<00:01:24.439> mind<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:27.360> sum<00:01:27.689> of

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
loop right now mind you this the sum of

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.620 
loop right now mind you this the sum of
these<00:01:27.810> are<00:01:27.990> rough<00:01:28.170> approximations<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:29.630> had

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
these are rough approximations I had

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.230 
these are rough approximations I had
more<00:01:31.619> rooms<00:01:31.950> than<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.310> more<00:01:32.640> arrows<00:01:33.000> than

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
more rooms than this more arrows than

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.179 
more rooms than this more arrows than
this<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.470> didn't<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.829> didn't<00:01:35.040> want<00:01:35.159> to

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
this but I just didn't I didn't want to

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.890 
this but I just didn't I didn't want to
go<00:01:35.310> over<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.180> took<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.530> smaller<00:01:38.280> amount

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
go over so I just took a smaller amount

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.749 
go over so I just took a smaller amount
there<00:01:39.900> was<00:01:40.110> more<00:01:40.380> coal<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.799> know<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.400> used

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
there was more coal I know that I used

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.530 
there was more coal I know that I used
some<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.270> uh<00:01:43.640> more<00:01:44.640> herbs<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.149> sold<00:01:45.360> about

100k verbs i added 100k in there and the
money<00:01:49.200> here<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.770> from<00:01:50.189> random<00:01:51.119> events<00:01:51.390> that

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
money here is from random events that

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.910 
money here is from random events that
would<00:01:51.600> give<00:01:51.720> me<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:51.960> let's<00:01:52.170> say<00:01:52.229> 500<00:01:52.740> gold

more uncut but i decided to cut them
because<00:02:10.890> i<00:02:10.950> needed<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.280> 61

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
because i needed that 61

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.320 
because i needed that 61
crafting<00:02:12.260> for<00:02:12.290> limiters<00:02:13.010> so<00:02:13.670> I<00:02:13.700> did<00:02:13.970> cut<00:02:14.150> some

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
crafting for limiters so I did cut some

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.470

there's definitely more and I know I'm
going<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.819> think<00:02:19.909> of<00:02:20.030> some<00:02:20.090> stuff<00:02:20.420> that<00:02:20.659> I<00:02:21.349> got

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
going to think of some stuff that I got

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.640 
going to think of some stuff that I got
from<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.010> rand<00:02:22.190> events<00:02:22.549> later<00:02:22.930> but<00:02:23.930> this<00:02:24.470> is

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
from the rand events later but this is

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.160 
from the rand events later but this is
what<00:02:24.980> I<00:02:25.010> can<00:02:25.250> remember<00:02:26.000> for<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.900> most<00:02:27.080> part

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
what I can remember for the most part

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.960 
what I can remember for the most part
yes<00:02:27.530> all<00:02:27.769> these<00:02:27.920> feathers<00:02:28.280> I<00:02:28.310> didn't<00:02:28.670> have<00:02:28.760> any

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
yes all these feathers I didn't have any

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.520 
yes all these feathers I didn't have any
feathers<00:02:29.180> before<00:02:29.480> this<00:02:29.810> so<00:02:30.079> these<00:02:30.319> are<00:02:30.500> all

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
feathers before this so these are all

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.399 
feathers before this so these are all
from<00:02:30.950> them<00:02:31.209> mostly<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.360> maze<00:02:32.540> game<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:33.079> think

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
from them mostly the maze game I think

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.880 
from them mostly the maze game I think
only<00:02:33.829> the<00:02:34.010> maze<00:02:34.250> game<00:02:34.489> Tim<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.879> arrows<00:02:35.890> Cole

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
only the maze game Tim the arrows Cole

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.740 
only the maze game Tim the arrows Cole
mithril<00:02:37.430> those<00:02:37.940> are<00:02:38.060> all<00:02:38.120> from<00:02:38.269> the<00:02:38.360> maze<00:02:38.480> game

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
mithril those are all from the maze game

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.530 
mithril those are all from the maze game
also<00:02:39.049> the<00:02:39.349> runes<00:02:39.590> i<00:02:40.489> also<00:02:40.790> got<00:02:41.180> a<00:02:41.209> lot<00:02:41.510> of

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
also the runes i also got a lot of

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.920 
also the runes i also got a lot of
nature<00:02:42.170> wounds<00:02:42.440> from<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.540> mystery<00:02:44.540> boxes

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
nature wounds from the mystery boxes

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.770 
nature wounds from the mystery boxes
they<00:02:45.109> dropped<00:02:45.349> 20<00:02:45.680> at<00:02:45.859> a<00:02:45.920> time<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.400> so<00:02:47.030> that<00:02:47.629> I

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
they dropped 20 at a time and so that I

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.270 
they dropped 20 at a time and so that I
probably<00:02:47.959> got<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.260> couple<00:02:48.680> hundred<00:02:48.890> of<00:02:49.129> those

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
probably got a couple hundred of those

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.770 
probably got a couple hundred of those
and<00:02:49.519> that<00:02:49.640> would<00:02:49.940> definitely<00:02:50.299> add<00:02:50.569> to<00:02:50.690> the

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
and that would definitely add to the

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.449 
and that would definitely add to the
cash<00:02:50.930> pile<00:02:51.170> considering<00:02:51.680> they're<00:02:51.859> 300<00:02:52.129> each

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
cash pile considering they're 300 each

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.150 
cash pile considering they're 300 each
right<00:02:52.700> now<00:02:53.109> but<00:02:54.109> yeah<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:54.769> there<00:02:54.920> was<00:02:55.010> more

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
down by about a fifth maybe i would

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.839

guess<00:03:45.430> five<00:03:46.430> mil<00:03:46.699> experience<00:03:47.329> about<00:03:48.280> 3gp<00:03:49.280> /<00:03:49.459> XP

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849
