new Rising Star team and he may get
cannoned<00:00:28.080> here

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
cannoned here

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.080 
cannoned here
oh<00:00:28.640> is<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:30.949> it<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.160> there's<00:00:32.520> no<00:00:32.730> way<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.940> get

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
oh is this it is there's no way to get

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.319 
oh is this it is there's no way to get
inside<00:00:33.290> double<00:00:34.290> final<00:00:34.559> unblocked<00:00:35.030> and<00:00:36.030> if<00:00:36.270> you

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
inside double final unblocked and if you

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.150 
inside double final unblocked and if you
can<00:00:36.450> get<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.630> cannon<00:00:36.930> up<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.380> will<00:00:37.710> most

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
can get the cannon up you will most

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.630 
can get the cannon up you will most
likely<00:00:38.250> be<00:00:38.489> able<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.969> block<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.450> off<00:00:40.640> its

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
likely be able to block this off its

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.040 
likely be able to block this off its
gonna<00:00:41.760> make<00:00:41.910> an<00:00:42.030> additional<00:00:42.360> pylon<00:00:42.719> here<00:00:42.899> will

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
gonna make an additional pylon here will

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.729 
gonna make an additional pylon here will
he<00:00:43.110> make<00:00:43.260> one<00:00:43.410> more<00:00:43.559> oh<00:00:45.260> but<00:00:46.260> he<00:00:46.320> needs<00:00:46.500> enough

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
he make one more oh but he needs enough

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.889 
he make one more oh but he needs enough
resources<00:00:47.190> for<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:47.550> one<00:00:47.789> more<00:00:48.059> just<00:00:48.690> one

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
resources for just one more just one

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.330 
resources for just one more just one
more<00:00:48.930> pile<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.440> here<00:00:49.649> will<00:00:49.739> block<00:00:49.980> off<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
more pile on here will block off the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.850 
more pile on here will block off the
cannon<00:00:50.640> he<00:00:50.850> does<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.480> clutch<00:00:52.020> timing<00:00:52.649> and

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
cannon he does it in clutch timing and

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.270 
cannon he does it in clutch timing and
that<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.699> going<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.210> game<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.530> that

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
that is going to be game that is it that

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.720 
that is going to be game that is it that
is<00:00:56.460> checkmate<00:00:56.730> even<00:00:57.120> with<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.329> zealot<00:00:57.629> here

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
is checkmate even with the zealot here

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.610 
is checkmate even with the zealot here
pylon<00:00:59.730> getting<00:01:00.480> very<00:01:00.719> low<00:01:00.989> but<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> cannon

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
pylon getting very low but the cannon

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.860 
pylon getting very low but the cannon
getting<00:01:01.829> closer<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.460> second<00:01:03.030> cannon<00:01:03.210> comes<00:01:03.719> in

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
getting closer a second cannon comes in

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.090 
getting closer a second cannon comes in
here<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.110> block<00:01:04.320> which<00:01:04.530> means<00:01:04.559> he's<00:01:04.860> not<00:01:04.949> gonna

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
here to block which means he's not gonna

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.820 
here to block which means he's not gonna
be<00:01:05.159> else<00:01:05.280> around<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> first<00:01:05.850> one<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.650> is

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
be else around the first one and that is

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.289 
be else around the first one and that is
it<00:01:08.010> only<00:01:08.250> one<00:01:08.430> zealot<00:01:08.700> can<00:01:08.820> attack<00:01:09.090> at<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
it only one zealot can attack at the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.969 
it only one zealot can attack at the
time<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.659> probe<00:01:09.930> sneaks<00:01:10.409> his<00:01:10.560> way<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.799> here<00:01:10.920> to

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
time of probe sneaks his way in here to

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.039 
time of probe sneaks his way in here to
also<00:01:11.220> attack<00:01:11.670> zealots<00:01:12.479> targeted<00:01:12.900> first

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
also attack zealots targeted first

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.219 
also attack zealots targeted first
probes<00:01:13.979> going<00:01:14.250> down<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.540> ladies<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
probes going down and that ladies and

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.310 
probes going down and that ladies and
gentlemen<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.920> end<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:18.390> Moore's<00:01:18.810> run<00:01:19.170> in

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
gentlemen is the end of Moore's run in

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.190 
gentlemen is the end of Moore's run in
the<00:01:19.439> GSL<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.790> was<00:01:21.060> ended<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.479> shorter<00:01:21.840> than<00:01:21.990> 10

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
the GSL it was ended in shorter than 10

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.609 
the GSL it was ended in shorter than 10
minutes<00:01:23.360> that's<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.540> GG

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
minutes that's it GG

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.010 
minutes that's it GG
so<00:01:27.490> there's<00:01:27.789> a<00:01:27.850> lot<00:01:28.000> of<00:01:28.149> history<00:01:28.450> here<00:01:28.479> but<00:01:28.689> it

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
so there's a lot of history here but it

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.569 
so there's a lot of history here but it
doesn't<00:01:29.320> matter<00:01:29.439> because<00:01:29.590> Naniwa<00:01:30.159> knows<00:01:30.369> it's

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
doesn't matter because Naniwa knows it's

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.870 
doesn't matter because Naniwa knows it's
a<00:01:30.670> throwaway<00:01:30.939> game<00:01:31.359> and<00:01:31.810> here<00:01:32.590> comes<00:01:32.920> six

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
a throwaway game and here comes six

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.740 
a throwaway game and here comes six
