the<00:00:18.250> way<00:00:18.400> I<00:00:18.430> avoid<00:00:18.940> that<00:00:19.210> is<00:00:19.420> extreme

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
the way I avoid that is extreme

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.780 
the way I avoid that is extreme
conditioning<00:00:20.410> with<00:00:20.560> an<00:00:20.680> SMG<00:00:21.040> you<00:00:21.400> want<00:00:21.610> to<00:00:21.700> be

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:21.790 
conditioning with an SMG you want to be

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.040 
conditioning with an SMG you want to be
right<00:00:22.000> out<00:00:22.180> the<00:00:22.300> gate<00:00:22.330> and<00:00:22.599> you<00:00:22.689> want<00:00:22.869> to<00:00:22.960> be

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
right out the gate and you want to be

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.740 
right out the gate and you want to be
fast<00:00:23.380> so<00:00:24.130> by<00:00:24.430> putting<00:00:24.610> an<00:00:24.820> SMG<00:00:25.119> in<00:00:25.390> extreme

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
fast so by putting an SMG in extreme

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.950 
fast so by putting an SMG in extreme
conditioning<00:00:26.340> holding<00:00:27.340> forward<00:00:28.000> before<00:00:28.599> the

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
conditioning holding forward before the

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.839 
conditioning holding forward before the
game<00:00:29.140> even<00:00:29.170> starts<00:00:29.860> to<00:00:30.040> get<00:00:30.130> that<00:00:30.310> jump<00:00:30.669> and

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
game even starts to get that jump and

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:32.220 
game even starts to get that jump and
move<00:00:31.090> straight<00:00:31.360> across<00:00:31.660> to<00:00:31.960> avoid<00:00:32.200> getting

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
move straight across to avoid getting

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.380 
move straight across to avoid getting
killed<00:00:32.710> I<00:00:32.920> do<00:00:33.220> not<00:00:33.670> get<00:00:33.940> killed<00:00:34.180> by<00:00:34.360> that

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
killed I do not get killed by that

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.870 
killed I do not get killed by that
sniper<00:00:34.840> so<00:00:35.200> just<00:00:35.410> keep<00:00:35.530> that<00:00:35.590> in<00:00:35.770> mind<00:00:36.070> I'm

anyone<00:00:46.390> that's<00:00:46.629> rushing<00:00:46.989> it<00:00:47.109> smoke<00:00:47.829> is<00:00:48.039> going

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
anyone that's rushing it smoke is going

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.939 
anyone that's rushing it smoke is going
to<00:00:48.690> immobilize<00:00:49.690> that<00:00:49.929> sniper<00:00:50.260> on<00:00:50.440> the<00:00:50.469> far<00:00:50.739> end

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949

here we're gonna go to be again

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.939 
here we're gonna go to be again
eighty-nine<00:01:01.780> percent<00:01:01.809> they're<00:01:02.469> going<00:01:02.679> to<00:01:02.769> try

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
silencer on it because I'm not going to

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.850 
silencer on it because I'm not going to
be<00:01:07.240> rushing<00:01:07.570> across<00:01:07.690> and<00:01:08.230> this<00:01:08.320> is<00:01:08.470> a<00:01:08.500> good<00:01:08.680> way

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
be rushing across and this is a good way

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.610 
be rushing across and this is a good way
again<00:01:09.790> I<00:01:09.820> feel<00:01:10.120> smoke<00:01:10.540> to<00:01:10.720> immobilize<00:01:11.380> that

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
again I feel smoke to immobilize that

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.470 
again I feel smoke to immobilize that
sniper<00:01:11.920> at<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.190> far<00:01:12.400> end<00:01:12.580> actually<00:01:13.060> kind<00:01:13.420> of

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
sniper at the far end actually kind of

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.510 
sniper at the far end actually kind of
get<00:01:13.630> a<00:01:13.659> little<00:01:13.900> surprise<00:01:14.350> here<00:01:14.650> and<00:01:14.770> i<00:01:14.830> miss

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
get a little surprise here and i miss

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.679 
get a little surprise here and i miss
throw<00:01:15.880> my<00:01:16.180> grenade<00:01:17.310> anyway<00:01:18.310> so<00:01:19.030> that<00:01:19.210> smoke<00:01:19.509> is

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
throw my grenade anyway so that smoke is

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.020 
throw my grenade anyway so that smoke is
there<00:01:19.930> I<00:01:20.520> probably<00:01:21.520> going<00:01:21.700> to<00:01:21.790> end<00:01:21.850> up

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
there I probably going to end up

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.389 
there I probably going to end up
planting<00:01:22.540> because<00:01:23.409> he's<00:01:23.649> you<00:01:23.979> know<00:01:24.009> half<00:01:24.280> the

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
planting because he's you know half the

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:25.889 
planting because he's you know half the
time<00:01:24.579> the<00:01:24.729> King<00:01:24.939> don't<00:01:25.180> communicate<00:01:25.689> he's

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
time the King don't communicate he's

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.330 
time the King don't communicate he's
probably<00:01:26.110> thinking<00:01:26.259> his<00:01:26.590> teammate<00:01:26.950> did<00:01:27.130> that

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
probably thinking his teammate did that

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.789 
probably thinking his teammate did that
I<00:01:27.630> stayed<00:01:28.630> back<00:01:28.810> cuz<00:01:29.290> that<00:01:29.439> guy<00:01:29.619> obviously

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
I stayed back cuz that guy obviously

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.280 
I stayed back cuz that guy obviously
some<00:01:30.280> it's<00:01:30.579> a<00:01:30.610> little<00:01:30.820> bit<00:01:30.909> dangerous<00:01:31.170> now<00:01:32.170> I'm

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290

gonna<00:01:32.409> try<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:32.920> defuse<00:01:33.790> but<00:01:33.969> I<00:01:34.000> know<00:01:34.090> that

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
gonna try and defuse but I know that

snipers still at the far end there now I
nail<00:01:38.020> him<00:01:38.259> but<00:01:38.530> even<00:01:38.680> if<00:01:38.860> I<00:01:38.979> didn't<00:01:39.399> nail<00:01:39.640> him

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
nail him but even if I didn't nail him

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.149 
nail him but even if I didn't nail him
