not many people know how to trigger

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.570 
not many people know how to trigger
notice<00:05:22.500> how<00:05:22.620> he<00:05:22.680> said<00:05:22.949> that<00:05:23.130> he's<00:05:23.250> been<00:05:23.280> going

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
notice how he said that he's been going

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.820 
notice how he said that he's been going
into<00:05:23.910> the<00:05:24.030> US<00:05:24.360> servers<00:05:24.870> and<00:05:24.990> doing<00:05:25.229> the<00:05:25.380> secret

into the US servers and doing the secret
to<00:05:25.949> get<00:05:26.130> people's<00:05:26.520> reactions<00:05:27.060> so<00:05:27.660> I<00:05:27.690> presume

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
to get people's reactions so I presume

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.300 
to get people's reactions so I presume
that<00:05:28.139> this<00:05:28.410> is<00:05:28.590> something<00:05:28.919> that<00:05:29.039> one<00:05:29.280> person

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
that this is something that one person

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.159 
that this is something that one person
can<00:05:29.970> trigger<00:05:30.210> on<00:05:30.479> their<00:05:30.660> own<00:05:30.810> it<00:05:30.990> doesn't

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169

when<00:05:38.699> Alex<00:05:39.000> was<00:05:39.180> making<00:05:39.539> it<00:05:39.659> happen<00:05:39.780> so<00:05:40.380> what

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
when Alex was making it happen so what

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.560 
when Alex was making it happen so what
is<00:05:40.650> this<00:05:40.830> well<00:05:41.190> I<00:05:41.430> think<00:05:41.550> it's<00:05:42.150> a<00:05:42.330> massive

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
is this well I think it's a massive

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.770 
is this well I think it's a massive
Megalodon<00:05:43.320> giant<00:05:44.220> shark<00:05:44.520> thing<00:05:44.820> that<00:05:45.389> jumps

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
Megalodon giant shark thing that jumps

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.540 
Megalodon giant shark thing that jumps
out<00:05:45.900> of<00:05:45.930> the<00:05:46.050> water<00:05:46.199> or<00:05:46.650> swims<00:05:47.010> around<00:05:47.340> on

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
out of the water or swims around on

out of the water or swims around on
paracel<00:05:48.000> storm<00:05:48.030> I<00:05:48.539> just<00:05:49.110> haven't<00:05:49.440> figured<00:05:49.680> out

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
paracel storm I just haven't figured out

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:52.129 
paracel storm I just haven't figured out
how<00:05:50.099> to<00:05:50.159> trigger<00:05:50.520> it<00:05:50.760> yet<00:05:50.909> I<00:05:51.120> think<00:05:51.930> that<00:05:52.050> the

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
how to trigger it yet I think that the

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:53.839 
how to trigger it yet I think that the
two<00:05:52.320> Megalodon<00:05:52.830> references<00:05:53.370> I<00:05:53.460> mentioned

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:53.849 
two Megalodon references I mentioned

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:55.670 
two Megalodon references I mentioned
earlier<00:05:54.180> are<00:05:54.330> too<00:05:54.570> much<00:05:54.750> of<00:05:54.870> a<00:05:54.900> coincidence<00:05:55.110> to

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
earlier are too much of a coincidence to

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.070 
earlier are too much of a coincidence to
not<00:05:55.949> have<00:05:56.159> some<00:05:56.430> sort<00:05:56.460> of<00:05:56.699> significance<00:05:57.389> and<00:05:57.599> I

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
not have some sort of significance and I

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.510 
not have some sort of significance and I
think<00:05:58.320> that<00:05:58.470> dice<00:05:58.710> are<00:05:58.949> hinting<00:05:59.310> at<00:05:59.490> something

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
think that dice are hinting at something

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.330 
think that dice are hinting at something
and<00:06:00.240> they<00:06:00.389> basically<00:06:00.930> want<00:06:01.320> us<00:06:01.530> to<00:06:01.680> find<00:06:01.889> it<00:06:02.159> I

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
and they basically want us to find it I

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.460 
and they basically want us to find it I
spent<00:06:03.030> hours<00:06:03.389> on<00:06:03.539> every<00:06:03.780> map<00:06:03.960> looking<00:06:04.289> for

spent hours on every map looking for
Easter<00:06:04.770> eggs<00:06:04.830> I<00:06:05.130> found<00:06:05.159> nothing<00:06:05.760> behind<00:06:06.060> walls

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:06.449 
Easter eggs I found nothing behind walls

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.689 
Easter eggs I found nothing behind walls
or<00:06:06.810> secret<00:06:07.199> triggers<00:06:07.620> and<00:06:08.099> at<00:06:08.280> first<00:06:08.490> I

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 
or secret triggers and at first I

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:09.920 
or secret triggers and at first I
thought<00:06:08.849> that<00:06:08.909> Alex<00:06:09.180> was<00:06:09.539> talking<00:06:09.720> about

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
thought that Alex was talking about

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.510 
thought that Alex was talking about
rogue<00:06:10.320> transmission<00:06:10.560> because<00:06:11.310> of<00:06:11.430> the

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
rogue transmission because of the

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.070 
rogue transmission because of the
Jurassic<00:06:11.970> Park<00:06:12.240> goat<00:06:12.570> that<00:06:12.780> they've<00:06:12.900> got

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
Jurassic Park goat that they've got

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.320 
Jurassic Park goat that they've got
there<00:06:13.320> but<00:06:13.919> no<00:06:14.099> I<00:06:14.130> think<00:06:14.430> that<00:06:14.699> that's<00:06:14.909> just<00:06:15.090> a

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
there but no I think that that's just a

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.670 
there but no I think that that's just a
cheeky<00:06:15.630> prop<00:06:15.870> that<00:06:15.990> doesn't<00:06:16.260> really<00:06:16.409> do

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
cheeky prop that doesn't really do

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.800 
cheeky prop that doesn't really do
anything<00:06:16.919> so<00:06:17.550> I<00:06:17.580> think<00:06:17.729> it's<00:06:18.210> on<00:06:18.360> paracel

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
anything so I think it's on paracel

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.810 
anything so I think it's on paracel
storm<00:06:18.840> the<00:06:19.440> evidence<00:06:19.770> points<00:06:20.159> to<00:06:20.310> that<00:06:20.490> it's

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 
storm the evidence points to that it's

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.430 
storm the evidence points to that it's
one<00:06:21.150> of<00:06:21.240> the<00:06:21.330> nicest<00:06:21.539> look<00:06:21.900> in<00:06:22.020> battlefield

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440
