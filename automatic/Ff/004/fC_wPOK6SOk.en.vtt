it's<00:02:13.960> easier<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.380> create<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.830> negative

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
it's easier to create the negative

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.220 
it's easier to create the negative
things<00:02:15.460> because<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.240> world<00:02:16.450> tells<00:02:16.780> us<00:02:17.020> it's

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230
