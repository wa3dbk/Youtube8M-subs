00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
info and everything down the box below I

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.010 
info and everything down the box below I
believe<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:17.700> fifteen<00:01:18.030> dollars<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> month<00:01:18.570> but

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
believe it's fifteen dollars a month but

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.390 
believe it's fifteen dollars a month but
you<00:01:19.140> can<00:01:19.259> order<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.650> boxes<00:01:20.009> on<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> longer

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
you can order the boxes on a longer

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.039 
you can order the boxes on a longer
service<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.060> i<00:01:21.090> believe<00:01:21.299> it's<00:01:21.420> cheaper<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.810> do

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
service and i believe it's cheaper to do

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.420 
service and i believe it's cheaper to do
so<00:01:22.909> this<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.060> their<00:01:24.210> december<00:01:24.720> box<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.890> i'm
