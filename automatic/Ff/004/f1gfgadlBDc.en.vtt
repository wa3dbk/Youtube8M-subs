00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
partial and then on to the implants I

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.110 
partial and then on to the implants I
would<00:03:15.180> most<00:03:15.480> definitely<00:03:15.769> most<00:03:16.769> definitely

had if I had to have the option before

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.890 
had if I had to have the option before
I'd<00:03:20.430> have<00:03:20.640> gone<00:03:20.760> right<00:03:21.060> for<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.299> implants

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
I'd have gone right for the implants

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.690 
I'd have gone right for the implants
from<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.230> beginning<00:03:22.560> there's<00:03:23.280> there's

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
from the beginning there's there's

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.090 
from the beginning there's there's
nothing<00:03:24.030> comparable<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.630> them<00:03:24.810> it's<00:03:25.739> given<00:03:26.010> me

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
back the confidence that I needed to

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.260 
back the confidence that I needed to
feel<00:03:30.510> them<00:03:30.660> in<00:03:30.870> myself<00:03:31.340> when<00:03:32.340> I'm<00:03:32.790> speaking<00:03:33.090> to

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
self-conscious about anything and that

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.860 
self-conscious about anything and that
was<00:03:45.520> something<00:03:45.880> that<00:03:45.910> I<00:03:46.060> went<00:03:46.630> through<00:03:46.720> a

was something that I went through a

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.300 
was something that I went through a
period<00:03:46.989> of<00:03:47.200> time<00:03:47.380> when<00:03:47.500> I<00:03:47.530> couldn't<00:03:47.860> do<00:03:48.069> that

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
period of time when I couldn't do that

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.940 
period of time when I couldn't do that
and<00:03:48.720> having<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.810> ability<00:03:50.140> to<00:03:50.170> do<00:03:50.440> that<00:03:50.650> once
