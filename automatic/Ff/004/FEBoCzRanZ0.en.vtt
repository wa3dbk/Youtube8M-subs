00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.340
 Y 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.960
 and 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.300
 surely it's finite roses that 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.250
 I was with a neighbor who came down I lived 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.210
 in a room the neighbor lived in a sixth 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.430
 and I went down to my house to do some 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.780
 cupcakes of madness and a rosquillitas and 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.820
 my brother and I created some microphones 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.020
 small as we did as well as some 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.760
 coats donuts was 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.150
 complicated purito did was give him 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.620
 same with elongated and then frying 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.150
 surely the first thing I did with my 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.220
 hands to eat were the cigarillos of 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.580
 which was also called pur and also to 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.580
 curious 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.760
 Sincerely, he has not given me 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.739
 define it with a flavor but of course 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.869
 you 're still sweet it's sweet especially because 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.689
 more like I'm very sweet and I like it a lot 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.280
 Well then I do not care, it's very 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.280
 Well honestly it 's very good 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.450
 Well, what he did was with a salad 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.060
 it was like a reinterpretation of a 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.509
 caprese was like a commune that appears 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.820
 with heart shape evidently and so 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.320
 as in layered with a show the 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.750
 auto matera I think you remember that 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.220
 it was a mozzarella mozzarella a 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.710
 tomato down I think I was wearing it 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.200
 like a common gelatinous napado very 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.360
 bright basil was like getting 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.979
 all the prisoners in the mouth no and already 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.539
 I have had a heart shape and it was very 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.539
 good pimp 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.440
 I do not know what it could be but I know which one 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:53.590
 like I possibly do not like me 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.670
 I like persimmons but I like those that 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.380
 They are hard and very sweet look has some 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.270
 clean grace not only that I like 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.420
 but also I see myself I see a little 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.420
 A) Yes 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.250
 about to explode to truth how is the 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.410
 I really need to live in my world 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.080
 particular perfect and when I'm in 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.670
 a kitchen I want the kitchen to be my 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.819
 particular world perfect when you do not 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.770
 it's pissed me off when you explain to 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.720
 someone 5 times because I do not want it to be 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.010
 so I want it to be roasted and still 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.989
 do the end of the video and it is 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.400
 laughing at me is not the way of work 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.220
 sets 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.590
 it can not be good that some niceties 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.920
 It does not depend on the degree of anger that you 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.920
 provoke 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.450
 I am an inveterate reader and I carry 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.270
 reading a lot since I was a kid 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.590
 suddenly I read a lot of philology and what 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.300
 next that I get to read is 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.280
 fantastic do not think so like that 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.750
 of tea with the jumps done now I carry 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.950
 like a couple of years linked with the 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.120
 fantastic science fiction that I 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.120
 he has in that he has me crazy 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.900
 it's a guy who's called will have 2 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.870
 anderson 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.909
 spectacular a very american lad 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.140
 young man who writes like the angels I'm 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.170
 with something else from an uncle they call 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.540
 a thousand stephenson just like the cryp sounds 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.069
 bull with or something like that not good then 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.069
 Good science fiction 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.370
 is that no no I can not understand it some in 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.010
 others I can not I am one of those cooks 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.310
 pirra to those who go out to eat and eat 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.380
 at home and try everything I do there 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.270
 many people that he works with 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.130
 cook but do not like to go out to eat 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.470
 or does not like to see what other people do 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.239
 he enjoys sitting in a restaurant 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.300
 it seems to me that the greatest show 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.950
 of the world is neither the opera nor the circus 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.440
 or nothing is to sit at the table of the 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:48.090
 restaurant where there is a gentleman who 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.090
 wants to attend so you have a good time 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.410
 it seems to me that this only with 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.260
 a salsita and a little parsley goes to 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.640
 be complicated I think that here is the same 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.440
 better throw away all the garbage and start 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.550
 from scratch what seems to start 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.530
 from scratch we have to buy the 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.950
 new chicken we have a new oil 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.530
 we have the new pan we have to 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.390
 make a kitchen again the same I do not know if 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.890
 we have money for this but since 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.480
 then the plate as it is is not going 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.820
 Arrange with a little oil splash or 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.109
 fats and it's sweeter and this is not 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.930
 touch dishes let's take out everything and 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.400
 where they are burned at all there is no 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.450
 solution I would throw away the 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.450
 area maybe from scratch 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.360
 the world
