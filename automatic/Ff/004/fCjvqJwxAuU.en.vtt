00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
so you're saying spring is on the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.819 
so you're saying spring is on the
registers<00:01:19.399> so<00:01:20.399> let's<00:01:20.640> quit<00:01:20.820> out<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.149> now

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
now just put these in my Applications

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.130 
now just put these in my Applications
folder<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.990> make<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.289> easier<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.860> use<00:01:30.140> they'll
