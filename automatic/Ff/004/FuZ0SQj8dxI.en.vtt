00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.430
 in 1985 when because here blair resumes 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.680
 the reins of the vineyard 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.510
 family she decides to expand her 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.360
 field of activity it then starts with 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.559
 plant half a hectare of aspect rj I 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.940
 I threw myself into the sphere because 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.670
 that I needed a human touch 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.010
 I needed to make a product 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.140
 from the beginning to the end of the production 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.430
 until marketing my 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.800
 winemaking because I was 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.910
 in cooperatives did not allow it I 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.010
 I also started in space because 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.630
 it with vegetables that I love and in 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.399
 my sector there was not yet 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.899
 uninitiated production choose a 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.219
 production that was not existing 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.840
 already in my area 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.010
 actually planted in asparagus 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.760
 in the vineyard it seemed a little 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.770
 little utopian 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.260
 mona some pretty good land the in 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.629
 riverside which lend themselves to it so 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.340
 I started and it's true that 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.410
 first asparagus I was doing the door to 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.239
 door to sell them because he has 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.770
 had to make a little name and I had to 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.539
 wait four years before the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.430
 first client does not cross my door 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.030
 and come directly ac on a 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.160
 exploitation 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.510
 she also benefited from a coup de 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.370
 thumb from the restoration 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.199
 indeed olivier nasti who was not 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.729
 still starry at the time began to 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.479
 stock up at her house then the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.820
 word of mouth worked 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.290
 today the exploitation counts 12 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.330
 hectares of aspers games sold live 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.250
 on the farm but also at great expense and 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.500
 at the subway it is the activity 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.640
 main operating a 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.500
 planting species that is reflected 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.240
 so we already plant the asparagus in a 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.780
 soil that is appropriate to the culture of 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.580
 the ace by ge 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.439
 so we plant we will say the year zero 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.829
 the year zero we plant claws the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.290
 time of the month of March its 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.479
 claws are put on sale at 25 30 cm in 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.549
 earth and then we wait patiently two 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.369
 years and we pamper them for two years 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.320
 before harvesting the first sprinkling 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.909
 for production the main work 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.320
 that's the goal and the asparagus so their 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.479
 put a small mound of land of 30 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.890
 cm so that they can have 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.420
 sufficient length for sale 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.890
 they are covered with a plastic tarpaulin 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.170
 so that she did not see the light 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.149
 that it stays white and 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.030
 starts to harvest general from the 15th 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.979
 April which lasts until early June but 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.719
 this year is early asparagus 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.590
 started coming out of the ground as soon as the end 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.549
 March 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.890
 like a lot of agricultural productions 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.420
 this one is dependent on the weather in 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.550
 below 12 degrees the growth of 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.899
 the sprayed stop the optimum yield 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.970
 being obtained when the temperature 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.140
 closer to 20 degrees the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.760
 does it start rather its wave 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.200
 is not a sign that we are going to do 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.610
 a better year than another year 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.710
 since we do not know the conditions 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.800
 climate ahead after the 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.780
 products over a year between 3 and 8 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.970
 tons of sprayed per hectare 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.980
 depends on the climatic conditions in 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.600
 average 500 g of sprinkles come out of a 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.670
 claw from the beginning to the end of the season 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.290
 to make this season last two months 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.900
 clarisse has selected different 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.820
 early and late season varieties 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.310
 different colors and various 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.140
 templates on my farm I produce 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.640
 the white sprinkled 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.830
 basically we'll say it's 80% 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.000
 of production and I am well 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.200
 diverse in the sphere and green that 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.850
 is a product more and more requested 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.650
 so we also have a hectare and a half 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.440
 green sprinkles and sptr game 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.940
 violet to satisfy we'll say the 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.470
 new cooking techniques and 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.050
 new restaurateurs who want to 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.280
 indulge in 10 to a cooking of the 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.820
 sphere in little different than so 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.830
 traditional 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.420
 we can harvest asparagus from 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.920
 of the same claw for nine years but 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.600
 to maintain maximum performance 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.250
 Clarisse is changing plots every 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.260
 seven years no less than forty people 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.810
 are hired during the season to 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.519
 ensure harvesting and sorting them 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.260
 asparagus is harvested daily 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.060
 every day to prevent it from 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.930
 so translated from land as soon as they 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.370
 come too fast to land they 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.900
 bloom for us to go harvest 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.890
 every day once they are 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.230
 harvested they come back on 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.580
 exploitation on the basis of all 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.230
 hours every hour they are 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.209
 soaked in an ice-cold water bath at 2 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.680
 degrees to cool them to heart of 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.540
 so that it no longer evolves and for 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.830
 keep all their servers from 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.900
 his veil to space on the chain of 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.890
 sorting calibrations issued in bundles 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.110
 and parts for sale 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.790
 Alsace has a total of around 200 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.950
 producers of sprayed production 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.930
 global regional also around the two 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.959
 thousand tons of sprinkled parents the 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.010
 asparagus all have a special taste 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.110
 by driving the place where they grow 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.030
 so it's like the wine is long in 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.560
 function of the terroir they have a 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.150
 different specificity the aspergent 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.830
 alsace to a peace civitella a little more 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.120
 of taste is in my opinion a little more than 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.890
 flavor that asparagus comes from the south 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.720
 which grows in soils a little 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.650
 sandy where we have a little more soil 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.180
 heavy a little richer 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.650
 so that gives them a little more knowledge 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.950
 so good as an Alsatian we are a little 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.950
 chauvinist
