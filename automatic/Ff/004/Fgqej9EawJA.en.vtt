00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.590
 twice after the second visit he concluded that they issued them and 2000 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.480
 they were an alternative as long as they will provide the ability 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.640
 of firing 125-mm-caliber missiles but that would be 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.289
 available within two years it is at this point that criticism exploded 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.079
 because if the Santander 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.359
 nobody had in the room to our requirement 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.669
 the answer seems to be free 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.390
 each Chinese vehicle cost 5 million dollars in the third sleeve on 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.570
 Spanish marc coma were established p minimum requirements that should 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.800
 meet the tanks that could that values 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.260
 certainly so that it could be said if it was acquired 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.330
 p was classified rated that classified all options already 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.980
 all those who exceeded 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.740
 of the necessary bay then it became one day it was more detailed of them 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.620
 Then came a previous analysis of the opportunity cost g20 and 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.630
 so that what has been done 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.180
 but it is also true that nobody has in this 50 with tape before 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.710
 this are manufactured have wanted and will be delivered in remittances however the 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.689
 block played in favor of Chinese vehicles were several things 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:22.380
 the mass production capacity the safety of having spare parts the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.780
 commitment to technology transfer is to say the possibility of 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.780
 remove the new ones in the technological advance 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.480
 and China's promise to assemble a more modern center for the imminent 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.780
 but above all 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.780
 and these tanks shoot at 5,000 meters 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.120
 of children participate 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.120
 This sale 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.410
 the agreement of the contra was felt at the apec meeting in singapore between 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.830
 presidents 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.670
 DC 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.670
 it has been achieved because the project is very limited 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.080
 Thanks for your interest 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.490
 It is a very important 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.480
 the price but it will come 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.480
 potential that the palladium touched suffering the problem 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.350
 and noted that he had reached a good agreement 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.290
 china sent on a frigate in the five mbt 2000 tanks the same ones that were 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.629
 exhibited in the military parade 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.569
 nobody here the other controversial point that caused controversy 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.670
 within the same executive 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.779
 they did not know 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:32.729
 if they had already discussed the against ones they said that still while the 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:34.090
 President Garcia 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.629
 I already took it for granted 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.999
 what he considered to be a mistake in my neighborhood for that reason they remembered 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:42.299
 these are the first five so many 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.549
 they pilot informative two realities 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.249
 hence they use in the elevated 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:50.639
 at your level at this time 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:51.849
 by the psoe 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.130
 the number of the magazine carranza 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.409
 to face this situation 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.079
 efe 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.629
 p not directly 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.460
 the decision to buy china was political 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.310
 in which the economic thing prevailed although to say of the experts it also satisfied 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.729
 7 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:13.749
 let's just wait for harmful substances to lift 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:16.749
 so much dust 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.689
 definitely when it comes to arms purchases we are talking 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:32.800
 of a subject that not only involves the political but also 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.829
 the technicians therefore 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.459
 you can hear the voices of many experts is difficult from the point of 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.689
 view of the laymen being completely sure and who says the whole truth but 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.949
 The truth is that apparently a series of justifications have been presented 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:50.209
 that first would explain that the inclination to buy these tanks 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.439
 in front of others what has answered us is what some critics 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:58.700
 As Ferdinand Rospigliosi wondered and that was necessary to acquire that amount 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:02.029
 of tanks is a question that in any case 

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:05.029
 what can be a leo like me in this type of issues and hopefully 

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:08.829
 this acquisition is never used we pause for a little
