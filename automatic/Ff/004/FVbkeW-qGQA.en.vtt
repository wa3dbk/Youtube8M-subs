00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.700
 hello my name is galeev anatoly 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:12.360
 Today I will show you how to 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:16.209
 lay laminate 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.970
 free flooring in a straight line for laying 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.410
 we will need the following tools 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.619
 laminate substrate laminate itself 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.820
 pencil spacer wedges under the exuberant 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.850
 bar brace 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.340
 tape measure hammer jigsaw 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.039
 and circulating beer on todays 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.229
 master class we have boxing imitating 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:38.079
 the room here in the corner is represented 

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:39.760
 duct box for laying 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.789
 laminate we need a substrate 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.479
 the substrate is needed for cushioning locks 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:48.519
 compounds and it needs to be applied in any 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:51.670
 case it may be from different 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.829
 materials at different prices but it needs 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.170
 erase in this case we have 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.809
 the wooden base will immediately lay down 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.809
 substrate before installation is necessary 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:05.350
 measure the width of the room and count 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.150
 how many whole rows will ours enter 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.040
 the room 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:14.470
 if the calculation goes so that 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.400
 the final row will be less than half 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:22.390
 boards then it is advisable to start laying 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.790
 down a range because the final 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.320
 the series will be very small it will be 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.420
 hard to make 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.640
 he will not hold well if the wall 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.940
 us uneven has some obstacles 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.660
 or protrusions we cut off the strip 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.660
 substrates 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.090
 move it close to the wall and cut it off 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.450
 excess before you start laying 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.750
 inspect almost check and in the body with not 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:52.270
 so there is no deformation and dents it 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:54.479
 will be an indicator of the quality of the board and not 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.400
 will create any problems when laying 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.910
 board laminate has a quadrilateral 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.250
 crown lock on both sides there 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.310
 the long part of the lock is from the end 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.649
 and on the long side on the other side 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.200
 short lock for easy assembly 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.020
 the boards we lay down the short side of the lock to 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.360
 the wall is then calculated as needed 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.010
 boards for one row we connect 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.800
 several boards for one row and 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.510
 at first the boards are joined in the end 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.910
 the locks are connected 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.350
 plant one board to another at an angle 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.180
 45 degrees and docked to one board 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.480
 relative to the other did not shift and was 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.880
 smooth coming to the opposite not 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.180
 finishing the series you need to measure the desired 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.440
 the length for this board is turned upside down 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.070
 suited to the wall with a small indentation 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.489
 to provide a technological gap 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:52.739
 mark is made and on the square we do 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:55.950
 cut line mark after cut 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.420
 we put the right part in a row and 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.970
 finish it the rest we will have 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.670
 serve as the beginning of the next series now 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.640
 the first row we need to trim width 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.800
 in order to complete the series we have 2 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.480
 I was too small and it was comfortable 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:16.330
 start our room has a ledge to 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.580
 so we need to mark it and 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.490
 cut from the first row the extra part 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.400
 for this we bring to our ledge 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.130
 the board makes a mark with the necessary 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:31.780
 reserve for expansion and cut out the excess 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:33.340
 Part 1 row we have laid and we start 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.989
 assembly of subsequent rows 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.230
 after assembly 2 rows we get the whole row 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.690
 first row 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.690
 for this raised at an angle and the whole 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.019
 a row we get to 1 wall we have to put 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.090
 wedges to provide 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.890
 necessary spare expansion and to 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.900
 all canvas nous down moved to the wall 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.019
 after installing the wedges we 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.489
 keep assembling our tight and 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.310
 subsequent rows are collected similarly 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.830
 the main thing to observe when assembling necessary 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.320
 run between the joints of the laminate laying 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.900
 conducted on the similarity of brickwork and 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.720
 boards lies with offset so here 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.640
 the overlap between the boards should not be 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.620
 less than 30 centimeters it is important for 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.450
 fixing boards the rest is this boards 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.169
 small enough so we don't 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.810
 use 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.180
 and start next time the whole board 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.760
 modern laminate is well assembled but 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.440
 periodically you need to knock rows for 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.970
 order to shoot more dense 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.570
 for this is used the bed plate and 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.570
 hammer 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.470
 when laying the last row you need 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.710
 distinguish boards in width and cut off 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.720
 right part last row of the board 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.120
 the short side of the lock comes in long 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.950
 for this we need the part of the board to them 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.850
 we turn to the wall do small 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.590
 indent from wall 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.590
 about a millimeter 3 and 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.190
 on the previous row do the markup on 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.020
 board for laying the last row you need 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.210
 use metal bracket by 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.130
 wedges completed 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.110
 cleaned and technological gap 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.460
 skidding closes installation war with 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.770
 four sides of it is a golden castle 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.050
 over now we will show you the installation 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.570
 laminate slam lock principle 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.510
 laying laminate slam lock 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.310
 the same but the bond of the boards is different 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.710
 Now we will show the laying of the first 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.930
 rows are the same we lay out boards and 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.760
 we connect them with the ends 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.800
 corner one to another further assembly 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.040
 already goes not in rows but on one board 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:39.980
 the board of the next row we get under 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:42.980
 corner first row then next board 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:46.880
 also getting into the first row 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:49.470
 bring together the previous board and 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.720
 we lay end lock so on 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.400
 all subsequent boards are going 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.560
 advantage of this lock systems 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:59.240
 more quickly mounting our master class 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.240
 finished thanks for attention
