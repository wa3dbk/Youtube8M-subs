00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 what's up with friends stefanie von fifa 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.480
 and gaming tv and welcome 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.980
 to the first squad pictures for fifa 14 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.440
 all this here at foot 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.910
 get and not in the web app or 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.259
 at the console but that is synonymous yes 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.580
 not yet at the console on the webcam 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.590
 I went but I'm not like that 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.180
 active but that's why it should now 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.890
 not giving is not that bad 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.420
 that's what food is doing here here 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.820
 you see exactly the same as usual 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.810
 also different everywhere and we play 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.789
 today in the 4 3 3 formation variation 5 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.070
 and that for me very interesting in the tv 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.390
 14 before that did not exist yet 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.880
 a hanging tip like us here 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.800
 Do not see a real striker like that 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.629
 so far, but as I said one 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.320
 player of the striker gets dressed 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.420
 back a bit 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.040
 and yes I'm curious how that is 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.590
 let me play a game of football 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.129
 from that it is good though 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.420
 One hundred percent I can do that, of course 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.789
 not say 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.379
 The team costs about 15 to 20,000 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.329
 Münster really like lying around like that 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.800
 so a state could have it, you could do it 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.020
 almost say it's a bit more expensive 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.489
 but could play after a few 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.649
 Many actually afford it 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.229
 Anyway, we'll catch it 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.570
 still on with the goalie this is chesley 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.290
 of course, then of course 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.760
 arsenal 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.560
 you could do that on any 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.570
 but he has me in 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.460
 fifa 13 just something from convinced 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.619
 without there has always just start for me 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.530
 played and that's why it comes for me 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.299
 in the gate then start with the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.900
 defense here we have first 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.360
 man sack of sackcloth sakko of 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.880
 Of course, more though the boy can 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.799
 I think from psg I think yes 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.090
 have been that and a good 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.070
 defenders now a bit slower 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.630
 become but that's so bad even 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.130
 We will not move on to the next one 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.450
 That's why we're looking for him shortly and short 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.270
 we must have found him there as well 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.899
 he is 65 paces 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.189
 70 defense 76 hedging and 73 games 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.929
 actually quite solid values for the 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.710
 inside linebacker 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.990
 maybe a bit slow though 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.210
 fifa 14 speed you have to see how 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.159
 the impact is then we seek 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.130
 Here's a left defender 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.280
 And that's a new addition to liverpool 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:08.450
 namely sissoko he has here 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.660
 perfect link with sakko and yes something 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.549
 you can say it's quite good 74 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.780
 rather defensive so much so really 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.819
 a good man who also with backwards 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.470
 works and not as a whiz like 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.569
 dani alves the wupsi or aristocratic 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.420
 Attack seeks in the right 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.489
 defend position here from the rhine 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.200
 or van or over the 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.110
 In any case it may sound 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.720
 dutch pace 86 otherwise very good 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.769
 Values ​​in things fit dribbling 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.510
 defense and header 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.799
 he will then see you soon 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.690
 Of course, good ones bring here 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.150
 connections to the remaining players 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.290
 we come to the central Mittefeld 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.569
 this is also a new addition from the so also 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.970
 a Dutchman is kevin strootmann 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.650
 the defensive department 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.350
 is responsible in this team 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.269
 you can see it already its best values 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.560
 dribbling fit and defense 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.940
 otherwise good values ​​in all 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.950
 other areas is actually one 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.100
 quite an all-rounder and not so 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.569
 is expensive so he would have his 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.970
 actually do quite well now 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.560
 you can also go to the left 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.890
 central midfielder the bistum 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.980
 artner 80s overall rating of 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.900
 lisbon that later you get his 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.730
 values ​​of really good values 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.990
 again in all areas has become 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.360
 I think that is also greatly improved 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.440
 really big just under two feet or so 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.319
 maybe two meters maybe 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.550
 also more than 195 irgendsowas like there on 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.459
 a good presence in every case 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.440
 Mittelfeld therefore a good man for 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.930
 Now we come to the right 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.790
 Central midfielder and to 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.209
 right central midfield and there 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.069
 plays van ginkel of chelsea, too 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.300
 An all- rounder can not be said how 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.709
 Here you can see the whole central 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.440
 midfielders actually have 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.270
 pretty much not outstanding values 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.739
 but pretty good values ​​in all 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.769
 areas how to seventh here again 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.900
 then you can be quite fast with 78 ps 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.450
 best value the dribbling with 76 and 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.570
 75er pass worthy of you are still 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.239
 quite young his resta 25 times already 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.920
 way too much I do not even know 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.500
 in any case a pretty good player 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.200
 then we come to the attack 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.910
 and there we have the right flitzer 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.190
 is also a Dutchman again and it 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.530
 Of course , he took care of himself 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.030
 Use 93er tempo on direct 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.140
 streaming of course the four stables 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.580
 skills available the three 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.840
 midfielders have all three stars 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.360
 skills 76 dribbling 93 ps 72 fitting 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.160
 as wrong done there a real stain 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.430
 saw the man on the outer track came now 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.430
 let's come to the first 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.130
 to a premiere here for the 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.860
 hanging tip and that is yes with the 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.750
 play at as rom also a serbe 81er 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.090
 tempo quite good dribbling '84 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.550
 outstanding value 78 shot also correct 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.370
 good and 73 thus fits an optimal 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.780
 position for the suffering of the world 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.360
 will definitely be interesting to see 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.610
 be like he is doing on the 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.040
 position and now we come naturally 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.260
 then even to the last man he 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.790
 have in the team and that is there must times 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.040
 look what a donor because that's one 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.980
 be a bit funny then name 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.990
 every file tells judith or how to do that 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.940
 leather out speaks no idea is on 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.740
 every time a serb plays in the same 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.930
 simplistic as ma comes gets romantic 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.610
 that's why the perfect link appears 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.830
 Now here after chemistry of no 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.210
 I do not know what's going on there 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.040
 is possibly there is a new 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.350
 system other youtube is well 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.500
 not so special in any case 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.030
 all the players to fifa 13 time if 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.160
 you look at the links of course 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.810
 I know all the new chemistry here 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.620
 not as accurate as that then there 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.300
 Anyway, I think that's going to happen 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.530
 Pretty good is a starter team 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.580
 should i say one on each one 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.380
 case, try it out before everything 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.340
 This system attracted me here times 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.490
 to make such a team 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.890
 By the way, legal good man 86 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.020
 here has the biggest rilling of the 86 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.660
 pace so a really good young 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.890
 Flitzer on the left outer course and so 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.550
 far it was the then actually to 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.380
 the team 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.760
 I would be interested in how you do that 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.500
 she writes the comments ob 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.800
 you could imagine the team too 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.630
 build and let me know i would 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.700
 Of course I am very happy about live 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.920
 yes and if it thinks there is little there 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.720
 he is nervous or was very nervous 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.760
 just a bit hard 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.200
 cold and so on and so forth, the 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.640
 next videos because I'm back topfit 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.800
 Of course, I'll be back, too 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.290
 still outstanding with spec lot to glory 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.940
 soon to start, of course, because we pick 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.260
 In any case, this ticket 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.520
 I think as we can from tomorrow 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.440
 Let's see how we do it 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.889
 will act when the first videos 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.689
 there have to come with me 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:34.219
 deny it was so far from me 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:37.180
 Do it well until next time skin 

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:37.180
 pure and ciao
