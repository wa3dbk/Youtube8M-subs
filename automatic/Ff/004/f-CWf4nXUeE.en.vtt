champion secrets today
I'm<00:00:07.980> covering<00:00:08.760> your<00:00:08.880> question<00:00:09.360> on<00:00:10.940> how<00:00:11.940> can<00:00:12.509> I

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
I'm covering your question on how can I

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.890 
I'm covering your question on how can I
hit<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.110> shots<00:00:13.410> more<00:00:13.830> cleanly<00:00:14.900> especially

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
hit the shots more cleanly especially

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.390 
hit the shots more cleanly especially
when<00:00:16.049> I'm<00:00:16.170> stretching<00:00:17.600> so<00:00:18.740> that<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.160> great

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
when I'm stretching so that is a great

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.990 
when I'm stretching so that is a great
question

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
question

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.660 
question
and<00:00:21.180> it's<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.840> concern<00:00:22.680> for<00:00:23.070> lots<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.609> people

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
and it's a concern for lots of people

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.900 
and it's a concern for lots of people
because<00:00:24.480> it's<00:00:24.779> really<00:00:25.320> difficult<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:26.279> hit<00:00:26.580> a

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
because it's really difficult to hit a

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.279 
because it's really difficult to hit a
clean<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.580> crispy<00:00:29.580> shot<00:00:29.880> when<00:00:30.750> you're<00:00:30.990> under

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
clean and crispy shot when you're under

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.260 
clean and crispy shot when you're under
pressure<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:32.250> when<00:00:32.430> you're<00:00:32.579> stretching<00:00:32.940> out

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
pressure so when you're stretching out

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.500 
pressure so when you're stretching out
either<00:00:33.989> overhead<00:00:34.890> or<00:00:35.130> out<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:35.940> side<00:00:36.030> or

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
either overhead or out to the side or

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.119 
either overhead or out to the side or
out<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:36.840> front<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.290> that's<00:00:37.800> when<00:00:37.980> you're

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
out in front of you that's when you're

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.569 
out in front of you that's when you're
more<00:00:38.309> vulnerable<00:00:38.969> for<00:00:39.180> miss<00:00:39.540> hits<00:00:39.920> so<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.399> hit

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
more vulnerable for miss hits so to hit

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.459 
more vulnerable for miss hits so to hit
a<00:00:41.610> clean<00:00:41.940> shot<00:00:42.239> I'm<00:00:42.480> going<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.870> give<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.050> three

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
a clean shot I'm going to give you three

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.060 
a clean shot I'm going to give you three
helpful<00:00:44.160> hints<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:45.510> first<00:00:45.840> has<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.530> do<00:00:46.860> with

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
helpful hints the first has to do with

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.450 
helpful hints the first has to do with
preparing<00:00:47.969> your<00:00:48.450> racquet<00:00:48.899> face<00:00:49.250> so<00:00:50.250> your

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
preparing your racquet face so your

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.389 
preparing your racquet face so your
racquet<00:00:50.789> face<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.559> this<00:00:52.559> part<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.010> racket

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
racquet face is this part of the racket

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.250 
racquet face is this part of the racket
the<00:00:53.520> strings<00:00:53.910> we<00:00:54.449> call<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.840> face<00:00:55.020> because

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
the strings we call it a face because

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.020 
the strings we call it a face because
this<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.649> head<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.820> face

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
this is the head and this is the face

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.840 
this is the head and this is the face
just<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.920> prepare<00:00:59.219> your

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
just like on you so to prepare your

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.110 
just like on you so to prepare your
racket<00:01:00.300> face<00:01:00.440> you<00:01:01.440> want<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.920> be<00:01:02.070> open<00:01:02.820> at

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
racket face you want it to be open at

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.730 
racket face you want it to be open at
the<00:01:03.899> front<00:01:04.339> open<00:01:05.339> flat<00:01:06.080> to<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.110> approaching

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
the front open flat to the approaching

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.640 
the front open flat to the approaching
shuttle<00:01:08.130> because<00:01:08.970> think<00:01:09.390> about<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.810> if<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
shuttle because think about it if the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.100 
shuttle because think about it if the
shot<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:10.950> coming<00:01:11.490> towards<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.780> going<00:01:13.049> to

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
shot is coming towards you it's going to

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.380 
shot is coming towards you it's going to
have<00:01:13.320> an<00:01:13.439> easier<00:01:14.010> chance<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.700> bounce<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
have an easier chance to bounce on the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.859 
have an easier chance to bounce on the
strings

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
strings

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.910 
strings
if<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.470> racket<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.159> flat<00:01:18.150> if<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.409> racket<00:01:19.799> is

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
if the racket is flat if the racket is

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.620 
if the racket is flat if the racket is
facing<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.670> way<00:01:20.939> when<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.270> bird<00:01:21.450> is

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
facing this way when the bird is

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.749 
facing this way when the bird is
approaching<00:01:22.229> then<00:01:22.860> there's<00:01:23.220> more<00:01:23.460> room<00:01:23.729> for

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
approaching then there's more room for

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.210 
approaching then there's more room for
miss<00:01:24.420> hits<00:01:24.720> because<00:01:25.140> then<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:25.890> hitting<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
miss hits because then it's hitting the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.550 
miss hits because then it's hitting the
strings<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.729> an<00:01:26.850> angle<00:01:27.360> or<00:01:28.080> maybe<00:01:28.350> you're

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
strings on an angle or maybe you're

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.920 
strings on an angle or maybe you're
moving<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.070> strings<00:01:29.400> at<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.640> last<00:01:29.970> second<00:01:30.509> so

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
moving the strings at the last second so

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.830 
moving the strings at the last second so
if<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.170> open<00:01:31.409> up<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.770> racket<00:01:32.400> face<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.939> keep

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
if you open up that racket face and keep

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.710 
if you open up that racket face and keep
it<00:01:35.000> approaching<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.329> shuttle<00:01:36.570> is

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
it approaching so the shuttle is

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.160 
it approaching so the shuttle is
approaching<00:01:37.259> at<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.470> perpendicular<00:01:37.979> angle<00:01:39.170> to

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
approaching at a perpendicular angle to

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.100 
approaching at a perpendicular angle to
the<00:01:40.470> strings<00:01:40.799> you'll<00:01:41.729> cut<00:01:42.060> down<00:01:42.360> those<00:01:42.780> miss

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
the strings you'll cut down those miss

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.530 
the strings you'll cut down those miss
hits<00:01:43.409> at<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.680> frontcourt<00:01:44.270> so<00:01:45.270> for<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
hits at the frontcourt so for the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.450 
hits at the frontcourt so for the
forehand<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.229> would<00:01:46.350> be<00:01:46.470> opening<00:01:46.950> up<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.250> face

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
forehand it would be opening up the face

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.240 
forehand it would be opening up the face
this<00:01:47.700> way<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.180> for<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> backhand<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.979> would

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
this way and for the backhand it would

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.889 
this way and for the backhand it would
be<00:01:50.369> opening<00:01:50.820> up<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.149> face<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:52.049> way<00:01:53.840> now<00:01:54.840> you

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
be opening up the face this way now you

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.810 
be opening up the face this way now you
might<00:01:55.170> think<00:01:55.200> well<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:56.009> makes<00:01:56.280> my<00:01:56.490> play<00:01:56.759> too

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
might think well that makes my play too

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.149 
might think well that makes my play too
basic<00:01:57.540> but<00:01:58.079> actually<00:01:58.439> it's<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.680> opposite

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
basic but actually it's the opposite

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.330 
basic but actually it's the opposite
when<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.939> get<00:02:00.149> good<00:02:00.509> at<00:02:00.680> holding<00:02:01.680> your<00:02:01.950> racket

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
when you get good at holding your racket

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.209 
when you get good at holding your racket
face<00:02:02.369> open<00:02:03.270> then<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.049> can<00:02:04.229> actually<00:02:04.680> increase

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
face open then you can actually increase

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.760 
face open then you can actually increase
your<00:02:05.640> deception<00:02:06.270> because<00:02:07.020> you're<00:02:07.200> able<00:02:07.740> to

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
your deception because you're able to

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.170 
your deception because you're able to
hold<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:09.060> shuttle<00:02:09.239> longer<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.200> way

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
hold the shuttle longer and way

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.380

till the very last second before you

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.839 
till the very last second before you
make<00:02:14.870> your<00:02:14.900> shot<00:02:15.409> which<00:02:16.220> forces<00:02:16.640> your

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
make your shot which forces your

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.289 
make your shot which forces your
opponent<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:18.560> delay<00:02:19.189> their<00:02:19.610> movement<00:02:20.150> and

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
opponent to delay their movement and

opponent to delay their movement and
they<00:02:20.599> don't<00:02:20.810> get<00:02:20.959> any<00:02:21.200> clues<00:02:21.590> on<00:02:21.620> where<00:02:21.980> you're

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
they don't get any clues on where you're

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.039 
they don't get any clues on where you're
going<00:02:22.189> to<00:02:22.340> hit<00:02:22.519> it<00:02:22.640> whereas<00:02:23.480> if<00:02:23.629> you<00:02:23.750> don't

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
going to hit it whereas if you don't

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.500 
going to hit it whereas if you don't
open<00:02:24.290> your<00:02:24.500> racket<00:02:24.950> face<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.790> end<00:02:26.000> up<00:02:26.209> making

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
open your racket face you end up making

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.199 
open your racket face you end up making
a<00:02:26.810> move<00:02:27.079> before<00:02:27.439> you<00:02:27.799> hit<00:02:28.069> and<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.819> gives

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
a move before you hit and that gives

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.599 
a move before you hit and that gives
away<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.659> clues<00:02:29.959> of<00:02:30.290> what<00:02:30.980> you're<00:02:31.400> going<00:02:31.579> to

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
away the clues of what you're going to

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.940 
away the clues of what you're going to
do<00:02:31.819> if<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.390> do<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.569> wind-up<00:02:33.140> then<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.739> shows

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
do if you do a wind-up then it shows

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.640 
do if you do a wind-up then it shows
you're<00:02:34.159> going<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.340> lift<00:02:34.579> if<00:02:34.939> you<00:02:35.720> keep<00:02:36.319> it<00:02:36.500> on

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
you're going to lift if you keep it on

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.140 
you're going to lift if you keep it on
an<00:02:36.920> angle<00:02:37.069> then<00:02:37.400> it<00:02:37.430> shows<00:02:37.730> you're<00:02:37.970> going<00:02:38.090> to

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
an angle then it shows you're going to

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.960 
an angle then it shows you're going to
hit<00:02:38.329> cross<00:02:38.569> so<00:02:39.530> there's<00:02:40.099> a<00:02:40.189> lot<00:02:40.430> of<00:02:40.549> benefits

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
hit cross so there's a lot of benefits

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.789 
hit cross so there's a lot of benefits

that<00:03:59.209> you<00:03:59.930> need<00:04:00.229> to<00:04:01.239> time<00:04:02.239> your<00:04:02.269> in-breath<00:04:02.900> and

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
that you need to time your in-breath and

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.009 
that you need to time your in-breath and
your<00:04:03.500> out-breath<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:04.790> coordinate<00:04:05.359> with<00:04:05.720> the

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
your out-breath to coordinate with the

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.740 
your out-breath to coordinate with the
contact<00:04:06.470> of<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.709> shuttle<00:04:07.010> and<00:04:07.269> it<00:04:08.269> really

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
contact of the shuttle and it really

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.899 
contact of the shuttle and it really
helps<00:04:09.109> me<00:04:09.260> especially<00:04:09.500> when<00:04:10.010> I'm<00:04:10.190> on<00:04:10.340> defense

because<00:04:12.040> what<00:04:13.040> you<00:04:13.159> want<00:04:13.400> to<00:04:13.519> do<00:04:13.609> is<00:04:13.760> time<00:04:14.180> your

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:14.479 
because what you want to do is time your

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.890 
because what you want to do is time your
out<00:04:14.629> breath<00:04:15.109> or<00:04:15.379> your<00:04:15.530> exhale<00:04:16.329> to<00:04:17.329> match<00:04:17.570> with

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
out breath or your exhale to match with

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.620 
out breath or your exhale to match with
the<00:04:17.930> contact<00:04:18.500> of<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.709> shuttle<00:04:19.099> so<00:04:20.060> you<00:04:20.150> your

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
the contact of the shuttle so you your

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.019 
the contact of the shuttle so you your
in-breath<00:04:20.900> or<00:04:21.529> your<00:04:21.709> inhalation<00:04:22.190> happens

00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:23.029 
in-breath or your inhalation happens

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:24.620 
in-breath or your inhalation happens
when<00:04:23.750> you're<00:04:23.900> moving<00:04:24.260> to<00:04:24.349> the

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
when you're moving to the

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.060 
when you're moving to the
and<00:04:25.310> then<00:04:26.310> when<00:04:26.490> you're<00:04:26.640> hitting<00:04:27.890> you<00:04:28.890> can

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
and then when you're hitting you can

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.640 
and then when you're hitting you can
exhale<00:04:29.430> and<00:04:29.910> what<00:04:30.570> that<00:04:30.720> does<00:04:30.900> is<00:04:31.080> calms<00:04:31.380> your

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
exhale and what that does is calms your

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.890 
exhale and what that does is calms your
muscles<00:04:32.040> and<00:04:32.250> connects<00:04:32.760> you<00:04:33.030> more<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:33.780> the

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
muscles and connects you more to the

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.500 
muscles and connects you more to the
shot<00:04:34.140> and<00:04:34.380> I<00:04:35.130> find<00:04:35.400> it<00:04:35.550> really<00:04:35.730> reduces<00:04:36.060> the

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
shot and I find it really reduces the

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.540 
shot and I find it really reduces the
miss<00:04:36.870> hit<00:04:37.050> so<00:04:37.290> at<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:37.500> back<00:04:37.650> line<00:04:37.950> in<00:04:38.190> breath

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
miss hit so at the back line in breath

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:45.110 
miss hit so at the back line in breath
out<00:04:39.740> breath<00:04:40.740> in<00:04:41.310> breath<00:04:41.940> out<00:04:43.220> breath<00:04:44.220> you<00:04:44.970> can

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
out breath in breath out breath you can

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.650 
out breath in breath out breath you can
do<00:04:45.240> it<00:04:45.360> any<00:04:45.720> shot<00:04:46.350> around<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:46.710> court<00:04:46.950> and

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
do it any shot around the court and

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.180 
do it any shot around the court and
sometimes<00:04:48.660> it<00:04:48.810> might<00:04:48.960> be<00:04:49.020> just<00:04:49.500> because<00:04:49.650> as

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
sometimes it might be just because as

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.220 
sometimes it might be just because as
you<00:04:50.340> get<00:04:50.490> more<00:04:50.610> tired<00:04:50.910> your<00:04:51.240> breath<00:04:51.540> gets<00:04:51.840> more

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
you get more tired your breath gets more

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.710 
you get more tired your breath gets more
shallow<00:04:52.530> and<00:04:52.800> faster<00:04:53.310> so<00:04:54.090> you<00:04:54.120> need<00:04:54.480> to

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
shallow and faster so you need to

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.440 
shallow and faster so you need to
sometimes<00:04:55.350> force<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:56.460> out<00:04:56.610> breath<00:04:56.880> so<00:04:57.300> it

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
sometimes force the out breath so it

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:05.540 
sometimes force the out breath so it
might<00:04:57.600> be<00:05:02.450> and<00:05:03.500> I'm<00:05:04.500> exaggerating<00:05:04.830> just<00:05:05.280> so

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
might be and I'm exaggerating just so

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.420 
might be and I'm exaggerating just so
you<00:05:05.610> can<00:05:05.820> hear<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:07.140> timing<00:05:07.620> but<00:05:07.830> think<00:05:08.190> about

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
you can hear the timing but think about

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.430 
you can hear the timing but think about
that<00:05:08.670> and<00:05:08.910> try<00:05:09.390> it<00:05:09.510> out<00:05:09.690> and<00:05:09.810> it's<00:05:09.960> really<00:05:10.140> neat

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
that and try it out and it's really neat

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.650 
that and try it out and it's really neat
to<00:05:10.470> experiment<00:05:11.310> and<00:05:11.490> to<00:05:11.580> realize<00:05:11.970> you

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
to experiment and to realize you

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.480 
to experiment and to realize you
probably<00:05:13.020> might<00:05:13.230> not<00:05:13.260> I<00:05:13.680> know<00:05:13.740> I<00:05:13.860> hadn't<00:05:14.400> even

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
probably might not I know I hadn't even

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.000 
probably might not I know I hadn't even
thought<00:05:14.640> of<00:05:14.910> that<00:05:15.210> before<00:05:15.450> I<00:05:15.690> was<00:05:16.470> instructed

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
thought of that before I was instructed

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.770 
thought of that before I was instructed
on<00:05:17.100> this<00:05:17.280> I<00:05:17.400> hadn't<00:05:17.670> even<00:05:17.730> really<00:05:18.090> been<00:05:18.450> aware

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
on this I hadn't even really been aware

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.840 
on this I hadn't even really been aware
of<00:05:18.930> my<00:05:19.080> breathing<00:05:19.140> during<00:05:19.680> the<00:05:19.890> rally<00:05:20.100> I<00:05:20.400> knew

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
of my breathing during the rally I knew

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.130 
of my breathing during the rally I knew
that<00:05:21.030> I<00:05:21.060> should<00:05:21.300> take<00:05:21.450> deep<00:05:21.690> breaths<00:05:21.930> in

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
that I should take deep breaths in

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.930 
that I should take deep breaths in
between<00:05:22.170> the<00:05:22.620> round<00:05:22.800> but<00:05:23.430> I<00:05:23.460> didn't<00:05:23.790> think

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
between the round but I didn't think

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.550 
between the round but I didn't think
about<00:05:24.090> what's<00:05:24.540> happening<00:05:24.930> with<00:05:24.960> my<00:05:25.170> breathing

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
about what's happening with my breathing

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.190 
about what's happening with my breathing
during<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:25.920> rally<00:05:26.390> so<00:05:27.390> try<00:05:27.600> those<00:05:27.750> tips<00:05:28.020> out

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
during the rally so try those tips out

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.760 
during the rally so try those tips out
