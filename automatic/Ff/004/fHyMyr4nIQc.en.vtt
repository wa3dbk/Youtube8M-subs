shot we're going to ask me some
questions<00:00:07.799> about<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.610> illusion<00:00:09.360> did<00:00:09.690> because

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
questions about the illusion did because

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.190 
questions about the illusion did because
Misha<00:00:10.530> goes<00:00:10.830> way<00:00:11.099> back<00:00:11.370> pre<00:00:11.820> illusion<00:00:12.300> days<00:00:12.509> so

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
Misha goes way back pre illusion days so

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.770 
Misha goes way back pre illusion days so
what<00:00:13.349> kind<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.710> person<00:00:13.920> was<00:00:14.280> i<00:00:14.460> before<00:00:14.969> when

that it's on browse on well so Misha

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.460 
that it's on browse on well so Misha
have<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.360> been<00:01:21.570> instrumental<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.320> your<00:01:22.770> life<00:01:23.009> oh

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
have I been instrumental in your life oh

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.249 
have I been instrumental in your life oh
really<00:01:25.470> yeah<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.490> going<00:01:26.759> through<00:01:26.940> some

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
really yeah it's going through some

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.719 
really yeah it's going through some
vibrational<00:01:28.259> breakdowns<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.069> you're<00:01:29.610> able

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
vibrational breakdowns and you're able

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.359 
vibrational breakdowns and you're able
to<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.090> pump<00:01:30.300> up<00:01:30.420> my<00:01:30.569> frequency<00:01:31.130> help<00:01:32.130> help

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
to like pump up my frequency help help

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.779 
to like pump up my frequency help help
me<00:01:32.460> vibrate<00:01:32.700> right<00:01:33.030> past<00:01:33.300> the<00:01:33.509> low<00:01:33.750> frequency

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
me vibrate right past the low frequency

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.580 
me vibrate right past the low frequency
you<00:01:35.789> know<00:01:35.909> slugs<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.720> are<00:01:36.840> trying<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.110> slow

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
you know slugs that are trying to slow

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.520 
you know slugs that are trying to slow
my<00:01:37.770> steez<00:01:38.190> down<00:01:38.520> basically<00:01:39.179> and<00:01:39.899> so<00:01:40.380> you're

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
my steez down basically and so you're

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.550 
my steez down basically and so you're
Steve's<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.190> its<00:01:41.670> back<00:01:41.940> on<00:01:42.140> its<00:01:43.140> back<00:01:43.380> high

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
Steve's is its back on its back high

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.070 
Steve's is its back on its back high
frequency<00:01:44.130> it's<00:01:44.490> vibrating<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.300> proper<00:01:45.690> you

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
frequency it's vibrating the proper you

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.570 
frequency it's vibrating the proper you
know<00:01:46.520> revs<00:01:47.520> per<00:01:47.789> minute<00:01:48.229> now<00:01:49.229> most<00:01:50.069> people<00:01:50.490> are

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
know revs per minute now most people are

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.070 
know revs per minute now most people are
confused<00:01:51.030> about<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.569> holographic

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
confused about the holographic

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.809 
confused about the holographic
experience<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.100> dream<00:01:53.310> what's<00:01:53.549> your

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
experience in the dream what's your

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:58.309 
experience in the dream what's your
interpretation<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:56.390> none<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.690> shit

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
interpretation of that none of this shit

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.429 
interpretation of that none of this shit
exists<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.420> you're<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.569> like<00:02:00.750> making<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.320> up

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
exists and you're just like making it up

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.590 
exists and you're just like making it up
in<00:02:01.560> your<00:02:01.590> mind<00:02:01.860> right<00:02:02.189> now<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.759> like<00:02:02.939> if<00:02:03.479> your

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
in your mind right now so like if your

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.999 
in your mind right now so like if your
vibrations<00:02:04.170> are<00:02:04.289> positive<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:04.829> the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
vibrations are positive and the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.230 
vibrations are positive and the
frequency<00:02:05.369> time<00:02:05.700> you're<00:02:05.880> going<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.030> have<00:02:06.180> a

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
frequency time you're going to have a

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.900 
frequency time you're going to have a
good<00:02:06.360> time<00:02:06.649> your<00:02:07.649> vibrations<00:02:08.310> are<00:02:08.459> negative

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
good time your vibrations are negative

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.880 
good time your vibrations are negative
and<00:02:09.000> your<00:02:09.149> frequency<00:02:09.630> is<00:02:09.780> low<00:02:10.019> you're<00:02:10.350> not

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
and your frequency is low you're not

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.080 
and your frequency is low you're not
going<00:02:11.070> to<00:02:11.130> be<00:02:11.220> having<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.519> good

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
going to be having a good
