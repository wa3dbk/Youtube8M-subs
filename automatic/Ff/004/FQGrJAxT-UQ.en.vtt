00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 (LEMMiNO) 

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 (Ten truths) 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 (Translation / Timeline: Maple Leaf Green Tea) 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.040
 In 1916, Ole Kirk Christiansen acquired a woodworking workshop in Denmark. 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.780
 They are specialized in construction and furniture. 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.260
 After a few years of commercial struggle 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.540
 If he still wants to survive in the industry, Ole must come up with something else. 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.240
 After several experiments, the workshop decided to switch to wooden toys. 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.699
 Change pigs, yo-yos, drag toys, toy cars, toy trucks and toy houses 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:44.980
 After World War II, Ole’s son, Godtfred, named it LEGO after working at the company. 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.260
 In 1947, Ole and Godfred made 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.839
 A sample of interlocking plastic blocks made by British company Kiddicraft 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.120
 Kiddicraft calls it Building Bricks (building blocks) 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.760
 Lego was inspired and they started producing their own blocks. 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.200
 They changed the name to Automatic Binding Bricks. 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:11.680
 In the past few years, the company's performance after Ole's death has grown geometrically under the leadership of his son Godfred. 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.940
 The business of producing wooden toys was completely abandoned. 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.600
 The company focuses on the production of plastics 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.020
 After Lego’s popularity in the building blocks, the Lego Park in Denmark opened. 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.920
 LEGO quickly became a well-known name in the world 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.259
 LEGO is made up of two Danish groups, Leg Godt, which means "play well." 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.620
 And although there was no other idea at first, I later found LEGO in Latin. 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.940
 Can be an abbreviation of "I will piece it together" or "I will combine it" 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.880
 They also considered using LEGIO, the word has the meaning of the toy legion. 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.880
 Another important component of LEGO is the Miniman. 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.520
 But the Miniman was invented 30 years after Lego’s appearance. 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.600
 The first appearance in 1978 was the image of a policeman in black uniform and white hat. 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.519
 To be honest, the design of the villain has been similar since then. 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.680
 Clothing has become more diversified and can be relaunched with a small change 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.260
 But in the 11 years since the launch, their faces are the same. 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.959
 Each of them is like this! 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.640
 Until 1989, they realized that it was a bit creepy. 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.339
 So it will become a new facial expression every time. 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.980
 More than 4 billion mini-persons have been manufactured to date. 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.680
 By the late 1990s, the company was gradually going downhill. 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.060
 The lowest point ever reached in 2004 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.440
 When they almost filed for bankruptcy, Lego saved himself. 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.680
 In fact, after playing the movie from Lego, Lego became the world's largest toy manufacturer. 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.840
 And since 1958 they have produced more than 560 billion blocks. 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.700
 In other words, in this world, everyone in the world can get an average of 78 Lego blocks. 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.360
 If you try to combine the 1958 Lego bricks with the current Lego bricks 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.580
 They can still fit the assembly 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.320
 This is because LEGO uses a general specification 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.340
 This means that even if they change the design, logo and purpose, they will still be compatible. 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.060
 Even the Duplo blocks that are multiplied by Lego blocks can be connected. 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:44.960
 Surprisingly, only 6 4x2 blocks can set up 915,103,765 possible changes. 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.800
 Lego bricks were used to build a lot of pretty amazing things. 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.140
 For example, the world's tallest LEGO composition is as high as 34.76 meters. 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:03.980
 Crazy car show host James May builds a real house with 3.3 million LEGO bricks 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.140
 This is definitely the biggest model that only uses LEGO. 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.160
 This is a 1:1 Star Wars X-wing fighter model. 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.719
 Used 5.3 million LEGO bricks and spent 4 months building 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:28.340
 According to Lego’s description, Lego’s only expression should be adjectives rather than nouns. 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.340
 So using LEGOS (Lego's plural) is the wrong usage. 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.039
 Should use LEGO Bricks to express 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:43.820
 Since 2007, huge mini-persons have been found on beaches around the world. 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.640
 OK, it’s weird, huge Lego... people 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.419
 Was washed ashore all over the world and wrote "Nothing is truer than you" 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.500
 (...I was smashed) Obviously this message means that you can’t believe the dog translation 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.240
 These things are believed to have been made by Dutch artist Ego Leonard. 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.780
 This rumor is almost possible to be fake. When you replace the first four alphabetical order, you will get LEGO. 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.200
 No one knows why he or she is doing this. 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.479
 However, the LEGO Group has repeatedly denied any connection with him. 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.960
 If you look at the top of the mini-person, you will find a hole in the top of their head. 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.419
 This is just in case the children accidentally swallowed the mini-head. 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.040
 Even if the villain is stuck in the throat, they can still breathe. 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.960
 Why does Lego play a movie that looks like a stop motion animation? 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.099
 This whole movie is actually made of animation. 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.140
 The entire production process is designed to make it look like stop motion 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.060
 Subtle depressions, gray spots, and even smudges and fingerprints on the model 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.200
 Lighting... Of course, and the most well-known stop motion animation 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.340
 Of course, the only exception is the live performance. 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.479
 But there is something very cool, they make sure every piece of the scene in the movie 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.160
 Also exists in the real world, so if you look at which scene 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.700
 You can also cover it yourself. 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.560
 Even this scene, every building, ground you see 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.800
 Are all spelled out by the unique digital Lego 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.980
 Do you want to know why you want to do this? 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.660
 ♫Every thing is awesome♫ because "everything is cool!" 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.660
 (thanks for watching)
