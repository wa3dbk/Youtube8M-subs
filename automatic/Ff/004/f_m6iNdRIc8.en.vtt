something<00:00:34.750> from<00:00:35.750> what<00:00:35.900> I<00:00:35.930> seem<00:00:36.200> to<00:00:36.410> picture

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
something from what I seem to picture

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.060 
something from what I seem to picture
yourself<00:00:37.510> I'll<00:00:38.510> really<00:00:38.900> read<00:00:39.080> like<00:00:39.350> rewards

yourself I'll really read like rewards
and<00:00:40.190> I<00:00:40.250> think<00:00:40.460> it's<00:00:40.550> like<00:00:40.760> God<00:00:40.970> swords<00:00:41.450> and

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
and I think it's like God swords and

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.920 
and I think it's like God swords and
stuff<00:00:42.130> so<00:00:43.130> hopefully<00:00:44.000> i<00:00:44.270> could<00:00:44.540> get<00:00:44.600> a<00:00:44.660> God's

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.450 
stuff so hopefully i could get a God's
Word<00:00:47.440> okay<00:00:48.440> let's<00:00:48.680> see<00:00:48.890> let's<00:00:49.070> check<00:00:49.310> this

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
Word okay let's see let's check this

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:56.980 
Word okay let's see let's check this
thing<00:00:49.670> out<00:00:50.710> okay<00:00:54.970> superb<00:00:55.970> high-level<00:00:56.570> deepens

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
thing out okay superb high-level deepens

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.940 
thing out okay superb high-level deepens
weapon<00:00:57.410> Jay<00:00:58.280> Marroquin<00:00:58.790> spear<00:00:59.680> and<00:01:00.680> what<00:01:00.890> you

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
weapon Jay Marroquin spear and what you

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.940 
weapon Jay Marroquin spear and what you
got<00:01:01.750> hmm<00:01:03.070> now<00:01:04.070> that<00:01:05.500> it's<00:01:06.500> like<00:01:06.620> a<00:01:06.710> light<00:01:06.920> that

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
got hmm now that it's like a light that

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.370 
got hmm now that it's like a light that
passes<00:01:07.280> through<00:01:07.550> it<00:01:07.790> so<00:01:07.910> it's<00:01:08.060> almost<00:01:08.150> like

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
passes through it so it's almost like

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.010 
passes through it so it's almost like
you<00:01:09.380> can<00:01:09.530> almost<00:01:09.680> time<00:01:10.040> it<00:01:10.720> so<00:01:11.720> it's<00:01:11.870> probably

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
you can almost time it so it's probably

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.250 
you can almost time it so it's probably
going<00:01:12.200> to<00:01:12.260> be<00:01:12.320> some<00:01:12.590> kind<00:01:12.860> of<00:01:13.360> not<00:01:14.360> something
