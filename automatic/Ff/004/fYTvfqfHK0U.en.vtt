00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 to take what Sam celebrated this year to 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.139
 manufacturing of 50 thousand planters since 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.090
 its foundation 65 years ago a moment 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.960
 history shared with your 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.730
 customers 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.600
 farmers from north to south of brazil 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.340
 who rely on the products of the class of 50 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.980
 thousand but it 's my fifth planter 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.910
 Armadillo is always confident in the brand 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.769
 present with them and always the group that 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.040
 is following the producer with mary 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.380
 until you are very confident with 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.660
 headquarters and factory in the municipality of 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.270
 interior of sÃ£o paulo to tatoo marquesan 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.180
 has a complete line of equipment 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:46.070
 for the preparation of soil and harvest with 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.950
 highlight for this harrow 8013 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.770
 geap crh that our team saw in 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.070
 operation in western Bahia in 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.109
 property of 10 thousand hectares 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:02.480
 making deep cuts in the soil of 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.480
 25 to 30 centimeters deep 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.030
 it helps this organic matter is the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:13.140
 rest of the matter what was planted this 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.680
 gain and incorporate and with that 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.200
 you pick it here it is played before 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.720
 incorporated there when it was planted in the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.700
 plant with adobe so she is already in the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.460
 Earth 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.310
 the pmt maize platform is another 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.829
 equipment and versatile tur 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.049
 proven efficiency in harvesting 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.200
 because it has angle of 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.119
 13 degree attack can be coupled I 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.060
 to any combine model 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.630
 and imported with spacing 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.329
 ranging from 45 to 90 centimeters between 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.610
 lines and number of lines ranging from 7 to 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.320
 15 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.299
 independent lines facilitate the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.420
 the handle rollers 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.860
 ensure better quality and 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.399
 harvest yield 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.829
 even at high speeds and for those who 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.439
 needs more productivity than 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.590
 agility in the field to take already 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.959
 developed a pmt platform 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.990
 articulated an engineering concept that 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.780
 helped 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:20.260
 Luthor to transport the platform without 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.620
 wasting my time is distributed in 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.000
 several lines and dashes are then 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.020
 Narrow roads 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.450
 then the need for the platform 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.480
 at least the width of the machine to be 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.410
 machine is already big so I searched 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:42.730
 for this and the facility has not hit 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:45.970
 in song and everything else 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.950
 and of course the strength of patton marquesan and 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.920
 is in its line of planters with 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.500
 highlight to the sap that meets the 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.280
 agricultural production with 15 models of 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.150
 chassis from 15 to 36 planting lines in 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.820
 spacing of 45 to 90 centimeters 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.460
 lines easy to carry 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.220
 the usaf of the class that zhan owns a chassis 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.980
 articulated front panel with 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.910
 transport of only 6.3 meters and 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.610
 working width of maximum 14,19 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.340
 meters with fully automatic 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:26.770
 hydraulics for opening and closing the 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.000
 which today has more than 500 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.310
 products which in their various 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.200
 from 5 thousand is one of the 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.910
 specialist company in each product that 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.850
 she does it covers from the preparation of the 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.560
 soil until planting and today also 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.960
 part of the grain harvest does 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.300
 harvesting platforms for maize and 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.800
 also in the cane area we have 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.440
 a very large cane line and is a 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.110
 company is always looking for the 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.640
 best for the Brazilian farmer to 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.440
 that the Brazilian farmer can 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.390
 reduce your costs improve your 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.390
 efficiency and produce more and more
