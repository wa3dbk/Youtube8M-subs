00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
did so I don't know if you can tell but

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.069 
did so I don't know if you can tell but
the<00:00:31.019> screen<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.349> backlit<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.960> this<00:00:33.960> is

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
the screen is backlit and this is

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.209 
the screen is backlit and this is
actually<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.350> pretty<00:00:34.530> sweet<00:00:34.770> backlight

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
actually a pretty sweet backlight

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.389 
actually a pretty sweet backlight
because<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.270> can<00:00:36.450> control<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.800> RGB

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
