double-a batteries not sure what the
battery<00:04:06.000> life<00:04:06.209> is<00:04:06.450> I<00:04:06.720> guess<00:04:06.989> it<00:04:07.110> depends<00:04:07.410> on

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
battery life is I guess it depends on

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.150 
battery life is I guess it depends on
how<00:04:07.709> loud<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.100> have<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:08.570> and<00:04:09.570> there<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:09.989> go

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.370 
this is something you should look into
at<00:07:00.940> least<00:07:01.060> some<00:07:01.419> type<00:07:01.599> of<00:07:01.630> amplifier<00:07:01.870> that

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:02.380 
at least some type of amplifier that

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.580 
at least some type of amplifier that
creates<00:07:03.250> such<00:07:03.580> a<00:07:03.610> dynamic<00:07:03.849> and<00:07:04.539> fun<00:07:04.840> and<00:07:05.199> and

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:05.590 
creates such a dynamic and fun and and

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.939 
creates such a dynamic and fun and and
very<00:07:06.130> colored<00:07:06.550> sound<00:07:07.539> and<00:07:08.139> colored<00:07:08.500> I<00:07:08.650> mean

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:08.949 
very colored sound and colored I mean

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:11.070 
very colored sound and colored I mean
it's<00:07:09.220> not<00:07:09.460> going<00:07:09.789> to<00:07:09.880> be<00:07:10.000> a<00:07:10.030> very<00:07:10.389> flat<00:07:10.720> neutral

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 
it's not going to be a very flat neutral

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.110 
it's not going to be a very flat neutral
sound<00:07:11.530> it's<00:07:11.800> it's<00:07:12.220> going<00:07:12.460> to<00:07:12.550> have<00:07:12.759> some<00:07:12.940> type

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 
sound it's it's going to have some type

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.580 
sound it's it's going to have some type
of<00:07:13.150> oomph<00:07:13.479> to<00:07:13.720> it<00:07:13.750> you're<00:07:14.080> going<00:07:14.169> to<00:07:14.229> have<00:07:14.349> some

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:14.590 
of oomph to it you're going to have some

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.670 
of oomph to it you're going to have some
meat<00:07:14.800> behind<00:07:15.160> it<00:07:15.340> you<00:07:15.430> know<00:07:16.289> if<00:07:17.289> you're<00:07:17.500> into

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 
meat behind it you know if you're into

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.559 
meat behind it you know if you're into
that<00:07:17.710> sort<00:07:17.860> of<00:07:18.099> thing<00:07:18.190> you<00:07:19.030> should<00:07:19.210> definitely

00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:19.569 
that sort of thing you should definitely

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:21.080 
that sort of thing you should definitely
look<00:07:19.660> into<00:07:19.780> this<00:07:20.110> read<00:07:20.410> some<00:07:20.560> more<00:07:20.680> reviews

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.090 
look into this read some more reviews

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.219 
look into this read some more reviews
but<00:07:22.090> like<00:07:22.240> I<00:07:22.270> said<00:07:22.419> it's<00:07:22.840> just<00:07:23.020> got<00:07:23.199> a

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:23.229 
but like I said it's just got a

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:26.040 
but like I said it's just got a
ridiculously<00:07:23.889> wide<00:07:24.190> soundstage<00:07:24.780> color<00:07:25.780> is

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.050 
ridiculously wide soundstage color is

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.620 
ridiculously wide soundstage color is
very<00:07:26.500> rich<00:07:26.770> details<00:07:27.490> are<00:07:27.669> there<00:07:27.819> it's<00:07:28.419> not

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:28.630 
very rich details are there it's not

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.029 
very rich details are there it's not
really<00:07:28.810> missing<00:07:29.110> anything<00:07:29.319> it's<00:07:29.590> an<00:07:29.710> all<00:07:29.889> in

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:30.039 
really missing anything it's an all in

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:32.129 
really missing anything it's an all in
one<00:07:30.069> great<00:07:30.490> package<00:07:30.699> just<00:07:31.180> despite<00:07:31.750> its<00:07:31.960> low

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:32.139 
one great package just despite its low

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:35.430 
one great package just despite its low
price<00:07:32.440> so<00:07:32.940> give<00:07:33.940> it<00:07:34.060> a<00:07:34.120> chance<00:07:34.360> and<00:07:34.690> again<00:07:35.229> if

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 
price so give it a chance and again if

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.230 
price so give it a chance and again if
you're<00:07:35.620> a<00:07:35.680> headphone<00:07:36.099> guy<00:07:36.340> or<00:07:36.669> headphone<00:07:37.000> girl

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:37.240 
you're a headphone guy or headphone girl

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.059 
you're a headphone guy or headphone girl
and<00:07:37.569> you<00:07:37.690> just<00:07:37.990> don't<00:07:38.560> really<00:07:38.740> care<00:07:39.009> for

00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:39.069 
and you just don't really care for

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:41.339 
and you just don't really care for
desktop<00:07:39.580> amplifiers<00:07:40.120> but<00:07:40.389> maybe<00:07:40.750> you're

00:07:41.339 --> 00:07:41.349 
desktop amplifiers but maybe you're

00:07:41.349 --> 00:07:43.200 
desktop amplifiers but maybe you're
considering<00:07:41.830> getting<00:07:41.979> to<00:07:42.220> one<00:07:42.400> look<00:07:43.060> into

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:43.210 
considering getting to one look into

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.920 
considering getting to one look into
