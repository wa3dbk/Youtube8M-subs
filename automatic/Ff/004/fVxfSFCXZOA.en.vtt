scanner so you can actually just send me

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.430 
scanner so you can actually just send me
the<00:03:40.979> design<00:03:41.400> on<00:03:41.669> paper<00:03:42.030> like<00:03:42.359> this<00:03:42.629> once<00:03:43.260> I

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
the design on paper like this once I

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.349 
the design on paper like this once I
receive<00:03:43.829> it<00:03:44.010> I<00:03:44.159> scan<00:03:44.639> it<00:03:44.669> into<00:03:45.180> my<00:03:45.299> computer

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
receive it I scan it into my computer

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.259 
receive it I scan it into my computer
and<00:03:46.079> then<00:03:46.560> from<00:03:46.829> there<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.040> vectorize<00:03:47.819> it<00:03:48.120> and

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
and then from there I vectorize it and

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.729 
and then from there I vectorize it and
all<00:03:48.359> that<00:03:48.569> other<00:03:48.690> stuff<00:03:48.840> if<00:03:49.229> you<00:03:49.319> guys<00:03:49.440> don't

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
all that other stuff if you guys don't

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.750 
all that other stuff if you guys don't
know<00:03:49.889> what<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.370> vector<00:03:50.699> is<00:03:52.099> go<00:03:53.099> google<00:03:53.459> it<00:03:53.579> it's

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
know what a vector is go google it it's

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.550 
know what a vector is go google it it's
ve<00:03:54.500> ctor<00:03:55.500> vector<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.780> yeah<00:03:57.780> pretty<00:03:58.049> much<00:03:58.229> in<00:03:58.470> a

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
ve ctor vector and yeah pretty much in a

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.069 
ve ctor vector and yeah pretty much in a
nutshell<00:03:58.590> what<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.280> is<00:03:59.400> is<00:03:59.669> it's<00:03:59.909> taking<00:04:00.870> all

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
nutshell what it is is it's taking all

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.930 
nutshell what it is is it's taking all
the<00:04:01.199> pixels<00:04:01.709> in<00:04:01.949> the<00:04:02.040> image<00:04:02.069> and<00:04:02.549> it<00:04:02.639> smooths

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
the pixels in the image and it smooths

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.319 
the pixels in the image and it smooths
them<00:04:03.419> out<00:04:03.629> so<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:05.220> end<00:04:05.400> result<00:04:05.760> is<00:04:05.879> a<00:04:05.940> really

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
them out so the end result is a really

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.770 
them out so the end result is a really
crisp<00:04:06.780> clean<00:04:07.440> image<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.970> process<00:04:09.419> does<00:04:09.750> take

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
crisp clean image the process does take

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.339 
crisp clean image the process does take
a<00:04:10.079> while<00:04:10.199> but<00:04:10.739> I<00:04:10.949> always<00:04:11.459> do<00:04:11.609> on<00:04:11.940> every<00:04:12.319> set<00:04:13.319> of

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
a while but I always do on every set of

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:15.589 
a while but I always do on every set of
prints<00:04:13.680> that<00:04:13.859> I<00:04:13.889> make<00:04:14.129> for<00:04:14.370> people<00:04:14.549> just<00:04:15.389> so<00:04:15.540> I

they're<00:05:55.259> called<00:05:55.500> thermal<00:05:55.919> prints<00:05:56.189> because

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
they're called thermal prints because

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.600 
they're called thermal prints because
the<00:05:56.669> image<00:05:56.939> is<00:05:57.060> actually<00:05:57.270> burnt<00:05:57.870> on<00:05:58.520> using<00:05:59.520> a

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
the image is actually burnt on using a

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:05.570 
the image is actually burnt on using a
special<00:06:00.089> laser<00:06:00.990> printer<00:06:01.580> so<00:06:04.399> pretty<00:06:05.399> much

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
special laser printer so pretty much

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.459 
special laser printer so pretty much
what<00:06:05.789> that<00:06:05.819> means<00:06:06.180> is<00:06:06.449> if<00:06:06.629> you<00:06:06.779> stick<00:06:07.080> these<00:06:07.259> up

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:07.469 
what that means is if you stick these up

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:10.600 
what that means is if you stick these up
outside<00:06:07.949> the<00:06:08.759> black<00:06:09.089> will<00:06:09.509> never<00:06:09.990> fade<00:06:10.529> away

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
outside the black will never fade away

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.659 
outside the black will never fade away
like<00:06:11.610> it<00:06:12.089> takes<00:06:12.419> years<00:06:13.020> and<00:06:13.139> years<00:06:13.490> for<00:06:14.490> this

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:14.669 
like it takes years and years for this

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:16.490 
like it takes years and years for this
black<00:06:14.969> to<00:06:15.210> fade<00:06:15.389> away<00:06:15.419> because<00:06:15.930> it's<00:06:16.080> actually

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
black to fade away because it's actually

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.100 
black to fade away because it's actually
burnt<00:06:16.770> into<00:06:17.310> the<00:06:17.520> sticker<00:06:17.819> as<00:06:18.120> you<00:06:18.719> guys<00:06:18.870> can
