00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.790
 all right 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.790
 I have a notice for you 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.530
 tutorial where we're going to learn something very 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.050
 useful to how to increase our memory 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.270
 internal that that is something that helps us 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.230
 a lot because a lot of us have 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.450
 many applications on the mobile then 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.309
 that helps us help us to be able to 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.070
 have enough applications in the mobile 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.350
 without any problem obviously like everything 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.660
 procedure that is useful 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.970
 we need requirements first let's go 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.230
 to need to have the participated memory 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:00.309
 then obviously it's the router 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.870
 have blood explore and that's it 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.220
 what do we need 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.220
 the last link 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.500
 good when we have all those 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.860
 requirements already ready we are going to 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.250
 proceed with the installation 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.960
 well let's start with the tutorial 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.060
 first what we are going to do is good 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.710
 as I had told you before, you have to 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.270
 have the memory participated in all 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.270
 let's go to the link tour or cd 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.429
 and he's going to ask us for root access and he's going to 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.429
 allow 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.970
 and well there's this 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.480
 if you are the first time you had it 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.270
 I was going to ask you to select the former 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.520
 the former two former prisoners 4 I recommend them 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.860
 the sixth if it's the first time I had it 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.340
 I already had it in this program 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.300
 so good this first what we're going 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.340
 to do let's go 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.500
 and here this button here we're going 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.040
 let's go to posts once we 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.960
 let's go to tastes let's say of 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.960
 select all the options that 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.210
 let's have for example here we have all 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.010
 the options are going to uncheck all 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.530
 those that all the options that there are win 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.090
 in in configurations we are going to 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.020
 uncheck were once we do it 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.530
 unchecked let's go to the blood 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.530
 explorer 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.010
 once we go to bluetooth 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.010
 flower we are going to date 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:47.640
 here in data we are going to go in data to x2 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.640
 and we look 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.040
 here it is 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.769
 here is that of texts as you can see 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.310
 I will show them to you and if you can see it 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:02.249
 come in there says s of x2 well let's go to 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:06.709
 select select is and we will 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:06.709
 appear some folders 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.409
 how can you see some folders that 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.269
 they call app to private and david cache such 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:15.549
 you may not see them maybe 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.620
 appear 11 what we are going to do 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.900
 we are going to erase all the 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.860
 we are going to erase them 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.450
 yes 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.450
 this also in my hand 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.150
 regular 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.189
 and yes 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:39.340
 then what we are going to do is go 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:44.079
 back and in data we're going to go find the 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:47.870
 these folders and I will accept app 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:51.560
 then the 2nd private and even below which 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:54.909
 says such a big cache those three are the ones 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.769
 we are going to occupy you, we are going to give you here in 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.890
 all these configurations and we're going to 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:03.459
 give to him that he is multiple choice 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.459
 then we select 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.040
 a private 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.300
 and the viking we have to stay like this 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.660
 those three selected that we're going to 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:19.660
 to do is to give copy 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.660
 and we 're going to go to that one of x2 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:27.639
 once we are in that of x2 we are going to 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.639
 attach those folders 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.870
 we are going to paste those folders as they can 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.380
 see is hitting is going to take a little 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.750
 I had to pause but well there 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:45.650
 keep hitting 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.200
 Well this will have already pasted the 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.640
 files once they have stuck to 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.480
 the archives we are going to proceed to do 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.889
 something we are going to leave strip ado the folder 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:59.789
 first the 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:01.710
 and we're going to go down below where 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:04.229
 I'm going to show you how you can 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.229
 see below let's go and create link to this 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:10.770
 folder then let's select that 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:13.320
 last and we're going to give you the first 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.800
 It is the one with little dots 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.080
 and we are going to give you here to create link in the 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.670
 button down here that says create 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.790
 link that is almost not seen because it was 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:27.390
 with black letters create link and there we 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:29.670
 is going to say the alert and so up already exists 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.750
 want to continue and try so much we are going to 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.030
 yes 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.700
 stuck a process and ready once you 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:40.080
 has stuck let's go back to go as / d 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.080
 s / d ext 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.870
 but good again to that of ex and now 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:50.490
 let's do the same with a private 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:53.490
 we are going to give you create link to this 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.379
 folder the one below down and we're going to 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.449
 select the one of the points and we're going 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:06:01.159
 to give that was the link we're going to see 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.159
 yes and ready 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.470
 once we've done this we'll go 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.230
 to give home button 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.780
 and let's check to see if it goes like this if 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.400
 the task manager to see if it 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.810
 it was open as you can see the gross 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.270
 explore zizic open we're going to 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.040
 finalize how and we will go out to 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.080
 say now what are we going to proceed to 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.820
 to do is that we have to restart the 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.820
 phone at least twice 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:32.070
 let's pay now let's accept it 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:34.140
 let's reset the phone so 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:37.770
 less about twice once we have 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:40.250
 done this let's go back to turn off 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.250
 manually 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:46.180
 to accept 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:49.620
 and we will pay again manually and 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.510
 let's manually restart 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.350
 and good once we have already 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:57.720
 restarted manually again and already 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.270
 we will have turned on the terminal and go 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:05.150
 to the test we will leave strip by button 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:05.150
 home we go to task manager 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.289
 and then go to task manager 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:16.270
 we are going to go to the area not 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.850
 storage as you say 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:21.550
 let's see that and how can you see how 

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.800
 can you top that says notice 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.050
 storage that in the internal memory 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.820
 As you can see, this is practically 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.680
 empty and before doing this 

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:32.100
 procedure was always full 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:35.080
 also how can you see the tutorial has 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:37.810
 completely served, they have almost no 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.780
 memory is full to the internal this is 

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:43.270
 certain tutorial dele I liked to subscribe 

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.190
 and do not forget to be on notice me 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.530
 channel to see if new videos so that the 

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:51.330
 stereo of you to improve your 

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.330
 experience on android see you later 

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.890
 look 

00:07:58.229 --> 00:08:01.229
 and 

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:07.040
 the snow
