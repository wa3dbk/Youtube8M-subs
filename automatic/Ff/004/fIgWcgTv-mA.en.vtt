this<00:00:00.390> video<00:00:00.750> talks<00:00:01.079> which<00:00:01.410> can<00:00:01.620> lead<00:00:01.860> to

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
this video talks which can lead to

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.849 
this video talks which can lead to
eisenmenger's<00:00:02.550> syndrome<00:00:02.580> and<00:00:03.240> how<00:00:03.990> surgery

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
eisenmenger's syndrome and how surgery

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.519 
eisenmenger's syndrome and how surgery
is<00:00:04.980> important<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:05.580> ASD<00:00:06.270> and<00:00:06.450> all<00:00:06.960> those<00:00:07.230> thing

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
is important to ASD and all those thing

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.919 
is important to ASD and all those thing
talking<00:00:08.160> about<00:00:08.340> all<00:00:08.550> of<00:00:08.580> them<00:00:08.910> starting<00:00:09.780> from

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
talking about all of them starting from

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.530 
talking about all of them starting from
ASD<00:00:10.500> so<00:00:11.040> what<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.370> is<00:00:11.750> there<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:13.049> an<00:00:13.500> opening

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
ASD so what is is there is an opening

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.660 
ASD so what is is there is an opening
between<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.809> two<00:00:16.020> H's<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.650> flow<00:00:16.920> from<00:00:17.550> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
between the two H's to flow from the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.939 
between the two H's to flow from the
left<00:00:17.910> side<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.690> right<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.380> left<00:00:19.590> side

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
left side to the right to the left side

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.769 
left side to the right to the left side
it's<00:00:20.400> because<00:00:20.730> pressure<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.390> left<00:00:21.570> side

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
it's because pressure in the left side

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.990 
it's because pressure in the left side
right<00:00:21.930> side<00:00:22.170> causing<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.920> flow<00:00:23.519> from<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
right side causing the flow from the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.880 
right side causing the flow from the
left<00:00:24.180> side<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.689> as<00:00:24.900> there<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> right

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
left side so as there is a to the right

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.089 
left side so as there is a to the right
side<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.730> think<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.330> pressure<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:28.099> in

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
side to think that the pressure in in

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.030 
side to think that the pressure in in
the<00:00:29.609> right<00:00:29.970> term<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.330> going<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.570> increase<00:00:31.040> then

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the right term is going to increase then

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.610 
the right term is going to increase then
it<00:00:32.160> should<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.640> mean<00:00:33.329> pathologically<00:00:34.170> yes<00:00:34.469> it

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
it should I mean pathologically yes it

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.959 
it should I mean pathologically yes it
went<00:00:34.829> because<00:00:34.950> there<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.280> more<00:00:35.489> blood<00:00:35.640> flow

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
went because there is more blood flow

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.630 
went because there is more blood flow
and<00:00:36.870> don't<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.649> think<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.980> pressure<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
and don't you think the pressure in the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.250 
and don't you think the pressure in the
right<00:00:38.820> ventricle<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.480> more<00:00:39.930> than<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.200> should

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
right ventricle is more than it should

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.830 
right ventricle is more than it should
absolutely<00:00:40.980> as<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.969> saw<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.180> pressure<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
absolutely as I saw the pressure in the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.540 
absolutely as I saw the pressure in the
pulmonary<00:00:43.020> artery<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.920> also<00:00:44.340> going<00:00:44.489> to

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
pulmonary artery is also going to

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.180 
pulmonary artery is also going to
increase<00:00:44.879> more<00:00:45.239> than<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.600> should<00:00:45.629> right<00:00:46.559> this

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
increase more than it should right this

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.000 
increase more than it should right this
causes<00:00:47.670> pulmonary<00:00:48.239> hypertension<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.500> over

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
causes pulmonary hypertension and over

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.850 
causes pulmonary hypertension and over
time<00:00:50.250> what<00:00:50.399> happens<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.059> there<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.300> media

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
time what happens is there is media

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.580 
time what happens is there is media
medial<00:00:52.860> hyper<00:00:53.309> V<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.899> pulmonary<00:00:55.140> vessels

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
medial hyper V of the pulmonary vessels

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.060 
medial hyper V of the pulmonary vessels
okay<00:00:56.100> there<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.370> laminated<00:00:57.050> menial

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
okay there is laminated menial

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.950 
okay there is laminated menial
hypertrophy<00:00:59.070> yes<00:00:59.760> Emily<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.300> game<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.539> wort

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
hypertrophy yes Emily is a game of wort

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.840 
hypertrophy yes Emily is a game of wort
so<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.800> be<00:01:01.890> familiar<00:01:02.399> with<00:01:02.550> some<00:01:02.760> of

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
so you have to be familiar with some of

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.910 
so you have to be familiar with some of
the<00:01:02.969> terms<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.359> they<00:01:03.570> use<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.379> whenever<00:01:04.619> we

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
the terms that they use so whenever we

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.890 
the terms that they use so whenever we
are<00:01:04.979> saying<00:01:05.250> medial<00:01:05.760> hypertrophy<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
are saying medial hypertrophy of the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.510 
are saying medial hypertrophy of the
pulmonary<00:01:07.110> vessels<00:01:07.530> don't<00:01:07.979> be<00:01:08.159> surprised<00:01:08.490> if

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
pulmonary vessels don't be surprised if

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.030 
pulmonary vessels don't be surprised if
they<00:01:08.760> say<00:01:08.909> laminated<00:01:09.720> medial<00:01:10.080> hypertrophy<00:01:10.680> so

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
they say laminated medial hypertrophy so

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.950 
they say laminated medial hypertrophy so
as<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> result<00:01:11.580> what<00:01:11.939> happens<00:01:11.970> as<00:01:12.600> there<00:01:12.840> is

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
as a result what happens as there is

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.950 
as a result what happens as there is
pulmonary<00:01:13.530> vascular<00:01:14.159> resistance<00:01:14.810> because<00:01:15.810> of

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
pulmonary vascular resistance because of

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.240 
pulmonary vascular resistance because of
increased<00:01:16.439> blood<00:01:16.680> flow

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
increased blood flow

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.980 
increased blood flow
the<00:01:17.580> reason<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> reversal<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.630> going<00:01:18.840> to

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
the reason the reversal is going to

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.300 
the reason the reversal is going to
increase<00:01:20.509> as<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:22.229> problem<00:01:22.740> becomes<00:01:23.040> more

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
increase as this problem becomes more

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.370 
increase as this problem becomes more
and<00:01:23.520> more<00:01:23.670> severe<00:01:24.180> pulmonary<00:01:24.930> resistance

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
and more severe pulmonary resistance

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.179 
and more severe pulmonary resistance
becomes<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.460> bad<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.750> very<00:01:28.619> little<00:01:28.979> blood

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
becomes so bad that very little blood

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.830 
becomes so bad that very little blood
flow<00:01:29.460> goes<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.450> lungs

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
flow goes to the lungs

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.340 
flow goes to the lungs
that's<00:01:31.530> when<00:01:31.950> also<00:01:32.549> there<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.509> reversal<00:01:34.229> of

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
that's when also there is reversal of

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.710 
that's when also there is reversal of
shunt<00:01:34.740> right<00:01:35.460> from<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.030> right<00:01:36.210> side<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
shunt right from the right side to the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.740 
shunt right from the right side to the
left<00:01:36.810> side<00:01:37.200> because<00:01:37.530> there<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.799> also<00:01:38.750> right

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
left side because there is also right

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
left side because there is also right
ventricular<00:01:39.990> hypertrophy<00:01:40.790> there<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:42.770> right

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
ventricular hypertrophy there is right

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.620 
ventricular hypertrophy there is right
atrial<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.399> particular<00:01:44.850> all<00:01:45.060> these<00:01:45.329> is

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
atrial have particular all these is

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.960 
atrial have particular all these is
causing<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.470> reversal<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.100> shunt<00:01:47.430> from<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
causing a reversal of shunt from the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.819 
causing a reversal of shunt from the
right<00:01:48.149> side<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.570> left<00:01:48.869> side<00:01:49.020> which<00:01:49.560> we

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
right side to the left side which we

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.620 
right side to the left side which we
classically<00:01:50.579> known<00:01:50.820> as<00:01:50.970> Eisenmenger

syndrome<00:01:52.369> as<00:01:53.369> has<00:01:53.759> become<00:01:54.119> progressively<00:01:54.750> bad

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
syndrome as has become progressively bad

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.030 
syndrome as has become progressively bad
the<00:01:56.369> late<00:01:56.610> onset<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.329> Eisenmenger<00:01:57.990> syndrome

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
the late onset of Eisenmenger syndrome

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.389 
the late onset of Eisenmenger syndrome
we<00:01:59.040> are<00:01:59.130> going<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.399> see<00:01:59.700> clubbing<00:02:01.250> we're<00:02:02.250> gonna

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
we are going to see clubbing we're gonna

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.059 
we are going to see clubbing we're gonna
see<00:02:02.729> polycythemia<00:02:05.299> and<00:02:06.619> we're<00:02:07.619> gonna<00:02:07.770> see

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
see polycythemia and we're gonna see

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.750 
see polycythemia and we're gonna see
cyanosis

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.760 
cyanosis

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.660 
cyanosis
these<00:02:10.760> are<00:02:11.060> late<00:02:11.750> onset<00:02:12.140> of<00:02:12.860> eisenmenger's

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
these are late onset of eisenmenger's

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.840 
these are late onset of eisenmenger's
syndrome<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:14.780> late<00:02:15.140> onset<00:02:15.920> ah<00:02:18.850> Eisenmenger

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
syndrome so late onset ah Eisenmenger

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.590 
syndrome so late onset ah Eisenmenger
syndrome<00:02:20.530> so<00:02:21.530> now<00:02:22.100> let's<00:02:22.430> talk<00:02:22.700> about<00:02:23.030> surgery

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
syndrome so now let's talk about surgery

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.560 
syndrome so now let's talk about surgery
so<00:02:24.080> what<00:02:24.260> happened<00:02:24.740> there<00:02:25.490> is<00:02:25.610> changed<00:02:26.090> in<00:02:26.360> the

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
so what happened there is changed in the

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.750 
so what happened there is changed in the
Palmer<00:02:26.990> pulmonary<00:02:27.650> vessels<00:02:27.860> there<00:02:28.670> is

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
Palmer pulmonary vessels there is

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.760 
Palmer pulmonary vessels there is
changed<00:02:29.120> in<00:02:29.210> the<00:02:29.330> right<00:02:29.510> ventricle<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:30.200> the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
changed in the right ventricle and the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.850 
changed in the right ventricle and the
right<00:02:31.520> atrium<00:02:31.760> right<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.750> three<00:02:32.960> spots<00:02:33.590> have

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
right atrium right the three spots have

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.670 
right atrium right the three spots have
just<00:02:34.070> because<00:02:34.370> of<00:02:34.550> the<00:02:34.900> because<00:02:35.900> of<00:02:35.960> the<00:02:36.170> ASD

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
just because of the because of the ASD

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.040 
just because of the because of the ASD
now<00:02:37.400> with<00:02:37.850> surgery<00:02:38.950> we<00:02:39.950> need<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:40.340> do<00:02:40.520> surgery

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
now with surgery we need to do surgery

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.800 
now with surgery we need to do surgery
before<00:02:42.050> it<00:02:42.350> gets<00:02:42.650> really<00:02:42.920> really<00:02:43.040> bad<00:02:43.490> and<00:02:44.450> the

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
before it gets really really bad and the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.500 
before it gets really really bad and the
surgery<00:02:45.260> should<00:02:45.500> close<00:02:45.950> our<00:02:46.280> ASD<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.420> the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
surgery should close our ASD and the

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.410 
surgery should close our ASD and the
reason<00:02:48.260> we<00:02:48.380> need<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.650> do<00:02:48.770> surgery<00:02:49.040> because<00:02:49.640> we

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
reason we need to do surgery because we

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.470 
reason we need to do surgery because we
need<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.780> protect<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.650> heart<00:02:51.920> from<00:02:52.480> having

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
need to protect the heart from having

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.040 
need to protect the heart from having
too<00:02:53.780> much<00:02:55.330> hypertrophy<00:02:56.330> in<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.630> pulmonary

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
too much hypertrophy in the pulmonary

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.710 
too much hypertrophy in the pulmonary
artery<00:02:57.830> we<00:02:58.160> don't<00:02:58.340> want<00:02:58.580> too<00:02:58.910> much<00:02:59.210> hyper<00:02:59.480> tip

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
artery we don't want too much hyper tip

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.210 
artery we don't want too much hyper tip
in<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.930> pulmonary<00:03:00.350> artery<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:00.740> we<00:03:00.920> want<00:03:01.130> to

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
in the pulmonary artery and we want to

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.220 
in the pulmonary artery and we want to
make<00:03:01.400> sure<00:03:01.700> that<00:03:02.180> that<00:03:02.360> does<00:03:02.540> not<00:03:02.570> happen<00:03:02.750> and

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
make sure that that does not happen and

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.860 
make sure that that does not happen and
the<00:03:03.290> reason<00:03:04.070> we<00:03:04.370> are<00:03:04.580> more<00:03:04.970> concerned<00:03:05.570> about

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
the reason we are more concerned about

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.250 
the reason we are more concerned about
the<00:03:06.680> pulmonary<00:03:07.130> artery<00:03:07.580> rather<00:03:08.240> than<00:03:08.690> the

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
the pulmonary artery rather than the

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.810 
the pulmonary artery rather than the
left<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.740> the<00:03:09.800> right<00:03:10.040> ventricular

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
left and the right ventricular

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.020 
left and the right ventricular
hypertrophy<00:03:11.060> is<00:03:11.600> because<00:03:12.050> this<00:03:13.010> change<00:03:13.610> is

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
hypertrophy is because this change is

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.820 
hypertrophy is because this change is
irreversible<00:03:16.180> this<00:03:17.180> change<00:03:17.690> is<00:03:17.930> reversible

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
irreversible this change is reversible

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.050 
irreversible this change is reversible
okay<00:03:19.400> so<00:03:20.030> if<00:03:20.330> we<00:03:20.360> correct<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:22.040> ASD<00:03:22.610> if<00:03:22.790> we

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
okay so if we correct the ASD if we

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.290 
okay so if we correct the ASD if we
close<00:03:23.360> the<00:03:23.600> ASD<00:03:23.990> with<00:03:24.140> surgery<00:03:24.680> that<00:03:25.610> is<00:03:26.000> not

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
close the ASD with surgery that is not

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.100 
close the ASD with surgery that is not
going<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:26.930> lead<00:03:27.170> to<00:03:27.440> so<00:03:27.770> much<00:03:27.820> pulmonary

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
going to lead to so much pulmonary

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.530 
going to lead to so much pulmonary
resistance<00:03:30.110> and<00:03:30.800> the<00:03:31.550> heart<00:03:31.790> will<00:03:32.030> eventually

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
resistance and the heart will eventually

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.160 
resistance and the heart will eventually
get<00:03:33.350> back<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:33.890> normal<00:03:34.130> morphology<00:03:35.120> right<00:03:35.660> but

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
get back to normal morphology right but

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.590 
get back to normal morphology right but
if<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.830> situation<00:03:37.040> becomes<00:03:37.400> so<00:03:37.880> bad<00:03:38.180> if<00:03:38.420> we

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
if the situation becomes so bad if we

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.930 
if the situation becomes so bad if we
let<00:03:38.810> this<00:03:38.989> get<00:03:39.290> so<00:03:39.950> bad<00:03:40.220> that<00:03:40.250> we<00:03:40.640> don't<00:03:40.820> do

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
let this get so bad that we don't do

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.940 
let this get so bad that we don't do
anything<00:03:41.209> with<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.630> ase<00:03:42.110> and<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.830> ACE

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
anything with the ase and the ACE

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.500 
anything with the ase and the ACE
remains<00:03:43.550> and<00:03:43.790> there<00:03:43.940> is<00:03:44.060> pulmonary

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
remains and there is pulmonary

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.010 
remains and there is pulmonary
hypertension<00:03:45.850> keep<00:03:46.850> on<00:03:47.060> happening<00:03:47.330> and<00:03:47.870> there

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
hypertension keep on happening and there

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.540 
hypertension keep on happening and there
is<00:03:48.140> hypertrophy<00:03:48.680> of<00:03:48.770> the<00:03:48.890> pulmonary<00:03:49.160> vessels

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
is hypertrophy of the pulmonary vessels

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.570 
is hypertrophy of the pulmonary vessels
this<00:03:50.590> situation<00:03:51.590> is<00:03:51.709> going<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.040> be<00:03:52.160> reversible

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
this situation is going to be reversible

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.300 
this situation is going to be reversible
and<00:03:52.940> and<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:54.290> patient<00:03:54.650> can<00:03:54.680> die<00:03:54.920> from<00:03:55.160> heart

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
and and the patient can die from heart

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.100 
and and the patient can die from heart
failure<00:03:55.430> right<00:03:56.090> so<00:03:56.390> we<00:03:56.510> want<00:03:56.690> to<00:03:56.780> prevent

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
failure right so we want to prevent

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.350 
failure right so we want to prevent
pulmonary<00:03:57.550> hypertension<00:03:58.550> that<00:03:58.790> is<00:03:58.910> our<00:03:59.030> main

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
pulmonary hypertension that is our main

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.199 
pulmonary hypertension that is our main
goal<00:03:59.650> right<00:04:00.650> with<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.670> right<00:04:01.850> ventricular

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
goal right with the right ventricular

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.479 
goal right with the right ventricular
hypertrophy<00:04:02.989> and<00:04:03.470> right<00:04:03.739> atrial<00:04:04.070> hypertrophy

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
hypertrophy and right atrial hypertrophy

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.750 
hypertrophy and right atrial hypertrophy
that<00:04:04.730> would<00:04:05.030> get<00:04:05.420> back<00:04:05.630> to<00:04:05.780> normal<00:04:05.930> with<00:04:06.350> time

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
that would get back to normal with time

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.699 
that would get back to normal with time
so<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:08.239> last<00:04:08.540> thing<00:04:08.930> I<00:04:09.050> want<00:04:09.260> to<00:04:09.320> talk<00:04:09.530> about

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
so the last thing I want to talk about

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.000 
so the last thing I want to talk about
is<00:04:10.100> that<00:04:10.370> with<00:04:10.640> ASD<00:04:11.390> you're<00:04:11.989> also<00:04:12.290> going<00:04:12.920> to

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
is that with ASD you're also going to

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.479 
is that with ASD you're also going to
hear<00:04:13.370> wide<00:04:13.880> split<00:04:14.720> right<00:04:15.590> Wrigley's<00:04:16.100> your

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
hear wide split right Wrigley's your

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.510 
hear wide split right Wrigley's your
white<00:04:16.669> split<00:04:17.090> I<00:04:17.330> made<00:04:17.960> a<00:04:17.989> video<00:04:18.169> on<00:04:18.530> the

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:19.520 
white split I made a video on the

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.950 
white split I made a video on the
different<00:04:19.789> types<00:04:19.940> of<00:04:20.090> splittings<00:04:20.570> and<00:04:20.780> why<00:04:20.900> it

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:20.960 
different types of splittings and why it

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.760 
different types of splittings and why it
happens<00:04:21.410> if<00:04:21.620> you're<00:04:21.770> interested<00:04:22.190> please

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
happens if you're interested please
