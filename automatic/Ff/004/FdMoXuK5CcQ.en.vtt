00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.569
 to the previous we saw the classification 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.370
 the big fights resolved these 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.889
 exocrine glands we have seen that they 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.480
 can present the men and directors 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.130
 in the shape of ace in the alveolus and all 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.130
 What are the cells that we can 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.350
 to find in these secretory positions are 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.990
 four cell-to-cell types 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.449
 mucosa and has a flattened nucleus 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.880
 cytoplasm almost uncollected by lime 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.470
 everyone remembers the serosa 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.270
 have a double rounded 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.870
 but outside the center of the cell has a 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.050
 cytoplasm by the plant to be a 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.640
 acid producer and its producer of 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.020
 lipids having a rounded nucleus 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.660
 each of these cells has some 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.710
 particularities of its functions not only 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.300
 They do this but there are some 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.840
 particularities for example spend 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:59.340
 mucous membrane it creates a sticky 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.320
 illuminates through its secretion its 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.510
 matter of culture is free issue 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.250
 for the digestion of food by 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.729
 producer of lipids, it creates a 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.200
 lubricating layer with antonelli 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.320
 antimicrobial and that protects tissue 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.750
 underlying dehydration 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.090
 already celso rosa she has more functions 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.680
 varied are so specific two 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.409
 previous 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.810
 Let's now see a secretive motion in the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.000
 case an assassin formed just by 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.909
 the mucous membranes we see a slide here 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.090
 arrow red bites hit green shows 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.799
 goals elano cosa concept or plasma clear 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.979
 in one all the books in the nucleus 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.880
 flat base that was in 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.650
 basal bar 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.649
 and here we have a rather strange name is 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.110
 who is a mucosal killer a selection 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.320
 rather viscous than who proteins 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.930
 located in the following we see a 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.689
 fine with are secretive in the case another 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.700
 which would be the boundary of the membrane 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.670
 basal we have a cancer cell 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.579
 pointed out for certain I saw the round number 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.530
 given away from the base but is also not 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.479
 the cytoplasm being cured is not 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.849
 is fully healed 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.120
 homogenous is cured and we have a 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.510
 very narrow name that is characteristic 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.730
 it with secretion 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.799
 more fluid than the previous more 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.900
 schools 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:22.030
 The third case we have a mixture 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.430
 we have a ratio that has so many cells 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.260
 clear nerve cells such as 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.629
 cancer cells that have that 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.000
 peripheral forming the same street 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.159
 the volume is very central here collects both 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.980
 secretion of mucous 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:40.030
 then it will be a mixed selection 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.159
 So, if it's a mix, we have the 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.049
 steel - producing cells as they 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:46.269
 imagine only remembering all the 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.150
 invested by micro-live and are very 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.340
 rich in micro waves here to the left we 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.170
 we have an image of a production cell 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.389
 of sugar in the bush that bind if not 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.340
 I see double round histoplasmosis as well 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:59.650
 coral and red and the wealth of 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.109
 mitochondria here in the first image of the 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.359
 upper right corner we have two 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.609
 white bars that delimit a wall of the 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.680
 stomach and down here we see the 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:11.049
 black outline and just remembering 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.700
 basal and in the center we have a band the 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.909
 tube shop that has both cells 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:20.560
 producing these with pm in 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:21.849
 cancerous cells in these cells and a 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.859
 other cell types the cells 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.980
 we see here 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:30.370
 sending her esop on the mobile cell phone running 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.310
 to sebastien that the cells release a 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.949
 product selection very rich in lipids 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:41.199
 they will lubricate the skin hairs 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:43.269
 In this image we have a gland 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:45.579
 Exotic showing the function of the duct 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.790
 covered by investment inhabitant 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.530
 and the portion gives the secretory position with 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.109
 very wide world felten 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.930
 here on the right we see several ducts 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:58.810
 ending in the veil in potions 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.370
 receivers verdÃ£o and they the bands 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.470
 surrounding the entire portion of the 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.260
 secretory duct removal are the 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.239
 thousand and terminal cells 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.489
 another hypothesis classification of 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.199
 glands is with respect to the mechanism of 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.019
 secretion release only the first 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:15.459
 in case the voltage pedrocon to it releases 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.479
 all selection only within a 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.780
 vesicle 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.790
 in the second case itself apart from visit 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.910
 when leaving some of the cytoplasm 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.520
 tension and in the third case the entire 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.560
 cell will lose organelles and lupi 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.290
 accumulating of vehicles and pressure 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.440
 and the cell together with the vesicles is 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.720
 released to the duct of the image itself 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.910
 we have an example of a broad 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.220
 collaboration is all and it is enough that 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.410
 leaning of hair by waiting 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.410
 in these rectangular positions of the 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.670
 image of the left and finally the 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.470
 standards can be used to classify 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.960
 relation to unicellular we have here 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.390
 some large unicellular squid 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.660
 cells are closed down forms that can 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:01.770
 to find in a simple cylinder criterion 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.770
 of the intestine
