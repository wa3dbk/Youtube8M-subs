 on the lake and here goes nur group 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.820
 Russian scientists spent more than a month 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.980
 the purpose of the expedition is to find evidence 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.170

 being said and scientific 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.340
 evidence of Soviet geologists 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.559
 participants of the first research 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.570
 expedition to the lake here goes nur 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.390
 visited here in the 20s of the past 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.120
 centuries have heard the screams that issued 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.240
 inhabitants of the depths they still 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.250
 and were woken up on the night of some kind 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.050
 very powerful pipe sound of some kind 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.240
 unknown in completely exist 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.130
 your impressions of that night as well 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.530
 stories of locals about underwater 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.040
 monsters geologists outlined in the book by 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.650
 following 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.220
 unknown animals my hands are rare 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.340
 instance 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.920
 the book itself was published in 1961 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.410
 Igor Grishin keeps it as a talisman because 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.900
 having read a travel story in my youth 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.970
 geologists to the mystical lake it times 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.550
 forever decided that he would certainly find 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.800
 unknown beast so the mystery of the lake here 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.780
 goes mur became a matter of his life but 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.390
 go to the treasured expedition Igor 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.900
 Grishin could only after decades and 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.240
 this time it was waiting for a big luck on 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.830
 Scientists have found traces of ponds 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.560
 rookery of a mysterious beast 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.400
 judging by the photo the length of the animal is at least 4 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.310
 meters long 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.810
 further evidence of existence 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.690
 predator here are the marks on 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.440
 caught fish pond environment fangs on 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.030
 fish and traces of such claws that is 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.190
 Here there is for example different types of tracks on 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.830
 the fish on it afterwards that the pond is not 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.800
 there was no one about to became a being in 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.780
 relic rise goal brings so much 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.770
 relict 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.569
 a type of fish that has no teeth 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.730
 our places and this artifact 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.500
 expedition leader is particularly proud 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.819
 this is a fragment of the jaw which 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.010
 the researchers found ashore 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.530
 which animal did she belong to 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.840
 not clear but it is obvious that we are talking about 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.950
 a predator indicates this 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.630
 small but razor-sharp teeth 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.580
 mysterious jaws and photographs of footprints 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.950
 on the shore carefully studied and crosses 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.780
 The zoologist Nikolay is a non-remembered scientist 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.570
 suggests most likely thanks 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.030
 underground warm sources and constant 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.980
 water temperature in the lake and here goes nur 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.930
 preserved ichthyosaurs 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.330
 further creatures lived in the era 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.989
 Mesozoic tens of millions of years ago 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:16.230
 someone could be a predatory box with a long 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:21.170
 so similar to what pike body needs 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:24.090
 who possesses such small posters 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.940
 small and new between the teeth in a huge 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.890
 the amount of which is littered 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.810
 mouth scientists explain 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.000
 the lake here goes but he is one of the most 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.790
 old reservoirs in all of Eurasia 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.560
 the lake is about 70 million years old and quite 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.299
 it is possible that with favorable 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.970
 circumstances in underwater caves 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.970
 prehistoric predators could survive 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.900
 Today Igor Grishin prepare for 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.269
 next expedition not authoritative 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.010
 the crypto zoologist once again convinced him 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.390
 that we must continue the search 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.660
 prehistoric animals 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.860
 the researcher believes that is on the verge 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:03.780
 sensational discovery
