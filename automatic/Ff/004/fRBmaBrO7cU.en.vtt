be<00:02:40.140> documenting<00:02:40.380> this<00:02:41.160> for<00:02:41.820> another<00:02:42.120> two

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
be documenting this for another two

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.760 
be documenting this for another two
weeks<00:02:42.770> to<00:02:43.770> see<00:02:44.040> if<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.700> get<00:02:44.940> any<00:02:45.240> bad<00:02:45.900> breakouts

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
weeks to see if I get any bad breakouts

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.430 
weeks to see if I get any bad breakouts
or<00:02:47.070> side<00:02:47.370> effects<00:02:47.730> from<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.000> biotin<00:02:48.570> other

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
or side effects from the biotin other

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.220 
or side effects from the biotin other
than<00:02:49.770> that<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.160> MSM<00:02:50.670> I<00:02:50.880> still<00:02:51.200> yesterday<00:02:52.200> I

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
than that the MSM I still yesterday I

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.480 
than that the MSM I still yesterday I
had<00:02:52.440> like<00:02:53.750> it's<00:02:54.750> like<00:02:54.950> residual<00:02:55.950> right<00:02:56.190> there

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
had like it's like residual right there

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.620 
had like it's like residual right there
but<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.030> had<00:02:57.270> two<00:02:58.080> huge<00:02:58.580> pretty<00:02:59.580> much<00:02:59.760> huge<00:03:00.090> it's

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
but I had two huge pretty much huge it's

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.100 
but I had two huge pretty much huge it's
there<00:03:00.960> didn't<00:03:01.710> last<00:03:01.890> long<00:03:02.070> I<00:03:02.490> popped<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:03.110> put

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
there didn't last long I popped it put

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.550 
there didn't last long I popped it put
some<00:03:04.260> tea<00:03:04.380> tree<00:03:04.620> oil<00:03:04.860> on<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.580> then<00:03:06.560> flush

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
some tea tree oil on it and then flush

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.650 
some tea tree oil on it and then flush
my<00:03:07.800> system<00:03:08.160> out<00:03:08.280> with<00:03:08.460> some<00:03:08.610> old<00:03:08.730> water<00:03:09.060> so<00:03:09.630> I

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
my system out with some old water so I

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.830 
my system out with some old water so I
was<00:03:10.080> good<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.290> go<00:03:10.470> after<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:11.630> but<00:03:12.630> that's

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
was good to go after that but that's

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.370 
was good to go after that but that's
about<00:03:13.110> it

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
about it

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.830 
about it
oh<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:16.310> here's<00:03:17.310> what<00:03:17.760> my<00:03:17.940> nails<00:03:18.209> look<00:03:18.480> like<00:03:18.510> I

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
oh and here's what my nails look like I

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.970 
oh and here's what my nails look like I
actually<00:03:19.050> put<00:03:19.650> clear<00:03:20.220> polish<00:03:20.670> on<00:03:20.910> because

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
actually put clear polish on because

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.400 
actually put clear polish on because
this<00:03:22.980> nail<00:03:23.340> is<00:03:23.670> cracked<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.600> can't<00:03:24.900> see<00:03:25.290> it

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
this nail is cracked you can't see it

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.190 
this nail is cracked you can't see it
because<00:03:25.770> it's<00:03:25.980> it's<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.700> little<00:03:27.690> bit<00:03:27.810> in<00:03:28.020> that

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
because it's it's a little bit in that

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.940 
because it's it's a little bit in that
corner<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:28.860> let<00:03:29.850> me<00:03:29.910> show<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.150> I<00:03:30.500> had<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.530> cut

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
corner and let me show you I had to cut

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.210 
corner and let me show you I had to cut
the<00:03:32.520> same<00:03:32.820> nail<00:03:33.120> off<00:03:33.480> on<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:34.530> other<00:03:34.739> hand

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
the same nail off on the other hand

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.960 
the same nail off on the other hand
because<00:03:36.320> my<00:03:37.320> nails<00:03:37.530> have<00:03:38.160> not<00:03:38.430> gotten<00:03:38.700> any

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
because my nails have not gotten any

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.720 
because my nails have not gotten any
stronger<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.930> guess<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:40.620> wasn't<00:03:40.950> really<00:03:41.190> hoping

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
stronger I guess I wasn't really hoping

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.490 
stronger I guess I wasn't really hoping
for<00:03:41.790> that<00:03:41.970> because<00:03:42.239> I<00:03:42.390> didn't<00:03:42.780> incorporate

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
for that because I didn't incorporate

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.570 
for that because I didn't incorporate
the<00:03:43.620> biotin<00:03:44.040> at<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.280> time<00:03:44.489> but<00:03:45.450> my<00:03:46.370> nails<00:03:47.370> is

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
the biotin at the time but my nails is

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.080 
the biotin at the time but my nails is
still<00:03:47.790> as<00:03:49.010> weak<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:50.280> brittle<00:03:50.489> as<00:03:50.850> they

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
still as weak and brittle as they

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.640 
still as weak and brittle as they
normally<00:03:51.660> would<00:03:51.840> be<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:52.970> so<00:03:53.970> I'll<00:03:54.660> see<00:03:55.020> if<00:03:55.260> the

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
normally would be and so I'll see if the

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.500 
normally would be and so I'll see if the
biotin<00:03:56.190> makes<00:03:56.940> any<00:03:57.360> difference<00:03:58.280> overall<00:03:59.510> but

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
biotin makes any difference overall but

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.080 
biotin makes any difference overall but
I<00:04:01.020> was<00:04:02.209> taken<00:04:03.209> apart<00:04:03.330> something<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.670> it<00:04:05.670> just

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
I was taken apart something and it just

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.390 
I was taken apart something and it just
caught<00:04:06.570> both<00:04:06.840> of<00:04:06.900> my<00:04:07.260> nails<00:04:07.500> on<00:04:07.860> both<00:04:08.100> hands

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
caught both of my nails on both hands

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.229 
caught both of my nails on both hands
the<00:04:08.760> same<00:04:09.000> nail<00:04:09.440> same<00:04:10.440> finger<00:04:10.890> rather<00:04:11.160> on<00:04:11.820> both

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
the same nail same finger rather on both

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.550 
the same nail same finger rather on both
hands<00:04:12.630> and<00:04:13.380> I'm<00:04:13.470> like<00:04:13.680> ah<00:04:13.860> I<00:04:14.989> usually<00:04:15.989> when<00:04:16.530> I

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
hands and I'm like ah I usually when I

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.130 
hands and I'm like ah I usually when I
cut<00:04:16.830> one<00:04:17.040> nail<00:04:17.310> or<00:04:17.640> I<00:04:17.700> break<00:04:18.299> one<00:04:18.330> nail<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:18.930> cut

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
cut one nail or I break one nail I cut

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.289 
cut one nail or I break one nail I cut
them<00:04:19.320> all<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:19.950> I<00:04:20.400> didn't<00:04:20.669> do<00:04:20.790> that<00:04:20.820> because<00:04:21.030> I

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
them all and I didn't do that because I

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.820 
them all and I didn't do that because I
just<00:04:21.510> wanted<00:04:21.720> to<00:04:21.810> show<00:04:21.960> you<00:04:22.020> how<00:04:22.800> it<00:04:23.039> looked

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
just wanted to show you how it looked

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.490 
just wanted to show you how it looked
and<00:04:23.919> so<00:04:24.580> yes<00:04:25.240> all<00:04:25.599> the<00:04:25.810> rest<00:04:26.050> of<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.259> nails

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
and so yes all the rest of the nails

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.689 
and so yes all the rest of the nails
very<00:04:27.340> still<00:04:28.210> weak<00:04:28.479> that's<00:04:28.930> how<00:04:29.169> they<00:04:29.699> normally

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
very still weak that's how they normally

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.999 
very still weak that's how they normally
are<00:04:30.909> very<00:04:31.750> soft<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:33.930> hopefully<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.470> biotin

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
are very soft and hopefully the biotin

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.939 
are very soft and hopefully the biotin
will<00:04:36.580> make<00:04:36.819> a<00:04:37.060> substantial<00:04:37.870> difference<00:04:37.930> if<00:04:38.590> it

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
will make a substantial difference if it

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.059 
will make a substantial difference if it
doesn't<00:04:39.280> break<00:04:39.400> me<00:04:39.610> out<00:04:39.639> first<00:04:40.030> so<00:04:40.740> that's<00:04:41.740> it

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:42.069 
doesn't break me out first so that's it

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:44.070 
doesn't break me out first so that's it
