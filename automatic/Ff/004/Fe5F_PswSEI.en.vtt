00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 equal but come only once a 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.100
 other duel namely hansa rostock 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.470
 against the second of borussia dortmund 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.630
 Since then in dortmund it is clear that thomas 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.269
 cloth there jÃ¼rgen klop as a trainer 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.860
 The young borussen are especially special 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.900
 I'm happy to offer the new one 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.330
 there was something else in today's opponent there 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.730
 also motivating the financially damp 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:27.000
 Verein called his fans to the city-duel 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:29.010
 on and so hello dear hansa fans 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.769
 Here is the last time was right 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.329
 cool here the mood was really cool 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.489
 we wish the second one stays that way 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.920
 that more come and therefore have 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.879
 We think about city bets all over 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.250
 mecklenburg western pomerania 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.239
 we hope that we continue the ezb 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.960
 can screw up and that's why 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.850
 we will make you the 35,000 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.340
 the 35,000 spectators in the two 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.180
 remaining home games 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.180
 be the hottest fans 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.070
 yes, which city in meck-pomm 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.960
 mobilizes most fans for the 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.030
 to win both last home games 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.280
 there is a game against the fans 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.060
 professionals and a great grillfest great 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.100
 Idea as I think 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.840
 to get the stadium full and so on 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.970
 also to secure a bit of license 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:19.070
 has it today against dortmund 2 already 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.750
 effect shown andreas meyer 500 people 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.369
 into the ostseestadion that is maybe 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.770
 not what the club hopes for 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.149
 but has those who are there to do that 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.920
 neat rabatz and it is too 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.020
 year's best 11,500 karsten baumann 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.060
 after the defeat in Unterhaching 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.250
 his team today to say he 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.350
 do not want to go back to the hansa in the 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.060
 fall asleep advised 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.399
 three points today against the bvb would be 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.619
 so immensely important but the second of the 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.630
 Dortmunder without professionals but with 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.000
 a lot of spielwitz traveled over each one 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.640
 fouled by rupprecht there's yellow 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.409
 for the defense chief of johannes last year 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.350
 still under contract in Rostock 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.929
 Here he takes a free kick out the 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.090
 completely correctly recognized by the 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.209
 impartial and it is in the tenth 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.209
 the perfect minute 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:11.480
 standard situation david solga 1 0 for 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:15.379
 the second of the bvb a class free kick 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.810
 the routine and ex dynamo in there 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.459
 sex to keep it out of school for the gate 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.709
 Rostock sees the ball at all 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.709
 not first on the net again 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:29.440
 Rostock has a lot of trouble with the 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.180
 dedicated to the game 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.099
 the blue falls not 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.920
 and then come those error-how 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.730
 now has a back kader 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.370
 is faster 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.690
 buesing is too passive and hair has that 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.760
 head up there comes full-back 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.069
 the crate is still hot 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.720
 take it and then mario k whose shot 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:54.190
 faked the corner brings nothing 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.260
 Rostock has big problems only at one 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.940
 Good half hour you come 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.099
 It's not dangerous in the face then 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.690
 different situation corner short and fast 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:08.379
 the captain is very happy 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.650
 balancing one unmerited one too 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:14.290
 one for hansa rostock but the captain 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.629
 finds the gap between many many 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.299
 legs in the dortmund penalty area 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.299
 nothing to hold for pohlmann in the bvb-gate 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:30.590
 good mood on the sidelines but she can 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:33.200
 also the bvb rostock gets the ball 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:38.080
 not out and the chicken show 21 dortmund 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:40.490
 the bvb-bubis leader in rostock again 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.180
 like on the other side, he does 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.890
 captain and technology wagner scents the 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.170
 three points it's a really strong one 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.360
 occurs to his young team though 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.739
 Of course that is too lax 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.650
 defended by the han you at 21 bvb 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.450
 but it's not halftime yet 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.570
 replay time of the first round still 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.100
 hansa is more or less playful 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:10.550
 room is a good and saffron 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:13.060
 Panzer again strikes back 2 2 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.060
 alisa 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.900
 6 that's the way to go 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:23.590
 previously on the edge of the allowed of marcel 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:26.770
 and then it stays very cool 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:30.600
 from the turn 2 2 to the break here 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:33.250
 only hansa does not quite flow 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.360
 second pass rostock is coming now 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.330
 better clear 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:41.410
 with the committed dortmund rooms 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.720
 with all the water you have to lie in 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.100
 Rostock and karsten baumann yes that is 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.960
 the attitude here of his 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.940
 but wants to see team dortmund 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.440
 stays permanently dangerous 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.420
 playful the better team 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.250
 Horn shoe the captain 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.680
 almost with his second hit we 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.940
 do not see complete in slow motion 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.290
 really the ball really went 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:04.450
 a haircut past the closing word 90 ansa 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.580
 who wants the victory I am from the cellar 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:10.900
 make the class as good as solid 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:16.350
 as if energetic and then three 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.350
 doubt, and all the burdens 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:34.190
 Thanks with two correctness 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.590
 The fans have us right again 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.120
 horny pushed forward and in the end 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.350
 you have to say that was already happy 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.320
 but we have the three dots and that 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.930
 counts and thus hansas can as well as 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:49.160
 sure for another year third league 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.660
 plan and thus back in the last 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.850
 home game should then but the stadium 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.740
 be really crowded as the eleventh season victory 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.360
 for hansa 41 points we hold 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.290
 I would say class retention too 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.290
 and congratulations
