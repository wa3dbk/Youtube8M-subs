00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello everyone for a new tutorial 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.049
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.330
 install windows 8 on your old pc 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.719
 turning on either windows 7 or on 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.460
 windows vista or windows xp so 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.650
 first thing to do go on 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.590
 the microsoft site to download a 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.939
 update wizard on windows 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.350
 so you type windows points like 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:28.199
 that this lease then you go down you 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.970
 have here easy update you click 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.380
 on the upgrade wizard and 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.270
 micro it will offer you to download 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.710
 an upgrade wizard that is going 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.770
 allow you to install windows 8 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.450
 without your old pc is to keep if 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.000
 you want it your files and your 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.780
 software according to their compatibility with 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.780
 windows 8 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.640
 so here I go so now 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.280
 download the upgrade wizard 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:01.969
 of microsoft like this here I 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:05.220
 record it play louvre I run them 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.659
 and that's it took a little while 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.369
 last time it takes a good quarter 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.040
 hour to check compatibility 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.730
 software and saffron especially a little 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.580
 of time smile too 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:20.230
 and that I do not know why this is where 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.600
 you can also note that the logo 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.440
 windows 8 has now changed its four 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.440
 small white squares 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.460
 so now harris on the board 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.280
 display that will check if your 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.539
 software is compatible or not with 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.299
 windows 8 so that's really 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.459
 practice I found it's still a 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:51.350
 sacred anymore so I'll leave that as 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:52.939
 that and we find ourselves right after that 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.159
 so once the wizard find 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.869
 compatibility details 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.189
 we can see here what are the 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.899
 applications that will work with 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.929
 windows 8 and those that are not going 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.609
 worked for example the usb os 3.0 only 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.069
 not work with windows 8 microsoft 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:09.079
 office starter will not be compatible 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.759
 so software probably you 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.440
 will probably have to reinstall 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.739
 and there you have software 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.879
 compatible so you have picasa 3 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:23.349
 skype microsoft is champion etc etc 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:25.790
 so I'm going next next 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.959
 so that's it's very important you 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.819
 you can choose the elements 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.220
 keep if you just want windows 8 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.450
 you click nothing if you wish 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.069
 keep windows settings 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.049
 personal files application you 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.519
 click here and if not right below if 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.739
 I did not want to keep software 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.280
 in my case I'm just going to install 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:47.650
 windows 8 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:50.450
 I click on next now that's it 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.139
 so here you have the choice with a 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.329
 professional version which is 39 99 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:58.880
 $ so here you can order it 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.590
 so I click on command and you 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.569
 have the choice so if you want 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.220
 order in addition to a DVD windows knowing 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.630
 that it will be shipped to you for $ 15 then 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.220
 it will be a bit more expensive because microsoft 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.410
 takes $ 5 for shipping costs 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.950
 so in my case I just downloaded 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.880
 the two gigas of windows 8 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:19.540
 so here I click on next 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.540
 and there you wait 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.970
 it takes a little time here and there 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.330
 you come in everything you give your 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.920
 postcard your email etc 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.810
 microsoft will offer you later 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.200
 pay in credit card or with an account 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.180
 paypal 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.510
 so I'm going to do that and we end up 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.190
 just after so here's one more time 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.049
 the purchase made microsoft will give you 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.819
 a product key that will need 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.769
 obviously save in order to activate 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.840
 windows 8 during installation 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.519
 so there the upgrade wizard is 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.930
 Downloading the two gigas 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.579
 files needed for installation 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.950
 of this new operating system 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:57.819
 and so we find ourselves right again 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.680
 so here is once the two gigas 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.629
 of downloaded files microsoft you 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.370
 will propose to install windows 8 either in 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.870
 installing it now either we create a 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.879
 media that is to say, install it on a 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.780
 USB key or either install it later 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.220
 from your office 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.450
 me what I advise you those of 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.950
 install it now because I 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.239
 think it's easier then 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.049
 to install it to create a medium it is necessary 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.549
 really know each other 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.750
 because it's not really obvious 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.400
 for someone who has never done in 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.720
 do me what I advise you 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.160
 it's really in the room and now 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.579
 or install it later from 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.169
 your office 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.650
 because it's exactly the same thing 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.630
 does that so I click on next 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.380
 and microsoft will prepare the installation 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.820
 of windows 8 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.470
 now you have to accept the 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.510
 terms of the contract the license so I 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.220
 checkmark accepted and there you have a 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.349
 summary of the options you have 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.669
 chosen so I had chosen nothing 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.660
 keep at all during installation 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.550
 of windows 8 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.560
 so just hard-core windows 8 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.389
 did not want to keep my files but 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.770
 windows 7 software and I had chosen 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.060
 also to install windows 8 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.830
 professionals because for now 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.270
 can only install windows 8 in 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.280
 professional version 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.160
 so now so now you can 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.570
 So start the installation after you 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.979
 have started the installation it's really 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.190
 simple on the other hand must provide a 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:08.080
 good half hour here I hope this 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.000
 tutorial please do not hesitate to me 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.979

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.080
