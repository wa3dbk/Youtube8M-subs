00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 It was oral beauty today. I'm here for the 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.520
 do you guys stopped one washcloth 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.520
 healthy 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.049
 I make this chicken fingers and it puts 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.730
 a light yellow light and an eye 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.590
 bursting into the future but was right when 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.630
 people ran in seven kilometers in the 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.490
 minimum to be able to do this 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.830
 so it's very simple people 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.349
 I will first hit here two little eggs is 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.580
 that old scheme of the contested only 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.689
 instead of using flour from 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.050
 screw thread 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.800
 We're going to use flaxseed flour. 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.649
 so here's very basic I'm going to hit john 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:46.469
 bats as if to make 11 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:50.700
 the omelet did not hit here normal here there 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.370
 I'll mix the two flours I'll 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.640
 Here mixing linseed flour two 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.420
 tablespoons more or less with oats 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.040
 in flakes and thick flakes of people here 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.780
 I'm going to give a life without an easy one. 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.229
 It's okay, we saw people. 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.590
 now get the chicken filet 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:18.330
 exceed the little ones I'll give you the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.369
 egg and pass the flour here and say there 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.930
 you can fish it is also well 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.030
 delicious egg flour there at home I do 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.210
 much sole that the sole it finishes 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.549
 being a fish a lot of grits there I finish 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.490
 doing it because it here in africa 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.140
 thick crust makes a crust so it does not 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.790
 breaks as much as you will grilling or 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.810
 sole is more difficult to grilled in 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.060
 cause of it 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.350
 on top of this flour so I go 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:51.020
 put a little bit of black pepper 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:53.850
 so a little bit in salt 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.159
 on top of even the flour has problem 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.960
 not if the chicken has already seasoned in 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.760
 home also has people program 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.680
 So let's go there and fight a day. 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:09.310
 cool to meet that fire a little bit 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.050
 eyes and looks that canola oil that 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.390
 She says I always give the pass one. 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.890
 a little paper towel for 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.530
 enjoy a lot 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.600
 I will not accept these two here the fire 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.250
 is average does not even too high is very 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.140
 weak and you have gluten intolerance 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.840
 It is not cool back to see that view have 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.550
 gluten, so I say you put the 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.270
 the flaxseed apparatus as the 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.160
 rice or do without gluten or any 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.260
 the one you like in this case if you go 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.180
 example a fish that can suddenly 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.100
 to add a coconut meal 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.260
 It is very good to fish with coconut I 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.360
 I really like it when I do it at home with 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.300
 coconut milk sauce and it seems 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.370
 Obviously just not right 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.630
 so here is the grilled my chicken 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.150
 align to darken in the 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.080
 chicken nee because flaxseed flaxseed 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.970
 dark 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.410
 if you do not like to buy too much 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.280
 that golden one that was a little more 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.060
 clear 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:07.450
 so if the chicken will get so coin 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:11.670
 year is not marina either already 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.670
 then combine to grill 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:29.310
 that's not the way Moses is here so well 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.310
 I'll take it easy, coach. 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:39.420
 and then people can serve with a little rice 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:43.329
 the athlete does not qualify a 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:48.639
 well crunchy had wonderful 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:52.920
 I will tell you to see O and then this 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:55.450

 taqueti oats with the alliance of one 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.130
