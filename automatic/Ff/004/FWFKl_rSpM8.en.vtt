young very tiny and they needed to be
safely<00:01:21.390> transported<00:01:22.170> one<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.009> other

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
safely transported one of the other

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.889 
safely transported one of the other
things<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:23.610> need<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.790> keep<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.210> mind<00:01:24.240> is

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
things that we need to keep in mind is

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.320 
things that we need to keep in mind is
that<00:01:24.960> when<00:01:25.439> they<00:01:25.649> got<00:01:25.860> older<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.790> they<00:01:27.270> were

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
that when they got older and they were

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.170 
that when they got older and they were
being<00:01:27.630> unruly<00:01:28.140> mama<00:01:28.920> cat<00:01:29.190> would<00:01:29.340> also<00:01:29.549> scruff

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
being unruly mama cat would also scruff

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.719 
being unruly mama cat would also scruff
kitten<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.020> order<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.680> provide<00:01:32.430> some

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:33.980 
kitten in order to provide some
disciplinary<00:01:33.330> action

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
disciplinary action

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.070 
disciplinary action
so<00:01:34.500> actually<00:01:35.340> scruffing<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.210> not<00:01:36.780> only<00:01:36.960> a

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
so actually scruffing is not only a

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.899 
so actually scruffing is not only a
means<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.500> transport<00:01:38.100> but<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.640> means<00:01:38.759> a

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
means of transport but it means a

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.080 
means of transport but it means a
discipline<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:40.140> when<00:01:41.039> we<00:01:41.250> are<00:01:41.460> scrubbing<00:01:41.789> our
