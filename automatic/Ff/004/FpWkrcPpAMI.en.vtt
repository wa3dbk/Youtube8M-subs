 8 9 at night with some video that is 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.899
 the final video of the marathon 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.690
 barcelona with raquel that is the girl to 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.059
 the one that I had the luck in fortune and the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.770
 pleasure and pride and all of power 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.230
 push during the Barcelona marathon 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.820
 and today I was riding this video 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.100
 They realize that something does not come out in 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.930
 the video that you will see tomorrow and that had 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.879
 really want to tell you because it's what 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.050
 that has come to mind during 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.059
 all these hours of assembly 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.790
 to this whole week that I lived after 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.369
 to have the prize of being able to be in that 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.350
 marathon and it's a very simple thing that to 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.720
 times and that happens to me surely 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.970
 because I'm a leftover and a pimp and I 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.310
 I think I 'm always better than everyone and 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.950
 that I do everything right and such and then 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.720
 suddenly you go to this kind of thing that 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.940
 can have a social point or a point 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.270
 solidary no or a point where you think 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.509
 that you go from your superiority 9 I go to 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.399
 lend a hand to these people and they are 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.720
 helping what I do not know that I'm coming 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.539
 to do the good deed of the month I'm going to 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.570
 help and the big surprise that you take 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.550
 in all this is that I did the same in the 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.800
 last year but I think this year has 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.420
 been even more beast in the marathon with 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.390
 Rachel with all the people on leash on me 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.890
 with angel with martín in order to 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.050
 Compile with all the people that cross me 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.090
 out there evidently alejandro jesús 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.590
 manuel all all those who 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.479
 they pushed like those who were pushed 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.360
 which is that I was going to think 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.220
 that I was going to help someone I know 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.540
 make someone happy or make people feel 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.890
 special to someone 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.930
 and after those 4 hours and after 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.000
 that day and then come home and 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.430
 after putting me to mount the video and 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.130
 thinking about it and seeing it, I realized that 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.980
 to fuck that from minute 1 that 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.560
 come until all this is over 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.990
 he felt special was me and the one who 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.600
 it was happier, it was me and the one who learned 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.460
 something was me and they helped me and 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.920
 the one that was the most human was me and 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.810
 I thought fuck male 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.940
 what luck that alejandro invited me 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.650
 here how lucky to have met Alejandro 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.690
 through jesus what luck to have 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.540
 known to all these people run in 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.150
 me and what luck to be there pulling not 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.320
 if not with raquel there is some time 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.670
 I told Raquel that now we are going to 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.890
 have to push you and in the background 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.510
 metaphorically the thing was like that had 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.650
 many moments that I'm going to go for 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.260
 house that I can not love and what the fuck 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.720
 you threw a mental smile until the 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.420
 point that I realized 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.520
 this does not speak to me nor with Alejandro who is 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.440
 who linked me with runs on me or with 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.480
 raquel's parents but but it's already 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.730
 the decision made that tomorrow when 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.560
 post the video I'm going to talk to 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.810
 they will contact them to see if 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.450
 it seems good that once a week 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.040
 for example when I go running for 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.620
 here because we are neighbors with brawls 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.240
 chances of life well good almost 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.580
 neighbors we are here in the same neighborhood 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.400
 flat if you feel like it and if you 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.630
 it seems good that one of those days the 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.700
 week or when they want or when 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.040
 Raquel wants to get her out there 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.100
 to walk for a while to chat for a while 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.720
 laugh and continue to share careers 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.870
 maybe not when it's colder but more 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.900
 in the afternoon or so but fuck and I tell you 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.970
 many times you think you do something and that 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.640
 you are going to help someone from your 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.680
 superiority not from your normality or 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.170
 from your there is if I am going to be here good 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.180
 person and you realize that they do not help you 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.650
 to you so all this video sheet is 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.480
 to tell you that tomorrow youtube.com 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.660
 bar valentí sanjuan will be this 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.420
 video but especially what the fuck is this 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.760
 kind of things because they are unpayable 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.260
 and because when you are there you do not give 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.630
 account and you think there's no now 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.940
 I have to be his life is not that 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.010
 is that we were wrong once again there 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.500
 in all this kind of things like the 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.739
 you get it, so you already 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.739
 you know
