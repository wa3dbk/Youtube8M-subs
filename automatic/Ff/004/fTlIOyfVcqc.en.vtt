you've got a butterfly not too tight and
not<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:14.970> friction<00:01:16.050> but<00:01:17.050> you<00:01:17.170> do<00:01:17.350> have<00:01:17.500> a

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
not the friction but you do have a

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.960 
not the friction but you do have a
couple<00:01:17.770> of<00:01:17.890> bits<00:01:18.100> you<00:01:18.250> need<00:01:18.369> to<00:01:18.490> remove<00:01:18.729> this

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
couple of bits you need to remove this

is<00:02:47.280> my<00:02:47.550> throttle<00:02:47.850> control<00:02:48.180> it's<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.960> very<00:02:49.260> very

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
is my throttle control it's a very very

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.680 
is my throttle control it's a very very
simple<00:02:49.830> idea<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.850> works<00:02:51.060> on<00:02:51.210> the<00:02:51.270> price<00:02:51.450> at<00:02:51.630> the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
simple idea it works on the price at the

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.070 
simple idea it works on the price at the
basis<00:02:52.050> of<00:02:52.080> friction<00:02:52.850> it's<00:02:53.850> easy<00:02:54.300> maneuverable

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
basis of friction it's easy maneuverable

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.710 
basis of friction it's easy maneuverable
so<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.320> can<00:02:55.470> disengage<00:02:55.770> it<00:02:56.100> completely<00:02:56.760> or

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
so you can disengage it completely or

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.890 
so you can disengage it completely or
just<00:02:57.930> have<00:02:58.080> it<00:02:58.170> close<00:02:58.350> enough<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.920> it<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.040> work

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
just have it close enough to it to work

there's you've got the buff fly clip to

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.660 
there's you've got the buff fly clip to
alter<00:03:02.700> tension<00:03:03.240> so<00:03:03.930> it's<00:03:04.050> stiffer<00:03:04.550> and<00:03:05.550> all

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670
