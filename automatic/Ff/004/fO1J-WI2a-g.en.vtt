Stadium<00:00:05.109> we've<00:00:05.770> just<00:00:06.010> been<00:00:07.019> making<00:00:08.019> the

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:08.109 
Stadium we've just been making the

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.600 
Stadium we've just been making the
rounds<00:00:08.140> after<00:00:08.559> the<00:00:08.769> news<00:00:08.920> came<00:00:09.160> about<00:00:09.430> the

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 
rounds after the news came about the

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.970 
rounds after the news came about the
suspension<00:00:10.330> and<00:00:10.570> the<00:00:11.080> fine<00:00:11.349> i<00:00:11.379> guess<00:00:11.710> that's

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
suspension and the fine i guess that's

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.799 
suspension and the fine i guess that's
what<00:00:12.160> we're<00:00:12.309> boiling<00:00:12.820> down<00:00:13.030> to<00:00:13.179> andy<00:00:13.660> with

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 
what we're boiling down to andy with

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.500 
what we're boiling down to andy with
venture<00:00:14.169> and<00:00:14.349> Herrera<00:00:14.999> from<00:00:15.999> where<00:00:16.120> I<00:00:16.150> said<00:00:16.480> I

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.510 
venture and Herrera from where I said I

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.570 
venture and Herrera from where I said I
thought<00:00:17.080> it<00:00:17.230> would<00:00:17.350> be<00:00:17.560> a<00:00:17.800> little<00:00:18.220> harsher

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
thought it would be a little harsher

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.939 
thought it would be a little harsher
what<00:00:19.449> what<00:00:19.750> are<00:00:19.840> you<00:00:19.930> thinking<00:00:20.320> why<00:00:20.619> don't<00:00:20.830> you

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:20.949 
what what are you thinking why don't you

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.560 
what what are you thinking why don't you
think<00:00:21.160> it<00:00:21.250> was<00:00:21.369> hard<00:00:21.550> sure<00:00:21.730> if<00:00:21.820> you<00:00:22.269> thought<00:00:22.449> it

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
think it was hard sure if you thought it

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.150 
think it was hard sure if you thought it
would<00:00:22.720> be<00:00:22.869> well<00:00:23.140> I<00:00:23.170> don't<00:00:23.410> I<00:00:23.650> don't<00:00:23.679> know<00:00:23.920> why

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
would be well I don't I don't know why

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.220 
would be well I don't I don't know why
you<00:00:24.789> know<00:00:24.880> what<00:00:25.060> goes<00:00:25.240> into<00:00:25.449> the<00:00:25.599> process<00:00:26.050> and

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
you know what goes into the process and

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.810 
you know what goes into the process and
you<00:00:26.560> know<00:00:26.679> it's<00:00:26.830> kind<00:00:26.980> of<00:00:27.099> arbitrary<00:00:27.279> then

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
you know it's kind of arbitrary then

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.970 
you know it's kind of arbitrary then
deciding<00:00:28.300> how<00:00:29.170> many<00:00:29.320> games<00:00:29.470> they<00:00:29.710> choose

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
deciding how many games they choose

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.560 
deciding how many games they choose
there's<00:00:30.250> precedence<00:00:30.730> sometimes<00:00:30.880> I<00:00:31.359> found

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
there's precedence sometimes I found

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.170 
there's precedence sometimes I found
sometimes<00:00:31.839> you<00:00:32.110> don't<00:00:32.580> but<00:00:33.580> yeah<00:00:33.760> I<00:00:33.790> mean<00:00:33.970> I

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
sometimes you don't but yeah I mean I

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.910 
sometimes you don't but yeah I mean I
think<00:00:34.210> the<00:00:34.510> Royals<00:00:34.660> probably<00:00:35.530> caught<00:00:35.710> a<00:00:35.740> break

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
think the Royals probably caught a break

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.980 
think the Royals probably caught a break
here<00:00:36.310> I<00:00:36.340> mean<00:00:36.580> there<00:00:36.850> is<00:00:37.000> not<00:00:37.210> even<00:00:37.240> suspended

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:37.990 
here I mean there is not even suspended

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.780 
here I mean there is not even suspended
you<00:00:38.140> know<00:00:38.230> and<00:00:38.500> he's<00:00:38.890> paid<00:00:39.130> a<00:00:39.160> fine<00:00:39.430> that<00:00:39.700> I'm

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
you know and he's paid a fine that I'm

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.170 
you know and he's paid a fine that I'm
sure<00:00:39.940> he<00:00:40.060> can<00:00:40.090> afford<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.800> vent<00:00:42.340> or<00:00:42.610> excuse<00:00:43.090> me

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
sure he can afford and vent or excuse me

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.330 
sure he can afford and vent or excuse me
Herrera<00:00:43.600> gets<00:00:44.080> five<00:00:44.530> games<00:00:44.860> which<00:00:45.160> i<00:00:45.280> think

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
Herrera gets five games which i think

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.860 
Herrera gets five games which i think
there<00:00:45.640> was<00:00:45.730> an<00:00:45.820> expectation<00:00:46.060> they<00:00:46.510> might<00:00:46.690> get

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
there was an expectation they might get

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.630 
there was an expectation they might get
more<00:00:47.080> than<00:00:47.140> that<00:00:47.410> but<00:00:47.620> he<00:00:47.680> would<00:00:47.800> get<00:00:47.920> seven<00:00:48.550> to

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
more than that but he would get seven to

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.760 
more than that but he would get seven to
ten<00:00:48.850> or<00:00:49.060> something<00:00:49.360> like<00:00:49.450> that<00:00:49.510> and<00:00:49.930> then<00:00:50.650> it

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
ten or something like that and then it

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.170 
ten or something like that and then it
would<00:00:50.890> subsequently<00:00:51.340> get<00:00:51.670> you<00:00:51.940> know<00:00:52.030> maybe

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
would subsequently get you know maybe

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.540 
would subsequently get you know maybe
appeal<00:00:52.540> down<00:00:52.810> to<00:00:53.140> four<00:00:53.470> or<00:00:53.590> five<00:00:53.770> so<00:00:54.400> he's

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
appeal down to four or five so he's

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.520 
appeal down to four or five so he's
going<00:00:54.670> to<00:00:54.760> start<00:00:54.910> at<00:00:55.090> five<00:00:55.270> he's<00:00:55.840> appealed<00:00:56.350> it

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
going to start at five he's appealed it

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.590 
going to start at five he's appealed it
he'll<00:00:56.650> be<00:00:56.680> available<00:00:57.400> until<00:00:57.970> they<00:00:58.360> get<00:00:58.480> all

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
he'll be available until they get all

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.850 
he'll be available until they get all
that<00:00:58.720> stuff<00:00:58.780> settled<00:00:59.350> in<00:00:59.440> the<00:00:59.500> next<00:00:59.710> couple

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
that stuff settled in the next couple

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.860 
that stuff settled in the next couple
weeks<00:01:00.160> and<00:01:00.460> then<00:01:01.060> the<00:01:01.180> hope<00:01:01.330> is<00:01:01.510> maybe<00:01:01.660> you

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
weeks and then the hope is maybe you

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.060 
weeks and then the hope is maybe you
know<00:01:01.960> I'm<00:01:02.020> getting<00:01:02.170> knocked<00:01:02.440> down<00:01:02.560> to<00:01:02.770> two<00:01:02.920> or

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
know I'm getting knocked down to two or

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.039 
know I'm getting knocked down to two or
three<00:01:03.310> I<00:01:03.340> doubt<00:01:03.880> it'll<00:01:04.030> get<00:01:04.180> totally<00:01:04.600> erased

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
three I doubt it'll get totally erased

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.139 
three I doubt it'll get totally erased
because<00:01:05.320> he<00:01:05.530> threw<00:01:05.770> at<00:01:05.920> someone<00:01:06.430> while<00:01:06.820> it<00:01:07.030> was

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
because he threw at someone while it was

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:08.999 
because he threw at someone while it was
under<00:01:07.179> a<00:01:07.390> warning<00:01:07.810> so<00:01:08.560> he's<00:01:08.679> probably<00:01:08.770> going

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
under a warning so he's probably going

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.740 
under a warning so he's probably going
to<00:01:09.130> serve<00:01:09.280> some<00:01:09.549> sort<00:01:09.759> of<00:01:09.789> spin<00:01:10.030> shun<00:01:10.240> but<00:01:10.479> yeah

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
to serve some sort of spin shun but yeah

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.389 
to serve some sort of spin shun but yeah
I<00:01:10.780> mean<00:01:10.869> he<00:01:11.020> could<00:01:11.200> maybe<00:01:11.740> knock<00:01:11.950> a<00:01:11.979> game<00:01:12.250> or

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
I mean he could maybe knock a game or

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.370 
I mean he could maybe knock a game or
two<00:01:12.429> off<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.670> expansion<00:01:13.359> well<00:01:13.929> for<00:01:14.259> their

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
two off the expansion well for their

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.719 
two off the expansion well for their
sake<00:01:14.619> just<00:01:14.859> the<00:01:14.920> fact<00:01:15.130> that<00:01:15.219> there<00:01:15.429> is<00:01:15.549> an

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
sake just the fact that there is an

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.459 
sake just the fact that there is an
appeals<00:01:16.060> process<00:01:16.149> is<00:01:16.719> probably<00:01:16.990> a<00:01:17.079> big<00:01:17.229> deal

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:17.469 
appeals process is probably a big deal

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:18.899 
appeals process is probably a big deal
right<00:01:17.710> now<00:01:17.770> with<00:01:18.100> what's<00:01:18.520> going<00:01:18.670> on<00:01:18.850> with
