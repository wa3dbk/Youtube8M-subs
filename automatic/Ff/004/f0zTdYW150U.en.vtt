00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.570 
as I was going to the course but you get
the<00:02:52.340> gist<00:02:52.580> of<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.790> so<00:02:52.970> it's<00:02:53.090> a<00:02:53.270> Meyer

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
the gist of it so it's a Meyer

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:05.230 
the gist of it so it's a Meyer
the<00:02:55.270> net<00:02:55.450> G<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:57.190> then<00:02:57.670> back

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.010 

so<00:03:06.050> that's

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:16.280 

so<00:03:11.020> it's<00:03:11.200> down

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:23.759 

try<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.349> figure<00:03:17.530> it<00:03:17.680> out<00:03:17.739> here<00:03:22.079> down<00:03:23.079> down<00:03:23.409> down

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
try to figure it out here down down down

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.960 
try to figure it out here down down down
up

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:42.020 

and<00:03:27.270> then<00:03:27.840> I<00:03:27.870> go<00:03:28.050> order<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.260> G<00:03:36.800> that's<00:03:37.800> it<00:03:41.030> then

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
and then I go order the G that's it then

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:51.950 
and then I go order the G that's it then
f1<00:03:42.810> downstroke<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:44.190> back<00:03:44.370> of<00:03:44.490> the<00:03:44.550> seat

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.950 

then<00:03:52.710> then<00:03:53.070> what<00:03:53.190> you<00:03:53.340> do<00:03:53.490> when<00:03:54.420> this<00:03:54.570> leads<00:03:54.780> up

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
then then what you do when this leads up

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.410 
then then what you do when this leads up
to<00:03:54.990> the<00:03:55.110> chorus<00:03:55.470> is<00:03:55.710> you<00:03:56.610> pluck<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:57.000> bass<00:03:57.150> note

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
to the chorus is you pluck the bass note

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.510 
to the chorus is you pluck the bass note
of<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.600> see<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:57.900> then<00:03:58.710> you<00:03:58.740> strum<00:03:59.130> it<00:03:59.160> so<00:03:59.400> I'm

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
of that see and then you strum it so I'm

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.510 
of that see and then you strum it so I'm
going

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
going

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.880 
going
it's<00:04:02.090> up

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.130 

this<00:04:05.640> is<00:04:05.760> where<00:04:05.940> it's<00:04:06.120> kind<00:04:06.300> of<00:04:06.330> fun<00:04:06.540> the

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
this is where it's kind of fun the

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.990 
this is where it's kind of fun the
course<00:04:07.380> is<00:04:07.590> this<00:04:07.800> it's<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.069> same<00:04:08.370> as<00:04:08.400> that<00:04:08.760> a

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
course is this it's the same as that a

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.559 
course is this it's the same as that a
minor<00:04:09.420> G<00:04:09.840> C<00:04:10.350> thing<00:04:10.650> however<00:04:11.520> the<00:04:11.670> strumming

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
minor G C thing however the strumming

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.120 
minor G C thing however the strumming
pattern<00:04:12.810> is<00:04:12.870> a<00:04:12.900> little<00:04:13.110> bit<00:04:13.230> different<00:04:13.620> it's

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
pattern is a little bit different it's

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.800 
pattern is a little bit different it's
really<00:04:14.430> easy<00:04:14.550> though<00:04:14.640> you're<00:04:15.390> just<00:04:15.540> plucking

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
really easy though you're just plucking

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.030 
really easy though you're just plucking
that<00:04:16.049> base<00:04:16.200> that's<00:04:16.470> our<00:04:16.590> plucking<00:04:16.950> that

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
that base that's our plucking that

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.280 
that base that's our plucking that
opening<00:04:17.459> and<00:04:18.060> then<00:04:18.600> I'm<00:04:18.720> strong<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.140> full

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.890 

holding<00:05:55.770> out<00:05:56.330> now<00:05:57.330> this<00:05:57.450> is<00:05:57.510> what<00:05:57.660> it<00:05:57.780> sounds

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
holding out now this is what it sounds

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:05.110 
holding out now this is what it sounds
like

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.240 

that's<00:06:05.900> the<00:06:06.139> first<00:06:06.380> part<00:06:06.650> of<00:06:06.830> the<00:06:06.949> interlude

I'm<00:06:16.880> basically<00:06:17.300> holding<00:06:17.720> that<00:06:17.840> G<00:06:18.080> for<00:06:18.320> a

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
I'm basically holding that G for a

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.810 
I'm basically holding that G for a
longer<00:06:18.560> time<00:06:18.680> and<00:06:19.070> I<00:06:19.100> don't<00:06:19.160> go<00:06:19.400> back<00:06:19.580> to<00:06:19.699> the
