00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.000
 it 's time again new call of duty 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.439
 black ops 3 infos appeared this time 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.060
 probably the most blatant 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.470
 in general, and indeed that relate 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.960
 info this time completely on the 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.079
 campaign on the multiplayer too and 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.630
 on the zombie mode and that's how it looks 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.849
 and he will not necessarily be alone 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.020
 I am also there Ankara we have 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.719
 we just do not know where we are now 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.460
 upload video here everywhere so say 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.260
 I do not care who made the much bigger ones 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.300
 has and as he already heard that is the 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.250
 biggest libyens until now there have been in 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.019
 the zombie mode multiplayer and 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.909
 campaign beating just get it 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.409
 at the campaign at around the largest 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:49.390
 message it actually to say 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:50.739
 There is that she is four players co-op 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.449
 What do you think about 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.980
 So I thought it was really cool 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.690
 at halo at that time already knows that 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.030
 you just hang out with buddies 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.469
 The campaign was a bock 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.949
 you could really fax the fax 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.899
 do 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.030
 and some people really too 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.830
 Bring it out anyway 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.860
 this will also be the case with call of duty 3 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.320
 be the amag around the campaign 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.950
 legendary is cod veteran 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.080
 bitter in the basket in any case right 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.910
 interesting then probably becomes 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.410
 Just this time I hope for a longer one 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.450
 ride campaign and not again 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.520
 somehow five or six hours through 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.200
 to gamble where they say every year yes 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.140
 The campaign is getting longer and longer 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.370
 longer and forgetting to say that 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.950
 it's the whole screenshots 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.420
 very clearly to campaigns and 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.820
 who has the first campaign screen one has 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.610
 yes here with such a funny cyborg 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.560
 mac or so and so mostly is for me 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.030
 the other thing down there rolling off 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.050
 These roll the top address none 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.160
 clue what is unique today tupperdose 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.780
 and then you see another ako 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.130
 so to speak , many have 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.830
 they were also written one 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.190
 text from seminar ko i thought in trader 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.720
 The magazine 40 is but I do not know 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.430
 it does not look so blatant 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.980
 futuristic from the weapon and also 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.400
 this ex or what he does not have 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.080
 absolutely 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.050
 There are no real exotic 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.330
 but yes so extension modification 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.300
 for the body could 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.760
 say that has already laid this one 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.170
 I think now can also to the part 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.610
 that you are most interested in 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.260
 simply the multiplayer mode 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.690
 and there is the first screen easy 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.520
 somehow a bit intense 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.530
 I think if you just look left 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.990
 This guy is so up in the air 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.230
 if he stands behind the back one 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.060
 light book beam not necessarily 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.800
 extra just such a small jump one 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.740
 It does not look like that either and later 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.080
 but will be according to this leak here 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.910
 or this text is the multiplayer the 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.440
 whole maps also built on it 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.290
 the whole new movement is first 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.730
 explain how the mouvement so me 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.860
 have the movement it should be in any case 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.480
 So be very clear liquid now 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.360
 not quite like in the arri but really 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.160
 again antique liquid so that yes 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.090
 just all the movements in one another 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.770
 should grab 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.830
 they mentioned something with that 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.470
 dolphin that's on such a few twitter 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.060
 read here also say that that 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.950
 germany somehow on call with 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.959
 is now being adapted because 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.739
 usually lucerne but falter 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.670
 lands on the ground wedge and otherwise 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.489
 changing calls with now believe 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.130
 i did not blatantly fell like nrw just that 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.110
 just fluid and that the movement 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.459
 not so extreme right now so that is 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.019
 you do not like ten meters high now 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.800
 jump or so instead provides the 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:31.050
 brings two two and a half meters high 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.300
 but if you are now at the multiplayer 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.989
 picture with the right guys on his 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:40.410
 Poor look that somehow looks 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.989
 already wired again so you have to 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.239
 watch years of modification right 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.310
 So I think that's how it is again 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:50.209
 what was the name of the exotic no volume ? 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.209
 could speak a little more 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.170
 I do not know, but something will open 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.349
 probably every case again 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.180
 Probably something that you go 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.709
 can jump more often or higher or 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.569
 Otherwise, probably something out 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.790
 also tell me that it is that 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.050
 You can also level your skills 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.280
 no idea how that should look like 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.709
 the levelystem he wanted some 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.620
 we presented weapons skills and 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.880
 general skills can level and there 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.639
 I can not handle that much yet 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.350
 imagine 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.940
 First of all, it's like I know you 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.970
 will not help or maybe will 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.590
 For the first time maybe it was only 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.840
 Poll so shit because you have to 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.690
 really to say a leap 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.970
 I have mine based when I was 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.380
 pretty much still possible now 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.970
 rauszuhauen a bit crass 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:43.370
 but these may interest me 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:48.680
 just not shaved behind it or 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:51.080
 so superman like you if you 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.250
 could opponents thus one may so 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.919
 wegboxen 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.860
 by being so sorry or something 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:01.430
 protect from the card 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.810
 no, you are also tactical 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.400
 there is still to say here 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.320
 multitouch in multiplayer actually 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.270
 not so much just there again 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.400
 something like access so you 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.570
 can be based here again with 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:17.990
 any double jumps or else 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.800
 what are the jumps and protection 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.210
 Skills 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.190
 I can not do that much now 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.820
 Imagine that these protective skills 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.310
 should be 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.270
 It is so because then no one 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.690
 wait a bit for tomorrow until the 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:32.210
 first trailer until you finally get more 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.490
 but in the morning tomorrow comes the 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.110
 whole shit out but zombie mode 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.010
 I think now that they are rather 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.380
 say because of 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.229
 that's a new complete one, so to speak 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.000
 horror story will interest me 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.590
 just how far zombie mode 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.630
 have brought it so far that it almost 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.860
 my story becomes what I am 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.389
 always I can to zombie 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.920
 mode you can now in zombie mode 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:56.880
 also level that it had too 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:59.070
 new was that not already with this 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.380
 extremely law not played because 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.910
 extinction but I know it 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.550
 since all could live but close 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.440
 maybe you can have it there too 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:10.200
 Durable knows the horny if one 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.070
 zombie mode could start with one 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:16.350
 let's say with a character setup 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:18.630
 it was synonymous with extension mode but 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:23.070
 just like real choice based 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:25.830
 is he horny we wish 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:30.030
 yes very extreme hardliner for 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:32.990
 zombie mode reach your rounds 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.880
 earlier so ne shit 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.940
 tommy mode and no matter if you have the 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.530
 Shipping no matter what you say 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.810
 campaign I think will be on everyone 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.280
 fall true grass so again movie maturity 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.630
 and by having it with friends 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.740
 can play it together again 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.320
 made really cool 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.370
 at multiplayer are a bit critical 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.650
 I mean you really have to be on the 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:57.120
 wait for the trailer tomorrow 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:58.260
 today it went together from it it works 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.510
 There is not much left to say 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.940
 and already half probable is 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.800
 already late from my side 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.230
 Do not take skin secret temples then 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.920
 I ever last word all clear 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.920
 The last word
