 carelessness or the extreme openness 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.350
 Mexican presidents have immortalized 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.420
 phrases that go outside the teleprompter 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.280

 as the former president Felipe said 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.869

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.460
 neither guarantees anything I'm proud 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.370
 of the year 1968 because it allowed me 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.230

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.430
 eloquent to its maximum expression that leaves 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.050
 for the story a phrase from the school 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.270

 breakers to mexico during his six-year term 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.459
 the moment that our country started a 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.170
 to the worst security crises and 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.450
 deaths so he had to call the 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.340

 this phrase very close to the microphone to 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.450
 Ending a press conference 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.040
 where he announces the measures on 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.930

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.459
 overcome this moment of pain message 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.049
 to use rock in warrior to 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.180

 of humanity though we could spend 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.680
 the whole day recapitulating the phrases 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.260

 back was not not something not only like that more 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.890
 beyond the laughter or pain of others that more 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.840
 can speak the sayings of the 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.669
 Mexican presidents along the 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.070
 time we should be with these phrases 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.290
 that the presidential investiture every time 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.130
 it's smaller to solve the challenges
