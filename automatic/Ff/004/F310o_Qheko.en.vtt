light<00:00:30.240> bulb<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:31.380> they<00:00:31.800> don't<00:00:31.980> need<00:00:32.130> if

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
light bulb and they don't need if

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.979 
light bulb and they don't need if
they're<00:00:32.550> inside<00:00:32.880> but<00:00:33.120> they're<00:00:33.390> outside<00:00:33.750> now

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
they're inside but they're outside now

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.680 
they're inside but they're outside now
and<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.230> lows<00:00:34.440> are<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.920> 30<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.850> think<00:00:36.540> I

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
and the lows are in the 30 so I think I

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.580 
and the lows are in the 30 so I think I
checked<00:00:36.899> on<00:00:37.020> them<00:00:37.110> last<00:00:37.290> night<00:00:37.380> at<00:00:37.530> about

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
checked on them last night at about

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.110 
checked on them last night at about
midnight<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.070> they<00:00:38.219> were<00:00:38.340> underneath<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.969> so

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
midnight and they were underneath it so

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.459 
midnight and they were underneath it so
I<00:00:39.149> guess<00:00:39.450> they're<00:00:39.600> warm<00:00:39.780> enough<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.200> let<00:00:40.379> me

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
I guess they're warm enough but let me

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.799 
I guess they're warm enough but let me
now<00:00:41.129> let<00:00:41.460> me<00:00:41.579> warn<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.910> before<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.239> show<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.540> my

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.760 

get<00:01:19.710> out<00:01:19.800> of<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:19.980> way<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:21.060> isn't<00:01:21.390> your<00:01:21.540> show

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.580 

then<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:27.000> kind<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
then I have this it's kind of the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.840 
then I have this it's kind of the
controller<00:01:28.590> for<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.980> drawbridge<00:01:29.400> here<00:01:29.670> let

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
controller for the drawbridge here let

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
controller for the drawbridge here let
me<00:01:29.880> show<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.180> how<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.480> works

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
me show you how it works

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.520 
me show you how it works
come<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.680> tight<00:01:32.060> unless<00:01:33.060> paint<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.540> use<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.960> is

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
come on tight unless paint I use this is

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.770 
come on tight unless paint I use this is
actually<00:01:35.070> roof<00:01:35.280> sealer<00:01:35.640> some<00:01:36.330> pretty<00:01:36.570> nasty

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
actually roof sealer some pretty nasty

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.660 
actually roof sealer some pretty nasty
stuff<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.470> does<00:01:37.590> anyone<00:01:37.830> dry<00:01:38.070> yet<00:01:38.310> but<00:01:38.490> I

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
stuff it does anyone dry yet but I

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.280 
stuff it does anyone dry yet but I
figure<00:01:39.360> it'll<00:01:39.540> keep<00:01:39.690> everything<00:01:40.020> from

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
figure it'll keep everything from

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.740 
figure it'll keep everything from
getting<00:01:40.410> wet<00:01:41.930> so<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.800> here<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.520> see<00:01:44.750> in

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
getting wet so in here you can see in

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.109 
getting wet so in here you can see in
there<00:01:47.570> okay<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:49.260> let<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.830> pull<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.220> up<00:01:50.430> you

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
there okay you let you pull this up you

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.280 
there okay you let you pull this up you
pull<00:01:51.300> the<00:01:51.450> string<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.840> it'll<00:01:51.960> pull<00:01:52.260> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
pull the string and it'll pull the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.250 
pull the string and it'll pull the
little<00:01:52.500> drawbridge<00:01:53.010> over<00:01:53.930> you<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.080> see<00:01:55.229> I

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
little drawbridge over you can see I

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.980 
little drawbridge over you can see I
didn't<00:01:55.560> measure<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.830> door<00:01:56.040> properly<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:57.150> left

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
didn't measure the door properly I left

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.910 
didn't measure the door properly I left
a<00:01:58.110> space<00:01:58.200> here<00:01:58.560> for<00:01:58.770> venting<00:02:00.440> okay<00:02:01.440> so<00:02:01.500> there's

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
a space here for venting okay so there's

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.310 
a space here for venting okay so there's
the<00:02:02.550> door<00:02:02.759> up<00:02:02.970> and<00:02:03.270> then<00:02:03.900> just<00:02:04.140> like<00:02:04.290> a

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
the door up and then just like a

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.389 
the door up and then just like a
flagpole<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.900> then<00:02:06.900> I'm<00:02:07.020> using<00:02:07.050> 550<00:02:07.950> cord<00:02:08.160> so

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
flagpole and then I'm using 550 cord so

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.380 
flagpole and then I'm using 550 cord so
there's<00:02:08.580> no<00:02:08.729> way<00:02:08.880> that<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.840> will<00:02:10.020> break<00:02:11.390> so

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
there's no way that this will break so

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.040 
there's no way that this will break so
