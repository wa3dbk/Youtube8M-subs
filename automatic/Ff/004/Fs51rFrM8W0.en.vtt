just aim at mid tone brown and this is
going<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.869> go<00:01:57.990> into<00:01:58.200> my<00:01:58.500> crease<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.890> that's

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
going to go into my crease and that's

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.260 
going to go into my crease and that's
going<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.460> be<00:01:59.579> my<00:01:59.729> transition<00:02:00.450> color<00:02:02.119> so<00:02:03.119> I'm

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
going to be my transition color so I'm

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.979 
going to be my transition color so I'm
just<00:02:03.479> going<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.810> be<00:02:04.170> blending<00:02:04.680> back<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.729> forth

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.690 

and<00:02:10.989> I'm<00:02:11.080> keeping<00:02:11.260> my<00:02:11.560> eye<00:02:11.590> open<00:02:11.739> while

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
and I'm keeping my eye open while

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.390 
and I'm keeping my eye open while
applying<00:02:13.030> this<00:02:13.329> so<00:02:14.319> that<00:02:14.500> way<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.709> see<00:02:15.159> the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
applying this so that way you see the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.740 
applying this so that way you see the
crease<00:02:15.760> color<00:02:16.030> when<00:02:16.239> my<00:02:16.329> eyes<00:02:16.480> are<00:02:16.510> open

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
crease color when my eyes are open

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.229 
crease color when my eyes are open
because<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.319> have<00:02:17.590> hooded<00:02:18.280> eyes<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:18.909> this<00:02:19.000> just

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
because I have hooded eyes and this just

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.500 
because I have hooded eyes and this just
is<00:02:19.599> a<00:02:19.659> really<00:02:19.989> nice<00:02:20.170> method<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.939> really<00:02:22.180> helps

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
is a really nice method it really helps

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.330 
is a really nice method it really helps
so<00:02:22.659> that<00:02:22.810> way<00:02:22.959> all<00:02:23.170> your<00:02:23.409> eye<00:02:23.439> shadow<00:02:23.950> colors

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
so that way all your eye shadow colors

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.899 
so that way all your eye shadow colors
are<00:02:24.549> visible<00:02:24.970> when<00:02:25.269> your<00:02:25.420> eyes<00:02:25.540> are<00:02:25.569> open<00:02:26.909> so

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
are visible when your eyes are open so

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.119 
are visible when your eyes are open so
I'm<00:02:27.970> using<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.420> mixture<00:02:28.750> of<00:02:28.890> windshield<00:02:29.890> wiper

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
I'm using a mixture of windshield wiper

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.880 
I'm using a mixture of windshield wiper
and<00:02:30.400> circular<00:02:31.360> motion<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:31.959> just<00:02:32.170> really<00:02:32.470> blend

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
and circular motion to just really blend

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.149 
and circular motion to just really blend
that<00:02:33.190> crease<00:02:33.579> in<00:02:34.269> so<00:02:35.170> it's<00:02:35.349> nice<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.590> smooth

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
that crease in so it's nice and smooth

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.970 
that crease in so it's nice and smooth
and<00:02:36.489> a<00:02:37.390> soft<00:02:37.689> transition<00:02:38.019> rather<00:02:38.590> than<00:02:38.769> like<00:02:38.950> a

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
and a soft transition rather than like a

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.069 
and a soft transition rather than like a
harsh<00:02:39.340> stopping<00:02:40.030> point<00:02:40.239> between<00:02:40.480> my<00:02:40.810> crease

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
harsh stopping point between my crease

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:47.610 
harsh stopping point between my crease

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
over towards the inner eye it's going to

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.380 
over towards the inner eye it's going to
help<00:04:13.470> blend<00:04:13.800> into<00:04:14.070> that<00:04:14.790> lid<00:04:15.150> color<00:04:15.450> as<00:04:15.720> well
