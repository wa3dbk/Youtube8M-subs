under<00:01:35.400> water<00:01:35.670> if<00:01:36.000> we<00:01:36.270> lift<00:01:36.479> off<00:01:36.659> because<00:01:36.840> her

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
under water if we lift off because her

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.149 
under water if we lift off because her
faster<00:01:37.470> may<00:01:37.560> go<00:01:37.680> first

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
faster may go first

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.950 
faster may go first
he's<00:01:38.490> going<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.820> miss<00:01:39.030> his<00:01:39.210> diet<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.689> he's

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
he's going to miss his diet and he's

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.149 
he's going to miss his diet and he's
gonna<00:01:40.079> miss<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.380> roeckl<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.890> we're<00:01:41.009> about<00:01:41.100> a

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
gonna miss the roeckl and we're about a

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.210 
gonna miss the roeckl and we're about a
schwa<00:01:41.670> came<00:01:41.909> in<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.119> face<00:01:42.299> with<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.540> liftoff

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
schwa came in to face with that liftoff

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.190 
schwa came in to face with that liftoff
area<00:01:44.220> that's<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.790> good<00:01:45.240> stuff<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.780> now<00:01:45.930> we<00:01:45.990> are

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
area that's it good stuff and now we are

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.690 
area that's it good stuff and now we are
still<00:01:46.409> faster<00:01:46.829> than<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.130> enough<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.490> get<00:01:47.610> in

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
still faster than just enough to get in

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.819 
still faster than just enough to get in
one<00:01:47.880> more<00:01:47.909> slicing<00:01:48.450> wind<00:01:48.600> hopefully<00:01:49.439> kill<00:01:49.649> him

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
one more slicing wind hopefully kill him

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.399 
one more slicing wind hopefully kill him
before<00:01:49.920> he<00:01:50.159> gets<00:01:50.490> his<00:01:50.610> pump<00:01:50.909> off<00:01:51.200> here<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.380> are

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
before he gets his pump off here we are

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.719 
before he gets his pump off here we are
in<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.770> event<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.130> miss<00:01:53.310> your<00:01:53.460> liftoff

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
in the event that you miss your liftoff

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.889 
in the event that you miss your liftoff
you<00:01:53.880> will<00:01:54.000> take<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> bit<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.420> damage<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:54.840> you

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
you will take a bit of damage but you

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.420 
you will take a bit of damage but you
should<00:01:55.079> still<00:01:55.290> be<00:01:55.530> alive<00:01:55.829> when<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.130> second

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
should still be alive when the second

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.910 
should still be alive when the second
pet<00:01:56.549> comes<00:01:56.729> out<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.840> here<00:01:58.320> we<00:01:58.409> go<00:01:58.530> we<00:01:58.680> want<00:01:58.860> to

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
pet comes out and here we go we want to

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.679 
pet comes out and here we go we want to
do<00:01:58.979> as<00:01:59.100> much<00:01:59.310> damage<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.939> second<00:02:00.299> pet<00:02:00.479> with

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
do as much damage to the second pet with

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.149 
do as much damage to the second pet with
our<00:02:00.899> hatchling<00:02:01.350> as<00:02:01.439> possible<00:02:01.890> because<00:02:01.979> we

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
our hatchling as possible because we

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.499 
our hatchling as possible because we
don't<00:02:02.310> need<00:02:02.430> him<00:02:02.549> anymore<00:02:02.610> after<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.240> there

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
don't need him anymore after this there

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:03.800 
don't need him anymore after this there
we<00:02:03.630> are

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
we are

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.080 
we are
these<00:02:04.799> will<00:02:05.040> stay<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.250> little<00:02:05.399> bit<00:02:05.610> faster<00:02:06.060> than

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
these will stay a little bit faster than

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.910 
these will stay a little bit faster than
him<00:02:06.390> as<00:02:06.509> long<00:02:07.110> as<00:02:07.229> I'm<00:02:07.350> above<00:02:07.530> half<00:02:07.680> health

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
him as long as I'm above half health

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.469 
him as long as I'm above half health
I'll<00:02:08.069> be<00:02:08.160> faster<00:02:08.459> than<00:02:08.580> him<00:02:08.729> -<00:02:08.849> by<00:02:08.970> default<00:02:09.360> but

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
I'll be faster than him - by default but

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.820 
I'll be faster than him - by default but
once<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.750> drop<00:02:09.899> below<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.289> point<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.590> will<00:02:10.739> no

once I drop below that point I will no
longer<00:02:10.860> be<00:02:11.250> so<00:02:11.459> it's<00:02:11.610> not<00:02:11.760> kind<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.000> nice

time<00:02:19.430> for<00:02:19.639> another<00:02:19.700> slicing<00:02:20.389> wind<00:02:21.849> and<00:02:22.849> let's

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
time for another slicing wind and let's

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.309 
time for another slicing wind and let's
just<00:02:23.389> go<00:02:23.480> ahead<00:02:23.599> and<00:02:23.780> lift<00:02:23.870> off<00:02:24.049> to<00:02:24.200> get

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
just go ahead and lift off to get

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.170 
just go ahead and lift off to get
ourselves<00:02:24.469> out<00:02:24.829> of<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.010> way<00:02:25.159> as<00:02:25.400> well<00:02:25.730> as<00:02:25.969> get

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
ourselves out of the way as well as get

ourselves out of the way as well as get
some<00:02:26.209> big<00:02:26.629> damage<00:02:26.840> on<00:02:27.079> and<00:02:27.230> hopefully<00:02:27.560> before

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
some big damage on and hopefully before

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.129 
some big damage on and hopefully before
he<00:02:27.920> heals<00:02:28.099> himself<00:02:28.400> up<00:02:28.489> too<00:02:28.670> much<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.870> he<00:02:30.049> is

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:30.139 
he heals himself up too much and he is

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:31.360 
he heals himself up too much and he is
now<00:02:30.260> faster<00:02:30.650> than<00:02:30.769> us<00:02:30.859> because<00:02:31.189> our

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
now faster than us because our

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.800 
now faster than us because our
adrenaline<00:02:31.969> rush<00:02:32.090> has<00:02:32.209> worn<00:02:32.389> off<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.719> we're

adrenaline rush has worn off and we're

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.420 
adrenaline rush has worn off and we're
also<00:02:32.930> below<00:02:33.200> half<00:02:33.379> held<00:02:33.560> at<00:02:33.680> this<00:02:33.739> point<00:02:34.010> but

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
also below half held at this point but

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.830 
also below half held at this point but
it's<00:02:34.579> okay<00:02:34.819> cuz<00:02:35.060> we<00:02:35.180> are<00:02:35.299> up<00:02:35.389> in<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.510> air<00:02:35.569> and
