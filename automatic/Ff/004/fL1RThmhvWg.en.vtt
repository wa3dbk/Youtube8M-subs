galaxy note 5 and the samsung galaxy s6
edge+<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.789> find<00:00:18.000> out<00:00:18.180> are<00:00:18.480> they<00:00:18.990> really

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
edge+ to find out are they really

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.189 
edge+ to find out are they really
different<00:00:20.310> or<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.270> same<00:00:21.510> device<00:00:21.900> which

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
different or is it the same device which

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.720 
different or is it the same device which
is<00:00:22.350> two<00:00:22.710> different<00:00:23.130> types<00:00:23.580> of

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
is two different types of

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.910 
is two different types of
functionalities<00:00:24.539> that's<00:00:25.350> what<00:00:25.619> we're<00:00:25.800> really

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
functionalities that's what we're really

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.859 
functionalities that's what we're really
interested<00:00:26.039> here<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.000> let's<00:00:27.210> start<00:00:27.570> off<00:00:27.689> with

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
interested here so let's start off with

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.419 
interested here so let's start off with
one<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.230> main<00:00:28.410> things<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.920> make<00:00:29.250> this

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
one of the main things that make this

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.089 
one of the main things that make this
device<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.090> different<00:00:30.599> for<00:00:31.009> hardware<00:00:32.009> and

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
device is different for hardware and

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.340 
device is different for hardware and
design<00:00:32.430> now<00:00:32.940> first<00:00:33.270> off<00:00:33.420> Samsung<00:00:34.170> did<00:00:34.290> a

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
design now first off Samsung did a

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.260 
design now first off Samsung did a
fantastic<00:00:34.559> job<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.399> basically<00:00:35.850> designing

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
fantastic job in basically designing

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.290 
fantastic job in basically designing
both<00:00:36.570> devices<00:00:36.899> with<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.350> s6<00:00:38.010> edge+<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
both devices with the s6 edge+ and the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.139 
both devices with the s6 edge+ and the
note<00:00:39.480> 5<00:00:39.750> they<00:00:40.140> are<00:00:40.379> slick<00:00:40.980> they're<00:00:41.550> stylish

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
note 5 they are slick they're stylish

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.440 
note 5 they are slick they're stylish
but<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.809> course<00:00:43.020> have<00:00:43.200> glass<00:00:43.530> back<00:00:44.450> metallic

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
but of course have glass back metallic

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.139 
but of course have glass back metallic
frame<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.200> they<00:00:46.739> just<00:00:46.950> look<00:00:47.250> really<00:00:47.280> really

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
frame and they just look really really

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.139 
frame and they just look really really
good<00:00:48.270> now<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.350> s6<00:00:49.800> edge+<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.610> slightly

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
good now the s6 edge+ is slightly

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.090 
good now the s6 edge+ is slightly
thinner<00:00:51.739> than<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.270> note<00:00:54.270> 5<00:00:54.539> just<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.440> terms<00:00:55.860> of

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
thinner than the note 5 just in terms of

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.830 
thinner than the note 5 just in terms of
height<00:00:56.430> from<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.210> course<00:00:57.420> laying<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.809> down

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
height from of course laying it down

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.860 
height from of course laying it down
flat<00:00:58.289> but<00:00:58.620> they<00:00:59.160> both<00:00:59.399> look<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.149> feel<00:01:00.449> very

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
flat but they both look and feel very

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.479 
flat but they both look and feel very
solid<00:01:01.320> now<00:01:01.500> what<00:01:02.010> are<00:01:02.100> some<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
solid now what are some of the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.219 
solid now what are some of the
differentiating<00:01:03.239> factors<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.809> course<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
differentiating factors of course the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.250 
differentiating factors of course the
edge<00:01:04.379> screen<00:01:04.680> for<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> s6<00:01:05.640> edge+<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
edge screen for the s6 edge+ and the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.219 
edge screen for the s6 edge+ and the
note<00:01:07.470> 5<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.610> S<00:01:08.790> Pen<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.840> ability

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
note 5 it is the S Pen and the ability

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.950 
note 5 it is the S Pen and the ability
to<00:01:10.439> write<00:01:10.650> notes<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.250> your<00:01:11.670> screen<00:01:12.210> especially

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
of course within us spend with the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.300 
of course within us spend with the
ejector<00:01:15.119> button<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.540> there<00:01:15.750> now<00:01:16.290> that's<00:01:16.979> about

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
ejector button in there now that's about

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.710 
ejector button in there now that's about
you<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.549> course<00:01:17.580> difference<00:01:18.360> between<00:01:18.540> both

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
you of course difference between both

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.149 
you of course difference between both
devices<00:01:18.930> but<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.259> terms<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.560> hardware<00:01:19.740> they

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
devices but in terms of hardware they

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.249 
devices but in terms of hardware they
pretty<00:01:20.310> much<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.640> same<00:01:20.820> we<00:01:21.030> will<00:01:21.180> have<00:01:21.420> Q<00:01:21.960> HD

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
pretty much the same we will have Q HD

open an application that i use on a
regular<00:01:50.460> basis<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:52.140> say<00:01:52.409> twitter<00:01:52.680> here<00:01:52.979> for

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
regular basis like say twitter here for

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.609 
regular basis like say twitter here for
