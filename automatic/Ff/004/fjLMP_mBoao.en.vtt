00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.570
 araujo 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.310
 can offer a text animation aspect the time 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.080
 which you can use to animate the titles that go before your 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.600
 animations animate a logo and so on let's put the text down 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.720
 aimar with tools this obviously 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.720
 text years write here flash 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.460
 and the first step is selectable that you have your text urges to modify 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.890
 belka birth or control ben once since 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.670
 airs excess petropar select once again ive again to brel capable 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.060
 because then you already have you are you inform the vector 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.060
 Now the next step is to convert each letter a symbol 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.840
 let's start with the f 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.830
 Right click will convert symbol 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.320
 i the mosso that we go with the 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.549
 will wear symbol or can you select for example cyber 

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:57.680
 the g8 on your keyboard 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.380
 it's the same and faster then since we have all our 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.739
 Letters that made a symbol what we have to do is 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.950
 select all 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.120
 all the letters see right click and where izik and distribute to carryons 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.290
 distribute your laws 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.860
 he distributes them as his name says each letter even this proportion stopped 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.250
 always sobrÃ³n stage here what you have to do is select law this 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.240
 small trash can 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.039
 delete 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.909
 or what 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.280
 then 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.270
 We are gonna give 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.020
 know drag all these frames here plus more the frame 10 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.030
 and right click insert keyframe kelly is to make it positional and we 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.760
 let's go here to frame 1 and for the initial possess 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.770
 let's finally everyone 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.870
 and move them with special keyboard up 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.740
 that then what is going to happen is that the letters are going to 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.950
 start here pap are going to cheer up that down 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.330
 let's give us some time here 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.330
 we detect more frames over here 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.420
 i the following 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.990
 selecting who you average of these two frames put and click 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.610
 right priism absent indicated movement interpolation 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.629
 and well we already have this animation here control test movie 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:15.420
 and if it's okay 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.430
 but it's not what we want we want each letter to fall separately 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.929
 what and then to do that 

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:24.929
 we have to if you minc lent each layer 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.650
 is and name is by the way if you name each letter condors 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.329
 modify will convert without veil for example if it seems quick 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.689
 this one in name when I wrote right will distribute layers each layer is going to have 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.499
 the name of the letter is then 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:42.649
 it's good to put the names but as we did not here 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:46.669
 let's see we click here for example in layer 1 penske is the f 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:49.830
 in layer 2 is the l tasting 3 is the 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.430
 and so on 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.729
 then 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:55.599
 what we are going to do is 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.219
 select here in the frames of the adjudicate we have them all like this 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.839
 while they are selected drag the one frame like that in the edit 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:06.659
 paper then they go to 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:07.869
 start 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:12.699
 the lawyer start a frame later or sorry the letter l goes to 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:16.319
 start a frame later and that's going to create it to be encouraged 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.629
 separate what 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.879
 let's do the same now let's go with the 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.029
 let's select it and drag it but we're going to drag two frames of 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:29.559
 so that one frame remains after 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:31.529
 what the previous letter 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:35.799
 and we will do the same with the s i select i drag 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:36.890
 so that it stays that way 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.970
 and if it catches you, it will create a kicanas ladder effect capable of signaling 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.609
 that we are doing well 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.609
 and finally the action consists of moving the dry 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:49.479
 and you have to do animation then as you can see here below 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.409
 the letters are falling separately 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:55.309
 let's go check movie 

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:59.799
 and basically that's what happens chains and frames again for the 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.679
 recording you will not be able to achieve the effect well to see 

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:05.109
 do the effect well so 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.260
 try it on your account and it's going to be very good and good of this effect is 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:10.289
 what can you do 

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:12.779
 many variations 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:14.319
 Kelly, there are no limits 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.799
 so 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.340
 that's all and I hope I've served you thank you
