00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
gonna go to eight and do a back and

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.619 
gonna go to eight and do a back and
forth<00:00:58.320> between<00:00:59.040> seven<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.760> eight

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.590 

and<00:01:04.619> jump<00:01:04.920> up<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.460> tenth<00:01:05.729> fret<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.119> three

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
and jump up to the tenth fret on three

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.280 
and jump up to the tenth fret on three
and<00:01:06.750> five<00:01:07.049> open<00:01:10.640> go<00:01:11.640> back<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.119> eight<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.630> with

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
and five open go back to eight and with

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.340 
and five open go back to eight and with
the<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.440> pedal<00:01:16.580> that's<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.450> D<00:01:18.990> seventh

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
the a pedal that's that it's a D seventh

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.120 
the a pedal that's that it's a D seventh
position<00:01:20.540> so<00:01:21.540> common<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.290> know<00:01:22.470> together

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
position so common you know together

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:31.370 
position so common you know together
again<00:01:29.060> but<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.180> works<00:01:30.360> nicely<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.140> one

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
again but it works nicely on this one

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.130 
again but it works nicely on this one
too

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.600 

so<00:01:40.140> then<00:01:40.319> we<00:01:40.440> go<00:01:40.590> two<00:01:40.920> or<00:01:41.039> three<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.429> five

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
so then we go two or three and five

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.670 
so then we go two or three and five
pedals<00:01:42.119> down<00:01:42.330> at<00:01:42.569> the<00:01:42.929> fifth<00:01:43.289> fret

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.529 

move<00:01:47.400> down<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.670> string

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.719 

three<00:01:51.539> and<00:01:51.689> five<00:01:51.869> two<00:01:52.140> four<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.409> six<00:01:52.729> petals

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
three and five two four and six petals

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.139 
three and five two four and six petals
down<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.590> then<00:01:55.590> we're<00:01:56.219> gonna<00:01:56.490> go<00:01:56.670> up<00:01:56.820> here

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
down and then we're gonna go up here

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.190 
down and then we're gonna go up here
with<00:01:57.299> petals<00:01:57.659> down<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> tenth<00:01:58.920> fret<00:02:00.200> so

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
with petals down to the tenth fret so

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.709 
with petals down to the tenth fret so
that's<00:02:01.409> just<00:02:01.619> letting<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:03.030> petals<00:02:03.360> are<00:02:03.509> dying

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
that's just letting the petals are dying

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.940 
that's just letting the petals are dying
we're<00:02:03.960> letting<00:02:04.289> off<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.710> petal<00:02:06.710> jump<00:02:07.710> up<00:02:07.920> to

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
we're letting off the a petal jump up to

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.800 
we're letting off the a petal jump up to
the<00:02:08.220> tenth<00:02:08.549> with<00:02:08.940> then<00:02:09.810> add<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> petal<00:02:11.810> so

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
the tenth with then add the a petal so

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.750 
the tenth with then add the a petal so
we<00:02:12.959> did<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.140> twice

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.850 

I<00:02:18.300> worked<00:02:19.300> at<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.780> DS<00:02:19.989> we're<00:02:20.530> at<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.830> a

here<00:02:24.489> to<00:02:24.849> the<00:02:25.840> 17th<00:02:26.410> fret<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.220> that's<00:02:27.879> the<00:02:28.180> 8th

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
here to the 17th fret and that's the 8th

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.940 
here to the 17th fret and that's the 8th
position<00:02:28.569> without<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.260> paddles<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.890> I'm

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
position without the paddles and I'm

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.860 
position without the paddles and I'm
going<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.160> listen<00:02:33.849> with<00:02:34.209> your<00:02:34.360> ear<00:02:34.569> for<00:02:34.599> the

going to listen with your ear for the
intonation<00:02:35.410> here<00:02:35.769> because<00:02:36.040> it's<00:02:36.310> when<00:02:37.090> these

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
intonation here because it's when these

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.089 
intonation here because it's when these
frets<00:02:37.569> get<00:02:37.810> close<00:02:37.989> together<00:02:38.200> it's<00:02:38.590> already

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
frets get close together it's already

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:49.309 
frets get close together it's already
hard<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.849> hit<00:02:39.970> it<00:02:40.120> perfect<00:02:44.549> and<00:02:45.549> so<00:02:45.760> it's

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
12th fret now I used the B and C pedals

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.009

position<00:04:06.620> up<00:04:06.769> here<00:04:06.980> at<00:04:07.159> 13<00:04:07.730> but<00:04:08.359> we're<00:04:08.540> really

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:08.689 
position up here at 13 but we're really

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:10.690 
position up here at 13 but we're really
not<00:04:08.959> going<00:04:09.109> to<00:04:09.170> be<00:04:09.260> playing<00:04:09.650> but<00:04:10.010> two<00:04:10.310> strings

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
not going to be playing but two strings

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.099 
not going to be playing but two strings
just<00:04:10.999> that<00:04:11.180> they're<00:04:11.389> in<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:11.659> fifth<00:04:11.870> so<00:04:12.049> you

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
just that they're in the fifth so you

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.099 
just that they're in the fifth so you
don't<00:04:12.409> really<00:04:12.530> have<00:04:12.829> to<00:04:13.010> have<00:04:13.189> the<00:04:13.780> arrays<00:04:14.780> but

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.409 
don't really have to have the arrays but
might<00:04:15.680> be<00:04:15.739> a<00:04:15.920> good<00:04:16.070> idea<00:04:16.220> to<00:04:16.489> do<00:04:16.639> it<00:04:16.789> if<00:04:17.120> she<00:04:17.150> hit

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
might be a good idea to do it if she hit
