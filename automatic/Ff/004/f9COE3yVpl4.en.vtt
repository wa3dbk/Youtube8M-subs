 salman card with norway salmon cake 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.660
 well we are in a total recipe and 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.640
 british the basis of this recipe it's going 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.680
 to be potatoes I grab my 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.470
 potatoes we will cook them to 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.840
 the water I'm already going to peel them whose age 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.760
 is roughly 300 g potatoes 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.140
 I have double the proportion of apples 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.309
 of land in relation to salmon 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.860
 now I've cut out but tape 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.680
 earth I'm trying to make pieces to 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.790
 about identical size so as to 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.790
 have a very uniform cooking 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.399
 direction the pan I dare not go 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.980
 my cooking water 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.239
 second element we have a splendid pavement 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.489
 of norway salmon 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.649
 so I check who has no art is there 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.540
 I actually chose a pavement without 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.440
 skin I am not in need of skin so 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.840
 no this mode norway 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.760
 we will find him amp had donned 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.129
 entire power which allows a 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.990
 multitude of recipes as fast as 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.720
 tasty so here I am going to make a 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.910
 cooking a little different from the pan 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.300
 dufour to steam cooking 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.429
 I'm going to enjoy cooking 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.560
 potatoes my end to fat 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:25.590
 broths I grab my steam basket 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:27.450
 I'm going to install my salmon and I 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.369
 covers meanwhile i'm going in 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.849
 enjoy to prepare my others 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.740
 trim 

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:34.110
 I will first attack by the onions 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.679
 new so I cut both 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.459
 extremities I remove the first skin and I 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:43.380
 the have slim as thinly as possible 

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:44.369
 we will bring a little bit of pep with 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.740
 lime zest 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:52.229
 I catch mara pool but I collect 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.700
 just the green part doing well 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.840
 be careful of not caught two parts 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.840
 white that would bring bitterness 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:04.050
 here is parsley game of stripping 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.509
 roughly I make a little package and 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.310
 I 'm doing a last kid in montceau 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.739
 world must be cooked I'm careful 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.370
 on the other hand it is very very hot so there 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.370
 I get it back 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.740
 nancy comes off a little bit it's 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.870
 not very serious because just now 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.490
 we go the mines were so I can the 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.900
 lay two sides so that they 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.970
 cool cooking baking apples 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.010
 earth yeah 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.870
 see it's perfect in supers 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.030
 all of my jelly potatoes 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.290
 crushes roughly if there are 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.910
 pieces it will be fine 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:40.870
 No, I'm going to be able, I'll be able to 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.580
 remy was my salmon so here I 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.440
 chosen a norway salmon is a 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.270
 farmed salmon 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.950
 he enjoys a healthy diet 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.360
 guaranteed without terrestrial animal flour I 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.800
 can add the rest of my garniture 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.550
 to know the onions the zest 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.550
 lime 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:08.830
 parsley I read added 1,9 3 spoons 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:14.610
 salt and pepper flour 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.610
 here is now I mix the whole 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.570
 here I have to mix well then you 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.730
 when you make this recipe you 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.830
 let the container come back to 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.830
 room temperature and you put it 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.650
 filmed during a good thirty 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.420
 minutes in the refrigerator so you can see 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.860
 something to do well but I 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.959
 I'm going to work it right away I'm 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.739
 flour hands and I catch a little 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.910
 of this preparation 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:44.320
 I will make the little pucks 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.600
 during that time I'm going to put in 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.430
 a pan of olive oil 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.870
 I put a good amount of oil 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.850
 olive I start to heat I 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.459
 can continue to achieve but palate 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.459
 always a little flour the preparation 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.209
 precisely the realization of his palates 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.560
 it's typically a step that you 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.310
 can ask your children to 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.050
 achieve 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.510
 they will explode then miss out 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.510
 she's hot so here I drop them 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.660
 good of course I prepared myself from 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.880
 absorbent paper to eliminate 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.680
 the excess fat I already started you 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.630
 return the first well are very 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:29.030
 fast here's for really just that 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:32.479
 front are superbly golden safe when 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.449
 of face so I put them on the paper 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:40.100
 absorbing or cutting a maximum of 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:42.110
 serious you can install them on my 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.630
 presentation plate last small 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.419
 shot of a single spoon and 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.229
 mayonnaise and so here for the little ones 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.199
