bending arts of a bender that twist was

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.930 
bending arts of a bender that twist was
probably<00:04:02.800> the<00:04:02.950> worst<00:04:03.130> twist<00:04:03.490> they<00:04:03.640> could<00:04:03.820> have

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
probably the worst twist they could have

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.910 
probably the worst twist they could have
went<00:04:04.150> with<00:04:04.300> I<00:04:04.540> hated<00:04:04.959> that<00:04:05.080> twist<00:04:05.500> they<00:04:05.709> should

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
went with I hated that twist they should

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.830 
went with I hated that twist they should
have<00:04:06.010> stuck<00:04:06.250> with<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.640> firt<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.120> lie<00:04:07.360> they

should have stuck with that it would

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.400 
should have stuck with that it would
have<00:04:09.070> been<00:04:09.100> awesome<00:04:09.340> but<00:04:09.790> of<00:04:10.330> course<00:04:10.630> know<00:04:10.930> now

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
have been awesome but of course know now

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.350 
have been awesome but of course know now
had<00:04:11.680> they<00:04:11.890> went<00:04:12.250> with<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.610> original<00:04:13.120> story

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
had they went with the original story

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.570 
had they went with the original story
that<00:04:13.480> a<00:04:13.510> mom<00:04:13.720> was<00:04:13.840> telling<00:04:14.080> everybody<00:04:14.260> he<00:04:15.190> may

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
that a mom was telling everybody he may

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.970 
that a mom was telling everybody he may
have<00:04:15.880> been<00:04:16.180> maybe<00:04:16.630> a<00:04:16.780> tad<00:04:17.109> bit<00:04:17.380> higher<00:04:17.620> than<00:04:17.890> a

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
have been maybe a tad bit higher than a

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.400 
have been maybe a tad bit higher than a
Kuvera<00:04:18.400> on<00:04:18.580> my<00:04:18.730> list<00:04:19.000> maybe<00:04:19.540> I<00:04:19.930> don't<00:04:20.080> know

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
Kuvera on my list maybe I don't know

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.260 
Kuvera on my list maybe I don't know
we'll<00:04:20.650> never<00:04:20.890> know<00:04:21.100> because<00:04:21.280> then

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
we'll never know because then

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.320 
we'll never know because then
and<00:04:22.479> then<00:04:22.780> him<00:04:23.319> and<00:04:23.650> tarrlok<00:04:24.280> blew<00:04:24.819> up<00:04:25.030> you

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
and then him and tarrlok blew up you

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.379 
and then him and tarrlok blew up you
know<00:04:25.419> so<00:04:25.750> it<00:04:26.199> like<00:04:27.009> again<00:04:27.729> if<00:04:27.970> they<00:04:28.120> would<00:04:28.300> have

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
know so it like again if they would have

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:29.670 
know so it like again if they would have
just<00:04:28.509> went<00:04:28.630> with<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:28.930> regular<00:04:29.289> story<00:04:29.560> it

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
just went with the regular story it

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.140 
just went with the regular story it
would've<00:04:29.830> been<00:04:29.889> great<00:04:30.039> and<00:04:30.490> last<00:04:30.880> and

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
would've been great and last and

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.960 
would've been great and last and
certainly<00:04:31.210> least<00:04:31.930> it<00:04:32.319> would<00:04:32.500> have<00:04:32.650> to<00:04:32.800> be

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
certainly least it would have to be

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.210 
certainly least it would have to be
vaatu<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.000> una<00:04:34.569> luck<00:04:34.750> now<00:04:35.080> only<00:04:35.650> Locke<00:04:35.949> was

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
vaatu and una luck now only Locke was
