was<00:03:02.450> t<00:03:02.780> most<00:03:02.989> stores<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.470> think<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:03.859> stores

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
was t most stores I think so stores

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
getting away with him there is Kelvin in

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.910 
getting away with him there is Kelvin in
the<00:03:07.609> pit<00:03:07.790> lane<00:03:07.819> so<00:03:08.480> he<00:03:08.599> has<00:03:08.750> managed<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.230> fire

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
the pit lane so he has managed to fire

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.699 
the pit lane so he has managed to fire
up<00:03:10.099> the<00:03:10.220> engine<00:03:10.489> again<00:03:11.349> sanela<00:03:12.349> looks<00:03:12.560> like

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
up the engine again sanela looks like

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.379 
up the engine again sanela looks like
he's<00:03:12.859> getting<00:03:13.010> into<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:13.790> zone<00:03:14.030> a<00:03:14.060> little<00:03:14.209> bit

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389 
he's getting into the zone a little bit

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:16.629 
he's getting into the zone a little bit
now<00:03:14.569> the<00:03:14.629> gap<00:03:14.900> up<00:03:15.049> to<00:03:15.200> two<00:03:15.409> seconds<00:03:15.889> is<00:03:16.370> key

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
now the gap up to two seconds is key

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:17.770 
now the gap up to two seconds is key

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
he saved a few basement a little bit

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.360 
he saved a few basement a little bit

mamaroneck<00:03:26.880> skis<00:03:27.090> now<00:03:27.120> I'm<00:03:27.330> putting<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.600> bit<00:03:27.750> of

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
mamaroneck skis now I'm putting a bit of

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.240 
mamaroneck skis now I'm putting a bit of
pressure<00:03:27.960> on<00:03:28.110> port<00:03:28.320> or<00:03:28.470> not<00:03:28.560> yeah<00:03:29.040> absolutely

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
pressure on port or not yeah absolutely

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.310

what<00:03:30.000> was<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.180> gap<00:03:30.330> as<00:03:30.480> they<00:03:30.600> came<00:03:30.780> from<00:03:30.900> that

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
what was the gap as they came from that

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.690 
what was the gap as they came from that
time<00:03:31.470> there<00:03:31.620> was<00:03:31.710> nine<00:03:31.890> tenths<00:03:32.160> of<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.340> second

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
time there was nine tenths of a second

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.160 
time there was nine tenths of a second
so<00:03:32.820> unless<00:03:33.030> he<00:03:33.180> used<00:03:33.390> a<00:03:33.480> bit<00:03:33.600> of<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.750> boost<00:03:33.930> on

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
so unless he used a bit of a boost on

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.740 
so unless he used a bit of a boost on
the<00:03:34.230> way<00:03:34.470> up<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.490> the<00:03:35.520> heaven<00:03:36.000> of<00:03:36.210> course<00:03:36.630> you'd

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
the way up to the heaven of course you'd

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.540 
the way up to the heaven of course you'd
only<00:03:36.840> use<00:03:37.050> too<00:03:37.260> many<00:03:37.410> boosts<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:38.130> catch<00:03:38.310> the

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
only use too many boosts to catch the

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.090 
only use too many boosts to catch the
guy<00:03:38.670> because<00:03:39.500> even<00:03:40.500> then<00:03:40.590> catches<00:03:40.920> up<00:03:41.010> the

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
guy because even then catches up the

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.040 
guy because even then catches up the
board<00:03:41.280> well<00:03:41.460> T<00:03:41.580> and<00:03:41.700> got<00:03:41.850> no<00:03:42.000> booze<00:03:42.180> left<00:03:42.390> then

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
board well T and got no booze left then

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.390 
board well T and got no booze left then
that<00:03:43.440> he's<00:03:43.530> going<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.740> be<00:03:43.800> in<00:03:43.830> trouble<00:03:43.920> and

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
that he's going to be in trouble and

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.890 
that he's going to be in trouble and
this<00:03:44.550> is<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.820> fate<00:03:45.000> of<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.240> race<00:03:45.390> now<00:03:45.630> where

walk around it on Friday evening it in
there's<00:04:05.480> a<00:04:05.599> lot<00:04:05.629> of<00:04:05.840> undulation<00:04:06.400> around<00:04:07.400> and<00:04:07.640> a

there's a lot of undulation around and a

Adelaide<00:04:10.400> you<00:04:10.549> can't<00:04:10.790> see<00:04:11.060> until<00:04:11.930> you're

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
Adelaide you can't see until you're

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:14.979 
Adelaide you can't see until you're
about<00:04:12.620> a<00:04:12.859> hundred<00:04:13.129> and<00:04:13.370> fifty<00:04:13.819> meters<00:04:14.180> from<00:04:14.780> it

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
about a hundred and fifty meters from it

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.159 
about a hundred and fifty meters from it
so<00:04:15.709> it's<00:04:16.100> very<00:04:16.699> and<00:04:17.449> you<00:04:17.570> can<00:04:17.690> see<00:04:17.810> that<00:04:17.840> the

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
so it's very and you can see that the

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.990 
so it's very and you can see that the
drop<00:04:18.380> down<00:04:18.560> into<00:04:18.739> lycée<00:04:19.160> is<00:04:19.370> fairly<00:04:19.639> steep<00:04:19.940> you

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
drop down into lycée is fairly steep you

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.759 
drop down into lycée is fairly steep you
need<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:20.419> get<00:04:20.570> on<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:20.780> brakes<00:04:20.989> a<00:04:21.289> little<00:04:21.530> bit

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
need to get on the brakes a little bit

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.260 
need to get on the brakes a little bit
earlier<00:04:21.859> than<00:04:22.190> you'd<00:04:22.370> think<00:04:22.400> because<00:04:23.090> of<00:04:23.120> the

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
earlier than you'd think because of the

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.310 
earlier than you'd think because of the
drop<00:04:23.539> down<00:04:23.690> the<00:04:23.810> hill<00:04:23.930> you're<00:04:24.080> going<00:04:24.199> to<00:04:24.260> be

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
drop down the hill you're going to be

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.200 
drop down the hill you're going to be
carrying<00:04:24.740> more<00:04:24.889> momentum<00:04:25.160> but<00:04:26.000> then<00:04:26.090> it

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
carrying more momentum but then it

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.480 
carrying more momentum but then it
levels<00:04:26.479> out<00:04:26.539> at<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:26.750> apex<00:04:27.139> so<00:04:27.350> the<00:04:27.919> apex<00:04:28.250> speed

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
levels out at the apex so the apex speed

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.310 
levels out at the apex so the apex speed
isn't<00:04:28.669> too<00:04:28.910> bad<00:04:29.090> as<00:04:29.300> they<00:04:29.449> come<00:04:29.930> across<00:04:30.139> the

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
isn't too bad as they come across the

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.960 
isn't too bad as they come across the
line<00:04:30.470> this<00:04:30.650> time<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:31.100> gap<00:04:31.250> between<00:04:31.370> both<00:04:31.729> lost
