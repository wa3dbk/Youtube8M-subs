 Xerox 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.650
 very soon all these cards will become 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.869
 invalid even if they 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.340
 present under the new law to take on 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.750

 certificate of the Russian national 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.890
 sample this means that drivers 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.110
 foreigners who will already be 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.149
 Petersburgers should officially they with

 He was taken in the apparent absence of those 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.239
 professionals and professionals who 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:02.460
 could tell about momentary 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.949

 Vasily Kiselev 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.570
 aggravated the already actual problem 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.159
 lack of personnel in the passenger market 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.799
 transportation St. Petersburg 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.540
 Russian driver's corps is aging in 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.640
 car fleets are mostly people 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.619
 who studied the category and even in 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.080
 Soviet time and now urban 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.210
 Driving schools produce fewer than thousands per year 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.450
 a man with such rights drivers 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.020
 category d can become quite 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.930
 wealthy person 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.710
 I will explain why the taste of practical training 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.820
 this, in addition to theory, is at least a hundred 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.189
 forty five hours on the cat on the bus 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.119
 one hundred and forty five hours on the cat on the bus 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:48.479
 passenger at the lowest 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:51.390
 I emphasize the scale of such an hour 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.229
 bus ranges from 300 to 500 rubles 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.180
 the cost 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.909
 training on category d in petersburg 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.979
 reaches 60 70 thousand rubles 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.719
 Of course if St. Petersburgers and spend 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.950
 That kind of money is clearly not to 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.950
 get behind the wheel of a minibus 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.690
 Petersburger Anatoly driver with experience 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.000
 recognized by revenue there is daily 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.890
 very impressive norm is responsible for 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.379
 life and health of hundreds of people work not 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.690
 simple Nepal want and earn more 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.299
 than modest for petersburg about 20,000

 Uzbekistan has been working in St. Petersburg already 6 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.110
 years and all quite happy to fight 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.970
 income meat as it should be in dreams 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.940
 there are easy grains that's longitudinal on 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.370
 fifty yes and your salary salary a 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.440
 file in St. Petersburg according to the association 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.690
 passenger carriers legally 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.150
 There are 12 and a half thousand drivers 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.190
 half of them are migrant drivers 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.170
 it is they who usually work on 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.910
 commercial routes and to not 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.620
 lose half their own overnight 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.420
 employees in fleet decided 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.220
 retrain them specifically for this 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.319
 purchased equipment and methodical 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.079
 literature attention do not forget to 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.030
 answer press twice and here are the drivers 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.799
 carefully dismantle the letters on the screens 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.690
 computers because for many it is also 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.970
 exam in Russian in the corridors 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.220
 enterprises queue training places at all 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.260
 not enough migrants will hand over traffic police 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.269
 Only a theory that achieved in 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.609
 passenger carrier association what 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.190
 curiously the law passed in may and 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.690
 only now the end of October is about 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.180
 understand how to proceed with its execution 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.400
 at the last meeting which was 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.459
 a week ago we more or less 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.440
 explained technology and now from us 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.680
 preparing a group of 50 people 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.720
 These lists are formed and filled with the 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.299
 the form that us colleagues bends dd 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.120
 lowered so necessarily this list and 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.819
 DBD is checked consistent with 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.470
 federal migration service and then 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.930
 after this sand is final 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.349
 agreed enterprise 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.090
 roughly speaking brings all employees 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.340
 who came to this list on 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.720
 GBDD exam at the headquarters of the traffic police 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.040
 St. Petersburg Leningrad 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.569
 areas claim that today 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.250
 rights application day 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.530
 Russian national sample for 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.819
 category d code and more than four thousand 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.400
 man but still none of 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.500
 drivers exam did not show up in fleets 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.959
 waiting for a visual signal of the EU and how the traffic management 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.209
 starting pistol signal athletes 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.900
 less and less time and exam and never 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.030
 started 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.919
 collect a full package of documents even for 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.900
 work by the grant as it turned out not 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.680
 just complete data to hold 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.199
 checks are provided only on 359 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.090
 Drivers for means that only 359 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:32.190
 Drivers have charges may be 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.000
 admitted theoretical examinations 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.310
 after checking their data in the format 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.949
 the law since November 5, the traffic police 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.690
 required to suspend drivers from work 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.880
 rights not Russian sample and 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.100
 to fine enterprises for 50 thousand 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.660
 rubles for each and therefore there is 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.430
 real probability that many 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.289
 minibuses and the fifth number simply will not be 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.820
 on the flight and however in the committee on 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.620
 Transport told us that there is 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.680
 informal agreement hi dd 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.930
