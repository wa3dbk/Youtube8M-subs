00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.250
 another one on the topic of space and a rocket 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.250
 spy 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:21.840
 square sheet of paper folded 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:29.939
 fold in half and fold 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:32.060
 we rotate the diagonals and once again 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.060
 diagonals 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:47.270
 unfold and fold one side 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.720
 and bend and and back and 2 exactly the same 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:55.040
 inside and kicked us out 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:01:03.640
 such a long triangle now 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:13.640
 each side to the center now bent 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:20.890
 second bent overturn bend 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.890
 one more leg and the last to the center 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.210
 now every second to the center 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.450
 turn over the workpiece and again 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:55.450
 prices 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:24.420
 now we need every blade 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:34.100
 straighten one caught up to the side just 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:34.100
 same rake things turn over and 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.950
 turn the remaining two parts 100 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.180
 now deploy each 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.280
 stabilizer aki 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:00.510
 it turns out we can volumetric 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.510
 stand rocket ready
