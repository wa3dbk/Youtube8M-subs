00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
parallel Jersey pulled because I really

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:30.890 
parallel Jersey pulled because I really
like<00:00:27.590> this<00:00:28.590> isn't<00:00:28.980> me<00:00:29.070> kind<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.429> like<00:00:29.599> ice<00:00:30.599> is

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
like this isn't me kind of like ice is

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.190 
like this isn't me kind of like ice is
probably<00:00:31.199> going<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.439> be<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> lot<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.679> bass<00:00:31.920> packs

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
probably going to be a lot of bass packs

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.290 
probably going to be a lot of bass packs
but<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.530> don't<00:00:34.980> know<00:00:35.070> how<00:00:35.219> many<00:00:35.250> Jersey<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:38.300> know

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300

Giroux<00:00:43.040> SPX<00:00:44.040> rookie<00:00:44.550> jersey<00:00:44.760> auto<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.300> 999<00:00:46.219> so

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
Giroux SPX rookie jersey auto to 999 so

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.569 
Giroux SPX rookie jersey auto to 999 so
that's<00:00:47.460> not<00:00:47.579> too<00:00:47.640> bad<00:00:47.789> he's<00:00:48.239> an<00:00:48.360> okay<00:00:48.629> Claire

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
that's not too bad he's an okay Claire

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.740 
that's not too bad he's an okay Claire
unless<00:00:50.579> they're<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.000> second<00:00:51.390> round<00:00:51.510> it

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
unless they're in the second round it

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.810 
unless they're in the second round it
seems<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.079> second<00:00:52.410> round<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
seems in the second round of the

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.209 
seems in the second round of the
playoffs<00:00:56.000> so<00:00:57.000> definitely<00:00:57.920> probably<00:00:58.920> one<00:00:59.100> of

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
playoffs so definitely probably one of

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.150 
playoffs so definitely probably one of
the<00:00:59.370> better<00:00:59.520> rookies<00:01:00.109> Adam<00:01:01.109> parity<00:01:01.649> at<00:01:01.739> SPX

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
the better rookies Adam parity at SPX

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:14.480 
the better rookies Adam parity at SPX
rookies<00:01:02.489> at<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> 499

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.210 

for<00:01:15.490> space<00:01:15.880> past<00:01:16.210> but<00:01:16.830> probably<00:01:17.830> won't<00:01:18.040> be

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
for space past but probably won't be

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:35.270 
for space past but probably won't be
last

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.070 

it's<00:01:35.880> like<00:01:36.119> let's<00:01:36.810> see<00:01:37.049> Ryan<00:01:38.040> Malone<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:39.080> even

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080
