and an issue that you deal with a lot is
people<00:00:05.129> talking<00:00:05.430> about<00:00:05.520> genetics<00:00:06.000> you<00:00:06.450> know

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
people talking about genetics you know

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.480 
people talking about genetics you know
genetic<00:00:07.080> limitations<00:00:07.709> or<00:00:07.979> there's<00:00:08.100> that<00:00:08.310> and

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
genetic limitations or there's that and

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.090 
genetic limitations or there's that and
today<00:00:08.580> we're<00:00:08.760> going<00:00:08.850> to<00:00:08.970> talk<00:00:09.090> about<00:00:09.180> two

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.100 
today we're going to talk about two

really the only two ways I know of to
overcome<00:00:13.920> your<00:00:14.040> genetics<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.970> first<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.540> all

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:15.600 
overcome your genetics and first of all

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.060 
overcome your genetics and first of all
let's<00:00:15.810> just<00:00:15.960> talk<00:00:16.139> about<00:00:16.169> genetics<00:00:16.859> for<00:00:17.009> a

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
let's just talk about genetics for a

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.040 
let's just talk about genetics for a
little<00:00:17.310> bit<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:18.419> know<00:00:18.509> people<00:00:18.779> always<00:00:18.929> say

you know they see a good athlete first
thing<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.810> think<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.589> guy<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:23.039> genetically

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
thing I think that guy is genetically

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.419 
thing I think that guy is genetically
gifted<00:00:24.499> genetic<00:00:25.499> beast<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.159> know<00:00:26.249> whatever

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:26.429 
gifted genetic beast you know whatever

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.380 
gifted genetic beast you know whatever
and<00:00:27.679> you<00:00:28.679> know<00:00:28.769> once<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.310> if<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:29.999> happen<00:00:30.359> to

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.650 
know yeah I'm not saying that genetics
aren't<00:00:57.930> real<00:00:58.140> they<00:00:58.470> are<00:00:58.680> real<00:00:59.130> but<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.330> is

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
aren't real they are real but so is

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
progress no matter what your genes are

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.230 
progress no matter what your genes are
and<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:04.049> when<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.409> was<00:01:04.939> kind<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:05.999> into<00:01:06.210> a

only<00:01:23.280> because<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.789> their<00:01:23.999> genetics<00:01:24.390> are<00:01:24.509> they

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
only because of their genetics are they

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.399 
only because of their genetics are they
that<00:01:24.749> way<00:01:25.189> let's<00:01:26.189> let's<00:01:26.850> say<00:01:27.509> what<00:01:28.200> that

that way let's let's say what that

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.270 
that way let's let's say what that
really<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:29.060> when<00:01:30.060> people<00:01:30.299> say<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.569> somebody

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
really is when people say to somebody

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.139 
really is when people say to somebody
that<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.369> has<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.639> be<00:01:32.729> because<00:01:32.819> of<00:01:33.030> their

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
that it has to be because of their

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.020 
that it has to be because of their
genetics<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.740> just<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.310> guess

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
genetics that is just a guess

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.840 
genetics that is just a guess
it's<00:01:36.899> just<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.200> guess<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.859> mean<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.609> have<00:01:38.729> to

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.779 
it's just a guess I mean you have to
really<00:01:39.179> dig<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.749> I<00:01:39.990> mean<00:01:40.920> you'd<00:01:41.219> really<00:01:41.490> have

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
really dig in I mean you'd really have

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.779 
really dig in I mean you'd really have
to<00:01:41.939> take<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.119> muscular<00:01:43.020> cross-section<00:01:44.009> to

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
to take a muscular cross-section to

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.969 
to take a muscular cross-section to
really<00:01:45.149> know<00:01:45.359> and<00:01:45.659> take<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> look<00:01:46.530> at<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.889> know

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
really know and take a look at you know

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.980 
really know and take a look at you know
what<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.280> muscle<00:01:47.609> fiber<00:01:47.819> was<00:01:48.119> what<00:01:48.479> types<00:01:48.780> of

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
what the muscle fiber was what types of

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.899 
what the muscle fiber was what types of
muscle<00:01:49.289> fiber<00:01:49.469> they<00:01:49.709> got<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.249> you<00:01:50.759> know<00:01:50.850> you

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
muscle fiber they got and you know you

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.849 
muscle fiber they got and you know you
can<00:01:51.090> also<00:01:51.240> look<00:01:51.929> at<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.289> know<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.469> their

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:52.859 
can also look at it you know the their

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:55.099 
can also look at it you know the their
leverage<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.639> their<00:01:54.149> limb<00:01:54.420> links<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.020> how

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:55.109 
leverage and their limb links and how

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:56.599 
leverage and their limb links and how
that<00:01:55.289> plays<00:01:55.499> out<00:01:55.679> with<00:01:55.859> specific<00:01:56.340> sport

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:56.609 
that plays out with specific sport

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:59.419 
that plays out with specific sport
movements<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.350> could<00:01:58.889> do<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> lot<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.310> that

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
movements and you could do a lot of that

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:04.519 
movements and you could do a lot of that
but<00:01:59.840> why<00:02:00.840> would<00:02:01.109> you<00:02:01.229> do<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:04.049> people<00:02:04.380> who<00:02:04.409> I

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:04.529 
but why would you do it the people who I

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:06.529 
but why would you do it the people who I
know<00:02:04.709> who<00:02:05.159> are<00:02:05.189> bent<00:02:05.609> on<00:02:05.819> on<00:02:06.149> telling

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
hard alone might not get you there I

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.470 
hard alone might not get you there I
mean<00:02:43.310> you<00:02:43.430> might<00:02:43.579> be<00:02:43.609> digging<00:02:43.879> the<00:02:44.090> wrong<00:02:44.239> hole

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
mean you might be digging the wrong hole

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.899

you<00:02:44.840> might<00:02:44.989> be<00:02:45.139> doing<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:46.099> wrong<00:02:46.250> things<00:02:46.579> and

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
you might be doing the wrong things and

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.379 
you might be doing the wrong things and
and<00:02:47.180> putting<00:02:47.659> a<00:02:47.719> lot<00:02:47.810> of<00:02:47.930> sweat<00:02:48.319> equity<00:02:48.530> into

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
and putting a lot of sweat equity into

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.929

an<00:02:50.389> investment<00:02:51.230> that<00:02:51.319> doesn't<00:02:51.650> pay<00:02:51.799> off<00:02:52.010> so

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:52.939 
an investment that doesn't pay off so

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.390 
an investment that doesn't pay off so
you<00:02:53.000> got<00:02:53.299> to<00:02:53.389> work<00:02:53.540> hard<00:02:53.739> but<00:02:54.739> you've<00:02:54.919> got<00:02:55.250> to

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
you got to work hard but you've got to

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.379 
you got to work hard but you've got to
work<00:02:55.519> smart<00:02:55.909> and<00:02:56.500> it's<00:02:57.500> just<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.799> truth<00:02:58.389> when

00:02:59.379 --> 00:02:59.389 
work smart and it's just the truth when

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:01.089 
work smart and it's just the truth when
I<00:02:59.419> was<00:02:59.599> a<00:02:59.629> young<00:02:59.840> athlete<00:02:59.989> in<00:03:00.379> high<00:03:00.560> school<00:03:00.859> and

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
I was a young athlete in high school and

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.149 
I was a young athlete in high school and
before<00:03:02.090> I<00:03:02.389> didn't<00:03:03.199> really<00:03:03.409> have<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.949> right

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
before I didn't really have the right

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.339 
before I didn't really have the right
information<00:03:04.549> to<00:03:05.060> act<00:03:05.180> on<00:03:05.449> but<00:03:05.870> I<00:03:06.049> did<00:03:06.199> work

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
information to act on but I did work

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.349 
information to act on but I did work
hard<00:03:06.639> but<00:03:07.639> I<00:03:07.699> made<00:03:07.879> very<00:03:08.060> little<00:03:08.239> progress

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
hard but I made very little progress

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.420 
hard but I made very little progress
even<00:03:09.169> though<00:03:09.319> I<00:03:09.349> didn't<00:03:09.829> know<00:03:09.859> anyone<00:03:10.159> who<00:03:10.280> was

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
even though I didn't know anyone who was

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.939 
even though I didn't know anyone who was
working<00:03:10.699> as<00:03:10.909> hard<00:03:11.090> at<00:03:11.180> me<00:03:11.680> I'm<00:03:12.680> sure<00:03:12.829> they're

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:12.949 
working as hard at me I'm sure they're

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:14.740 
working as hard at me I'm sure they're
out<00:03:12.980> there<00:03:13.280> I<00:03:13.310> just<00:03:13.370> was<00:03:13.969> working<00:03:14.120> day<00:03:14.449> after

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
out there I just was working day after

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.000 
out there I just was working day after
day<00:03:14.900> after<00:03:14.959> day<00:03:15.109> of<00:03:15.260> putting<00:03:15.500> hours<00:03:15.769> in<00:03:15.919> the

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
day after day of putting hours in the

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.939 
day after day of putting hours in the
gym<00:03:16.040> I<00:03:16.519> was<00:03:16.819> working<00:03:17.120> so<00:03:17.299> hard<00:03:17.599> I<00:03:17.989> wasn't

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:18.949 
gym I was working so hard I wasn't

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.729 
gym I was working so hard I wasn't
working<00:03:19.040> smart<00:03:19.639> so<00:03:20.479> there's<00:03:20.840> only<00:03:20.959> two<00:03:21.169> ways

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
working smart so there's only two ways

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.009 
working smart so there's only two ways
that<00:03:22.669> you<00:03:22.729> can<00:03:22.879> make<00:03:23.120> progress<00:03:23.599> you<00:03:23.930> can

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
that you can make progress you can

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.469 
that you can make progress you can
forget<00:03:24.409> about<00:03:24.470> your<00:03:24.829> genetics<00:03:25.250> maybe<00:03:26.180> you

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:26.479 
forget about your genetics maybe you

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:27.909 
forget about your genetics maybe you
have<00:03:26.659> good<00:03:26.870> genetics<00:03:27.229> maybe<00:03:27.379> you<00:03:27.560> don't<00:03:27.769> you

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:27.919 
have good genetics maybe you don't you

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:30.869 
have good genetics maybe you don't you
have<00:03:28.099> no<00:03:28.310> idea<00:03:28.989> until<00:03:29.989> you've<00:03:30.169> progressed

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
have no idea until you've progressed

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.479 
have no idea until you've progressed

until you've made progress steadily and

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.289 
until you've made progress steadily and
and<00:03:35.389> maintain<00:03:36.139> that<00:03:36.489> and<00:03:37.489> put<00:03:37.790> in<00:03:37.909> that<00:03:37.939> work

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
and maintain that and put in that work

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.960 
and maintain that and put in that work
so<00:03:38.659> until<00:03:39.379> you<00:03:39.470> make<00:03:39.650> progress<00:03:39.949> until<00:03:40.519> you<00:03:40.639> max

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
so until you make progress until you max

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.629 
so until you make progress until you max
out<00:03:41.239> what<00:03:41.509> you<00:03:41.689> have<00:03:42.099> they'll<00:03:43.099> talk<00:03:43.340> about

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
out what you have they'll talk about

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.420 
out what you have they'll talk about
genetics<00:03:44.120> just<00:03:44.540> work<00:03:45.229> hard<00:03:45.560> and<00:03:46.189> work<00:03:46.370> smart

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
genetics just work hard and work smart

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.300 
genetics just work hard and work smart
because<00:03:47.030> I<00:03:47.120> guarantee<00:03:47.479> you<00:03:47.989> you<00:03:48.949> can<00:03:48.979> make

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
because I guarantee you you can make

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.719 
because I guarantee you you can make
serious<00:03:50.000> progress<00:03:50.239> and<00:03:51.430> yes<00:03:52.430> there<00:03:52.699> are

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:52.729 
serious progress and yes there are

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:54.429 
serious progress and yes there are
people<00:03:53.150> who<00:03:53.269> are<00:03:53.419> just<00:03:53.629> genetic<00:03:54.019> beasts<00:03:54.199> who

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:54.439 
people who are just genetic beasts who

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.199 
people who are just genetic beasts who
they<00:03:54.590> are<00:03:54.620> I<00:03:54.769> don't<00:03:54.919> know<00:03:55.069> you<00:03:55.699> have<00:03:55.819> to<00:03:55.909> really

know their background I mean people look

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.689 
know their background I mean people look
at<00:04:03.049> me<00:04:03.290> or<00:04:03.469> they<00:04:03.560> look<00:04:03.709> at<00:04:03.859> other<00:04:03.979> athletes<00:04:04.430> and

and we just say no man you see a guy

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:17.890 
and we just say no man you see a guy
like<00:04:16.579> that<00:04:16.699> he<00:04:16.940> was<00:04:17.060> just<00:04:17.209> born<00:04:17.419> to<00:04:17.599> be<00:04:17.750> you

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
have a clue that's just conjecture

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.890 
have a clue that's just conjecture
that's<00:04:25.410> just<00:04:25.650> guesswork<00:04:26.449> two<00:04:27.449> ways<00:04:27.660> don't

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
that's just guesswork two ways don't

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.300 
that's just guesswork two ways don't
we're<00:04:28.080> coming<00:04:28.380> work<00:04:29.370> hard<00:04:29.910> work<00:04:30.750> smart

meet them so and most of the people who
I<00:04:44.310> see<00:04:44.669> saying<00:04:45.479> you<00:04:45.750> know<00:04:46.580> such-and-such<00:04:47.580> this

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
I see saying you know such-and-such this

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.909 
I see saying you know such-and-such this
is<00:04:48.389> this<00:04:48.539> is<00:04:48.660> my<00:04:48.810> situation<00:04:49.470> this<00:04:49.620> is<00:04:49.680> why<00:04:49.889> I

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
is this is my situation this is why I

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.499 
is this is my situation this is why I
can't<00:04:50.220> jump<00:04:50.400> is<00:04:50.610> because<00:04:50.880> of<00:04:50.970> my<00:04:51.060> genetics

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
can't jump is because of my genetics

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.150 
can't jump is because of my genetics
they're<00:04:52.050> not<00:04:52.169> doing<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:52.500> right<00:04:52.650> things<00:04:52.889> and

there's really there's no reason to say
that<00:05:04.380> until<00:05:04.830> you<00:05:04.919> can<00:05:05.039> make<00:05:05.069> progress<00:05:05.539> anybody

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
that until you can make progress anybody

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.589 
that until you can make progress anybody

can make progress anybody can make

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:11.570 
can make progress anybody can make
progress<00:05:09.870> so<00:05:10.169> you're<00:05:10.620> not<00:05:10.889> making<00:05:11.310> progress

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
progress so you're not making progress

progress so you're not making progress
that's<00:05:12.569> the<00:05:12.810> real<00:05:12.960> problem<00:05:13.169> so<00:05:13.669> learn<00:05:14.669> how<00:05:14.699> to

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:14.909 
that's the real problem so learn how to

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:16.730 
that's the real problem so learn how to
make<00:05:15.120> progress<00:05:15.360> by<00:05:15.900> learning<00:05:16.259> the<00:05:16.500> proper

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
make progress by learning the proper

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.309 
make progress by learning the proper

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.700 
work ethic to put it to work and start
making<00:05:22.319> progress<00:05:22.669> then<00:05:23.669> you<00:05:24.479> know<00:05:24.710> that's

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
making progress then you know that's

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.189 
making progress then you know that's
just<00:05:25.889> all<00:05:26.009> there<00:05:26.130> is<00:05:26.250> to<00:05:26.430> it<00:05:26.550> make<00:05:27.090> progress

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 
just all there is to it make progress

which<00:05:30.870> most<00:05:31.169> of<00:05:31.320> you<00:05:31.500> probably<00:05:32.130> all<00:05:32.550> of<00:05:32.580> you

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:32.849 
which most of you probably all of you

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:34.879 
which most of you probably all of you
never<00:05:33.180> will<00:05:33.509> actually<00:05:34.020> depth<00:05:34.380> reach<00:05:34.710> that

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
never will actually depth reach that

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.120 
never will actually depth reach that
potential<00:05:35.280> which<00:05:36.210> is<00:05:36.240> very<00:05:36.719> great<00:05:37.169> so<00:05:37.800> I

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
potential which is very great so I

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.909 
potential which is very great so I
believe<00:05:38.789> that<00:05:39.120> we<00:05:39.599> all<00:05:39.719> have<00:05:39.830> you<00:05:40.830> know

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
believe that we all have you know

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:43.100 
believe that we all have you know
potential<00:05:41.880> beyond<00:05:42.419> what<00:05:42.539> we<00:05:42.659> think<00:05:42.870> we<00:05:42.960> have

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
potential beyond what we think we have

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.629 
potential beyond what we think we have
you<00:05:43.199> know<00:05:43.289> so<00:05:43.500> many<00:05:43.650> a<00:05:43.919> lot<00:05:43.979> of<00:05:44.130> trainers<00:05:44.550> out

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
you know so many a lot of trainers out

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.219 
you know so many a lot of trainers out
there<00:05:44.699> people<00:05:45.120> out<00:05:45.810> there<00:05:45.960> would<00:05:46.050> say<00:05:46.169> you

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
there people out there would say you

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.379 
there people out there would say you
know<00:05:46.349> not<00:05:46.500> everyone<00:05:46.949> can<00:05:47.250> can<00:05:47.580> can<00:05:48.150> reach

for a year two years people make amazing
progress<00:05:59.400> and<00:06:00.030> what<00:06:00.270> if<00:06:00.389> they<00:06:00.509> sustain<00:06:00.930> that

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
progress and what if they sustain that

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:06.980

some of the right things I'm talking

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.360 
some of the right things I'm talking
about<00:06:17.580> like<00:06:17.819> really<00:06:18.150> nailing<00:06:18.389> it<00:06:18.770> so<00:06:19.770> it<00:06:20.219> was

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
about like really nailing it so it was

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.800 
about like really nailing it so it was
i'm<00:06:20.729> obviously<00:06:20.940> one<00:06:21.270> of<00:06:21.300> the<00:06:21.389> trainers<00:06:21.690> who

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
i'm obviously one of the trainers who

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.839 
i'm obviously one of the trainers who
believes<00:06:22.590> that<00:06:22.680> we<00:06:23.099> have<00:06:23.130> a<00:06:23.340> little<00:06:23.699> more

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:23.849 
believes that we have a little more

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:25.969 
believes that we have a little more
potential<00:06:24.389> i<00:06:24.569> believe<00:06:25.500> that<00:06:25.710> we<00:06:25.800> can<00:06:25.949> reach

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
potential i believe that we can reach

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:28.939 
potential i believe that we can reach
those<00:06:26.280> levels<00:06:26.490> and<00:06:26.759> i<00:06:27.030> see<00:06:27.360> athletes<00:06:27.949> making

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:28.949 
those levels and i see athletes making

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:31.850 
those levels and i see athletes making
great<00:06:29.250> progress<00:06:29.490> and<00:06:29.990> it's<00:06:30.990> exciting<00:06:31.289> so<00:06:31.590> and

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
great progress and it's exciting so and

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.070 
great progress and it's exciting so and
i<00:06:31.919> also<00:06:32.069> think<00:06:32.190> that<00:06:32.460> our<00:06:32.810> ability

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
i also think that our ability

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.529 
i also think that our ability
you<00:06:34.380> know<00:06:34.500> we're<00:06:35.159> reaching<00:06:35.460> an<00:06:35.789> age<00:06:35.909> where<00:06:36.300> our

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 
you know we're reaching an age where our

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:38.010 
you know we're reaching an age where our
research

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
research

research
techniques<00:06:38.740> and<00:06:39.129> what<00:06:39.520> we<00:06:39.639> know<00:06:39.879> about<00:06:40.090> how

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:40.449 
techniques and what we know about how

techniques and what we know about how
muscles<00:06:40.960> and<00:06:41.169> how<00:06:41.259> movement<00:06:41.860> works<00:06:42.069> is<00:06:42.310> just

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 
muscles and how movement works is just

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:52.710 
muscles and how movement works is just
getting<00:06:42.819> better<00:06:43.090> and<00:06:43.270> better<00:06:43.660> and<00:06:43.900> better<00:06:44.139> and
