00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
some of you guys have been wondering

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.830 
some of you guys have been wondering
about<00:03:03.450> signal<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.530> battery<00:03:05.430> life<00:03:05.910> signal<00:03:06.599> is

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
about signal and battery life signal is

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.900 
about signal and battery life signal is
by<00:03:07.140> far<00:03:07.349> very<00:03:07.709> good<00:03:08.040> on<00:03:08.160> this<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.579> actually

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
by far very good on this I actually

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.300 
by far very good on this I actually
think<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.599> it<00:03:09.810> has<00:03:09.989> to<00:03:10.260> do<00:03:10.410> with<00:03:10.650> an<00:03:10.829> update

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
think that it has to do with an update

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.330 
think that it has to do with an update
so<00:03:11.609> this<00:03:12.209> one<00:03:12.390> has<00:03:12.540> four<00:03:12.930> dot<00:03:13.109> 0<00:03:13.260> dot<00:03:13.290> for<00:03:13.769> the

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
so this one has four dot 0 dot for the

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.839 
so this one has four dot 0 dot for the
verizon<00:03:14.760> has<00:03:14.930> 403<00:03:15.930> so<00:03:16.170> that<00:03:16.349> might<00:03:16.709> be<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.400> huge

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
verizon has 403 so that might be a huge

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.020 
verizon has 403 so that might be a huge
factor<00:03:18.090> in<00:03:18.329> signalized<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:20.040> yeah<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.639> Sprint

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
factor in signalized so yeah the Sprint

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.000 
factor in signalized so yeah the Sprint
Galaxy<00:03:21.180> Nexus<00:03:21.510> definitely<00:03:22.200> has<00:03:22.380> a<00:03:22.590> lot<00:03:22.620> better

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
Galaxy Nexus definitely has a lot better

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.569 
Galaxy Nexus definitely has a lot better
signal<00:03:23.489> than<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.030> verizon<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:25.310> battery<00:03:26.310> life

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
signal than the verizon and battery life

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.339 
signal than the verizon and battery life
so<00:03:27.030> far<00:03:27.269> I've<00:03:27.450> had<00:03:27.630> her<00:03:27.720> own<00:03:27.840> full<00:03:28.109> brightness
