a<00:04:26.340> pretty<00:04:26.520> simple<00:04:26.729> base<00:04:27.060> to<00:04:27.270> be

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
a pretty simple base to be

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.590 
I did lure the clan castle out very very
early<00:04:47.340> so<00:04:47.460> I<00:04:47.490> was<00:04:47.670> able<00:04:47.790> to<00:04:47.910> pull<00:04:48.090> them<00:04:48.240> out<00:04:48.330> and

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
early so I was able to pull them out and

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.180 
early so I was able to pull them out and
as<00:04:49.260> you're<00:04:49.410> gonna<00:04:49.500> notice<00:04:49.680> from<00:04:49.860> this<00:04:49.980> raid<00:04:50.160> I

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
as you're gonna notice from this raid I

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.220 
as you're gonna notice from this raid I
really<00:04:50.550> didn't<00:04:50.850> attack<00:04:51.150> the<00:04:51.330> Queen<00:04:51.540> side<00:04:51.810> too

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
really didn't attack the Queen side too

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.490 
really didn't attack the Queen side too
heavily<00:04:52.620> because<00:04:52.770> I<00:04:53.130> usually<00:04:53.790> tend<00:04:54.450> to<00:04:54.690> stray

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
heavily because I usually tend to stray

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.950 
heavily because I usually tend to stray
away<00:04:55.530> from<00:04:55.890> attacking<00:04:56.520> the<00:04:56.580> Queen<00:04:56.790> side<00:04:57.030> just

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
away from attacking the Queen side just

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.050 
away from attacking the Queen side just
because<00:04:58.320> she<00:04:59.010> will<00:04:59.160> lure<00:04:59.370> your<00:04:59.580> minions<00:04:59.910> in

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
because she will lure your minions in

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.750 
because she will lure your minions in
and<00:05:00.270> they<00:05:00.330> will<00:05:00.480> not<00:05:00.600> do<00:05:00.750> any<00:05:01.020> work<00:05:01.320> and<00:05:01.760> that

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
and they will not do any work and that

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.820 
and they will not do any work and that
that<00:05:03.150> can<00:05:03.330> contribute<00:05:03.720> to<00:05:03.900> a<00:05:03.990> failed<00:05:04.380> raid<00:05:04.620> so

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
that can contribute to a failed raid so

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.200 
that can contribute to a failed raid so
I<00:05:04.860> usually<00:05:05.220> do<00:05:05.460> stay<00:05:05.640> away<00:05:05.790> from<00:05:05.850> the<00:05:06.030> Queen

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
I usually do stay away from the Queen

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.600 
I usually do stay away from the Queen
because<00:05:06.900> she's<00:05:07.050> a<00:05:07.410> so<00:05:07.650> gonna<00:05:08.190> lightning

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
because she's a so gonna lightning

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.010

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
the sides unfortunately there was a

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.220 
the sides unfortunately there was a
Tesla<00:05:38.760> layer<00:05:38.910> or<00:05:39.180> there<00:05:39.540> were<00:05:39.630> two<00:05:39.780> Tesla's

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
Tesla layer or there were two Tesla's

Tesla layer or there were two Tesla's
and<00:05:40.380> those<00:05:40.620> really<00:05:40.920> move<00:05:41.220> my<00:05:41.400> loons<00:05:41.580> away<00:05:41.940> from

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180

and those really move my loons away from
the<00:05:42.270> inside<00:05:42.510> of<00:05:42.570> the<00:05:42.660> base<00:05:42.810> away<00:05:43.590> from<00:05:43.770> that

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
the inside of the base away from that

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.470 
the inside of the base away from that
air<00:05:44.010> defense<00:05:44.040> and<00:05:44.730> just<00:05:44.940> kind<00:05:45.120> of<00:05:45.150> screwed

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
air defense and just kind of screwed

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.420 
air defense and just kind of screwed
that's<00:05:45.660> what<00:05:45.870> had<00:05:46.050> my<00:05:46.350> raid<00:05:46.560> just<00:05:47.160> kind<00:05:47.340> of

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
that's what had my raid just kind of

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.500 
that's what had my raid just kind of
screwed<00:05:47.700> up<00:05:47.790> a<00:05:47.910> little<00:05:48.030> bit<00:05:48.180> so<00:05:48.270> if<00:05:48.360> we<00:05:48.420> would

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
screwed up a little bit so if we would

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.060 
screwed up a little bit so if we would
have<00:05:48.600> checked<00:05:48.720> for<00:05:48.900> Tesla's<00:05:49.200> earlier<00:05:49.500> this

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
have checked for Tesla's earlier this

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
have checked for Tesla's earlier this
raid<00:05:50.310> could<00:05:50.430> have<00:05:50.550> been<00:05:50.640> a<00:05:50.670> little<00:05:50.970> bit

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
raid could have been a little bit

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.310 
raid could have been a little bit
different<00:05:51.480> and<00:05:51.630> it<00:05:51.780> would<00:05:51.900> have<00:05:51.990> been<00:05:52.080> a<00:05:52.110> lot

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
different and it would have been a lot

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.450 
different and it would have been a lot
easier<00:05:52.350> to<00:05:52.800> beat<00:05:52.950> but<00:05:53.130> I<00:05:53.190> did<00:05:53.340> not

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
easier to beat but I did not

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.670 
easier to beat but I did not
unfortunately<00:05:53.820> and<00:05:54.390> that<00:05:55.170> did<00:05:55.350> kind<00:05:55.530> of<00:05:55.560> ruin

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
unfortunately and that did kind of ruin

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.520 
unfortunately and that did kind of ruin
