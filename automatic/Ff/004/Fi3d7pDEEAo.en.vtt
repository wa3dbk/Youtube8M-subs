00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
but that's kind of risky so if you're

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.420

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
trick I reckon only doing or I recommend

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.330 
trick I reckon only doing or I recommend
doing<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.280> two<00:00:38.460> cut<00:00:38.670> lip<00:00:38.910> set<00:00:39.090> up<00:00:40.040> this<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.219> a

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
doing the two cut lip set up this just a

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.500 
doing the two cut lip set up this just a
lot<00:00:41.520> that's<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.329> flat-out<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.719> lot<00:00:42.960> easier<00:00:44.510> so

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
lot that's just flat-out a lot easier so

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.020 
lot that's just flat-out a lot easier so
the<00:00:46.440> first<00:00:46.680> coconut<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.520> have<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.820> sacrifice

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
the first coconut you have to sacrifice

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.240 
the first coconut you have to sacrifice
to<00:00:48.360> are<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.840> Jesus<00:00:49.050> by<00:00:49.440> placing<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
to are in Jesus by placing it in the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.010 
to are in Jesus by placing it in the
blender<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:51.210> it's<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:51.660> going<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.809> disappear

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
blender and it's just going to disappear

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.889 
blender and it's just going to disappear
so<00:00:52.640> then<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:54.000> have<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.180> go<00:00:54.329> get<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> second

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
so then you have to go get the second

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.270 
so then you have to go get the second
coconut<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.410> then<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.739> where<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:55.949> tip

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280
