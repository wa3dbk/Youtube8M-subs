00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.969
 My relationship with the beach I think 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.070
 the love relationship is not 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.039
 I discovered that I'm more in love. 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.720
 for surfing began a little bit late 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.210
 Because I lived in Sao Paulo, so I did not 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.010
 had this agreement with the beach and 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.619
 2006 I moved to the river 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.570
 I did not stop anymore, it's always what I have 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.669
 five minutes free 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.290
 I'll have a look at the beach races. 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.149
 if there is a day I will surf 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.149
 I love sunshine, I love the beach. 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.170
 I joke that I 'm a garbage collector in 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.030
 because when I'm surfing if I 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.860
 I'm going through a little bag. 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.390
 putting in your pocket, huh? 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.309
 and then when I leave I go out with a 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.260
 leg of that size so the face of 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.850
 pocket and sometimes when I'm surfing 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.680
 with the douro is that clothes of 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.750
 very cold water rubber 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.680
 As she does not have a pocket, I'll put it on. 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.720
 an effort in the bar of the pants that is well 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.220
 just the beach doing sometimes 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.560
 get out of the beach so it looks like I 'm 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.270
 full of cars and on the leg but they are not 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.710
 Several plastic sachets 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.060
 I can not stand the salt 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.060
 I can be free here 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.440
 once a friend of mine is joking 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.300
 with me what I wanted is that I stayed 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.080
 joking like a little child inside 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.540
 from water 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.060
 we are surfing haiti had a 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.860
 fresh plastic watering can 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.720
 young but down there 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.980

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.470

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.940

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.120

 I caught a wave 5 days ago in the mouth. 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.420
 genÃ© biting and then it became a joke 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.420

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.400
