 Aromatic in the right choice 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.210

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.860
 only watch one with 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.860

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.039

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.200
 I have a slices look 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.700
 cut and then in the refrigerator 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.290
 put it so that it gets cold faster 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.490
 then you can get better or faster or 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.530

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:30.410

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:39.570
 do the patient and then here 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:42.720
 cream cheese then mix everything nice 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.700
 and if you realize okay you have one 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.780
 a little too much cream cheese the cake 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:52.140
 gray then you just take one more 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:54.570

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.090

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.090
 fathers with children 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.099
 the things are now cured the 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.440
 I put in the froster and the 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.330
 are now really cold and so you can 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.060
 Here also very good here with darker 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.530
 conversion or with light culture 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.760
 just do not cover it 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:51.150
 here's a fork and then you leave 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.900
 Just dive it in here so briefly 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.060
 you can not get it back yet 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:00.670
 out and there you have the second cable 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:04.120
 take that a little bit last time 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.799
 drain is very important because otherwise 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.620
 you have such a thick layer here 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.000
 then get the kittens 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.870
 not with her little scenes 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.010
 bitten 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:20.650
 then you have to cut it in half so and then 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:22.000
 I take off baking paper 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.630
 I think that's going to be really weird right now 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.630
 julius make if culture here 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.630
 work 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.280
 the magnificent specimens now hang here 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.720
 the table yes that's the hottest part 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.170
 Decorate that makes the children on 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.170
 most fun 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.460
 yes that is now almost finished the cake 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.340
 pops is only on the spit of every game 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:15.640
 so had to watch the game 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:18.430
 Children then almost once with me 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:22.270
 leave an hour in the refrigerator now 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.260
 or half an hour in the froster then 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.550
 they have to be hard then 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.780
 you should actually lose weight 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.170
 can and then hold just such a hand 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.810
 eat 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.460
 the parts are now ready for the 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.350
 Mother's Day and I think the children 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.270
 We can do it ourselves if the mother 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.770
 for example, shopping is like that or so 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.780
 you do not have to go with it a bit 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.010
 you can work faster back 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.510
 maybe buy somehow 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.920
 It makes you happy when you are 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.240
 mother to get something like that 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.150
 I would be glad if you could 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.140

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.140
