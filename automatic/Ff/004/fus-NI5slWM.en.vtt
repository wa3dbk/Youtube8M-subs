00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 The first thing we have is to tell us 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:08.260
 that the best description of the video here 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.930
 will take us by chat 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:14.040
 and here are the calculations cutting in 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.240
 spanish punto radio 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.630
 you erase 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.580
 ok this has gone up for me as you can 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.890
 watch 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.840
 and here to download it we give here where 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.510
 he says download and they are giving visits 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.390
 let's give this to those who enter 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.940
 free 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.329
 and here is downloading as you 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.120
 can see 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.960
 and if you do not download the first one 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.640
 you give to where he said donan time 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.350
 but it is impossible to come out like this 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:51.409
 because if it happens good after it 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.299
 download everything to one hundred percent we 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:54.589
 let's give it to me for example I 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:56.659
 in every download 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.939
 I keep it on the desk so that 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:01.280
 be easier and good after 

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:04.280
 stalls and erase 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.280
 extremes 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.479
 well I 'm going to give them hay 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.970
 because as I already have it 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:23.000
 but you and let him take after 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.630
 have it open the folder and here it is 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.070
 all everything when 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.890
 all 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.550
 as necessary to open it 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.580
 but you do not see me the click to anything nothing 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.130
 of this nothing 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.570
 well here I have installed this I have 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.840
 installed this I have not gotten myself 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.710
 none of these folders holds everything 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.990
 all right 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.110
 but eye 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:02:00.430
 before they start it here it's going to 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:05.010
 generate about 61 or 50 because when 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:09.180
 abres puts an intro that sounds very ugly 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:12.819
 now we open it click here this exit 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:15.010
 it is an icon 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.840
 to multiply the controls and know 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.060
 more we give here 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.269
 for example that is every action that 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:27.540
 this has for example advance 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.540
 retreat stretched jump shoot 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.940
 good 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:37.220
 here are the letters well-suited 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:43.490
 for example keyboard or how to see how the 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:47.080
 rhyme this this does not need 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:50.940
 it does not take much but good 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.940
 we have the secondary 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.610
 for example, we click 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.750
 and we put you for example 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.510
 [Music] 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:06.780
 and here is in letter k 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.630
 we see that I already have it I go back to it and 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.400
 will change this 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.400
 we have it here 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.240
 shoot 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.190
 [Music] 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.190
 and well that 's fine 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.400

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.049
 [Music] 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.049

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.020

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.800
 of the other two agents 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:08.830

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.830
 the controls so that month by month 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:27.910

 just apologize for some that are 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:17.970
