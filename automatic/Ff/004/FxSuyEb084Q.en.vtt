new macbook let's go ahead and take a
look<00:00:03.540> and<00:00:03.629> see<00:00:03.720> how<00:00:03.810> all<00:00:03.959> this<00:00:04.049> thing<00:00:04.230> runs

look and see how all this thing runs

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.559 
look and see how all this thing runs
from<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.220> start<00:00:05.520> of<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.819> game<00:00:06.000> I<00:00:06.029> can<00:00:06.390> tell

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
from the start of the game I can tell

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.270 
from the start of the game I can tell
you<00:00:06.660> that<00:00:06.779> I'm<00:00:06.899> getting<00:00:07.049> about<00:00:07.350> 20<00:00:07.770> frames<00:00:08.040> per

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
you that I'm getting about 20 frames per

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.620 
you that I'm getting about 20 frames per
second<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:08.960> jumped<00:00:09.960> from<00:00:10.290> 20<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:11.190> 25<00:00:11.730> sometimes

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
second I jumped from 20 to 25 sometimes

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.799 
second I jumped from 20 to 25 sometimes
30<00:00:12.990> I<00:00:13.400> know<00:00:14.400> for<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.610> lot<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.759> MMOs<00:00:15.240> this<00:00:15.480> isn't

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
30 I know for a lot of MMOs this isn't

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.240 
30 I know for a lot of MMOs this isn't
like<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.080> biggest<00:00:16.440> deal-breaker

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
like the biggest deal-breaker

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.429 
like the biggest deal-breaker
but<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:17.820> mean<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.270> can<00:00:18.480> be<00:00:18.720> during<00:00:18.990> intense

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
but I mean it can be during intense

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.370 
but I mean it can be during intense
matches<00:00:19.920> with<00:00:20.100> PvP<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:21.720> thing<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.260> would

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
matches with PvP the thing is I would

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.550 
matches with PvP the thing is I would
say<00:00:22.560> it's<00:00:22.710> running<00:00:23.039> pretty<00:00:23.279> alright

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
say it's running pretty alright

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.849 
say it's running pretty alright
initially<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.710> game<00:00:25.890> kind<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.310> started<00:00:26.760> out

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
initially the game kind of started out

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.589 
initially the game kind of started out
on<00:00:28.859> low<00:00:29.189> graphics<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.000> bumped<00:00:30.210> everything

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
on low graphics and I bumped everything

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.590 
on low graphics and I bumped everything
up<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.840> medium<00:00:31.579> so<00:00:32.579> like<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.850> these<00:00:32.969> areas<00:00:33.329> here

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
up to medium so like in these areas here

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.450 
up to medium so like in these areas here
I<00:00:33.719> was<00:00:33.899> getting<00:00:33.989> like<00:00:34.200> 30<00:00:34.770> frames<00:00:35.100> like<00:00:35.309> when

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
I was getting like 30 frames like when

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.959 
I was getting like 30 frames like when
I'm<00:00:35.550> going<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:35.910> route<00:00:36.149> here<00:00:37.700> so<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:38.820> will

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
I'm going this route here so this will

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.090 
I'm going this route here so this will
give<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.300> pretty<00:00:39.570> good<00:00:40.100> well

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
give you a pretty good well

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.799 
give you a pretty good well
understanding<00:00:41.730> here<00:00:41.879> what<00:00:42.090> it's<00:00:42.210> like<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
understanding here what it's like in the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.049 
understanding here what it's like in the
beginning<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.770> areas<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.610> start<00:00:44.910> in

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
beginning of the areas that you start in

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.479 
beginning of the areas that you start in
and<00:00:45.320> generally<00:00:46.320> these<00:00:46.559> areas<00:00:46.980> are<00:00:47.100> not<00:00:47.280> very

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
and generally these areas are not very

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.459 
and generally these areas are not very
intense<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.420> if<00:00:48.719> you're<00:00:48.930> not<00:00:49.110> getting<00:00:49.350> that

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
intense so if you're not getting that

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.380 
intense so if you're not getting that
much<00:00:49.649> frames<00:00:49.950> here<00:00:50.399> chances<00:00:51.090> are<00:00:51.210> you're<00:00:51.360> not

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
much frames here chances are you're not

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.939 
much frames here chances are you're not
gonna<00:00:51.690> get<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.079> much<00:00:52.289> more<00:00:52.559> when<00:00:52.739> you're

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
gonna get that much more when you're

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.100 
gonna get that much more when you're
actually<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.000> real<00:00:54.239> battles<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.899> mean<00:00:55.050> I

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
actually like in real battles I mean I

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.220 
actually like in real battles I mean I
just<00:00:55.140> started<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.800> game<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.840> by<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.930> way<00:00:58.079> this

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
just started the game so by the way this

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.200 
just started the game so by the way this
games<00:00:58.469> got<00:00:58.739> some<00:00:58.920> pretty<00:00:59.070> kick-ass<00:00:59.370> music

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210

I'll tell you that I've never actually
played<00:01:01.800> World<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.100> Warcraft<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.850> very

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
played World of Warcraft this is a very

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.090 
played World of Warcraft this is a very
interesting<00:01:03.270> request<00:01:03.780> some<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.979> guys

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
interesting request some of you guys

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.899 
interesting request some of you guys
made<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:06.420> would<00:01:07.080> say<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.500> it's<00:01:07.619> definitely

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
made I would say that it's definitely

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.140 
made I would say that it's definitely
playable<00:01:09.320> on<00:01:10.320> medium<00:01:11.189> graphics<00:01:11.700> but<00:01:11.909> if<00:01:12.030> it

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
playable on medium graphics but if it

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.570 
playable on medium graphics but if it
does<00:01:12.330> get<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.840> little<00:01:12.869> laggy<00:01:13.350> which<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.430> might

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
does get a little laggy which it might

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.020 
does get a little laggy which it might
doing<00:01:14.939> some<00:01:15.150> intense<00:01:15.509> moments<00:01:16.820> you<00:01:17.820> might

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
doing some intense moments you might

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.580 
doing some intense moments you might
need<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.240> drop<00:01:18.390> down<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.659> low<00:01:18.990> but<00:01:19.350> it'll

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
need to drop down to low but it'll

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.340 
need to drop down to low but it'll
definitely<00:01:19.830> run<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> low<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.720> I'll<00:01:22.080> go<00:01:22.229> ahead

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
definitely run a low so I'll go ahead

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.890 
definitely run a low so I'll go ahead
and<00:01:22.860> I'll<00:01:22.950> turn<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> graphics<00:01:24.180> down<00:01:24.390> here<00:01:24.689> and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
and I'll turn the graphics down here and

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.109 
and I'll turn the graphics down here and
I'll<00:01:24.990> show<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.259> what<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.680> defaults<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.189> as<00:01:26.580> you

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
I'll show you what it defaults to as you

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.770 
I'll show you what it defaults to as you
can<00:01:27.240> see<00:01:27.420> here<00:01:27.720> 1280<00:01:28.320> by<00:01:28.500> 800<00:01:28.850> so<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.420> good

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
can see here 1280 by 800 so it's on good

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.560 
can see here 1280 by 800 so it's on good
which<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.500> call<00:01:32.009> medium<00:01:32.400> because<00:01:33.390> when<00:01:33.509> you

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
which I call medium because when you

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.670 
which I call medium because when you
click<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.900> there's<00:01:34.140> fare<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.560> then

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
click on it there's fare and then

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.730 
click on it there's fare and then
there's<00:01:34.860> low<00:01:35.509> so<00:01:36.509> if<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.110> put<00:01:37.350> all<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
there's low so if you put all the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.109 
there's low so if you put all the
graphics<00:01:38.100> down<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.460> low<00:01:38.640> here's<00:01:38.939> what<00:01:39.090> a

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
graphics down on low here's what a

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.870 
graphics down on low here's what a
little<00:01:39.329> look<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:41.250> then<00:01:41.400> it'll<00:01:41.640> probably

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
little look like and then it'll probably

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.770 
little look like and then it'll probably
look<00:01:42.060> like

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
look like

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.929 
look like
but<00:01:43.790> we<00:01:44.790> want<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.060> know<00:01:45.240> what<00:01:45.540> it's<00:01:45.689> like<00:01:46.939> with

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
but we want to know what it's like with

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.719 
but we want to know what it's like with
the<00:01:48.060> most<00:01:48.299> FPS<00:01:49.110> possible<00:01:49.770> okay<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.399> here<00:01:50.700> we

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
the most FPS possible okay so here we

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.370 
the most FPS possible okay so here we
have<00:01:50.909> all<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.090> graphics<00:01:51.479> turned<00:01:51.750> down<00:01:51.960> and

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
have all the graphics turned down and

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.670 
have all the graphics turned down and
we're<00:01:53.220> getting<00:01:53.460> good<00:01:53.610> 51<00:01:54.270> FPS<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.590> we

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
we're getting good 51 FPS so we

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.819 
we're getting good 51 FPS so we
increased<00:01:56.070> about<00:01:56.820> 20<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.659> 30<00:01:57.899> fps<00:01:58.409> just<00:01:58.710> by

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
increased about 20 to 30 fps just by

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.709 
increased about 20 to 30 fps just by
putting<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.159> on<00:01:59.250> low<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.759> I<00:02:00.299> mean<00:02:00.450> if<00:02:00.540> you're

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
putting it on low and I mean if you're

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.420 
putting it on low and I mean if you're
really<00:02:00.990> an<00:02:01.170> enthusiast<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.159> game

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
really an enthusiast of this game

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.399 
really an enthusiast of this game
there's<00:02:03.060> really<00:02:03.270> no<00:02:03.509> reason<00:02:03.750> why<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.140> can't

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
there's really no reason why you can't

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.980 
there's really no reason why you can't
play<00:02:04.619> this<00:02:04.740> game<00:02:04.890> on<00:02:05.430> low<00:02:05.820> graphics<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.570> still

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
play this game on low graphics and still

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.380 
play this game on low graphics and still
pretty<00:02:07.500> much<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:08.069> mean<00:02:08.610> yeah<00:02:08.940> I'm<00:02:09.000> getting<00:02:09.239> good

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
pretty much I mean yeah I'm getting good

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.410 
pretty much I mean yeah I'm getting good
60<00:02:09.840> pretty<00:02:10.050> much<00:02:10.140> anywhere<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.500> go<00:02:10.739> now

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
60 pretty much anywhere I go now

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.270 
60 pretty much anywhere I go now
I<00:02:11.510> mean<00:02:12.080> even<00:02:12.170> if<00:02:12.349> I<00:02:12.410> come<00:02:12.620> back<00:02:12.800> to<00:02:12.950> this<00:02:13.040> town

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
I mean even if I come back to this town

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.830 
I mean even if I come back to this town
over<00:02:13.459> here<00:02:13.730> it's<00:02:14.150> probably<00:02:14.390> still<00:02:14.510> gonna<00:02:14.660> be

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
over here it's probably still gonna be

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.270 
over here it's probably still gonna be
60<00:02:16.540> my<00:02:17.540> next<00:02:17.780> goal<00:02:17.900> would<00:02:18.050> probably<00:02:18.380> be<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.830> try

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
60 my next goal would probably be to try

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.900 
60 my next goal would probably be to try

how<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.510> play<00:02:35.720> this<00:02:35.840> game<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.440> do<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.040> test

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
how to play this game and do the test

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.770 
how to play this game and do the test
for<00:02:37.519> you<00:02:37.610> guys<00:02:37.790> if<00:02:38.150> you're<00:02:38.480> willing<00:02:38.720> to

for you guys if you're willing to

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.240 
for you guys if you're willing to

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
subscribe and like the video and all

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.130 
subscribe and like the video and all
that<00:02:40.430> but<00:02:41.150> if<00:02:41.239> you're<00:02:41.360> not<00:02:41.450> then<00:02:41.750> I<00:02:41.780> guess<00:02:42.050> I

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
that but if you're not then I guess I

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.600 
that but if you're not then I guess I
probably<00:02:42.230> won't<00:02:42.470> do<00:02:42.650> it<00:02:42.800> so<00:02:43.160> this<00:02:43.280> is<00:02:43.340> just<00:02:43.459> a

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
probably won't do it so this is just a

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.640 
probably won't do it so this is just a
general<00:02:43.940> video<00:02:44.120> here<00:02:44.480> but<00:02:45.080> yeah<00:02:45.200> well<00:02:45.470> flow

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
general video here but yeah well flow

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.860 
general video here but yeah well flow
graphics<00:02:46.130> I<00:02:46.310> mean<00:02:46.459> it's<00:02:46.610> it's<00:02:47.120> running<00:02:47.569> really

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
graphics I mean it's it's running really

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.020 
graphics I mean it's it's running really
smooth<00:02:48.319> and<00:02:48.620> by<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.160> way<00:02:49.340> you<00:02:49.400> don't<00:02:49.760> have<00:02:49.910> to

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
smooth and by the way you don't have to

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.820 
smooth and by the way you don't have to
be<00:02:50.090> plugged<00:02:50.209> into<00:02:50.510> power<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:51.410> even<00:02:51.650> if<00:02:51.739> you

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
be plugged into power and even if you

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.229 
be plugged into power and even if you
are<00:02:51.950> plugged<00:02:52.220> into<00:02:52.340> power<00:02:52.580> it<00:02:52.850> makes<00:02:53.060> no

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
are plugged into power it makes no

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.229 
are plugged into power it makes no
difference<00:02:53.530> so<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:55.069> doesn't<00:02:55.400> it<00:02:56.030> doesn't

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
difference so it doesn't it doesn't

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.910 
difference so it doesn't it doesn't
boost<00:02:56.569> the<00:02:56.840> gigahertz<00:02:57.140> elf<00:02:57.470> it<00:02:57.590> doesn't<00:02:57.830> do

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
boost the gigahertz elf it doesn't do

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.920 
boost the gigahertz elf it doesn't do
any<00:02:58.100> of<00:02:58.220> that<00:02:58.280> so<00:02:58.850> you're<00:02:59.690> pretty<00:02:59.870> much

look<00:04:32.970> pretty<00:04:33.120> decent<00:04:33.380> just<00:04:34.380> just<00:04:34.860> run<00:04:35.040> up

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
look pretty decent just just run up

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.890 
look pretty decent just just run up
medium<00:04:35.580> to<00:04:35.730> low<00:04:35.880> and<00:04:36.150> you<00:04:36.270> should<00:04:36.540> be<00:04:36.630> fine

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
medium to low and you should be fine

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.050 
medium to low and you should be fine
getting<00:04:37.200> about<00:04:37.410> 30<00:04:38.010> FPS<00:04:38.490> so<00:04:38.670> maybe<00:04:38.880> a<00:04:38.910> little

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
getting about 30 FPS so maybe a little

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.310 
getting about 30 FPS so maybe a little
bit<00:04:39.240> more<00:04:39.420> depending<00:04:39.780> on<00:04:39.840> where<00:04:40.020> you're<00:04:40.170> at

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
bit more depending on where you're at

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.590 
bit more depending on where you're at
but<00:04:41.130> I<00:04:41.190> don't<00:04:41.520> recommend<00:04:41.790> running<00:04:42.210> on<00:04:42.390> medium

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
but I don't recommend running on medium

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.170 
but I don't recommend running on medium
graphics<00:04:43.170> and<00:04:43.410> intensely<00:04:44.250> populated<00:04:44.790> areas

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
graphics and intensely populated areas

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.910 
graphics and intensely populated areas
because<00:04:45.630> I<00:04:45.900> don't<00:04:46.200> think<00:04:46.410> it's<00:04:46.530> gonna<00:04:46.680> handle

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
because I don't think it's gonna handle

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.290 
because I don't think it's gonna handle
it<00:04:47.010> if<00:04:47.190> you<00:04:47.280> want<00:04:47.460> to<00:04:47.520> see<00:04:47.610> that<00:04:47.700> video<00:04:47.970> let<00:04:48.270> me
