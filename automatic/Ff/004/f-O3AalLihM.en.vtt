well is she little update here I've been
working<00:00:43.879> on<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:44.750> frame<00:00:45.280> for<00:00:46.280> this<00:00:46.399> whole

00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:46.609 
working on the frame for this whole

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:49.899 
working on the frame for this whole
truck<00:00:46.909> and<00:00:47.649> I<00:00:48.649> got<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:48.890> front<00:00:49.129> section<00:00:49.489> of<00:00:49.789> it

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:49.909 
truck and I got the front section of it

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:51.310 
truck and I got the front section of it
done<00:00:50.089> i'm<00:00:50.300> pretty<00:00:50.570> happy<00:00:50.690> with<00:00:51.019> the<00:00:51.079> way<00:00:51.289> it

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
done i'm pretty happy with the way it

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:59.969 
done i'm pretty happy with the way it
turned<00:00:51.530> out<00:00:52.039> i<00:00:56.379> built<00:00:57.379> these<00:00:58.359> shackle<00:00:59.359> mounts

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979 
turned out i built these shackle mounts

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:02.770 
turned out i built these shackle mounts
they<00:01:00.979> have<00:01:01.189> to<00:01:01.339> come<00:01:01.549> outside<00:01:01.789> the<00:01:02.479> frame

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
they have to come outside the frame

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.850 
they have to come outside the frame
because<00:01:03.729> both<00:01:04.729> springs<00:01:05.119> sit<00:01:05.330> on<00:01:05.420> that<00:01:05.740> axle<00:01:06.740> at

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
because both springs sit on that axle at

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.950 
because both springs sit on that axle at
an<00:01:06.979> angle<00:01:07.340> because<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.789> old<00:01:07.970> frame<00:01:08.270> was<00:01:08.750> white

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
an angle because the old frame was white

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.330 
an angle because the old frame was white
shape<00:01:09.289> and<00:01:09.979> these<00:01:10.460> rails<00:01:10.729> are<00:01:10.909> straight<00:01:11.259> so

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
shape and these rails are straight so

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.290 
shape and these rails are straight so
that's<00:01:13.340> how<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:13.550> springs<00:01:13.909> are<00:01:14.030> mounted<00:01:14.270> on

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
that's how the springs are mounted on

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.539 
that's how the springs are mounted on
the<00:01:14.450> axle<00:01:14.810> so<00:01:14.990> I<00:01:15.050> want<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:15.289> keep<00:01:15.440> those<00:01:15.649> angles

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
the axle so I want to keep those angles

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.249 
the axle so I want to keep those angles
in<00:01:16.729> order<00:01:17.390> to<00:01:17.450> do<00:01:17.539> that<00:01:17.659> ahead<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:18.049> put<00:01:18.170> this

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
in order to do that ahead and put this

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.980 
in order to do that ahead and put this
mount<00:01:18.530> out<00:01:18.740> here<00:01:18.979> and<00:01:19.670> I<00:01:20.360> might<00:01:20.509> change<00:01:20.720> that

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
mount out here and I might change that

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.559 
mount out here and I might change that
down<00:01:21.619> the<00:01:21.799> road<00:01:21.979> you<00:01:22.190> know<00:01:22.340> I<00:01:22.610> figure<00:01:23.450> I'm

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
down the road you know I figure I'm

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:24.880 
down the road you know I figure I'm
going<00:01:23.720> to<00:01:23.780> build<00:01:23.929> this<00:01:24.049> thing<00:01:24.110> about<00:01:24.440> 12<00:01:24.740> or<00:01:24.860> 13

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
going to build this thing about 12 or 13

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.669 
going to build this thing about 12 or 13
times<00:01:25.549> before<00:01:26.119> I<00:01:26.149> get<00:01:26.299> it<00:01:26.390> done<00:01:26.600> as<00:01:27.289> a<00:01:27.350> matter

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
times before I get it done as a matter

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:30.940 
times before I get it done as a matter
of<00:01:27.770> fact<00:01:27.860> I<00:01:28.450> had<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:29.630> quite<00:01:30.560> a<00:01:30.590> bit<00:01:30.649> further

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
of fact I had it quite a bit further

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.740 
of fact I had it quite a bit further
together<00:01:31.340> last<00:01:31.640> night<00:01:31.789> and<00:01:32.149> is<00:01:32.270> right<00:01:32.479> now<00:01:32.630> and

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.630 
together last night and is right now and
I'm<00:01:32.840> tearing<00:01:33.140> it<00:01:33.229> all<00:01:33.319> down<00:01:33.500> again<00:01:33.799> because

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
I'm tearing it all down again because

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.820 
I'm tearing it all down again because
don't<00:01:34.850> like<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.119> way<00:01:35.209> it<00:01:35.270> turned<00:01:35.330> out<00:01:35.709> and<00:01:36.709> you

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
saw in the party area in the opening

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.149 
saw in the party area in the opening
shot<00:01:39.440> there<00:01:39.830> I<00:01:41.259> had<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:42.380> cab<00:01:42.619> setting<00:01:43.009> down

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
shot there I had the cab setting down

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.380 
shot there I had the cab setting down
and<00:01:43.579> the<00:01:44.270> agents<00:01:44.750> it's<00:01:45.020> way<00:01:45.380> too<00:01:45.439> high<00:01:46.390> and

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
when you get that radiator up there

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.289 
when you get that radiator up there
where<00:01:49.039> it's<00:01:49.130> supposed<00:01:49.219> to<00:01:49.490> be<00:01:49.640> it's<00:01:49.670> just<00:01:49.909> way

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
where it's supposed to be it's just way

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.419 
where it's supposed to be it's just way
up<00:01:50.479> higher<00:01:50.719> than<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:53.920> firewall<00:01:54.920> up<00:01:55.189> there

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
up higher than the the firewall up there

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:56.830 
up higher than the the firewall up there
at<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.549> top<00:01:55.640> of<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:55.969> cow<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:56.689> just

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
at the top of the cow and it just

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.130 
at the top of the cow and it just
doesn't<00:01:57.109> look<00:01:57.170> right<00:01:57.579> so<00:01:59.049> another<00:02:00.049> thing

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
doesn't look right so another thing

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.490 
doesn't look right so another thing
that's<00:02:00.439> not<00:02:00.590> right<00:02:00.829> is<00:02:02.049> where<00:02:03.049> this<00:02:03.200> frame<00:02:03.469> is

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
that's not right is where this frame is

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.679 
that's not right is where this frame is
lead<00:02:03.890> down<00:02:04.130> I<00:02:04.159> mean<00:02:04.460> I<00:02:04.549> like<00:02:04.759> that<00:02:05.030> what<00:02:05.570> I've

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
lead down I mean I like that what I've

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.009 
lead down I mean I like that what I've
got<00:02:05.840> done<00:02:05.869> there<00:02:06.289> but<00:02:06.469> it's<00:02:06.590> too<00:02:06.770> far<00:02:07.009> back<00:02:07.219> and

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
got done there but it's too far back and

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.830 
got done there but it's too far back and
it<00:02:09.019> comes<00:02:09.289> this<00:02:09.619> disease<00:02:10.399> part<00:02:10.670> is<00:02:10.850> inside<00:02:11.690> the

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
it comes this disease part is inside the

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.449 
it comes this disease part is inside the
cab<00:02:12.079> once<00:02:12.350> you're<00:02:12.500> sitting<00:02:12.799> down<00:02:12.829> which<00:02:13.280> is

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
cab once you're sitting down which is

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.949 
cab once you're sitting down which is
kind<00:02:13.730> of<00:02:13.790> nice<00:02:13.940> because<00:02:14.209> it's<00:02:14.510> just<00:02:14.720> about<00:02:14.900> the

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
kind of nice because it's just about the

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.069 
kind of nice because it's just about the
right<00:02:15.170> angle<00:02:15.560> for<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.739> floorboard<00:02:16.480> but<00:02:17.480> it

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079 
right angle for the floorboard but it

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.190 
right angle for the floorboard but it
just<00:02:18.320> doesn't<00:02:18.530> look<00:02:18.799> right<00:02:19.870> so<00:02:20.870> two<00:02:21.049> things

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
just doesn't look right so two things

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.140 
just doesn't look right so two things
I'm<00:02:21.440> going<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.650> do<00:02:21.769> I've<00:02:22.459> already<00:02:22.700> pull<00:02:23.030> that

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
I'm going to do I've already pull that

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.039 
I'm going to do I've already pull that

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
engine and cut those motor mounts out

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.569 
engine and cut those motor mounts out
and<00:02:27.049> I<00:02:27.109> got<00:02:27.260> welded<00:02:27.680> in<00:02:27.799> there<00:02:27.980> real<00:02:28.160> nice<00:02:28.310> and

the<00:02:47.930> forward<00:02:48.930> so<00:02:49.710> it's<00:02:50.010> up<00:02:50.190> here<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:51.360> it'll

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
the forward so it's up here and it'll

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.980 
the forward so it's up here and it'll

about a foot further toward the front

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
be a lot easier to set the frame down

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.620 
be a lot easier to set the frame down
low<00:03:22.380> but<00:03:23.160> with<00:03:23.460> these<00:03:23.640> leaf<00:03:23.940> springs<00:03:24.330> these

rail<00:03:29.040> just<00:03:29.340> kind<00:03:29.730> of<00:03:29.790> has<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:29.970> set<00:03:30.330> up<00:03:30.510> there

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
rail just kind of has to set up there

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.970 
rail just kind of has to set up there
where<00:03:30.990> it<00:03:31.110> is<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.970> need<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.000> be<00:03:33.180> level<00:03:33.980> in

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
where it is and need to be level in

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.420 
where it is and need to be level in
order<00:03:35.130> to<00:03:35.310> keep<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.460> caster<00:03:36.120> in<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:37.430> front

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
order to keep the caster in the front

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.090 
order to keep the caster in the front
end<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:38.880> so<00:03:39.840> have<00:03:40.050> that<00:03:40.200> all<00:03:40.350> down<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.740> also

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
end and so have that all down and also

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.980 
end and so have that all down and also
degrees<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.610> engine<00:03:41.970> what<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.150> put<00:03:42.390> it<00:03:42.450> in<00:03:42.540> I

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
degrees that engine what I put it in I

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.260 
degrees that engine what I put it in I
had<00:03:43.890> everything<00:03:44.370> right<00:03:44.670> except<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.060> height

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
had everything right except the height

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.870 
had everything right except the height
so<00:03:45.930> it's<00:03:46.260> just<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:46.590> do<00:03:46.920> item<00:03:47.280> will<00:03:47.430> change<00:03:47.730> it

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
so it's just that do item will change it

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.060 
so it's just that do item will change it
but<00:03:48.030> but<00:03:48.810> in<00:03:48.960> that<00:03:49.110> opening<00:03:49.440> shot<00:03:49.710> you<00:03:49.890> can<00:03:50.010> see

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
but but in that opening shot you can see

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.670 
but but in that opening shot you can see
those<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:51.120> frame<00:03:51.360> rails<00:03:51.570> coming<00:03:52.020> way<00:03:52.350> up<00:03:52.380> here

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
those the frame rails coming way up here

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.120 
those the frame rails coming way up here
in<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:52.860> top<00:03:53.240> or<00:03:54.240> about<00:03:54.660> midway<00:03:55.080> and<00:03:55.590> the

firewall<00:03:56.550> and<00:03:56.940> I<00:03:57.660> don't<00:03:57.870> know<00:03:57.990> I<00:03:58.020> just<00:03:58.140> think

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
firewall and I don't know I just think

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.530 
firewall and I don't know I just think
it<00:03:58.560> looks<00:03:58.740> kind<00:03:58.980> of<00:03:59.010> dumb<00:03:59.190> that<00:03:59.430> way<00:03:59.610> I<00:03:59.910> think

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
it looks kind of dumb that way I think

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.040 
it looks kind of dumb that way I think
it<00:04:00.600> needs<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:00.870> come<00:04:01.080> down<00:04:01.110> and<00:04:01.800> I<00:04:02.810> get<00:04:03.810> up<00:04:03.900> on

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
it needs to come down and I get up on

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.430 
it needs to come down and I get up on
this<00:04:04.170> rail<00:04:04.440> here<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:06.510> now<00:04:06.870> when<00:04:07.170> i<00:04:07.200> get<00:04:07.410> done

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
this rail here and now when i get done

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.220 
this rail here and now when i get done
where<00:04:08.310> it'll<00:04:08.490> come<00:04:08.670> in<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:09.060> going<00:04:10.050> to<00:04:10.140> be

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
where it'll come in and going to be

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.230 
where it'll come in and going to be
right<00:04:10.500> under<00:04:10.860> this<00:04:11.040> likely<00:04:11.640> be<00:04:11.850> right<00:04:12.030> inside

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
right under this likely be right inside

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.210 
right under this likely be right inside
there<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:13.020> i<00:04:13.620> don't<00:04:13.770> know<00:04:13.860> if<00:04:13.920> you'll<00:04:14.040> sit

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
there and i don't know if you'll sit

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.910 
there and i don't know if you'll sit
down<00:04:14.460> here<00:04:14.940> or<00:04:15.750> if<00:04:16.170> it'll<00:04:16.350> sit<00:04:16.680> right<00:04:16.890> there

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
down here or if it'll sit right there

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.789 
down here or if it'll sit right there
probably<00:04:17.549> down<00:04:17.820> here<00:04:18.230> and<00:04:19.230> i'll<00:04:19.320> probably<00:04:19.530> put

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
probably down here and i'll probably put

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.890 
probably down here and i'll probably put
a<00:04:19.859> couple<00:04:20.070> of<00:04:20.220> skid<00:04:20.459> plates<00:04:20.760> under<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.720> bottom

a couple of skid plates under the bottom

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.760 
a couple of skid plates under the bottom

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
of that frame for dragon when it bottoms

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.310 
of that frame for dragon when it bottoms
out<00:04:26.300> how<00:04:27.300> pretty<00:04:27.600> sure<00:04:27.720> it's<00:04:27.840> got<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:28.050> bottom

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
out how pretty sure it's got to bottom

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.270 
out how pretty sure it's got to bottom
out<00:04:28.410> because<00:04:28.650> i'm<00:04:28.710> going<00:04:28.860> to<00:04:28.920> set<00:04:29.070> it<00:04:29.100> down

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
out because i'm going to set it down

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.150 
out because i'm going to set it down
fairly<00:04:29.670> low<00:04:30.060> but<00:04:31.050> anyway<00:04:31.350> that's<00:04:31.500> a<00:04:31.680> project

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
fairly low but anyway that's a project

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.920 
fairly low but anyway that's a project
i'm<00:04:32.610> going<00:04:32.820> to<00:04:32.880> move<00:04:33.000> this<00:04:33.150> down<00:04:33.390> this<00:04:33.690> frame

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
i'm going to move this down this frame

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.450 
i'm going to move this down this frame
rail<00:04:34.140> instead<00:04:34.320> of<00:04:34.470> coming<00:04:34.740> in<00:04:34.830> there<00:04:35.070> and<00:04:35.280> come

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
rail instead of coming in there and come

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.080 
rail instead of coming in there and come
in<00:04:35.840> way<00:04:36.840> down<00:04:37.050> here<00:04:37.380> at<00:04:37.980> least<00:04:38.220> a<00:04:38.310> foot<00:04:38.520> lower<00:04:38.760> i

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090
