00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.629 
and I'm living it and I think if a game
can<00:04:27.729> make<00:04:27.940> me<00:04:28.090> do<00:04:28.270> that<00:04:28.479> then<00:04:28.900> it's<00:04:29.639> definitely

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
can make me do that then it's definitely

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.830 
can make me do that then it's definitely
a<00:04:30.669> good<00:04:30.880> game<00:04:31.120> so<00:04:32.430> anyway<00:04:33.430> it<00:04:34.060> is<00:04:34.450> bittersweet

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
a good game so anyway it is bittersweet

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.779 
a good game so anyway it is bittersweet
that<00:04:35.320> it's<00:04:35.470> over<00:04:35.650> but<00:04:36.099> I<00:04:36.660> mean<00:04:38.160> look<00:04:39.160> I<00:04:39.490> guess

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
that it's over but I mean look I guess

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.839

look forward to more LPS in the future

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.730 
look forward to more LPS in the future
