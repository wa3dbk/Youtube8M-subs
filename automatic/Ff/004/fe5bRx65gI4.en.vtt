00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.009
 Epiphany frosts 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:18.150
 baptism was yesterday and here and frost was 32 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.510
 degrees at night but the dogs survived nothing 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.660
 ok funny are now -13 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.680
 see they value nothing easy 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.009
 behave plays but I really fed them 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.369
 good good so from the heart they were 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.369
 fed 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:47.059
 that is, for the day they ate 3 liters of porridge 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.809
 kilogram of meat 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:53.109
 well, everything may be big yet 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.109
 somewhere 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:01:03.289
 anywhere else anything yes it was well 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:08.049
 see that is minus 13 for them this 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:08.049
 generally beautiful weather 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:18.380
 Well, they learned to warm up and a lot 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:22.399
 the dog earlier they are sure to suck already 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:25.369
 big teeth and she doesn't like it here 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:30.140
 understand that you can warm up and not 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:33.100
 suck and of course it immediately im plus but 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.100
 and had to bite them 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:48.310
 let's see where they ran out from me 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.310
 live here without a leash 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:02:01.130
 but do not go far and where are you going 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:10.210
 here especially go anywhere he they field for 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:10.210
 There are no wolves in the forest 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:28.750
 the animal is one of the smallest 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.750
