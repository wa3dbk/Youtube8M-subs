00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 in this video tutorial we will reproduce 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.230
 again this is a spiral staircase 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.030
 time but using the macro command 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.170
 which has been included since the version 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.730
 2011 in autocad absolutely prepared 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.529
 from the lager where to insert the elements 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:23.039
 of the scale begin with the base 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:25.560
 two-dimensional circle command we put 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.320
 down the footprint of the center scale of 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.840
 rocket and while we're at it too 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.820
 central pole with a radius of ten 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.180
 we insert the line for our first 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.540
 step in this way and exploiting the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.789
 command polar series select the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.820
 line just created the center of the 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.620
 watch our series now that autocad e 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.860
 offers us a control bar 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.570
 of the polar series so we turn the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.719
 let's put in here in the number 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.910
 of the elements 16 in my case and me 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.670
 I make sure that the is not associative 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.920
 speech that you did not press this 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.470
 ok button was on I position myself in the 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.409
 conceptual mode because now we go 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.409
 to exclude our first step e 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.759
 we also move to the south east view 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.970
 in this way 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.369
 let's get into the solid menu and get up with 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.659
 press and drag and in our first 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.549
 step that this is the height of 19 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.579
 centimeters 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:37.350
 this step we bring for convenience 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:41.670
 on the layer roads here is done and 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.430
 we are now beginning to register ours 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.860
 macro that will allow us to automate 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.360
 the construction of the staircase we carry 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.390
 in the menu manage here we find you see the 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.320
 where to start recording the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.180
 macro then click on the button 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.430
 record now everything we will do 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.729
 will be recorded by autocar 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.600
 but before starting this operation 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.479
 we move lights s 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.280
 this is at the center of our scale 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.180
 because then all the references of the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.019
 commands is the macro will do 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.120
 reference to this cs here we are 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:22.030
 let's start with the registration by pressing 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.629
 this button records observe that in 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:29.109
 cursor now appears a red dot 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:31.750
 let's get to the start menu and copy 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:35.200
 this skirt with the copy command 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.370
 in this way when selecting 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.920
 the elements are important instead 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.859
 digital dashboard command 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.129
 low l which stands for the last as the last 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:49.659
 item so let's send you see you are 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.209
 selected our last item 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:54.819
 what we have created ours 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.720
 step after that we give again 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.060
 sending 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.629
 select the shift option e 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.340
 we give as an indication to the tgr that is the 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:06.040
 button to the right of the bar 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.310
 spacer snapping this way 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.060
 we indicate that it must remain firm in the 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.790
 coordinate hicks then zero comma 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:20.169
 still stationary in the zero coordinate 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:23.709
 comma should instead move along 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:29.790
 the z- axis of 19 centimeters 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:33.340
 here it is not over wheel command 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.199
 always underscore l 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.069
 in this way we indicate again 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:42.669
 the last gesture we created 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:47.290
 I still send this request 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:48.009
 we answer with the coordinates 0,0 e 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.500
 we send 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:55.439
 after which we type the angle of 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:58.959
 rotation that in my case is 20 25 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:04:02.560
 22.5 on the way here is made of her 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:07.299
 return to the manage menu and to 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:10.810
 close our macro we must give 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:15.040
 let's call our macro a name as well 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.500
 helical scale and we give ok 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.669
 in this way we recorded the 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:24.250
 let's see our macro now if it works 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:26.560
 there were caliamo a little then enough 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:31.380
 simply now begin 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:39.130
 click the play venete button 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:43.210
 begins to build the steps of the 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:45.669
 scale ok 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.770
 I would say that this is enough to start 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.630
 now build the elements 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.330
 two-dimensional that will be extruded 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.699
 along the helicoidal trajectory ie from 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.720
 protection and the railing first 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:01.949
 we carry colucci s on the face of 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.949
 this step then
