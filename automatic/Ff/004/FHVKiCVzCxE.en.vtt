crappy<00:00:50.850> servers<00:00:51.350> anyway<00:00:52.350> after<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:53.100> game

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280

crappy servers anyway after that game
were<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.610> go<00:00:53.699> by<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.000> Martin<00:00:54.329> y'all<00:00:54.629> not

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
were to go by and Martin y'all not

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.510 
were to go by and Martin y'all not
specifically<00:00:55.500> him<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.010> minder<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.430> was

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
specifically him just a minder that was

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.970 
specifically him just a minder that was
in<00:00:56.610> for<00:00:56.850> far<00:00:57.059> too<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:58.199> 200<00:00:58.559> kind<00:00:58.770> was

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
in for far too and the 200 kind was

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.319 
in for far too and the 200 kind was
pretty<00:00:59.190> chuffed<00:00:59.550> without<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.030> be<00:01:00.120> honest

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
pretty chuffed without to be honest

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.229 
pretty chuffed without to be honest
because<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.809> think<00:01:01.680> managed<00:01:02.579> enough<00:01:02.820> formation

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
because I think managed enough formation

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.329 
because I think managed enough formation
tend<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.510> cost<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.750> fair<00:01:03.899> bit<00:01:04.049> more<00:01:04.320> afar<00:01:05.159> bit

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.730 
tend to cost a fair bit more afar bit
more<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.640> fair<00:01:05.850> bit<00:01:06.030> more<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.450> after<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.470> was

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
more a fair bit more and after this was

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.289 
more a fair bit more and after this was
joined<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> another<00:01:08.220> game<00:01:08.580> when<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.760> got<00:01:09.000> 100

disconnect<00:01:18.240> now<00:01:18.540> I'm<00:01:19.409> assuming<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:19.950> one's<00:01:20.130> a

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
disconnect now I'm assuming this one's a

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.440 
disconnect now I'm assuming this one's a
disconnect<00:01:20.640> because<00:01:20.790> there<00:01:20.970> was<00:01:21.060> no<00:01:21.180> reason
