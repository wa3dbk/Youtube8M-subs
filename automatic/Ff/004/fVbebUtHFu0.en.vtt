90 and I'm using rapid fire and XM x the
reason<00:00:18.449> for<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.990> because<00:00:19.050> unlocker<00:00:20.630> kind

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
reason for this is because unlocker kind

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.779 
reason for this is because unlocker kind
of<00:00:21.779> larger<00:00:22.199> Maps<00:00:22.410> like<00:00:22.619> not<00:00:22.890> super<00:00:23.310> small<00:00:23.550> but

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
of larger Maps like not super small but

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.880 
of larger Maps like not super small but
like<00:00:23.910> medium<00:00:24.330> sized<00:00:24.570> maps<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.230> don't<00:00:25.769> really

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
like medium sized maps I don't really

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.009 
like medium sized maps I don't really
like<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.250> usually<00:00:26.849> use<00:00:27.180> sounds<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.689> rapid

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
like to usually use sounds and rapid

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.080 
like to usually use sounds and rapid
fire<00:00:28.199> ball<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.470> these<00:00:28.619> maps<00:00:28.890> sound<00:00:29.820> some

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
fire ball in these maps sound some

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.389 
fire ball in these maps sound some
ratify<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.660> recoil<00:00:31.170> just<00:00:31.470> like<00:00:31.619> recoils<00:00:32.099> up

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
ratify the recoil just like recoils up

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.370 
ratify the recoil just like recoils up
too<00:00:32.610> much<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.600> kind<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.809> hard<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.110> handle

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380
