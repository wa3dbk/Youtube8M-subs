00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.040
 Hi everyone, then we 'll do it 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.919
 see how to build a kind of 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.580
 rifle with materials that surely 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.880
 I ask you to scotch a house 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.340
 very sharp scissors a stapler 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.609
 it is a point of kitchen just kitchen must 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.960
 be elastically literacy that because 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.269
 then I'll show you what it is for 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.390
 in short, if it is not classic, it is useful 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.390
 anything 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.380
 Let's start to see contains works 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.360
 then 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.060
 take the tube 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.160
 a tube after being made of 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.450
 toilet paper or if it is better 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.670
 find tinfoil tube because 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.750
 the one made of tin foil is harder and it is 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.090
 even more resistant this here and I already have 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.770
 created a kind of gun and this 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.780
 so it is already where they are already read 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.879
 created and I will show you this here 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.790
 how it works because precisely that 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.780
 dry paper the castagnola tube 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.780
 it comes much better 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:15.420
 take the tube that you are the scott 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.420
 we fight hicks then we cut it 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:27.300
 I have cut unitary ie facility of 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:36.020
 delay like us that where you have some 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:40.950
 more time you put a little smaller ok 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:43.830
 with the stapler we take and it 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:50.310
 let's explain so that it remains small and 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:52.770
 on the other side, here's how it should be 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.910
 be but must come on hbo then 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:01.340
 we take the finger and we have to put it 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.340
 we have to put on the ends of the tube 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.550
 with a moment I have the title already 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.750
 cut that the glove however is not much 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.280
 easy to cut them 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.600
 at least this was not the case 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.440
 very easy because it was a people but 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.440
 I can put it 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:34.150
 ok 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.540
 here it is, ok, now you have to take it 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.580
 Scotch tape 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.220
 I scotch with the cut in this way 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:45.640
 at least don't waste your time looking 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:50.230
 this video and so it should be put so that 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.000
 holds the finger of the glove attached to the 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.239
 tube disc tube because otherwise 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.440
 when we're going to pull the finger 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:01.680
 I will leave and it will not happen shortly here it is 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.680
 here 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.380
 this is how it should come then 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.600
 a pen can take a maturity 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:16.100
 a rubber this nocerino anything 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.860
 and we have to launch it ok I will do it 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.530
 see with this one because I have it 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.910
 better achieved and even Scotch is a 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.920
 a little more resistant because I don't have it 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:31.330
 put very well ok guys now I will make you 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.330
 see where it will end up 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:50.050
 but you 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:50.050
 surprising to see at a distance with you ok 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.370
 to shoot to give here is life here is 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.480
 a species is fine a pen must 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.659
 stay this until it goes to 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.659
 to end 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:16.380
 I don't know if he saw the flight he did 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.539
 however he took the wall and it is even 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.329
 turned back because he was not 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:23.400
 power now I'll show you another 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.070
 time and I was not to hit a wait 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.060
 long but I'll show you how much 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.669
 team showed for power 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:41.419
 why show matri bazaar 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:43.800
 we will see how much boys do now 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:47.580
 cut by two term children since 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.169
 also fantato calculated that also taken 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.020
 the door and then bounced but why 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:56.900
 not being able to pull faster but here 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.900
 it's all 28 from 98
