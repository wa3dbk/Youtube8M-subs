00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.700 
the 925 as you can see right here it's I
think<00:04:45.070> that's<00:04:45.430> about<00:04:46.020> 11<00:04:47.020> millimeters<00:04:47.470> on<00:04:47.620> the

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
think that's about 11 millimeters on the

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.200 
think that's about 11 millimeters on the
920<00:04:48.960> has<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.949> 920<00:04:51.340> has<00:04:51.490> the<00:04:51.669> integrated

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
920 has the 920 has the integrated

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.540 
920 has the 920 has the integrated
charging<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:52.930> wireless<00:04:53.199> charging<00:04:53.530> stuff<00:04:53.860> so

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
charging the wireless charging stuff so

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.200 
charging the wireless charging stuff so
that's<00:04:54.729> why<00:04:54.880> it's<00:04:54.910> a<00:04:55.120> bit<00:04:55.270> thicker<00:04:55.510> as<00:04:56.199> the<00:04:57.210> 925

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
that's why it's a bit thicker as the 925

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.939 
that's why it's a bit thicker as the 925
doesn't<00:04:58.660> have<00:04:58.780> that<00:04:58.900> integrated<00:04:59.440> they<00:04:59.770> can

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
doesn't have that integrated they can

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.450 
doesn't have that integrated they can
build<00:05:00.130> it<00:05:00.220> a<00:05:00.430> bit<00:05:00.639> thinner<00:05:01.560> spec-wise<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:03.250> two

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
build it a bit thinner spec-wise the two

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.930 
build it a bit thinner spec-wise the two
devices<00:05:03.760> are<00:05:04.180> pretty<00:05:04.600> much<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:04.810> same<00:05:04.990> so<00:05:05.740> the

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
devices are pretty much the same so the

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.260 
devices are pretty much the same so the
925<00:05:06.940> has<00:05:07.449> just<00:05:08.410> as<00:05:08.590> the<00:05:09.039> 920<00:05:09.580> a<00:05:09.610> dual-core

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
925 has just as the 920 a dual-core

another<00:05:29.800> major<00:05:30.099> difference<00:05:30.250> the<00:05:30.820> 920<00:05:31.270> hands

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
another major difference the 920 hands

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.029 
another major difference the 920 hands
on<00:05:31.630> LCD<00:05:32.050> screen<00:05:32.880> whereas<00:05:33.880> the<00:05:34.410> 925<00:05:35.410> actually

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 
on LCD screen whereas the 925 actually

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:37.890 
on LCD screen whereas the 925 actually
has<00:05:36.220> an<00:05:36.430> AMOLED<00:05:37.000> display<00:05:37.389> or<00:05:37.539> an<00:05:37.630> all<00:05:37.780> at

has an AMOLED display or an all at

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.830 
has an AMOLED display or an all at
display<00:05:38.289> which<00:05:39.070> makes<00:05:39.310> it<00:05:39.400> possible<00:05:39.639> to<00:05:40.210> have

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
display which makes it possible to have

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.710 
display which makes it possible to have
the<00:05:41.680> special<00:05:42.099> feature<00:05:42.310> with<00:05:42.880> which<00:05:43.240> they<00:05:43.479> had

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
the special feature with which they had

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.490 
the special feature with which they had
on<00:05:43.990> the<00:05:44.260> nokia<00:05:44.919> 808<00:05:45.910> for<00:05:46.330> example<00:05:46.780> where<00:05:47.410> you

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
on the nokia 808 for example where you

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.480 
on the nokia 808 for example where you
can<00:05:47.680> show<00:05:47.950> a<00:05:48.280> clock<00:05:49.150> on<00:05:49.389> the<00:05:49.570> screen<00:05:50.340> wilds<00:05:51.340> and

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
can show a clock on the screen wilds and

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.260 
can show a clock on the screen wilds and
standby<00:05:52.139> because<00:05:53.139> only<00:05:54.070> the<00:05:54.310> pieces<00:05:54.760> where

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
standby because only the pieces where

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.070 
standby because only the pieces where
the<00:05:55.389> clock<00:05:55.660> is<00:05:55.840> that<00:05:56.020> are<00:05:56.260> actually<00:05:57.070> lit<00:05:57.520> and

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
the clock is that are actually lit and

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.990 
the clock is that are actually lit and
that<00:05:59.080> cannot<00:05:59.740> really<00:06:00.010> work<00:06:00.250> or<00:06:00.580> I<00:06:00.610> think<00:06:00.729> it

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
that cannot really work or I think it

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.640 
that cannot really work or I think it
could<00:06:01.180> do<00:06:01.360> that<00:06:01.539> on<00:06:01.660> the<00:06:01.750> 920<00:06:02.229> by<00:06:02.349> that<00:06:02.500> would

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
could do that on the 920 by that would

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.890 
could do that on the 920 by that would
take<00:06:02.889> use<00:06:03.190> much<00:06:03.490> more<00:06:03.699> power<00:06:03.910> because<00:06:04.240> you'd

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
take use much more power because you'd

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.650 
take use much more power because you'd
have<00:06:05.139> to<00:06:05.380> use<00:06:05.770> the<00:06:06.340> whole<00:06:06.550> screen<00:06:06.820> backlit<00:06:07.449> and

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
have to use the whole screen backlit and

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.260 
have to use the whole screen backlit and
that<00:06:08.349> draws<00:06:08.560> a<00:06:08.620> lot<00:06:08.919> more<00:06:09.190> power<00:06:09.430> than<00:06:09.849> on<00:06:10.210> the

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
that draws a lot more power than on the

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.379 
that draws a lot more power than on the
925<00:06:11.199> or<00:06:11.470> only<00:06:11.620> the<00:06:11.919> pixels<00:06:12.729> of<00:06:12.849> the<00:06:12.880> clock<00:06:13.180> are

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:13.389 
925 or only the pixels of the clock are

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.710 
925 or only the pixels of the clock are
actually<00:06:13.720> lumen<00:06:14.320> ated<00:06:15.510> another<00:06:16.510> major

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
actually lumen ated another major

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.920 
actually lumen ated another major
difference<00:06:16.900> is<00:06:17.410> that<00:06:17.770> the<00:06:18.340> 920<00:06:18.820> actually<00:06:19.300> has

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
difference is that the 920 actually has

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.140 
difference is that the 920 actually has
a<00:06:19.960> polycarbonate<00:06:20.949> shell<00:06:21.280> there's<00:06:22.030> probably

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
a polycarbonate shell there's probably

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.779 
a polycarbonate shell there's probably
carbonate<00:06:22.720> on<00:06:22.870> the<00:06:22.960> 925<00:06:23.560> too<00:06:23.889> but<00:06:24.130> that's<00:06:24.520> only

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:24.789 
carbonate on the 925 too but that's only

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:27.810 
carbonate on the 925 too but that's only
on<00:06:24.910> the<00:06:25.120> back<00:06:25.300> because<00:06:26.260> the<00:06:26.560> 925<00:06:27.130> actually<00:06:27.580> has

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820 
on the back because the 925 actually has

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.540 
on the back because the 925 actually has
an<00:06:28.030> aluminum<00:06:28.330> frame<00:06:28.720> that<00:06:29.530> also<00:06:30.010> doubles<00:06:30.220> as

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
an aluminum frame that also doubles as

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.830 
an aluminum frame that also doubles as
the<00:06:30.909> antenna<00:06:32.370> which<00:06:33.370> makes<00:06:33.610> it<00:06:33.789> lighter<00:06:34.210> a<00:06:34.510> lot

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
the antenna which makes it lighter a lot

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.719 
the antenna which makes it lighter a lot
lighter

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729 
lighter

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:39.499 
lighter
since<00:06:36.150> the<00:06:36.809> 920<00:06:37.349> is<00:06:37.499> actually<00:06:37.919> 185<00:06:38.879> grams<00:06:39.210> are

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:39.509 
since the 920 is actually 185 grams are

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:44.959 
since the 920 is actually 185 grams are
in<00:06:39.539> 182<00:06:40.289> grams<00:06:40.740> whereas<00:06:41.729> the<00:06:42.599> 925<00:06:43.559> is<00:06:43.889> only<00:06:44.099> 139

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:44.969 
in 182 grams whereas the 925 is only 139

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:48.079 
in 182 grams whereas the 925 is only 139
grams<00:06:45.330> you<00:06:46.229> can<00:06:46.439> really<00:06:46.589> tell<00:06:46.949> that<00:06:47.089> because

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:48.089 
grams you can really tell that because

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:51.140 
grams you can really tell that because
it<00:06:48.449> just<00:06:48.779> the<00:06:49.379> 920<00:06:50.129> is<00:06:50.249> actually<00:06:50.639> quite<00:06:51.059> a

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
it just the 920 is actually quite a

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.170 
it just the 920 is actually quite a
break<00:06:51.589> at<00:06:52.589> least<00:06:52.830> that's<00:06:53.370> the<00:06:53.460> way<00:06:53.520> I<00:06:53.610> feel<00:06:53.969> and

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 
break at least that's the way I feel and

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.769 
break at least that's the way I feel and
the<00:06:54.900> 925<00:06:55.469> is<00:06:55.710> much<00:06:55.919> more<00:06:56.189> sinner<00:06:57.059> feels

00:06:57.769 --> 00:06:57.779 
the 925 is much more sinner feels

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:01.489 
the 925 is much more sinner feels
lighter<00:06:58.499> and<00:06:58.830> is<00:06:59.039> lighter<00:06:59.370> and<00:07:00.229> it's<00:07:01.229> kind<00:07:01.439> of

00:07:01.489 --> 00:07:01.499 
lighter and is lighter and it's kind of

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:03.439 
lighter and is lighter and it's kind of
I<00:07:01.740> like<00:07:02.159> it<00:07:02.309> better<00:07:02.490> because<00:07:02.699> it<00:07:02.939> hasn't<00:07:03.180> much

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:03.449 
I like it better because it hasn't much
