openers<00:00:12.389> are<00:00:12.509> very<00:00:12.750> interesting<00:00:13.440> they<00:00:13.710> seem

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
openers are very interesting they seem

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.950 
openers are very interesting they seem
like<00:00:14.759> something<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.240> could<00:00:15.389> do<00:00:15.540> as<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.750> one-man

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
like something you could do as a one-man

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.870 
like something you could do as a one-man
project<00:00:16.619> but<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:16.980> does<00:00:17.160> produce<00:00:17.550> some

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
project but it does produce some

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.300 
project but it does produce some
difficulties<00:00:18.840> in<00:00:19.080> terms<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.770> getting<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.189> up

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
difficulties in terms of getting it up

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.340 
difficulties in terms of getting it up
and<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:21.090> terms<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.390> getting<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.720> all<00:00:21.840> set<00:00:21.869> up<00:00:22.109> by

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
and in terms of getting it all set up by

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.800 
and in terms of getting it all set up by
yourself<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:23.699> really<00:00:23.760> would<00:00:24.150> be<00:00:24.180> ideal<00:00:24.570> as<00:00:24.779> a

two-man job and for a lot of homeowners
I<00:00:27.180> think<00:00:27.359> it's<00:00:27.480> something<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.840> might<00:00:27.990> want<00:00:28.199> to

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
I think it's something you might want to

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.349 
I think it's something you might want to
consider<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.740> professional<00:00:29.400> installer<00:00:29.789> for<00:00:30.090> I

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
consider a professional installer for I

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.020 
consider a professional installer for I
was<00:00:30.929> able<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.170> get<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.470> installed

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 
was able to get it installed

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.889 
was able to get it installed
everything's<00:00:33.030> working<00:00:33.390> functioning

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
everything's working functioning

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.810 
everything's working functioning
properly<00:00:34.130> but<00:00:35.130> there<00:00:35.340> were<00:00:35.399> some<00:00:35.520> tricky

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
properly but there were some tricky

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.970 
properly but there were some tricky
parts<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.870> biggest<00:00:37.320> tricky<00:00:37.590> part<00:00:37.829> was

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
parts the biggest tricky part was

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.310 
parts the biggest tricky part was
obviously<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:39.239> fact<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.930> belt

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
obviously the fact that the belt

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.990 
obviously the fact that the belt
connector<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.129> there<00:00:41.250> have<00:00:41.430> another<00:00:41.670> video

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
connector and there have another video

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.420 
connector and there have another video
on<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.239> already<00:00:42.480> had<00:00:43.469> been<00:00:43.649> wedged<00:00:43.920> all<00:00:44.190> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
on this already had been wedged all the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.340 
on this already had been wedged all the
way<00:00:44.550> back<00:00:44.760> up<00:00:45.000> into<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.360> sprocket<00:00:45.870> that's<00:00:46.140> now

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
way back up into the sprocket that's now

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.979 
way back up into the sprocket that's now
above<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.980> garage<00:00:47.160> door<00:00:47.460> body<00:00:47.760> when<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.539> was<00:00:48.809> up

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
above the garage door body when I was up

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.810 
above the garage door body when I was up
when<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.260> arrived<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.920> think<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.700> was<00:00:50.789> a

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
when it arrived I think that was a

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.240 
when it arrived I think that was a
manufacturing<00:00:51.539> defect<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.469> don't<00:00:52.949> think<00:00:53.129> it

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
manufacturing defect I don't think it

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.979 
manufacturing defect I don't think it
could<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.520> slid<00:00:53.820> all<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:53.969> way<00:00:54.149> up<00:00:54.300> up<00:00:54.480> there

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
could have slid all the way up up there

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.410 
could have slid all the way up up there
onto<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.350> sprocket<00:00:55.829> by<00:00:55.949> itself<00:00:56.280> but<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.329> is

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
onto the sprocket by itself but it is

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.700 
onto the sprocket by itself but it is
the<00:00:57.539> type<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.780> thing<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.079> professional<00:00:58.199> Garage

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the type of thing a professional Garage

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.470 
the type of thing a professional Garage
Door<00:00:59.100> installing<00:00:59.670> might<00:00:59.850> have<00:01:00.030> noticed

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
Door installing might have noticed

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.900 
Door installing might have noticed
before<00:01:00.809> they<00:01:00.960> put<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.199> up<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.590> my<00:01:01.710> case<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.250> put

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
before they put it up in my case I put

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.270 
before they put it up in my case I put
it<00:01:03.030> up<00:01:03.149> tried<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.600> out<00:01:03.830> tried<00:01:04.830> moving<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
it up tried it out tried moving the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.070 
it up tried it out tried moving the
garage<00:01:05.460> door<00:01:05.729> back<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.119> forth<00:01:06.299> manually<00:01:06.900> with

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
garage door back and forth manually with

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.990 
garage door back and forth manually with
the<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.470> power<00:01:07.650> buttons<00:01:08.070> on<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.280> back<00:01:08.490> and

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
the the power buttons on the back and

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.670 
the the power buttons on the back and
that's<00:01:09.810> when<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:09.990> discovered<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
that's when I discovered that the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.260 
that's when I discovered that the
connector<00:01:11.310> had<00:01:11.460> been<00:01:11.580> wedged<00:01:11.760> up<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.090> there

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
connector had been wedged up in there

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.550 
connector had been wedged up in there
and<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.450> managed<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.840> actually<00:01:12.990> wedge<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
and I managed to actually wedge the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.090 
and I managed to actually wedge the
connector<00:01:13.920> even<00:01:14.760> further<00:01:15.000> back<00:01:15.360> up<00:01:15.659> into<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
connector even further back up into the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.100 
connector even further back up into the
body<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.850> sprocket<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.720> caused<00:01:18.930> a

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
body of the sprocket and that caused a

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.990 
body of the sprocket and that caused a
little<00:01:19.200> damage<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.799> sprocket<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> end

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
little damage to the sprocket in the end

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.490 
little damage to the sprocket in the end
it<00:01:21.090> functioned<00:01:21.540> okay<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.049> didn't<00:01:22.320> break

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
it functioned okay it didn't break

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.679 
it functioned okay it didn't break
anything<00:01:22.850> but<00:01:23.850> it's<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.540> know<00:01:24.600> it's

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
anything but it's you know it's

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.630 
anything but it's you know it's
something<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.049> look<00:01:25.229> out<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.979> again<00:01:26.460> it's

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
something to look out for and again it's

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.980 
something to look out for and again it's
a<00:01:26.700> pretty<00:01:26.909> good<00:01:27.060> argument<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.450> why<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:27.900> have

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
a pretty good argument for why we have

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.950 
a pretty good argument for why we have
professional<00:01:28.170> garage<00:01:28.680> door<00:01:28.979> installers<00:01:29.960> but

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
green side the red side is the receive

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.270 
green side the red side is the receive
the<00:02:18.330> receiver<00:02:18.810> I'm<00:02:18.930> actually<00:02:19.140> not<00:02:19.410> sure<00:02:19.470> one

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
the receiver I'm actually not sure one

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.950 
the receiver I'm actually not sure one
is<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.520> receiver<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.060> one<00:02:21.240> is<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> sender<00:02:21.810> I

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
is the receiver and one is the sender I

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.900 
is the receiver and one is the sender I
think<00:02:22.710> that<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.280> receiver<00:02:23.520> but<00:02:23.790> I'm

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
think that this is the receiver but I'm

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.430 
think that this is the receiver but I'm
not<00:02:24.000> positive<00:02:24.240> on<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:24.930> don't<00:02:25.080> quote<00:02:25.260> me

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
not positive on that so don't quote me

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.360 
not positive on that so don't quote me
and<00:02:25.860> here<00:02:26.820> as<00:02:26.940> well<00:02:27.140> is<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:29.010> out<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.280> our

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.300 
far to open basically you know where you
want<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.320> stop<00:03:16.560> at<00:03:16.770> the<00:03:16.860> top<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.250> the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
want it to stop at the top and the

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.540 
want it to stop at the top and the
bottom<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:18.290> tell<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.470> how<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.010> connect<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.459> the

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
bottom and tell it how to connect to the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.970 
bottom and tell it how to connect to the
remotes<00:03:20.850> that's<00:03:21.420> about<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:21.980> everything

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
remotes that's about it everything

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.080 
remotes that's about it everything
worked<00:03:23.250> out<00:03:23.400> pretty<00:03:23.580> good

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
worked out pretty good

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.120 
worked out pretty good
in<00:03:24.239> terms<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.720> setup<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:25.290> did<00:03:25.800> have<00:03:25.980> some

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
in terms of the setup I did have some

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.610 
in terms of the setup I did have some
trickiness<00:03:26.459> with<00:03:26.790> this<00:03:26.970> J<00:03:27.480> bar<00:03:27.750> I<00:03:28.020> initially

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
trickiness with this J bar I initially

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.290 
trickiness with this J bar I initially
said<00:03:28.800> it<00:03:28.950> I<00:03:29.010> think<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.340> little<00:03:29.640> bit<00:03:29.760> too<00:03:29.970> far

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
said it I think a little bit too far

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.860 
said it I think a little bit too far
forward<00:03:30.810> in<00:03:31.320> other<00:03:31.709> words<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:32.190> had<00:03:32.520> the<00:03:32.870> slider

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
forward in other words I had the slider

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.380 
forward in other words I had the slider
here<00:03:34.200> all<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:35.040> way<00:03:35.160> up<00:03:35.190> toward<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.790> front<00:03:35.880> of

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
here all the way up toward the front of

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.600 
here all the way up toward the front of
the<00:03:36.570> unit<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:36.989> when<00:03:37.320> it<00:03:37.440> closed<00:03:37.860> completely

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
the unit and when it closed completely

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.990 
the unit and when it closed completely
it<00:03:39.060> started<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.690> detect<00:03:40.110> that<00:03:40.260> it<00:03:40.380> was

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
it started to detect that it was

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.979 
it started to detect that it was
producing<00:03:42.000> too<00:03:42.120> much<00:03:42.150> pressure<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.840> the

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
producing too much pressure to the

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.300 
producing too much pressure to the
little<00:03:43.170> pressure<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:43.620> throwing<00:03:43.860> up<00:03:43.950> a<00:03:44.070> code

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
little pressure and throwing up a code

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.930 
little pressure and throwing up a code
28<00:03:44.880> so<00:03:45.570> I<00:03:45.600> had<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:46.050> actually<00:03:46.580> when<00:03:47.580> I<00:03:47.610> had<00:03:47.820> this

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
28 so I had to actually when I had this

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.130 
28 so I had to actually when I had this
all<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.209> way<00:03:48.270> in<00:03:48.330> the<00:03:48.390> front<00:03:48.510> position<00:03:48.959> I<00:03:49.020> had

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
all the way in the front position I had

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
all the way in the front position I had
to<00:03:49.200> move<00:03:49.380> this<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.560> little<00:03:49.709> bit<00:03:49.890> farther

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
to move this a little bit farther

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.070 
to move this a little bit farther
forward<00:03:50.489> so<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:50.940> this<00:03:51.120> button<00:03:51.450> was<00:03:51.690> hanging

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
forward so that this button was hanging

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.720 
forward so that this button was hanging
it<00:03:52.170> more<00:03:52.380> of<00:03:52.500> an<00:03:52.620> ink<00:03:52.890> over<00:03:53.010> this<00:03:53.250> up<00:03:53.459> sorry<00:03:53.640> the

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
it more of an ink over this up sorry the

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.600 
it more of an ink over this up sorry the
J<00:03:53.880> bar<00:03:54.060> was<00:03:54.209> hanging<00:03:54.450> it<00:03:54.510> more<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.870> an<00:03:54.989> angle<00:03:55.200> I

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
J bar was hanging it more of an angle I

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.320 
J bar was hanging it more of an angle I
don't<00:03:56.610> know<00:03:56.700> if<00:03:56.760> that's<00:03:56.910> something<00:03:57.090> you'll

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
don't know if that's something you'll

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.400 
don't know if that's something you'll
run<00:03:57.480> into<00:03:57.600> or<00:03:57.870> if<00:03:57.930> that<00:03:58.050> was<00:03:58.140> just<00:03:58.200> a

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
run into or if that was just a

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.680 
run into or if that was just a
particular<00:03:58.920> trick<00:03:59.160> of<00:03:59.370> how<00:03:59.880> I<00:03:59.910> installed<00:04:00.540> it

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
particular trick of how I installed it

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.470 
particular trick of how I installed it
the<00:04:00.900> angle<00:04:01.670> whatever<00:04:02.670> it<00:04:02.790> is<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:03.030> old<00:04:03.180> garage

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
the angle whatever it is the old garage

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.090 
the angle whatever it is the old garage
door<00:04:03.870> which<00:04:04.080> is<00:04:04.350> quite<00:04:04.680> old<00:04:04.800> you've<00:04:04.980> probably

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
door which is quite old you've probably

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.440 
door which is quite old you've probably
heard<00:04:05.280> it<00:04:05.400> creaking<00:04:05.760> a<00:04:05.880> good<00:04:06.060> bit<00:04:06.209> there

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
heard it creaking a good bit there

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.150 
heard it creaking a good bit there
that's<00:04:06.660> just<00:04:06.900> mechanical<00:04:07.590> creaking<00:04:07.770> from<00:04:08.010> the

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
that's just mechanical creaking from the

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.640 
that's just mechanical creaking from the
garage<00:04:08.400> door<00:04:08.790> it's<00:04:09.300> a<00:04:09.450> something<00:04:10.350> I<00:04:10.530> was

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
garage door it's a something I was

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.440 
garage door it's a something I was
hoping<00:04:10.829> because<00:04:11.070> this<00:04:11.250> is<00:04:11.400> such<00:04:11.670> a<00:04:11.700> quiet<00:04:11.970> unit

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
hoping because this is such a quiet unit

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.060 
hoping because this is such a quiet unit
that<00:04:12.930> I'd<00:04:13.079> get<00:04:13.260> into<00:04:13.380> some<00:04:13.500> improvement<00:04:13.980> in

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
that I'd get into some improvement in

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.680 
that I'd get into some improvement in
terms<00:04:14.220> of<00:04:14.400> sound<00:04:14.730> but

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
terms of sound but

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.120 
terms of sound but
unfortunately<00:04:16.230> a<00:04:16.260> lot<00:04:16.530> of<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:16.739> noise<00:04:16.920> is

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
unfortunately a lot of that noise is

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.160 
unfortunately a lot of that noise is
just<00:04:17.280> coming<00:04:17.549> from<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:17.820> mechanical<00:04:18.180> we<00:04:18.959> all

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
just coming from the mechanical we all

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.140 
just coming from the mechanical we all
send<00:04:19.560> spring<00:04:20.100> from<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.400> garage<00:04:20.549> door<00:04:20.940> so<00:04:21.120> I

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
send spring from the garage door so I

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.510 
send spring from the garage door so I
can<00:04:21.420> look<00:04:21.540> at<00:04:21.690> those<00:04:21.870> as<00:04:22.049> well<00:04:22.230> but<00:04:22.950> this<00:04:23.160> unit

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
can look at those as well but this unit

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.160 
can look at those as well but this unit
itself<00:04:23.820> in<00:04:24.030> terms<00:04:24.150> of<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.390> engine<00:04:24.780> terms<00:04:25.020> the

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
itself in terms of the engine terms the

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.800 
itself in terms of the engine terms the
power<00:04:25.350> and<00:04:26.310> very<00:04:26.670> very<00:04:26.910> quiet<00:04:27.240> and<00:04:27.600> really

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
power and very very quiet and really

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.740 
power and very very quiet and really
nice<00:04:28.140> so<00:04:28.680> overall<00:04:29.330> you<00:04:30.330> know<00:04:30.420> I've<00:04:30.510> tried<00:04:30.690> to

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
nice so overall you know I've tried to

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.470 
nice so overall you know I've tried to
get<00:04:31.320> past<00:04:31.590> my<00:04:31.920> problems<00:04:32.730> with<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.000> connector

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
get past my problems with the connector

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.720 
get past my problems with the connector
they<00:04:34.410> did<00:04:34.560> give<00:04:34.710> me<00:04:34.830> a<00:04:34.890> you<00:04:35.340> know<00:04:35.430> quite<00:04:35.610> a<00:04:35.640> bit

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
they did give me a you know quite a bit

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.460 
they did give me a you know quite a bit
of<00:04:35.910> pain<00:04:36.090> I<00:04:36.150> had<00:04:36.420> to<00:04:36.480> take<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.810> entire<00:04:37.080> unit

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
of pain I had to take the entire unit

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.680 
of pain I had to take the entire unit
down<00:04:37.680> other<00:04:38.490> than<00:04:38.610> that<00:04:38.880> I'd<00:04:39.060> really<00:04:39.270> like<00:04:39.540> the

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
down other than that I'd really like the

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.200 
down other than that I'd really like the
unit<00:04:40.050> up<00:04:40.230> so<00:04:40.560> if<00:04:40.860> you<00:04:40.980> do<00:04:41.130> buy<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.310> unit<00:04:41.670> really

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
unit up so if you do buy the unit really

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.460 
unit up so if you do buy the unit really
just<00:04:42.390> watch<00:04:42.540> out<00:04:42.750> for<00:04:42.780> that<00:04:42.930> you<00:04:43.050> see<00:04:43.320> that

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
just watch out for that you see that

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.890 
just watch out for that you see that
white<00:04:43.650> connector<00:04:44.100> right<00:04:44.520> up<00:04:44.670> back<00:04:44.820> there<00:04:45.120> make

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
white connector right up back there make

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
instructions so it's not something you

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.910 
instructions so it's not something you
can<00:05:15.360> pin<00:05:15.600> on<00:05:15.780> on<00:05:16.170> being<00:05:16.500> able<00:05:16.590> to<00:05:16.680> read<00:05:16.830> an

can pin on on being able to read an
instruction<00:05:17.010> to<00:05:17.460> avoid<00:05:17.730> but<00:05:18.540> I<00:05:18.930> think<00:05:19.560> if<00:05:19.680> you

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
instruction to avoid but I think if you

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.060 
instruction to avoid but I think if you
if<00:05:20.750> you're<00:05:21.750> looking<00:05:22.020> for<00:05:22.200> a<00:05:22.230> good<00:05:22.350> garage<00:05:22.830> door
