very compact you can see the laser
pointer<00:06:52.140> and<00:06:53.870> the<00:06:54.870> range<00:06:55.200> on<00:06:55.530> it<00:06:55.680> says<00:06:55.920> that

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.070 
pointer and the range on it says that

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.670 
pointer and the range on it says that
it's<00:06:56.220> 30<00:06:56.550> meters<00:06:56.970> I<00:06:57.180> it<00:06:57.660> seems<00:06:58.080> pretty<00:06:58.350> close

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 
it's 30 meters I it seems pretty close

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.200 
it's 30 meters I it seems pretty close
to<00:06:58.860> that<00:06:58.890> so<00:06:59.400> if<00:06:59.490> you<00:06:59.610> wanted<00:06:59.850> to<00:06:59.910> use<00:07:00.060> this

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:00.210 
to that so if you wanted to use this

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.620 
to that so if you wanted to use this
with<00:07:00.450> say<00:07:00.680> ps3<00:07:01.680> or<00:07:01.920> a<00:07:02.280> media<00:07:02.610> center<00:07:02.820> it's

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:03.630 
with say ps3 or a media center it's

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.970 
with say ps3 or a media center it's
ideal<00:07:04.110> it's<00:07:04.410> roughly<00:07:04.980> the<00:07:05.190> size<00:07:05.370> of<00:07:05.610> a<00:07:05.730> remote

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:06.980 
ideal it's roughly the size of a remote

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.210 
ideal it's roughly the size of a remote
so<00:07:08.030> but<00:07:09.030> anyway<00:07:09.510> this<00:07:09.900> is<00:07:10.080> james<00:07:10.380> at<00:07:10.590> el<00:07:10.800> logics

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 
so but anyway this is james at el logics

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:17.240 
so but anyway this is james at el logics
calm<00:07:11.610> and<00:07:13.670> this<00:07:14.670> is<00:07:14.880> the<00:07:15.060> RI<00:07:15.540> I<00:07:15.750> mini<00:07:16.620> wireless

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:17.250 
calm and this is the RI I mini wireless

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:22.850 
calm and this is the RI I mini wireless
keyboard<00:07:17.910> with<00:07:18.810> built-in<00:07:19.200> touchpad<00:07:19.850> thanks
