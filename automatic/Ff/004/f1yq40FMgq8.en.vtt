against a very tall you know sweaty

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.560 
against a very tall you know sweaty
backline<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.159> most<00:02:05.310> people<00:02:05.610> have<00:02:05.759> his

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
heading ability is also very good with

his high attacking positioning he always

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.470 
his high attacking positioning he always
seems<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.770> be<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.160> right<00:02:11.400> place<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:12.390> get

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
seems to be in the right place to get

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.460 
seems to be in the right place to get
the<00:02:12.660> headers<00:02:12.959> and

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
the headers and

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.040 
the headers and
the<00:02:13.620> ender<00:02:13.860> crosses<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:15.180> think<00:02:15.450> us<00:02:15.600> maybes

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
the ender crosses and I think us maybes

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.050 
the ender crosses and I think us maybes
only<00:02:16.260> one<00:02:16.470> he<00:02:16.650> scored<00:02:16.980> for<00:02:17.190> me<00:02:17.310> but<00:02:17.670> he<00:02:17.910> got

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
only one he scored for me but he got

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.400 
only one he scored for me but he got
eight<00:02:18.180> heading<00:02:18.570> on<00:02:18.690> his<00:02:18.810> card<00:02:19.050> so<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.320> know

you know two sweaty wingers so I could

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.680 
you know two sweaty wingers so I could
just<00:02:46.920> cross<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.250> ball<00:02:47.370> in<00:02:47.520> get<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.880> as<00:02:48.330> much<00:02:48.510> as

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
possible but let's talk about his

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.460 
possible but let's talk about his
passing<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:50.910> dribbling<00:02:51.240> it's<00:02:51.870> that's<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.320> now

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
passing and dribbling it's that's a now

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.960 
passing and dribbling it's that's a now
and<00:02:52.740> how<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:52.860> thought<00:02:53.100> they<00:02:53.250> were<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:53.610> he's<00:02:53.790> got

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
and how I thought they were so he's got

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.450 
and how I thought they were so he's got
69<00:02:54.690> passing<00:02:55.380> on<00:02:55.500> his<00:02:55.620> card<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:56.070> really<00:02:56.340> isn't

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
69 passing on his card that really isn't

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.820 
69 passing on his card that really isn't
too<00:02:56.730> great<00:02:57.030> but<00:02:57.240> I<00:02:57.600> just<00:02:57.930> felt<00:02:58.170> his<00:02:58.320> passing

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
too great but I just felt his passing

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.610 
too great but I just felt his passing
that<00:02:58.950> was<00:02:59.160> at<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.330> higher<00:03:00.840> level<00:03:00.870> than<00:03:01.230> any<00:03:01.500> of

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
that was at a higher level than any of

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.750 
that was at a higher level than any of
us<00:03:01.680> draw<00:03:01.860> because<00:03:01.980> I'd<00:03:02.160> used<00:03:02.310> before<00:03:02.610> he

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
us draw because I'd used before he

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.970 
us draw because I'd used before he
played<00:03:03.000> he<00:03:03.690> just<00:03:03.870> passed<00:03:04.080> through<00:03:04.320> wall

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
played he just passed through wall

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.470 
played he just passed through wall
conn-young<00:03:05.250> so<00:03:05.460> many<00:03:05.910> times<00:03:06.120> they've<00:03:06.360> got

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
conn-young so many times they've got

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.450 
conn-young so many times they've got
lots<00:03:06.690> of<00:03:06.810> assists<00:03:07.170> I<00:03:07.230> think<00:03:07.410> of<00:03:07.530> five<00:03:08.070> or<00:03:08.280> six

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
lots of assists I think of five or six

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.790

when he got down the wing but Lester was
dribbling<00:03:19.739> what<00:03:20.220> only<00:03:21.150> three<00:03:21.390> star<00:03:21.630> skills<00:03:21.930> so

moves<00:03:23.790> I<00:03:23.940> mean<00:03:24.090> Roulettes<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.810> stepovers<00:03:25.250> the

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
moves I mean Roulettes and stepovers the

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.830 
moves I mean Roulettes and stepovers the
most<00:03:26.459> useful<00:03:26.910> one<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.209> three<00:03:27.420> star<00:03:27.630> skills

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
most useful one to three star skills

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.680 
most useful one to three star skills
that's<00:03:28.020> what<00:03:28.170> I<00:03:28.200> tend<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.739> use<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:29.070> most<00:03:29.690> but

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
that's what I tend to use the most but

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.150 
that's what I tend to use the most but
now<00:03:30.840> his<00:03:31.020> dribbling<00:03:31.320> was<00:03:31.500> pretty<00:03:31.709> high<00:03:31.860> keeps

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
now his dribbling was pretty high keeps

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.530 
now his dribbling was pretty high keeps
pretty<00:03:32.400> close<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.790> him<00:03:32.880> it's<00:03:33.090> obviously<00:03:33.390> not

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
pretty close to him it's obviously not

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.970 
pretty close to him it's obviously not

my wings or something clinical was

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.979 
my wings or something clinical was
always<00:04:08.100> an<00:04:08.310> option<00:04:08.459> he's<00:04:08.790> always<00:04:08.940> on<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.690> last

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
always an option he's always on the last

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.360 
always an option he's always on the last
line<00:04:10.140> defenders<00:04:10.620> off<00:04:10.739> you<00:04:10.980> know<00:04:11.070> that's<00:04:11.250> not

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
line defenders off you know that's not

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.190 
line defenders off you know that's not
on<00:04:11.489> his<00:04:11.670> dropping<00:04:11.970> back<00:04:12.150> his<00:04:12.390> last<00:04:12.780> having

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
on his dropping back his last having

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.320 
on his dropping back his last having
that<00:04:13.320> 1993<00:04:14.280> attack<00:04:14.370> positioning<00:04:14.970> I<00:04:15.030> think<00:04:15.209> it

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
that 1993 attack positioning I think it

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.449 
that 1993 attack positioning I think it
was<00:04:15.450> moving<00:04:15.840> higher<00:04:16.080> but<00:04:16.410> yeah<00:04:17.220> you<00:04:17.280> just

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
was moving higher but yeah you just

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.099 
was moving higher but yeah you just
really<00:04:17.850> noticed<00:04:18.209> that<00:04:18.359> but<00:04:18.720> if<00:04:18.840> you're<00:04:18.959> trying

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
really noticed that but if you're trying

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.599 
really noticed that but if you're trying
to<00:04:19.230> make<00:04:19.320> an<00:04:19.440> England<00:04:19.769> legend<00:04:20.190> side<00:04:20.400> I

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
to make an England legend side I

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.550 
to make an England legend side I
definitely<00:04:21.120> choose<00:04:21.330> a<00:04:21.390> lineker<00:04:21.840> over<00:04:22.169> oh<00:04:22.229> and

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
definitely choose a lineker over oh and

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.310 
definitely choose a lineker over oh and
I<00:04:22.740> think<00:04:23.520> Owen<00:04:23.789> has<00:04:23.910> 54<00:04:24.539> strengths<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.140> that's

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
I think Owen has 54 strengths and that's

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.020 
I think Owen has 54 strengths and that's
gonna<00:04:25.500> be<00:04:25.620> such

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
gonna be such

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.180 
gonna be such
huge<00:04:26.210> hindrance<00:04:26.450> that<00:04:26.810> it's<00:04:27.050> not<00:04:27.260> it's<00:04:27.560> like

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
huge hindrance that it's not it's like

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.830 
huge hindrance that it's not it's like
linen<00:04:28.610> cos<00:04:28.760> only<00:04:29.030> got<00:04:29.240> three<00:04:29.420> less<00:04:29.570> space<00:04:29.810> in

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
linen cos only got three less space in

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.870 
linen cos only got three less space in
him<00:04:30.139> better<00:04:30.650> shooting<00:04:31.130> it's<00:04:31.400> just<00:04:31.610> gonna<00:04:31.700> be

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
him better shooting it's just gonna be

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.850 
him better shooting it's just gonna be
so<00:04:32.030> much<00:04:32.120> more<00:04:32.330> worthwhile<00:04:32.960> playing<00:04:33.560> with<00:04:33.710> him

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
so much more worthwhile playing with him

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.650 
so much more worthwhile playing with him
as<00:04:34.070> a<00:04:34.100> striker<00:04:34.460> than<00:04:34.790> oh<00:04:35.000> and<00:04:35.210> it's<00:04:35.330> a<00:04:35.419> shame

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
as a striker than oh and it's a shame

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.300 
as a striker than oh and it's a shame
he's<00:04:35.840> got<00:04:36.020> that<00:04:36.169> kind<00:04:36.380> of<00:04:36.440> strength<00:04:36.830> because<00:04:36.950> I

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
he's got that kind of strength because I

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.830 
he's got that kind of strength because I
don't<00:04:37.940> know<00:04:38.000> it<00:04:38.090> could<00:04:38.210> be<00:04:38.270> a<00:04:38.330> very<00:04:38.419> good<00:04:38.600> card

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
don't know it could be a very good card

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.390 
don't know it could be a very good card
but<00:04:38.900> yeah<00:04:39.110> lineker<00:04:39.500> definitely<00:04:39.889> my<00:04:40.220> first

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
but yeah lineker definitely my first

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.790 
but yeah lineker definitely my first
choice<00:04:40.669> so<00:04:41.300> overall<00:04:41.690> I<00:04:41.990> gave<00:04:42.050> Lin<00:04:42.380> a<00:04:42.470> kunai

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
choice so overall I gave Lin a kunai

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.100 
choice so overall I gave Lin a kunai
point<00:04:43.160> five<00:04:43.400> out<00:04:43.730> of<00:04:43.760> ten<00:04:44.150> now<00:04:44.630> I<00:04:44.660> couldn't

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
point five out of ten now I couldn't

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.500 
point five out of ten now I couldn't
really<00:04:45.410> think<00:04:45.560> of<00:04:45.860> any<00:04:46.130> disadvantages<00:04:47.090> to<00:04:47.300> him

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
really think of any disadvantages to him

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.960 
really think of any disadvantages to him
but<00:04:48.080> it's<00:04:48.830> kind<00:04:49.070> of<00:04:49.100> just<00:04:49.220> there<00:04:49.430> his<00:04:49.550> shooting

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
but it's kind of just there his shooting

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.210 
but it's kind of just there his shooting
pace<00:04:50.570> and<00:04:50.900> like<00:04:51.290> heading<00:04:51.650> all<00:04:51.830> that<00:04:52.010> stuff

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
pace and like heading all that stuff

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.640 
pace and like heading all that stuff
overall<00:04:52.639> could<00:04:52.940> be<00:04:53.120> better<00:04:53.330> but<00:04:53.630> for<00:04:53.990> his<00:04:54.380> card

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
overall could be better but for his card

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.860 
overall could be better but for his card
he<00:04:54.800> is<00:04:54.919> amazing<00:04:55.700> he<00:04:55.820> has<00:04:55.910> amazing<00:04:56.210> finishing

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
he is amazing he has amazing finishing

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.960 
he is amazing he has amazing finishing
his<00:04:57.320> pace<00:04:57.560> is<00:04:57.770> very<00:04:58.070> good<00:04:58.310> for<00:04:58.430> a<00:04:58.490> striker<00:04:58.820> on

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
his pace is very good for a striker on

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.240 
his pace is very good for a striker on
the<00:04:59.090> team<00:04:59.300> very<00:05:00.020> strong<00:05:00.380> heading<00:05:00.740> which<00:05:00.980> you

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
the team very strong heading which you

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.500 
the team very strong heading which you
often<00:05:01.400> don't<00:05:01.700> get<00:05:01.880> of<00:05:02.000> players<00:05:02.210> with<00:05:02.360> high

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
often don't get of players with high

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.210 
often don't get of players with high
pace<00:05:02.750> and<00:05:02.930> high<00:05:03.080> shooting<00:05:03.470> also<00:05:03.830> have<00:05:04.070> high

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
pace and high shooting also have high

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.980 
pace and high shooting also have high
strength<00:05:04.580> and<00:05:05.090> he<00:05:05.240> just<00:05:05.390> always<00:05:05.570> seems<00:05:05.870> to<00:05:05.930> be

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
strength and he just always seems to be

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.970 
strength and he just always seems to be
in<00:05:06.080> the<00:05:06.110> right<00:05:06.230> place<00:05:06.410> with<00:05:06.650> his<00:05:06.800> high

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
in the right place with his high

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.340 
in the right place with his high
attacking<00:05:07.730> positioning<00:05:08.600> but<00:05:09.140> he<00:05:09.230> actually

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
attacking positioning but he actually

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.500 
attacking positioning but he actually
