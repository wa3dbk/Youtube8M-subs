00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
okay 30 31 set now the trick I learned

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.619 
okay 30 31 set now the trick I learned
in<00:00:48.559> instructions<00:00:49.559> online<00:00:49.999> that<00:00:50.999> says<00:00:51.269> to

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
in instructions online that says to

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.840 
in instructions online that says to
stretch<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.109> spring<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.440> quarter<00:00:52.949> inch<00:00:53.159> to<00:00:53.819> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
stretch the spring a quarter inch to the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.779 
stretch the spring a quarter inch to the
right<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.749> left<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.230> other<00:00:55.319> side<00:00:55.699> so<00:00:56.699> I'll

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
right the left on the other side so I'll

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.079 
right the left on the other side so I'll
take<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.999> marker<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:59.010> mark<00:00:59.280> about<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.609> quarter

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
take a marker the mark about a quarter

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:08.090 
take a marker the mark about a quarter
inch<00:01:03.680> then<00:01:05.150> use<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.300> hammer<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.830> hammer<00:01:07.830> it

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
inch then use the hammer to hammer it

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.120 
inch then use the hammer to hammer it
over<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:09.140> then<00:01:10.140> tighten<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.590> set<00:01:10.799> screws<00:01:13.130> the

over and then tighten the set screws the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.740 
over and then tighten the set screws the
additional<00:01:14.700> quarter<00:01:15.119> drinks<00:01:15.180> will<00:01:15.570> give<00:01:15.719> a

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
additional quarter drinks will give a

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.170 
additional quarter drinks will give a
little<00:01:15.960> space<00:01:16.320> between<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:17.040> springs<00:01:17.719> and<00:01:20.180> so

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
little space between the springs and so

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.350 
little space between the springs and so
when<00:01:21.390> graph<00:01:22.229> goes<00:01:22.469> all<00:01:22.649> the<00:01:22.680> way<00:01:22.770> down<00:01:23.360> there

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
when graph goes all the way down there

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:35.300 
when graph goes all the way down there
won't<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.539> any<00:01:24.719> binding<00:01:28.310> so<00:01:33.920> how<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.130> three

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
won't be any binding so how do you three

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.249 
won't be any binding so how do you three
things<00:01:35.520> at<00:01:35.670> once

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
things at once

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.389 
things at once
use<00:01:37.259> your<00:01:38.030> wrench<00:01:39.030> for<00:01:39.359> the<00:01:39.479> set<00:01:39.689> screw<00:01:40.399> the

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
use your wrench for the set screw the

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.770 
use your wrench for the set screw the
bar<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.140> camera<00:01:43.939> to<00:01:44.939> lift<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.299> bar<00:01:45.479> and

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.109 
bar and the camera to lift the bar and
then<00:01:45.930> buying<00:01:46.289> the<00:01:46.560> bar<00:01:46.740> by<00:01:46.950> pulling<00:01:47.219> it<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
then buying the bar by pulling it to the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.010 
then buying the bar by pulling it to the
left<00:01:48.270> toward<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.200> center<00:01:49.880> that<00:01:50.880> means<00:01:51.659> that

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
left toward the center that means that

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.990 
left toward the center that means that
way<00:01:52.170> when<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.500> hit<00:01:52.740> with<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.369> hammer<00:01:53.609> right

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
way when you hit with the hammer right

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.719 
way when you hit with the hammer right
here<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.990> move<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.259> spring<00:01:55.859> the<00:01:56.189> quarter<00:01:56.579> inch

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
here to move the spring the quarter inch

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.959 
here to move the spring the quarter inch
to<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.000> right<00:01:57.710> by<00:01:58.710> binding<00:01:59.310> it<00:02:01.219> the<00:02:02.219> as<00:02:02.670> we<00:02:02.820> hit

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
to the right by binding it the as we hit

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.150 
to the right by binding it the as we hit
the<00:02:03.409> cone<00:02:04.409> most<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.299> to<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.450> left<00:02:07.160> so

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
the cone most like that to the left so

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.450 
the cone most like that to the left so
once<00:02:09.500> once<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.619> have<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.800> over<00:02:11.070> to<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.250> mark

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
once once I have it over to the mark

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.070 
once once I have it over to the mark
which<00:02:11.700> will<00:02:11.820> take<00:02:11.970> about<00:02:12.090> three<00:02:12.630> or<00:02:12.690> four<00:02:12.840> hits

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
which will take about three or four hits

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.729 
which will take about three or four hits
or<00:02:13.830> do<00:02:13.950> what<00:02:14.099> I<00:02:14.129> did<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.459> other<00:02:14.519> side<00:02:15.739> you

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
the other set screw I maintain the the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:30.260 
the other set screw I maintain the the
binding<00:03:16.489> bar<00:03:17.489> here<00:03:18.530> shall<00:03:19.530> we<00:03:19.560> both<00:03:19.830> set<00:03:20.159> up

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:45.320 

okay<00:03:33.660> now<00:03:36.270> I'm<00:03:37.270> sick<00:03:37.600> right<00:03:43.590> tap<00:03:44.590> out

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
okay now I'm sick right tap out

00:03:45.330 --> 00:04:02.160 
okay now I'm sick right tap out
push<00:03:46.330> out<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:49.360> bottom<00:04:00.780> looks<00:04:01.780> like<00:04:01.900> I<00:04:01.989> have<00:04:02.140> a

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170

so<00:04:10.480> I'll<00:04:10.630> have<00:04:10.810> to<00:04:10.959> back<00:04:11.170> off<00:04:12.810> quarter<00:04:13.810> turn

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
so I'll have to back off quarter turn

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:21.150 
so I'll have to back off quarter turn
and<00:04:15.060> test<00:04:16.060> again<00:04:18.060> all<00:04:19.060> done<00:04:19.359> I<00:04:19.630> had<00:04:19.810> to<00:04:20.160> back

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
and test again all done I had to back

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.990 
and test again all done I had to back
off<00:04:21.570> from<00:04:22.570> seven<00:04:23.140> and<00:04:23.260> three-quarters<00:04:24.010> turns

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
off from seven and three-quarters turns

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.360 
off from seven and three-quarters turns
to<00:04:25.480> seven<00:04:25.930> in<00:04:26.050> one<00:04:26.080> quarter<00:04:26.740> so<00:04:26.830> he<00:04:27.100> had<00:04:27.220> to

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
to seven in one quarter so he had to

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.320 
to seven in one quarter so he had to
back<00:04:27.550> off<00:04:27.580> I<00:04:28.120> have<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:28.930> turn<00:04:29.320> on<00:04:29.680> both<00:04:29.860> sides<00:04:30.330> to

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
back off I have to turn on both sides to

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.650 
back off I have to turn on both sides to
get<00:04:31.979> to<00:04:32.979> get<00:04:33.100> it<00:04:33.160> where<00:04:33.310> I<00:04:33.340> want<00:04:33.610> what<00:04:34.300> you<00:04:34.419> want
