00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
full speed and you'll see how it wants

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.419 
full speed and you'll see how it wants
to<00:01:23.159> clean<00:01:23.490> up<00:01:23.700> all<00:01:23.880> those<00:01:24.090> rough<00:01:24.450> marks<00:01:25.429> over

to clean up all those rough marks over

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:48.890 
to clean up all those rough marks over
there

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.080 

and<00:01:49.900> this<00:01:50.050> is<00:01:50.230> on<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.620> dildo<00:01:51.010> so<00:01:51.250> this<00:01:51.430> gives

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
and this is on the dildo so this gives

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.380 
and this is on the dildo so this gives
you<00:01:52.330> a<00:01:52.360> finer<00:01:52.900> finish<00:01:53.290> now<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.130> next<00:01:54.760> step<00:01:55.060> is

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
you a finer finish now the next step is

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.190 
you a finer finish now the next step is
going<00:01:56.290> to<00:01:56.560> give<00:01:56.770> you<00:01:57.010> more<00:01:57.310> of<00:01:57.370> a<00:01:57.610> polish<00:01:58.200> this

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
going to give you more of a polish this

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.910 
going to give you more of a polish this
is<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.560> 5<00:01:59.770> micron<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:01.540> if<00:02:01.960> you<00:02:02.229> like<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.680> matte

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
is the 5 micron so if you like the matte

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.370 
is the 5 micron so if you like the matte
finish<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:03.369> can<00:02:03.670> stop<00:02:04.000> right<00:02:04.240> here<00:02:04.570> and<00:02:05.170> if

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
finish you can stop right here and if

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.380 
finish you can stop right here and if
you<00:02:05.530> want<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:05.860> continue<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.729> more<00:02:07.060> brighter

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
you want to continue to a more brighter

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.190 
you want to continue to a more brighter
polish<00:02:07.990> again<00:02:08.560> you<00:02:09.160> can<00:02:09.369> mark<00:02:09.610> it<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.929> see

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
polish again you can mark it and see

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.930 
polish again you can mark it and see
where<00:02:11.440> you<00:02:11.590> are<00:02:14.070> so<00:02:15.070> you<00:02:15.400> just<00:02:15.580> hold<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:15.910> right

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
where you are so you just hold it right

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:39.350 
where you are so you just hold it right
