00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.830

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.130

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.230
 dribbling tutorial 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.900
 be sure to use the links that 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.820
 in the video case descriptions 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.840
 want to share the videos with your 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.690
 friends 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.600
 This helps me a lot because it encourages me to 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.540
 see the number of hits comments 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.640
 likes growing up and I always want to take 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.729
 better videos for all 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.620
 You because, after all, you guys? 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:51.909
 deserve now enough of coaxing and let's 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.979
 to what matters in this tutorial 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:54.820
 we will talk a little about the 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:58.000
 champions 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.710
 also known as scooping this dribble 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.570
 is four stars and should be done 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.409
 when the player is standing or almost 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.479
 stopped 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.570
 we have two commands to dribble the 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.159
 first year two rings on rs one of the 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.010
 lower diagonals 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.260
 the second is to do one made xote and 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.980
 holding the ls the directional in a 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.300
 direction except forward 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.610
 just like rio top 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.370
 it has two commands but I recommend it 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.590
 you use the command that is done with the 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.620
 pixote the second command I taught 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:33.100
 now as well as faster 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.320
 you decide precisely the direction 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.540
 of the dribble output 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.260
 this is because when you run the 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.990
 dribble 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.110
 You'll be holding ls one direction. 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.600
 in the direction after holding the ls the 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.390
 player goes out with the ball 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.060
 this dribble is very useful when you 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.170
 is facing his marker and 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.980
 do you want to go out 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.260
 none of the diagonals or to the sides 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.730
 also a great utility of it is 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.130
 when you turn your back on the 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.470
 marker protecting the ball then you 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.709
 can make a quick turnaround of 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.220
 180 degrees leaving your opponent in the 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.860
 miss and creating a good opportunity 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.629
 a space for you to cross pass 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.400
 or kick the ball 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.469
 So let's go to the field, let's go. 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.290
 example the sculptor left where already 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:24.469
 they work 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.930
 all the couple there in manchester united 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:29.750
 formulated 15 30 being cleaned on the move 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.420
 bosco turn prepares a tornado looks 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:38.590
 only saw the 180graus as he had said 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:41.060
 previously did not roll the bike 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.530
 It is very useful for you. 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.310
 at that time you need not 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.389
 coiled in the game to cadenciada 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:53.290
 Look, the van Persie is looking at turning 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:53.290
 imposing background to cross 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:02.960
 one more sculptor while the number 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.690

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.550
 bomb on the dash is watching you 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.880
 can easily clear your bid with the 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.890
 software to boot is very cool this 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.920
 Personal dribble it's very easy so 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.760
 to do is a dribble I recommend 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.830
 you train because it is very useful 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:28.750
 Can you guys see the pedaling? 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.750
 Our defender, Ball 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:49.450

00:03:37.070 --> 00:04:25.220
 bid opponent looks there new shopping 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:04:30.080
 of the field, just look at it

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.280
