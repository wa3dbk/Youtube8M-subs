00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
improve in a different field and to me

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.210 
improve in a different field and to me
it's<00:03:26.239> a<00:03:26.269> different<00:03:26.660> journey<00:03:27.080> and<00:03:27.410> so<00:03:27.980> far<00:03:28.160> I'm

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
it's a different journey and so far I'm

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.400 
it's a different journey and so far I'm
enjoying<00:03:28.310> it<00:03:28.730> you<00:03:28.850> know<00:03:28.970> it's<00:03:29.120> not<00:03:29.269> as<00:03:29.450> painful

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
enjoying it you know it's not as painful

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.190 
enjoying it you know it's not as painful
as<00:03:30.560> Foreman<00:03:30.920> was<00:03:31.100> on<00:03:31.310> my<00:03:31.430> body<00:03:31.880> you<00:03:32.780> know<00:03:32.840> I<00:03:32.930> can

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
as Foreman was on my body you know I can

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.170 
as Foreman was on my body you know I can
train<00:03:33.500> there<00:03:33.709> pretty<00:03:33.860> much<00:03:33.950> every<00:03:34.310> day<00:03:34.489> you

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
train there pretty much every day you

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.259 
train there pretty much every day you
know<00:03:35.360> the<00:03:36.019> big<00:03:36.230> change<00:03:36.260> was<00:03:36.709> a<00:03:36.769> diet<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:38.000> once

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
know the big change was a diet and once

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.380 
know the big change was a diet and once
you<00:03:38.420> get<00:03:38.570> in<00:03:38.750> then<00:03:39.620> you<00:03:40.070> sit<00:03:40.340> in<00:03:40.519> it's<00:03:41.209> no

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
you get in then you sit in it's no

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.850 
you get in then you sit in it's no
different<00:03:41.840> and<00:03:41.930> what<00:03:42.049> I<00:03:42.080> was<00:03:42.260> doing<00:03:42.530> now<00:03:42.650> it's

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
different and what I was doing now it's

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.860 
different and what I was doing now it's
just<00:03:43.100> a<00:03:43.250> different<00:03:43.790> vehicle<00:03:43.940> then<00:03:44.480> I<00:03:44.570> test

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
just a different vehicle then I test

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.840 
just a different vehicle then I test
myself<00:03:45.049> for<00:03:45.500> do<00:03:46.070> you<00:03:46.160> have<00:03:46.250> any<00:03:46.370> desire<00:03:46.820> to

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
myself for do you have any desire to

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.699 
myself for do you have any desire to
train<00:03:47.420> like<00:03:47.570> a<00:03:47.630> strongman<00:03:47.930> still<00:03:48.320> like<00:03:48.500> lift

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
train like a strongman still like lift

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.979 
train like a strongman still like lift
those<00:03:48.830> heavy<00:03:48.980> weights<00:03:49.299> initially<00:03:50.299> yeah<00:03:50.450> but

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
those heavy weights initially yeah but

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.900 
those heavy weights initially yeah but
now<00:03:51.200> you<00:03:51.260> know<00:03:51.590> I<00:03:51.620> think<00:03:52.100> I<00:03:52.250> really<00:03:52.580> made<00:03:52.730> the

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
now you know I think I really made the

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.270 
now you know I think I really made the
switch<00:03:53.180> to<00:03:53.209> body<00:03:53.540> building<00:03:54.019> where<00:03:54.380> you<00:03:54.709> don't

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
switch to body building where you don't

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.620 
switch to body building where you don't
need<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.549> train<00:03:55.820> as<00:03:55.970> heavy<00:03:56.180> you<00:03:56.390> know<00:03:56.510> what

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
need to train as heavy you know what

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.479 
need to train as heavy you know what
it's<00:03:56.810> pretty<00:03:57.200> I'm<00:03:57.650> pretty<00:03:57.920> sure<00:03:58.130> at<00:03:58.250> 3:00<00:03:58.430> in

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
it's pretty I'm pretty sure at 3:00 in

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.400 
it's pretty I'm pretty sure at 3:00 in
probably<00:03:58.880> every<00:03:58.910> year<00:03:59.209> and<00:03:59.420> most<00:04:00.140> of<00:04:00.320> the

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
probably every year and most of the

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.080 
probably every year and most of the
people<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:01.010> most<00:04:01.160> of<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.340> bodybuilder<00:04:01.880> but

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
people and most of the bodybuilder but

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.539 
people and most of the bodybuilder but
as<00:04:02.750> far<00:04:03.049> as<00:04:03.080> compared<00:04:03.890> to<00:04:03.980> what<00:04:04.130> I<00:04:04.160> was<00:04:04.340> lifting

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
as far as compared to what I was lifting

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.170 
as far as compared to what I was lifting
it's<00:04:05.000> light<00:04:05.480> weight<00:04:05.750> so<00:04:06.610> you<00:04:07.610> know<00:04:07.760> mainly

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
it's light weight so you know mainly

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.720 
it's light weight so you know mainly
focusing<00:04:08.870> on<00:04:09.049> making<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:10.310> proper

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
focusing on making the the proper

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.819 
focusing on making the the proper
lifting<00:04:11.120> and<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.480> right<00:04:11.630> switch<00:04:11.959> there's<00:04:12.650> no

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
lifting and the right switch there's no

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:14.560 
lifting and the right switch there's no
point<00:04:13.160> of<00:04:13.250> doing<00:04:13.310> a<00:04:13.640> different<00:04:13.970> sport<00:04:14.209> is<00:04:14.420> you

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
point of doing a different sport is you

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.390 
point of doing a different sport is you
try<00:04:14.780> to<00:04:14.840> stick<00:04:15.230> to<00:04:15.260> what<00:04:15.590> what<00:04:15.799> you<00:04:15.980> were<00:04:16.100> doing

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
try to stick to what what you were doing

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.280 
try to stick to what what you were doing
you<00:04:16.579> know<00:04:17.000> a<00:04:17.030> body<00:04:17.359> building<00:04:17.660> a<00:04:17.780> strongman<00:04:18.049> is

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
you know a body building a strongman is

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.349 
you know a body building a strongman is
two<00:04:18.440> different<00:04:18.560> things<00:04:18.769> even<00:04:19.579> if<00:04:19.729> the<00:04:19.880> gimli

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
two different things even if the gimli

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.750 
two different things even if the gimli
the<00:04:20.630> gym<00:04:20.840> life<00:04:21.019> is<00:04:21.229> pretty<00:04:21.979> similar<00:04:22.340> you<00:04:22.640> know

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
the gym life is pretty similar you know

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.910 
the gym life is pretty similar you know
a<00:04:22.789> bench<00:04:23.030> press<00:04:23.240> a<00:04:23.270> bench<00:04:23.570> press

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
a bench press a bench press

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.800 
a bench press a bench press
but<00:04:24.040> benchpress<00:04:24.880> for<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.210> building<00:04:25.510> but

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
but benchpress for the building but

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.330 
but benchpress for the building but
bodybuilding<00:04:26.350> is<00:04:26.440> not<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.680> same<00:04:26.890> and<00:04:27.040> poet<00:04:27.250> of
