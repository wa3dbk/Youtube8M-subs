you have just a little bitty little
bitty<00:04:44.450> tick<00:04:44.720> in<00:04:44.930> it<00:04:45.050> when<00:04:45.230> you<00:04:45.350> when<00:04:45.560> you're

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
bitty tick in it when you when you're

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.970 
bitty tick in it when you when you're
popping<00:04:45.890> it<00:04:46.100> on<00:04:46.190> the<00:04:46.340> bottom<00:04:47.650> going<00:04:48.650> to<00:04:48.919> a

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
popping it on the bottom going to a

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.690 
popping it on the bottom going to a
quarter<00:04:49.640> ounce<00:04:49.790> jig<00:04:50.120> head<00:04:51.190> and<00:04:52.190> I<00:04:52.340> like<00:04:52.520> these

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
quarter ounce jig head and I like these

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.170 
quarter ounce jig head and I like these
ones<00:04:53.000> that<00:04:53.120> are<00:04:53.320> I've<00:04:54.320> got<00:04:54.530> the<00:04:54.740> deep<00:04:55.310> large

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
ones that are I've got the deep large

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.050 
ones that are I've got the deep large
shank<00:04:56.570> hook<00:04:56.780> okay<00:04:57.289> I<00:04:57.320> mean<00:04:57.560> this<00:04:58.550> is<00:04:58.789> probably

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
shank hook okay I mean this is probably

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.689 
shank hook okay I mean this is probably
about<00:04:59.150> a<00:04:59.240> 3/4<00:04:59.990> hook

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
about a 3/4 hook

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.969 
about a 3/4 hook
I<00:05:01.729> think<00:05:02.360> these<00:05:02.449> are<00:05:02.509> do<00:05:02.839> a<00:05:02.930> jig<00:05:03.319> hooks<00:05:03.619> anyway

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
I think these are do a jig hooks anyway

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:06.159 
I think these are do a jig hooks anyway
any<00:05:04.189> of<00:05:04.309> them<00:05:04.430> that<00:05:04.550> have<00:05:04.729> the<00:05:04.939> the<00:05:05.599> big<00:05:05.839> gap

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
any of them that have the the big gap

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.269 
any of them that have the the big gap
but<00:05:06.409> the<00:05:06.499> ones<00:05:06.680> were<00:05:06.830> using<00:05:08.710> you<00:05:09.710> just<00:05:09.740> insert

00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:10.279 
but the ones were using you just insert

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:13.149 
but the ones were using you just insert
it<00:05:10.309> down<00:05:11.300> about<00:05:11.419> two<00:05:11.809> inch<00:05:12.289> and<00:05:12.439> a<00:05:12.529> half<00:05:12.559> into

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:13.159 
it down about two inch and a half into

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:15.040 
it down about two inch and a half into
the<00:05:13.249> quarter<00:05:13.580> just<00:05:14.240> come<00:05:14.449> up<00:05:14.599> through<00:05:14.839> and

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
the quarter just come up through and

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.439 
the quarter just come up through and
just<00:05:15.080> push<00:05:15.409> it<00:05:15.439> up<00:05:15.729> like<00:05:16.729> you<00:05:16.819> normally<00:05:17.029> do<00:05:17.300> but

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
just push it up like you normally do but

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:18.459 
just push it up like you normally do but
the<00:05:17.509> only<00:05:17.659> thing<00:05:17.839> we're<00:05:17.960> doing<00:05:18.110> really

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:18.469 
the only thing we're doing really

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:19.989 
the only thing we're doing really
different<00:05:18.860> than<00:05:18.949> unique<00:05:19.309> putting<00:05:19.729> that

00:05:19.989 --> 00:05:19.999 
different than unique putting that

around just to see if the fish will hear
we<00:07:22.090> came<00:07:22.300> up<00:07:22.450> about<00:07:22.570> a<00:07:22.720> hundred<00:07:22.930> yards<00:07:23.500> and<00:07:23.650> win

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:23.770 
we came up about a hundred yards and win

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.100 
we came up about a hundred yards and win
a<00:07:23.800> bin<00:07:24.130> when<00:07:24.970> throwing<00:07:25.180> out<00:07:25.360> here<00:07:25.600> to<00:07:25.750> about<00:07:25.930> an

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:26.110 
a bin when throwing out here to about an

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.170 
a bin when throwing out here to about an
eight-foot<00:07:26.560> drop<00:07:26.770> on<00:07:27.220> this<00:07:27.400> being<00:07:27.639> here<00:07:28.030> and

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:28.180 
eight-foot drop on this being here and

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.960 
eight-foot drop on this being here and
looks<00:07:29.080> like<00:07:29.289> we<00:07:29.979> hadn't<00:07:30.190> thrown<00:07:30.370> two<00:07:30.639> times

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:30.970 
looks like we hadn't thrown two times

this<00:08:08.110> new<00:08:08.349> spot<00:08:08.650> ain't<00:08:08.860> bad<00:08:09.099> I<00:08:09.370> mean<00:08:09.550> we're

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:09.700 
this new spot ain't bad I mean we're

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.219 
this new spot ain't bad I mean we're
catching<00:08:10.060> bigger<00:08:10.240> fish<00:08:10.570> on<00:08:10.840> average
