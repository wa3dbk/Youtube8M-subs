00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.510
 mask and how many times it has not changed 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:29.490
 a fucking chapter 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:32.279
 every day of concussion I know that 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.020
 will change 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.490
 and all this 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.100
 I have traveled 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.910
 I know that one day 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.550
 just 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.430

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.510
 things that you think will not pass e 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.610
 palace that in reality if the first ones that if 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.220
 he eats everything enough but not 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.980
 be in a hurry all that remains 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.320
 wait and there are those who remain and those who leave 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.330
 with a road circles it is enough for today 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.129
 face I stuck on what it is from 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.930
 neglecting a strong move much 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.070
 even the sense of pass is the advice 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.070
 of a friend is always the same not chance 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.990
 pass would love pass this way 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.850
 they call you faiths that we were never told 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.370
 that a whore you obviously look at him 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.170
 all that has been done is enough, but reality 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:27.140
 and a case does not pass every day indeed 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.820
 I know that 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.700
 will change 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:38.170
 and all this 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.170
 I ran steering I know not June 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.290
 avoid a confidential tone but already 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.020
 say that all is well when everything to 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.270
 sea is always good not to worry 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.370
 but when he marks for the whisk 10 months 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.830

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.860

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.050
 to the judges of gila who don't think about it anymore 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.910
 more but in the fucking head I'm saying 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.280
 and there are those who remain firm and demand that 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.590
 that's all but nothing can pass if before 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.140

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.119

 he says my dad won't be low anymore e 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.260
 in order not to suffer the risk of being 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.430
 worse we hope the non-existent costs 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:24.189
 clean 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:26.879

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.879

 and all that I have suffered for I know 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.840
 that one day 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.330
 or not 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.350
 in the evening 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:55.540
