 boiling water with a little salt 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.510
 but they did not leave him not leave him alone 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.370
 it's not a pass 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.629
 clear they are set apart extremely 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.629
 apacheta of his shoes 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.530

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.080
 I want to be listen to me let's do 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.820
 now a sauce well loaded my 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.400
 mid-day preschool experience 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.590
 so then that it will be a rich and 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.670
 meaty sauce where they are going to 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:33.369
 finish cooking the zucchini 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:37.090
 then we go with onion in this case 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:40.180
 cut and filleted pine also from 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.179
 Basque covite that the variant of 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.610
 boot are almost almost always with 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:49.320
 the spoonful of oil with the onion 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.430
 that delivers all and its flavor 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.620
 and from picasso we go with the peppers 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.860
 green and not colored then in this 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:02.720
 sauteed vegetables 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:07.300
 speak we give slip quickly and you 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.300
 we grab him a little bit of salt 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:17.620
 we have around here there is wine 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.620
 red don horacio minotti 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:32.470
 to flood it 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.890
 let the wine evaporate so you do not have 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.480
 that acid taste the raw wine and thing that 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.300
 will happen in 30 seconds of exposure 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.630
 to heat then evaporates no longer has 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:47.530
 that smell had come strong yes and then 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.270
 let's go with tomato tomato puree and 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.960
 We are going to add this tomato puree 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.880
 some broth can perfectly be a 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.830
 broth of meat or a broth of vegetables 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.860
 as in this case then there you have a 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.680
 good base of sauce well rich well 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.550
 substantial where in the first instance 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.110
 the measure that is gaining temperature 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.560
 we correct pepper salt some chili 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.080
 we give you gustito we love you 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.820
 and we give a few chips that chips 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.290
 they are going to cook there in that salsita as 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.960
 to make bulk 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.880
 so that they are not just the Zapatistas and 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.370
 then it will start to evolve 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.810
 to start taking temperature and in it 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.770
 meanwhile we do not come here 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.110
 fill the zucchini shoes 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.500
 that we had lightly bleached in 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:42.800
 those that no more than minute and a half minute 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.370
 in its going through the boiling water a 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.910
 once they were emptied and beheaded 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.910
 poor 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:00.210
 But I love the dressings who gave it 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.210
 absolutely lying I adore you 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.190
 it will have been a time 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:17.590
 in my house when the meat I appreciate that 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.820

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.960

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:25.600
 ricota I do not know what chicken with ham since 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.150
 the meat sometimes the zucchini stuffed 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.190
 itself or just with what they emptied 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.590
 saltea go with a little oil of 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.970
 some basil and eating has 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.160
 returned again they are more blunt 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:40.500
 this wins 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.500
 these are some graphics 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:52.990
 it's a totally arbitrary thing but 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:53.740
 well for example we have a lot of pollen from 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.840
 Asia 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:00.670
