working but I think now I pretty much
have<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:27.960> under<00:00:28.230> control<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.910> works

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
have it under control and that it works

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.709 
have it under control and that it works

from the screen the pokemon i will be
talking<00:00:37.350> about<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.980> deoxys<00:00:38.910> speed<00:00:39.450> form<00:00:39.890> now

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
talking about is deoxys speed form now

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.690 
talking about is deoxys speed form now
deoxys<00:00:41.879> speed<00:00:42.120> form<00:00:42.510> has<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:43.129> speed<00:00:44.129> high

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
deoxys speed form has a speed high

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.270 
deoxys speed form has a speed high
enough<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.450> up<00:00:45.570> speed<00:00:45.870> anything<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.950> doesn't

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
enough to up speed anything that doesn't

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.350 
enough to up speed anything that doesn't
have<00:00:47.750> 100<00:00:48.750> base<00:00:49.020> speed<00:00:49.379> or<00:00:49.620> higher<00:00:50.090> with<00:00:51.090> a

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
have 100 base speed or higher with a

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.490 
have 100 base speed or higher with a
plus<00:00:51.870> speed<00:00:52.320> nature<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.670> choice<00:00:54.030> scarf<00:00:54.510> so

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
plus speed nature and a choice scarf so

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.950 
plus speed nature and a choice scarf so
basically<00:00:56.070> that's<00:00:56.309> kind<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.910> rare<00:00:57.180> because<00:00:57.510> if

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
basically that's kind of rare because if

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.529 
basically that's kind of rare because if
you<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.949> pokemon<00:00:59.879> with<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.510> much<00:01:01.309> speed

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
you have a pokemon with that much speed

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.210 
you have a pokemon with that much speed
you<00:01:03.539> don't<00:01:03.750> really<00:01:04.019> need<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.439> scarf<00:01:04.920> because

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
you don't really need a scarf because

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.030 
you don't really need a scarf because
usually<00:01:06.060> deoxys<00:01:06.990> speed<00:01:07.260> isn't<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.799> threat

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
usually deoxys speed isn't a threat

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.380 
usually deoxys speed isn't a threat
because<00:01:09.030> people<00:01:09.510> use<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.170> differently<00:01:10.909> so<00:01:11.909> you

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
because people use it differently so you

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.289 
because people use it differently so you
can<00:01:12.570> basically<00:01:12.720> out<00:01:13.229> speed<00:01:13.820> anything<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
can basically out speed anything in the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.510 
can basically out speed anything in the
game<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:16.290> only<00:01:16.470> thing<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.890> I've<00:01:17.040> seen<00:01:17.340> that

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
game the only thing that I've seen that

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.590 
game the only thing that I've seen that
is<00:01:17.670> kind<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.330> comment<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:18.990> scarfs<00:01:19.650> terrakion

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
is kind of comment is scarfs terrakion

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.179 
is kind of comment is scarfs terrakion
but<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.110> deal<00:01:22.259> with<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.500> easily

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
but you can deal with that easily

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.179 
but you can deal with that easily
anyways<00:01:23.610> with<00:01:23.850> other<00:01:24.060> pokes<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:25.259> basically

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
anyways with other pokes so basically

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.550 
anyways with other pokes so basically
what<00:01:26.880> we're<00:01:27.000> going<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.360> talk<00:01:27.509> about<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:28.049> how

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
what we're going to talk about is how

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.600 
what we're going to talk about is how
deoxys<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.490> being<00:01:30.259> misused<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:32.009> my<00:01:32.250> opinion

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
deoxys is being misused in my opinion

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.240 
deoxys is being misused in my opinion
now<00:01:33.450> deoxys<00:01:34.200> has<00:01:34.409> very<00:01:35.310> good<00:01:35.610> steps<00:01:37.250> including

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
now deoxys has very good steps including

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.600 
now deoxys has very good steps including
95<00:01:39.030> base<00:01:39.450> attack<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.290> special<00:01:40.979> attacks<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.430> it

95 base attack and special attacks so it

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.060 
95 base attack and special attacks so it
can<00:01:41.790> be<00:01:41.939> either<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.299> physical<00:01:42.930> or<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.170> special

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
spreads for a second modest nature

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.300 
spreads for a second modest nature

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
with vaporeon so you go for the t-bolt

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.610 
with vaporeon so you go for the t-bolt
and<00:02:23.130> that<00:02:23.790> he's<00:02:23.970> not<00:02:24.120> seen<00:02:24.450> lefties<00:02:25.080> or<00:02:25.319> life

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
also be a really solid option because of

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.490 
also be a really solid option because of
heat<00:04:46.940> trend<00:04:47.360> and<00:04:50.110> tyranitar<00:04:51.110> which<00:04:51.350> are

tar<00:05:31.630> but<00:05:32.630> so<00:05:32.900> you<00:05:32.960> need<00:05:33.229> probably<00:05:33.860> a<00:05:33.889> new<00:05:34.220> way

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
to get around those two but I rather

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.290 
to get around those two but I rather
have<00:05:38.360> to<00:05:39.139> deal<00:05:39.380> with<00:05:39.590> a<00:05:39.849> tyranitar<00:05:40.849> then<00:05:41.060> deal

have to deal with a tyranitar then deal

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.790 
have to deal with a tyranitar then deal
with<00:05:41.330> a<00:05:41.539> terrakion<00:05:42.080> because<00:05:42.470> strike<00:05:42.770> counts

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
with a terrakion because strike counts

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.379 
with a terrakion because strike counts
are<00:05:43.130> much<00:05:43.849> much<00:05:44.750> more<00:05:45.430> dangerous<00:05:46.430> because<00:05:47.150> of

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
are much much more dangerous because of

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.190

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
their amazing attack and speed so they

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.110

can do some hefty damage to anything so

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.469 
can do some hefty damage to anything so
