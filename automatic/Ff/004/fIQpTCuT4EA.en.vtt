00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
here we have this green loop you get to

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.090 
here we have this green loop you get to
later<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.750> thunder<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.649> mean<00:00:52.949> the

lightning bolt to USB cable which is new
and<00:00:56.250> different<00:00:57.680> so<00:00:58.680> point<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.039> assign<00:00:59.280> will

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
and different so point that assign will

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.860 
and different so point that assign will
get<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> rest<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.180> contents<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
get to the rest of the contents in the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.650 
get to the rest of the contents in the
box<00:01:01.199> over<00:01:01.620> here<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:01.890> have<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.309> loop<00:01:03.030> which<00:01:03.420> is

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
box over here we have this loop which is

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.740 
box over here we have this loop which is
a<00:01:03.989> little<00:01:04.229> bit<00:01:04.350> interesting<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.159> take<00:01:05.309> out<00:01:05.750> so

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
a little bit interesting to take out so

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.140 
a little bit interesting to take out so
yeah<00:01:06.930> once<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.200> got<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.380> out<00:01:07.820> there's<00:01:08.820> kind

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
yeah once you got that out there's kind

like that bootstrapping and then you
just<00:01:15.390> connect<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.590> back<00:01:16.860> part<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
just connect it to the back part of the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.850 
just connect it to the back part of the
ipod<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.390> then<00:01:18.689> lastly<00:01:19.110> we<00:01:19.350> got<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.710> new
